specific objectives of this study were to i identify the main sources of disturbance affecting the glavacioc and the ilfov river basins to then ii assess the state and viability and of the riparian vegetation at catchment and wetland level and finally iii identify the relationship between both natural and anthropogenic stressors and the fluctuations and modifications in the state of riparian vegetation during the vegetation season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area considered two neighboring basins of small plain streams glavacioc and ilfov from romania for which the vegetation analysis has been conducted the two selected basins are closely located only approximately 25 km apart and therefore they are found at similar mean altitudes and exposed to the same climatic conditions based on the occupied surface the national administration of romanian waters anar has categorized the two basins as small glavacioc 682 km² ilfov 203 km² within the two selected basins fig 1 according to in situ investigations the disturbance occurs in the form of i changes in adjacent land use ii stream chemical point and non point pollution iii overgrazing iv extreme climatic events including both droughts and storms based on seasonality followed by v flooding episodes the glavacioc river basin is an integrated part of the arges vedea hydrological space 20 911 km2 which includes the capital of romania bucharest the glavacioc river is a tributary of the câlniştea river having a length of 120 km a sinuosity coefficient of 1 69 and an average altitude of 118 m it has a basin of 682 km2 oriented from northeast to southeast which is more developed in the upper part the ilfov river basin is part of the arges vedea hydrological space and is a direct tributary of the dambovita river which crosses and provides water supply to the capital city bucharest its water is supplying closely located administrative territories such as udresti ilfoveni racari etc from artificial reservoirs the climatologic normal slightly differs between basins i e 10 c for the glavacioc river measured at videle meteorological station and 9 8 c for the ilfov river basin measured at targoviste meteorological station respectively table s2 regarding the land use land cover provided by corine 2018 both basins show similarities with high percentages of non irrigated arable land and the presence of broad leaved forests ilfov river basin has more surfaces of water bodies having a higher number of hydrotechnical facilities and an important pisciculture research station figs s1 and s2 seven artificial lakes are located on the course of the ilfov river udresti bunget i bunget ii bunget iii bratesti adunati and ilfoveni table 1 summarizes the main morphological and hydrological characteristics of the two river basins 2 2 monitoring campaigns the field measurements have been performed to establish an adequate methodology for the determination of evapotranspiration from the riparian areas including wetlands the study area considered relevant from the point of view of the inter aspa project objectives was chosen on a distance of 26 km along the glavacioc river in its basin cadastral code x 1 23 11 8 from catunu village to the town of videle fig 2 five monitoring points have been considered for sampling the water chemistry i e four from the river channel and one from the ponds of poeni wetland in depth analyses have been performed in the wetland located near poeni village 135 ha teleorman county south of romania starting from catunu to butești village in the poeni village administrative area there are forests agricultural lands and permanent grasslands but also oil extraction fields six relevant monitoring points were considered for monitoring campaigns which were performed each month in the vegetation season from march to september 2019 microclimate measurements for evapotranspiration assessments using a par monitoring system comprising a beam fraction sensor digital anemometers microclimate multi parameters air and soil temperature sensors and soil moisture sensors albedo the ratio between reflected and global radiation was determined with a portable pyranometer for different vegetated surfaces surface water quality in various control sections and herbaceous vegetation mapping the data obtained from in situ monitoring was used in the penman monteith algorithm dingman 2014 to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet requiring the canopy height the conductance properties of the leaf the albedo the lai the atmospheric pressure the incident global radiation the cloud cover the air temperature the relative humidity the wind speed and the soil moisture deficit leaf conductance properties for riparian ecosystems were retrieved from literature dunea et al 2019 in ilfov river basin two control points were considered at the entrance and exit of udresti wetland fig s3 just to compare the results with the more extended ones obtained in glavacioc river basin the in situ monitoring consisted of water chemistry analysis and the monitoring of atmospheric parameters in and outside of the riparian canopy the water samples 4 replicates point have been systematically collected using a watson marlow peristaltic pump from both rivers fig s3 the equipment has been washed with distilled water after each measurement to avoid cross contamination water quality parameters such as conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen have been measured on site using adequate equipment table s2 and conventional measuring protocols fig s5 water samples have been stored in cooler bags and transported to the laboratory where nitrates and ammonium content has been measured using a hach lange dr 2800 portable spectrophotometer following the specific procedures the chemical analysis of water was conducted at the entry and the exit points of various sections of the selected riparian areas in order to emphasize the ability of riparian buffers of contributing towards nutrients up taking 2 3 remote sensing resources and analysis landsat 8 oli resources have been selected because it provides useful spatial resolutions 30 m and images at a relatively high frequency 16 days the remotely sensed data captured by landsat 8 were processed to calculate the gndvi green normalized difference vegetation index which is a vegetation health indicator purcoi 2020 the gndvi has been chosen to overcome the issues of saturation previously observed for the ndvi when analyzing the properties of plants at a late growth stage with moderately high foliar surface in riparian areas gianelle et al 2009 cicek et al 2010 this indicator is particularly useful in identifying changes in the vegetation composition because of disturbance and interspecific competition liang et al 2015 lai values are a reliable indicator of the water loss rate through transpiration nagler et al 2004 thus for the characterization of the evapotranspiration processes evapotranspiration changes between the monitoring campaigns were assessed using modis myd16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration latent heat flux products mu et al 2011 which is a composite dataset produced at 8 days using 500 m pixel resolution https lpdaac usgs gov products myd16a2v006 2 4 statistics and data processing descriptive statistics were employed to develop a quantitative analysis of the interaction between riparian ecosystems and water quality charts were used to present the distribution of various indicators the modis raster datasets were altered by changing the cell size from 500 500 m to 50 50 m through resampling method data management tools raster processing resample using the bilinear interpolation the purpose of this modification was to supplement the missing of downscaled outputs since the downscaling method was not fully optimized consequently the et modeling results should be regarded only as indicative the resampled images were used in envi tools from arc toolbox envi tools classification image processing classify with training command has clustered the composing pixels into classes based on the training data supplied as polygons and points from corine land cover shapefile https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover the classification method for a single band input data was maximum likelihood maximum likelihood assumes that the statistics for each class in each band are normally distributed and calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to a specific class each pixel is assigned to the class that has the highest probability which is the maximum likelihood following the trained classification the difference between the resulted raster datasets was assessed using calculate image difference this tool compares two images of the same geographic extent and identifies differences between them at last we used calculate thematic change which takes two classification images of the same scene and identifies differences between them the resulting classification image shows class transitions for example from class 1 to class 2 and so on the remotely sensed data and the primary data resulted from in field collection have been used for the calculation of the potential evapotranspiration pet 3 results 3 1 water chemistry the results obtained from sampling the water along glavacioc river in four control sections showed a reduction of the values of the monitored parameters from upstream to downstream excepting conductivity on a river segment of 26 km that passes a wetland and then several patches with abundant riparian vegetation located between butesti and videle this tendency was more evident between june and july which are months with maximum lai development for the riparian vegetation table 2 apparently the reduction of nitrates and ammonium ph and do might be related to the buffer capacity of wetland and riparian areas thus the water sampled from the ponds of poeni wetland reached the lowest ph 7 6 concentrations of nitrates 2 mg l ammonium 1 mg l and do 6 4 mg l on average compared to the river samples this suggests that the wetland vegetation intercepts and consumes nutrients load to some extent regarding the dynamics of the tested parameters during the vegetation season march september the results obtained in the poeni wetland are presented in fig 3 while the river water maintained the same ph the ph of the water from ponds decreased with the advancement of time recording the lowest ph in september conductivity dropped from march to september almost in the same way for all the water types i e upstream downstream and ponds in the poeni wetland nitrates and ammonium concentrations presented a significant decreasing from march to april then maintaining a steady trend for the ilfov river the upstream and downstream ph values were alkaline 7 9 8 2 a decrease of 0 3 ph units has been found in the lower part of the riparian area furthermore decreases in the concentrations of nitrates 2 4 mg l and ammonium 0 7 mg l have also been observed the conductivity showed medium values in both locations and within the normal range for rivers water according to u s g s the water temperature was lower in the upstream area where the basin is shadowed by riparian forests whereas in the downstream areas grasslands and shrubs are dominant consequently the overall ecological status of the ilfov river in the upper part of the udresti riparian area was good during 2019 with good values for lotic ecosystems the only variable that indicated moderate quality was the concentration of nitrates with a mean value of 8 9 mg l 3 2 vegetation indices and evapotranspiration riparian vegetation of both basins consists of hydrophilic species such as spruce poplar willow alder and adapted grassland species shoreline areas that are frequently flooded are mostly covered by horsetail equisetum sp sedges carex sp and other grass species e g agrostis stolonifera l lolium perenne l poa pratensis l these species developed the ability to tolerate high sediment deposition and reduced soil oxygen garssen et al 2015 moving further from the channel margin sediments and flood tolerant species are steadily replaced by willow and alder purcoi 2020 fig s4 furthermore the drier and more stable areas are frequently covered by oaks quercus petraea l elms ulmus minor l willows salix alba l salix fragilis l poplars populus nigra l and spiny plants e g rubus ulmifolius l rosa canina l prunus spinosa l the glavacioc river basin has a significant abundance of thermophile oaks including quercus pedunculiflora and quercus pubescens the vegetation structure of the ilfov river riparian areas is almost similar but the anthropogenic influence is more present fig s7 within the ilfov river basin an avifaunistic region has been legally established id rospa0124 to protect about 22 endangered bird species e g ciconia nigra nycticorax nycticorax ardeola ralloides chlidonias hybridus etc consequently preserving the natural riparian environment in good ecological status is particularly important for conservation purposes and satellite derived indices can support this action gndvi results pointed out the greenness status for both basins table s5 table 3 shows the differences between the two basins while the mean of gndvi increased from june to august with 0 04 than decreased with the same amount from august to september in glavacioc the gndvi of ilfov decreased from june to september low precipitations were recorded in august 7 2 mm and september 3 2 mm and this might explain the constancy between these two months due to the lower availability of water for plants fig 4 gndvi of ilfov river basin showed more important differences compared to glavacioc mainly because ilfov has less agricultural lands and irrigation is more used due to the presence of hydrotechnical and land reclamation facilities existing in this basin in glavacioc several differences were recorded in the form of isolated patches in the central part of the basin this is consistent with the existence of degradation hotspots during august that recovered in september figure 5 shows the results of the pixel based detection technique between june and september 2019 ilfov presented more significant changes of gndvi compared to glavacioc river basin in terms of evapotranspiration determined in situ the daily pet varied from 1 2 to 3 6 trees 0 8 to 3 1 shrubs and 0 7 to 2 9 mm day 1 grassland between march and september 2019 a rate of 1 mm day 1 is equivalent to a loss of 10 m3 ha 1 day 1 pet values varied especially with wind speed solar radiation and temperature fluctuations during the maximum leaf area period grassland canopy showed pet rates higher than the taller canopy of shrubs including typha species having the highest variance dunea et al 2019 table 4 presents the mean pet values computed for the poeni wetland conditions in poland the average daily totals of evapotranspiration vary from about 0 5 mm day 1 during the winter months to about 3 3 5 mm day 1 in summer for wetland areas siedlecki et al 2016 the results from poeni wetland are in agreement with the summer values reported in this study figure 6 shows the fluctuations of hourly and daily pet between march and september 2019 recorded in the ilfov river basin by a continuous monitoring system the pet daily values ranged from 0 3 to 4 4 mm day 1 with an average value of the period of 2 3 mm day 1 3 3 evapotranspiration change detection satellite observations provide wide scale and reliable resources for the assessment of evapotranspiration processes at hydrographical basin level which is better than point monitoring figure 7 shows the modis myd16a2 images resampled to a 50 50 m cell resolution using bilinear interpolation a decreasing of the et can be observed following the advancing in vegetation from may june to the beginning of august fig s6 furthermore the river basin has preponderantly arable lands including cropland and fallows and in august most of the crops have been harvested corn wheat sunflower etc knowing that at sowing nearly 100 of et originates from evaporation and at full crop cover more than 90 of et comes from transpiration removal of crops significantly influences the et from the earth surface figure s2 shows the predominance of 211 non irrigated arable land category within the basin on the other hand the land cover was used for the classify with training tool in the glavacioc river basin figure 8 provides the computed difference between the two et classified images based on maximum likelihood estimation most of the changes overlapped with the arable lands but there were also areas that presented few observable modifications figure 9 presents the thematic change computed in the glavacioc river basin between the two 8 day et remote sensing products may june and august 2019 for an in depth classification of the change class transitions from one class to another are useful for performing detailed vegetation analysis 4 discussion the vegetated riparian areas alongside streams are considered to be efficient at impeding and controlling the chemical loads from various diffuse sources entering the water bodies weissteiner et al 2014 the intense spread of cattail typha spp occurred in both wetland areas and both basins in july august 2019 due to its morphological traits such as robust size quick growth rate and rhizomatic expansion typha spp is capable of quickly expanding and colonizing habitats increased nutrients inputs and altered hydrological regimes are the main causes of cattail spread bansal et al 2019 consequently the high availability of nutrients in the glavacioc water has supported this intense spread and luxuriant development of the canopy disturbance of the glavacioc basin is present in the form of diffuse pollution runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers washed from the agricultural lands on its entire course there are multiple ecological stressor on the river segment that passes the poeni wetland including point pollution generated by the oil extraction fields and untreated wastewaters originating from rural households and small enterprises most of the local households in the area lack advanced wastewater treatment systems on the upper part of the ilfov river the balanced ecological status is affected by waterborne and airborne loads of heavy metals originating from the metallurgical facilities of targoviste city fig s3 riparian vegetation influences the water chemistry of streams both directly though nutrients uptake and indirectly by supplying organic matter to the soil and reducing turbulence while stabilizing the banks and the alluvial sediments dosskey et al 2010 the rate of nutrients uptake varies according to the growing stage of the vegetation it is more efficient when plants are relatively young and vigorously growing with leaves stems and roots quickly adding biomass mcmillan et al 2014 in addition it has been established that temperature acts as a catalyst and enhances nutrients retention and solubility including nitrates sudduth et al 2011 the shadowing effect of riparian vegetation is essential because high water temperatures affect the health of the ecosystem and put at risk the aquatic biota kalny et al 2017 found that an increase of 2 c in atmospheric temperature would result in an increase of 1 3 c in water temperature in an unsheltered area and of only 0 8 c in areas with riparian vegetation it has been proved that water temperatures are lower in vegetated areas compared to open locations garner et al 2017 furthermore channel orientation and exposure are important in terms of solar radiation inputs jackson et al 2017 but the shadowing effect of riparian areas is also determinant these processes can be monitored from satellite observations in our case the observed trends in concentration will have to be confirmed by measurements of fluxes of elements transported by the streams in different sections on a yearly time scale the underground input of groundwater and elements in the rivers will also be assessed landsat based or other satellites daily synthetic indices such as ndvi gndvi lai or et can be estimated for the day of the satellite overpass because only a limited number of usable landsat images can be obtained during a year because of cloud cover and the 16 day temporal resolution the downscaling methods have to be considered to obtain synthetic maps of et for various periods it is reasonable to obtain annual et maps based on a few daily et estimates because any bias is compensated over a longer period one important shortcoming is the availability of cloud free images especially when small areas such as river wetlands are monitored only landsat 8 utilization is difficult to be considered since for the glavacioc river basin most of the images acquired in the vegetation season of the 2019 year had important cloud cover percentages other satellite products must be considered to compensate this hiatus but this complicates the potential automation of the data processing due to various differences between the image characteristics radiometric traits resolution time acquisition etc future work will consider these aspects and the downscaling procedures using field measurements of et and other ecophysiological characteristics a field experimental approach for a better characterization of the radiative advective processes occurring in the tested areas is required the results from pilot areas must be compared with lysimeter data a canopy analyzer will be deployed to assess the light interception and absorption patterns together with the non destructive lai assessment in heterogeneous herbaceous canopies which will improve the pet calculation routines in the wetland areas 5 conclusions the current study provides several points in view to diminish the gaps in knowledge related to the study of riparian vegetation of small plain streams that are subject of anthropogenic impact first it provides a methodological approach for detecting changes in vegetation and evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration estimation from satellites at finer temporal and spatial resolutions can help in water resources planning assessment development and management second water chemistry was explored providing required milestones for future detailed field monitoring campaigns in association with the structure of habitats riparian vegetation plays an essential role in maintaining the good ecological status of rivers in the present study there are indications that the vegetation could be useful in nutrients uptake lowering temperatures through shadowing and maintaining high humidity degree at ground level compared to open surfaces the main anthropogenic stressors affecting the studied areas were linked to changes in land use overuse of fertilizers especially in glavacioc basin water contamination with heavy metals ilfov river near targoviste city and oil spills and poor wastewater treatment poeni wetland water chemistry also has a feedback on the vegetation patterns and this has been observed in the abundance of hydrophilic species like cattail which is specific for nutrients rich environments thematic change detection applied to modis et products can finely point out the hot spots for degraded vegetation at the basin scale linking the water quality and evapotranspiration characteristics with the status of riparian vegetated areas future work will consider the developing testing and validation of suitable downscaling methods for field scale et modeling adapted for riparian vegetation studies third as with all satellite derived evapotranspiration assessments our approach is not without limitations from which the most important is the absence of calibration using ground data provided by eddy covariance towers because they are not available near the studied areas author contributions all authors have equal contribution to the preparation of this scientific paper all authors have read and agreed to

artificial reservoirs the climatologic normal slightly differs between basins i e 10 c for the glavacioc river measured at videle meteorological station and 9 8 c for the ilfov river basin measured at targoviste meteorological station respectively table s2 regarding the land use land cover provided by corine 2018 both basins show similarities with high percentages of non irrigated arable land and the presence of broad leaved forests ilfov river basin has more surfaces of water bodies having a higher number of hydrotechnical facilities and an important pisciculture research station figs s1 and s2 seven artificial lakes are located on the course of the ilfov river udresti bunget i bunget ii bunget iii bratesti adunati and ilfoveni table 1 summarizes the main morphological and hydrological characteristics of the two river basins 2 2 monitoring campaigns the field measurements have been performed to establish an adequate methodology for the determination of evapotranspiration from the riparian areas including wetlands the study area considered relevant from the point of view of the inter aspa project objectives was chosen on a distance of 26 km along the glavacioc river in its basin cadastral code x 1 23 11 8 from catunu village to the town of videle fig 2 five monitoring points have been considered for sampling the water chemistry i e four from the river channel and one from the ponds of poeni wetland in depth analyses have been performed in the wetland located near poeni village 135 ha teleorman county south of romania starting from catunu to butești village in the poeni village administrative area there are forests agricultural lands and permanent grasslands but also oil extraction fields six relevant monitoring points were considered for monitoring campaigns which were performed each month in the vegetation season from march to september 2019 microclimate measurements for evapotranspiration assessments using a par monitoring system comprising a beam fraction sensor digital anemometers microclimate multi parameters air and soil temperature sensors and soil moisture sensors albedo the ratio between reflected and global radiation was determined with a portable pyranometer for different vegetated surfaces surface water quality in various control sections and herbaceous vegetation mapping the data obtained from in situ monitoring was used in the penman monteith algorithm dingman 2014 to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet requiring the canopy height the conductance properties of the leaf the albedo the lai the atmospheric pressure the incident global radiation the cloud cover the air temperature the relative humidity the wind speed and the soil moisture deficit leaf conductance properties for riparian ecosystems were retrieved from literature dunea et al 2019 in ilfov river basin two control points were considered at the entrance and exit of udresti wetland fig s3 just to compare the results with the more extended ones obtained in glavacioc river basin the in situ monitoring consisted of water chemistry analysis and the monitoring of atmospheric parameters in and outside of the riparian canopy the water samples 4 replicates point have been systematically collected using a watson marlow peristaltic pump from both rivers fig s3 the equipment has been washed with distilled water after each measurement to avoid cross contamination water quality parameters such as conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen have been measured on site using adequate equipment table s2 and conventional measuring protocols fig s5 water samples have been stored in cooler bags and transported to the laboratory where nitrates and ammonium content has been measured using a hach lange dr 2800 portable spectrophotometer following the specific procedures the chemical analysis of water was conducted at the entry and the exit points of various sections of the selected riparian areas in order to emphasize the ability of riparian buffers of contributing towards nutrients up taking 2 3 remote sensing resources and analysis landsat 8 oli resources have been selected because it provides useful spatial resolutions 30 m and images at a relatively high frequency 16 days the remotely sensed data captured by landsat 8 were processed to calculate the gndvi green normalized difference vegetation index which is a vegetation health indicator purcoi 2020 the gndvi has been chosen to overcome the issues of saturation previously observed for the ndvi when analyzing the properties of plants at a late growth stage with moderately high foliar surface in riparian areas gianelle et al 2009 cicek et al 2010 this indicator is particularly useful in identifying changes in the vegetation composition because of disturbance and interspecific competition liang et al 2015 lai values are a reliable indicator of the water loss rate through transpiration nagler et al 2004 thus for the characterization of the evapotranspiration processes evapotranspiration changes between the monitoring campaigns were assessed using modis myd16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration latent heat flux products mu et al 2011 which is a composite dataset produced at 8 days using 500 m pixel resolution https lpdaac usgs gov products myd16a2v006 2 4 statistics and data processing descriptive statistics were employed to develop a quantitative analysis of the interaction between riparian ecosystems and water quality charts were used to present the distribution of various indicators the modis raster datasets were altered by changing the cell size from 500 500 m to 50 50 m through resampling method data management tools raster processing resample using the bilinear interpolation the purpose of this modification was to supplement the missing of downscaled outputs since the downscaling method was not fully optimized consequently the et modeling results should be regarded only as indicative the resampled images were used in envi tools from arc toolbox envi tools classification image processing classify with training command has clustered the composing pixels into classes based on the training data supplied as polygons and points from corine land cover shapefile https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover the classification method for a single band input data was maximum likelihood maximum likelihood assumes that the statistics for each class in each band are normally distributed and calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to a specific class each pixel is assigned to the class that has the highest probability which is the maximum likelihood following the trained classification the difference between the resulted raster datasets was assessed using calculate image difference this tool compares two images of the same geographic extent and identifies differences between them at last we used calculate thematic change which takes two classification images of the same scene and identifies differences between them the resulting classification image shows class transitions for example from class 1 to class 2 and so on the remotely sensed data and the primary data resulted from in field collection have been used for the calculation of the potential evapotranspiration pet 3 results 3 1 water chemistry the results obtained from sampling the water along glavacioc river in four control sections showed a reduction of the values of the monitored parameters from upstream to downstream excepting conductivity on a river segment of 26 km that passes a wetland and then several patches with abundant riparian vegetation located between butesti and videle this tendency was more evident between june and july which are months with maximum lai development for the riparian vegetation table 2 apparently the reduction of nitrates and ammonium ph and do might be related to the buffer capacity of wetland and riparian areas thus the water sampled from the ponds of poeni wetland reached the lowest ph 7 6 concentrations of nitrates 2 mg l ammonium 1 mg l and do 6 4 mg l on average compared to the river samples this suggests that the wetland vegetation intercepts and consumes nutrients load to some extent regarding the dynamics of the tested parameters during the vegetation season march september the results obtained in the poeni wetland are presented in fig 3 while the river water maintained the same ph the ph of the water from ponds decreased with the advancement of time recording the lowest ph in september conductivity dropped from march to september almost in the same way for all the water types i e upstream downstream and ponds in the poeni wetland nitrates and ammonium concentrations presented a significant decreasing from march to april then maintaining a steady trend for the ilfov river the upstream and downstream ph values were alkaline 7 9 8 2 a decrease of 0 3 ph units has been found in the lower part of the riparian area furthermore decreases in the concentrations of nitrates 2 4 mg l and ammonium 0 7 mg l have also been observed the conductivity showed medium values in both locations and within the normal range for rivers water according to u s g s the water temperature was lower in the upstream area where the basin is shadowed by riparian forests whereas in the downstream areas grasslands and shrubs are dominant consequently the overall ecological status of the ilfov river in the upper part of the udresti riparian area was good during 2019 with good values for lotic ecosystems the only variable that indicated moderate quality was the concentration of nitrates with a mean value of 8 9 mg l 3 2 vegetation indices and evapotranspiration riparian vegetation of both basins consists of hydrophilic species such as spruce poplar willow alder and adapted grassland species shoreline areas that are frequently flooded are mostly covered by horsetail equisetum sp sedges carex sp and other grass species e g agrostis stolonifera l lolium perenne l poa pratensis l these species developed the ability to tolerate high sediment deposition and reduced soil oxygen garssen et al 2015 moving further from the channel margin sediments and flood tolerant species are steadily replaced by willow and alder purcoi 2020 fig s4 furthermore the drier and more stable areas are frequently covered by oaks quercus petraea l elms ulmus minor l willows salix alba l salix fragilis l poplars populus nigra l and spiny plants e g rubus ulmifolius l rosa canina l prunus spinosa l the glavacioc river basin has a significant abundance of thermophile oaks including quercus pedunculiflora and quercus pubescens the vegetation structure of the ilfov river riparian areas is almost similar but the anthropogenic influence is more present fig s7 within the ilfov river basin an avifaunistic region has been legally established id rospa0124 to protect about 22 endangered bird species e g ciconia nigra nycticorax nycticorax ardeola ralloides chlidonias hybridus etc consequently preserving the natural riparian environment in good ecological status is particularly important for conservation purposes and satellite derived indices can support this action gndvi results pointed out the greenness status for both basins table s5 table 3 shows the differences between the two basins while the mean of gndvi increased from june to august with 0 04 than decreased with the same amount from august to september in glavacioc the gndvi of ilfov decreased from june to september low precipitations were recorded in august 7 2 mm and september 3 2 mm and this might explain the constancy between these two months due to the lower availability of water for plants fig 4 gndvi of ilfov river basin showed more important differences compared to glavacioc mainly because ilfov has less agricultural lands and irrigation is more used due to the presence of hydrotechnical and land reclamation facilities existing in this basin in glavacioc several differences were recorded in the form of isolated patches in the central part of the basin this is consistent with the existence of degradation hotspots during august that recovered in september figure 5 shows the results of the pixel based detection technique between june and september 2019 ilfov presented more significant changes of gndvi compared to glavacioc river basin in terms of evapotranspiration determined in situ the daily pet varied from 1 2 to 3 6 trees 0 8 to 3 1 shrubs and 0 7 to 2 9 mm day 1 grassland between march and september 2019 a rate of 1 mm day 1 is equivalent to a loss of 10 m3 ha 1 day 1 pet values varied especially with wind speed solar radiation and temperature fluctuations during the maximum leaf area period grassland canopy showed pet rates higher than the taller canopy of shrubs including typha species having the highest variance dunea et al 2019 table 4 presents the mean pet values computed for the poeni wetland conditions in poland the average daily totals of evapotranspiration vary from about 0 5 mm day 1 during the winter months to about 3 3 5 mm day 1 in summer for wetland areas siedlecki et al 2016 the results from poeni wetland are in agreement with the summer values reported in this study figure 6 shows the fluctuations of hourly and daily pet between march and september 2019 recorded in the ilfov river basin by a continuous monitoring system the pet daily values ranged from 0 3 to 4 4 mm day 1 with an average value of the period of 2 3 mm day 1 3 3 evapotranspiration change detection satellite observations provide wide scale and reliable resources for the assessment of evapotranspiration processes at hydrographical basin level which is better than point monitoring figure 7 shows the modis myd16a2 images resampled to a 50 50 m cell resolution using bilinear interpolation a decreasing of the et can be observed following the advancing in vegetation from may june to the beginning of august fig s6 furthermore the river basin has preponderantly arable lands including cropland and fallows and in august most of the crops have been harvested corn wheat sunflower etc knowing that at sowing nearly 100 of et originates from evaporation and at full crop cover more than 90 of et comes from transpiration removal of crops significantly influences the et from the earth surface figure s2 shows the predominance of 211 non irrigated arable land category within the basin on the other hand the land cover was used for the classify with training tool in the glavacioc river basin figure 8 provides the computed difference between the two et classified images based on maximum likelihood estimation most of the changes overlapped with the arable lands but there were also areas that presented few observable modifications figure 9 presents the thematic change computed in the glavacioc river basin between the two 8 day et remote sensing products may june and august 2019 for an in depth classification of the change class transitions from one class to another are useful for performing detailed vegetation analysis 4 discussion the vegetated riparian areas alongside streams are considered to be efficient at impeding and controlling the chemical loads from various diffuse sources entering the water bodies weissteiner et al 2014 the intense spread of cattail typha spp occurred in both wetland areas and both basins in july august 2019 due to its morphological traits such as robust size quick growth rate and rhizomatic expansion typha spp is capable of quickly expanding and colonizing habitats increased nutrients inputs and altered hydrological regimes are the main causes of cattail spread bansal et al 2019 consequently the high availability of nutrients in the glavacioc water has supported this intense spread and luxuriant development of the canopy disturbance of the glavacioc basin is present in the form of diffuse pollution runoff containing pesticides and fertilizers washed from the agricultural lands on its entire course there are multiple ecological stressor on the river segment that passes the poeni wetland including point pollution generated by the oil extraction fields and untreated wastewaters originating from rural households and small enterprises most of the local households in the area lack advanced wastewater treatment systems on the upper part of the ilfov river the balanced ecological status is affected by waterborne and airborne loads of heavy metals originating from the metallurgical facilities of targoviste city fig s3 riparian vegetation influences the water chemistry of streams both directly though nutrients uptake and indirectly by supplying organic matter to the soil and reducing turbulence while stabilizing the banks and the alluvial sediments dosskey et al 2010 the rate of nutrients uptake varies according to the growing stage of the vegetation it is more efficient when plants are relatively young and vigorously growing with leaves stems and roots quickly adding biomass mcmillan et al 2014 in addition it has been established that temperature acts as a catalyst and enhances nutrients retention and solubility including nitrates sudduth et al 2011 the shadowing effect of riparian vegetation is essential because high water temperatures affect the health of the ecosystem and put at risk the aquatic biota kalny et al 2017 found that an increase of 2 c in atmospheric temperature would result in an increase of 1 3 c in water temperature in an unsheltered area and of only 0 8 c in areas with riparian vegetation it has been proved that water temperatures are lower in vegetated areas compared to open locations garner et al 2017 furthermore channel orientation and exposure are important in terms of solar radiation inputs jackson et al 2017 but the shadowing effect of riparian areas is also determinant these processes can be monitored from satellite observations in our case the observed trends in concentration will have to be confirmed by measurements of fluxes of elements transported by the streams in different sections on a yearly time scale the underground input of groundwater and elements in the rivers will also be assessed landsat based or other satellites daily synthetic indices such as ndvi gndvi lai or et can be estimated for the day of the satellite overpass because only a limited number of usable landsat images can be obtained during a year because of cloud cover and the 16 day temporal resolution the downscaling methods have to be considered to obtain synthetic maps of et for various periods it is reasonable to obtain annual et maps based on a few daily et estimates because any bias is compensated over a longer period one important shortcoming is the availability of cloud free images especially when small areas such as river wetlands are monitored only landsat 8 utilization is difficult to be considered since for the glavacioc river basin most of the images acquired in the vegetation season of the 2019 year had important cloud cover percentages other satellite products must be considered to compensate this hiatus but this complicates the potential automation of the data processing due to various differences between the image characteristics radiometric traits resolution time acquisition etc future work will consider these aspects and the downscaling procedures using field measurements of et and other ecophysiological characteristics a field experimental approach for a better characterization of the radiative advective processes occurring in the tested areas is required the results from pilot areas must be compared with lysimeter data a canopy analyzer will be deployed to assess the light interception and absorption patterns together with the non destructive lai assessment in heterogeneous herbaceous canopies which will improve the pet calculation routines in the wetland areas 5 conclusions the current study provides several points in view to diminish the gaps in knowledge related to the study of riparian vegetation of small plain streams that are subject of anthropogenic impact first it provides a methodological approach for detecting changes in vegetation and evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration estimation from satellites at finer temporal and spatial resolutions can help in water resources planning assessment development and management second water chemistry was explored providing required milestones for future detailed field monitoring campaigns in association with the structure of habitats riparian vegetation plays an essential role in maintaining the good ecological status of rivers in the present study there are indications that the vegetation could be useful in nutrients uptake lowering temperatures through shadowing and maintaining high humidity degree at ground level compared to open surfaces the main anthropogenic stressors affecting the studied areas were linked to changes in land use overuse of fertilizers especially in glavacioc basin water contamination with heavy metals ilfov river near targoviste city and oil spills and poor wastewater treatment poeni wetland water chemistry also has a feedback on the vegetation patterns and this has been observed in the abundance of hydrophilic species like cattail which is specific for nutrients rich environments thematic change detection applied to modis et products can finely point out the hot spots for degraded vegetation at the basin scale linking the water quality and evapotranspiration characteristics with the status of riparian vegetated areas future work will consider the developing testing and validation of suitable downscaling methods for field scale et modeling adapted for riparian vegetation studies third as with all satellite derived evapotranspiration assessments our approach is not without limitations from which the most important is the absence of calibration using ground data provided by eddy covariance towers because they are not available near the studied areas author contributions all authors have equal contribution to the preparation of this scientific paper all authors have read and agreed to

valuable tool for water management since it can simulate the potential response of the aquatic system to changes such as the addition of organic pollution an increase in nutrient levels or water abstraction rates and changes in sewage treatment operations the negative effects of human activity on water quality are manifested both by the contamination of resources and by violation of the natural conditions of water circulation this study aims to determine the relationships between anthropogenic activities stressors and adverse effects based on previously acquired knowledge about the state of water quality in the laborec river and the sources of pollution in the river basin the exposure profile developed within this research is the output of an analysis of environmental risks in the studied river basin and is focused on an evaluation of the surface water quality in the laborec river the results from the evaluation are following risk is characterized as acceptable in the upper section of the laborec basin it can be characterized as moderate to undesirable in the middle part of the river basin and the risk is unacceptable in the lower part of the river basin mainly due to industry this results can identify the priority areas where measures for decreasing of the water pollution have to be done keywords risk assessment water quality laborec river slovakia 1 introduction over the past several decades many rivers and streams have been subjected to intense human pressure which has influenced the functioning of river ecosystems malmqvist and rundle 2002 kubiak wójcicka et al 2017 teurlincx et al 2019 rivers are the main source of water for the population agriculture and industry they are endangered by human activities which increases water pollution milanovic 2007 zhang et al 2012 bashar and fung 2020 water pollution is one of the most important environmental problems faced by water managers the solution to the problem may be based on various technologies and programs there is now a large selection of models developed for water quality simulation that have become useful and provide a good tool for planning and managing water quality erturk 2010 paca et al 2019 in the development of water quality models small river basins pose specific problems due to data scarcity a lack of major investments as a consequence of their minor importance and the large number of diverse inputs especially if these rivers flow through densely populated areas for these reasons it is difficult to adapt major water quality models which require more information regarding the river system than is often available in these cases it makes sense to use simple ad hoc models in order to derive crucial information about the river quality and to become part of a decision support system the complexity of water quality models covers a wide range from a simple streeter phelps model streeter and phelps 1925 with two fixed variables through swqm spreadsheet water quality model alabama department of environmental management 2001 based on the streeter phelps equation additional methods include qual2 hoang et al 2019 and similar tools describing in detail oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus cycles with about ten variables brown and barnwell 1987 hoang et al 2019 and ecosystem models that assess suspended insoluble substances algae zooplankton invertebrates plants and fish and modelling using artificial neural network techniques sarkar and pandey 2015 solgi et al 2017 the idea of using model structures that are appropriate for application and the available data was first advocated by halfon 1989 and beck 1987 pearl 1978 also noted that the tendency to prefer simple models is partly based on the notion that they are easier to calibrate and therefore more reliable as confirmed by snowling and kramer 2001 who showed that complex models are generally very sensitive and therefore difficult to identify and lindenschmidt 2006 who pointed out that the most complex model is not necessarily the most accurate on the other hand data scarcity may lead to heavily overdetermined calibration problems because the large number of adjustable parameters and the few experimental constraints make good fits almost guaranteed at least using mean parameter values european management strategies have tended to address single issues e g diffuse or point sources or particular regions e g upland or lowland areas wade 2001 there is no clear cut distinction between point sources or diffuse sources non point sources chapman 1996 in general with increasing discharge points sources of contaminants are diluted whereas diffuse sources show increased concentrations progressive urbanization and industrial development have also led to the increasing use of rivers for waste disposal activities abd elaziz et al 2020 abd elhamid et al 2020 the pollution arising from these and other sources such as the use of agricultural pesticides has led to an increasing need for rigorous assessment of river water quality zeleňáková and čarnogurská 2013 zeleňáková et al 2013 zeleňáková et al 2016 the complexity and components of such assessment programmes are defined by the uses of the water and local water quality requirements as well as a need to protect the aquatic environment from further degradation superimposed on these anthropogenic inputs an integrated management approach is required and environmental risk assessment is one of the effective possibilities the importance of this is acknowledged in the united states of america where an integrated approach was implemented through permit trading between diffuse and point source polluters epa 1999 in particular such an approach is needed to assess the likely impacts of land management and climatic change on eu polluted rivers an environmental risk assessment evaluates the potential adverse effects that human activities have on the plants and animals that make up an ecosystem was presented by zeleňáková and zvijáková 2017 the risk assessment process provides a way to develop organize and present scientific information so that it is relevant to environmental decisions when conducted for a particular place such as a river basin the environmental risk assessment process can be used to identify vulnerable and valued resources prioritize data collection activity and link human activities with their potential effects this paper presents an environmental risk assessment in a river basin due to the water quality in the river basin this paper aims to determine the relationships between anthropogenic activities stressors and adverse effects based on the sources of water pollution in the laborec river basin the exposure profile is focused on an evaluation of the surface water quality in the laborec river and the assessment of environmental risks in the river basin 2 material and methods the sources of environmental risks related to water quality in the river basins of eastern slovakia are primarily industrial and agricultural production which endanger water resources the main causes of the persistent unfavourable status in surface water quality in the area are considered to be the hydraulically insufficient qualitatively unsatisfactory and or a lack of treatment of wastewater produced in the area by point sources of pollution the high level of water contamination not only of surface water but also of groundwater due to extensive surface pollution which is caused by wastewater produced from the population without sewerage landfills intensive agricultural activity soil erosion and others the significant point sources of pollution in the area in question which have a direct impact on recipients through discharged wastewater in terms of quantity and nature 2 1 environmental risks assessment the methodology applied in this study is expressed in fig 1 the environmental risk assessment process consists of three main phases as depicted problem formulation risk analysis and risk characterization epa 1999 three additional compartments appear in the flow chart planning risk management and iterative monitoring and data acquisition during planning scientists and managers with input from stakeholders seek agreement on the focus scope and complexity of the assessment then the formal risk assessment process commences with problem formulation during which key questions conceptual models and an analysis plan are developed the analysis phase evaluates the exposure of the assessed resources to stressors and the relationship between stressor levels and environmental effects during risk characterization the risks are described and if possible estimated quantitatively forming the basis for the assessment s conclusions and a report monitoring and new data acquisition may occur in support of any of these phases wherever needed after completion the risk assessment s findings are communicated to managers who then determine a course of action epa 1999 2 2 study area the laborec catchment area where the mentioned conditions are most pronounced was selected as the model area for the needs of this work the characteristics of the river basin are elaborated as following the laborec river basin fig 2 is bordered on the north by the state border with poland which is also the ridge that forms the dividing line separating the baltic and black sea basins in the east this area is delimited by the state border with ukraine in the south by the left hand bank of the latorica and in the west by the basic catchment area of the ondava the basin is situated in the north eastern part of eastern slovakia the largest part of the laborec catchment area is located in the medzilaborce humenné michalovce snina and sobrance districts the total area of the laborec basin is 4 522 5 km2 the laborec springs in the nízke beskydy mountains at an altitude of 682 m above sea level and is 129 km long it receives mostly left side well developed tributaries of the výrava udava and cirocha which form a fan of streams above humenné next the river bypasses the vihorlat mountains and flows into the lowlands where its slope is reduced after a long section with no tributaries it merges with the large left hand tributary the uh river most of which is located in transcarpathian ukraine 11 613 km2 which is 61 of the area after the connection with the uh the enclosed modified laborec flows all the way to the latorica before the mouth the duša river flows into it the natural conditions in the upper and lower parts of the study area are quite different in nature but a common feature of both parts is their significant deterioration the catchment area is disproportionately burdened by economic activity especially in the central part the predominant part of the anthropogenic interventions have occurred in the east slovakian lowlands where in the flat and hilly parts the vegetation cover was first removed the increase in soil pollution due to oil contamination čierna nad tisou is also characteristic but also due to outputs from industrial plants concentrated in the middle part of the catchment area around strážské michalovce and humenné these facts worsen the conditions for maintaining the vegetation cover which plays an irreplaceable role in the water cycle parts of the forest stands are also damaged by emissions which is an undesirable phenomenon in the flysch area where the forest functions all the more strongly as a runoff regulator deterioration of natural conditions has begun to manifest itself in recent years especially with the outflow of large amounts of water as in the upper part of the basin where there have been rapidly occurring floods there has been an increase in the transport of sediments and intensive clogging of reservoirs as well as the lower sections of streams these phenomena should be seen as signs of a disturbance of the natural balance due to current land use trends if such trends continue serious disturbances to the natural renewal of water resources may occur in the whole river basin in the future the most conflicted areas those with a high anthropogenic load can be found in the area of larger settlements namely in michalovce and humenné the load on the area is at the limit of the environment s carrying capacity and reducing the intensity of anthropogenic activities is recommended 2 3 sources of pollution problem formulation phase pollution decreases biodiversity in rivers and is a negative factor mainly for fishes and the bio habitats of rivers the aim of the environmental risk assessment in the laborec river basin is to characterize the sources of pollution affecting the quality of the water in the basin the essence of this evaluation phase is the selection of endpoints and the creation of a conceptual model for the needs of the next phase of evaluation risk analysis data were provided by the slovak water management company the evaluated period covers five years from 2015 to 2019 2 3 1 point sources of pollution there are 66 points of wastewater discharge in the laborec river basin mainly from industry mining education health care social care homes dss and public sewers vk the sources of pollution in the laborec river basin include public sewers of which there are 20 industrial production also has a significant share in the pollution with 22 sources of pollution from industrial production registered in the river basin other sources of pollution 24 include agriculture and forestry wholesale and retail trade hotels and restaurants public administration and defence education health and social work the total amount of pollution discharged from point sources of pollution in the laborec basin according to the bod5 indicator is expressed in fig 3 discharged pollution expressed by the bod5 indicator from public sewers makes up 49 41 of the total production of resources in the river basin the reason is insufficient wastewater treatment from public sewers as well as the inability of existing wastewater treatment plants to treat the entire amount of inflowing wastewater the discharged pollution from industry expressed by the bod5 indicator is 50 31 this high percentage is mainly influenced by the discharge of cooling water from chemko strážske and evo vojany the remaining 0 28 belongs to other sources of pollution which do not contribute to a significant increase in the concentration of bod5 in the stream a longitudinal profile of the river fig 4 presents an overview of the main point sources of pollution of the laborec watercourse as well as control profiles to the left in fig 4 in which the water quality is monitored and the main tributaries of the laborec in addition to point sources of pollution diffuse sources of pollution also contribute to the environmental risks of the river basin the main sources of surface pollution in the laborec basin are agriculture plant and animal production silage pits forestry logging afforestation construction of forest roads population without sewage systems septic tanks outlets of domestic sewers flushing from urban areas rainfall relief of sewer networks surface flushes landfilling solid waste landfills wastewater irrigation sludge landfilling from wwtps septic tanks hazardous waste landfills construction construction of motorways bridges and roads mines surface and deep mines heaps hydrology stream modification dredging construction of dams flow regulation other atmospheric deposition accidents seepage from underground storage containers more than half of all pollution in the surface waters of the laborec river basin comes from surface sources these include diffuse sources that do not discharge wastewater directly but do degrade water quality in the laborec basin point and area sources of pollution cause a significant environmental burden the overall evaluation is documented in table 1 in as many as 14 of the 66 registered wastewater outlets non compliance with the emission limits for wastewater discharge set by a water management decision is observed and in the three other cases these are sources that discharge wastewater without treatment waste from plant and animal production as a surface source of pollution also contributes greatly to polluting the river where undesirable substances enter the water through erosion and flushing 2 3 2 diffuse sources of pollution in order to reduce the environmental burden of the laborec river basin more effective measures to protect surface waters need to be taken in the future the quality of surface waters in the laborec watercourse has long been monitored in control profiles for the needs of this work seven control profiles were selected for which it was possible to obtain the necessary data see fig 4 left the selection of evaluation endpoints is based on a comparison of pollutant concentrations with the limits given in legislative and standards the following pollutants are considered in the current study biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and total nitrogen ntotal in this part of the problem formulation the relationships between anthropogenic activities stressors and adverse effects are based on previously acquired knowledge about the state of water quality in the stream and the sources of pollution in the river basin the conceptual model which is presented in fig 5 was developed as part of the risk analysis plan 3 results and discussion 3 1 risk analysis this phase involves the analysis of exposure and environmental effects which requires the application of water quality modelling methods the output of risk analysis consists of the summary profiles that are needed in the risk characterization phase 3 1 1 exposure characterization and analysis exposure profile the exposure profile which is the output of the analysis of environmental risks in a river basin is focused on evaluating the quality of surface water in a stream for the purposes of this work a method of water quality assessment using modelling was used the model is based on a modified streeter phelps equation water quality models introduce the value of basic pollution in accordance with the actual state of the environment the modified streeter phelps equation applies to one source of pollution 1 c c z c 0 c z 10 k 1 t where c value of the pollution indicator e g bod5 at a distance x from the source pollution g m 3 c z value of basic pollution g m 3 c 0 value of the pollution indicator just below the source of pollution g m 3 k 1 coefficient of formal first order kinetics d 1 t outflow time along path x d the values of the basic pollution cz can be determined using the equation 2 log c z a b log p z c log 1 p o p where p catchment area km2 p z catchment area without forests approximately agricultural land km2 po number of inhabitants in the river basin a b c coefficients the models are characterized in that the river network is divided into sections by control profiles which are further divided into sub sections by nodes a node is a place where the quantity and quality of water changes by jumping river tributary wastewater discharge in a broader sense a control or interest profile is also considered a node in the control profile the concentrations of the bod5 pollution indicator were calculated on the basis of the model of the modified streeter phelps eq 1 the input value for the model was the value of the basic pollution cz calculated from eq 2 the determination of basic pollution cz was based on the average values of measured bod5 concentrations in seven control profiles on the laborec watercourse in the period 2015 2019 on the area of agricultural land the number of inhabitants in the sub basin for the relevant control profile the values are presented in table 2 and logarithmic values at table 3 the input value for the model was the value of the basic pollution cz calculated from eq 2 the determination of basic pollution cz was based on the average values of measured bod5 concentrations in seven control profiles on the laborec watercourse in the period 2015 2019 on the area of agricultural land the number of inhabitants in the sub basin for the relevant control profile table 2 and the logarithmic values table 3 eq 2 was solved by regression with two independent variables 3 the resulting regression coefficients a 0 018295 b 0 036536 c 0 035068 were calculated for bod5 by means of which it is possible to determine the value of basic pollution cz by substituting into relation 2 log c z 0 018295 0 036536 3 431 0 035068 2 029 0 2148 the resulting value of the basic pollution is cz 1 6398 mg l bod5 this value can be considered as authoritative for the laborec river basin or its lower part if necessary the basic pollution value can be calculated specifically for each sub basin according to the above procedure to determine the concentration c of the bod5 indicator a modified streeter phelps eq 1 was used taking into account the values k 1 0 2 d 1 is the coefficient of formal first order kinetics a value obtained from the literature t is the outflow time along path x a value calculated from the relation t x u x is the path m distance e g wastewater discharge points from the wwtp and the control profile u is the flow rate m s 1 in which case the average rate over a period of time c 0 is the value of the pollution indicator just below the source of pollution g m 3 calculated from the mixing eq 3 the mixing equation can be written in the form 3 c 0 q ov c ov q r c r q ov q r where c 0 concentration of the substance in the water stream after mixing with the discharged waste water kg m 3 c ov concentration of the substance in the discharged wastewater kg m 3 c r concentration of the substance in the water flow kg m 3 q ov wastewater inflow m 3 s 1 q r discharge in the water flow m 3 s 1 example of the concentration calculation the starting point is eq 1 into which the determined values are substituted c c z c o c z 10 k 1 t 1 6389 5 87 1 6389 10 0 2 0 022 2 169 mg l where the outflow time along path x is calculated from t x u 34 2 31 0 1000 1 47 24 3600 0 022 d the model was verified for surface water quality in the lastomír control profile in the bod5 pollution indicator 3 2 characterization and analysis of environmental effects a stressor response profile for the purposes of the work the calculated values of the concentrations of pollutants from the modified streeter phelps equation exposure profile were used for the classification of surface water quality the classification of surface water quality is based on the characteristic value according to table 5 based on previous water quality standard in slovakia and the calculated statistical characteristics for the calculated concentrations of the pollution indicator the characteristic value of the calculated concentration from the modified streeter phelps equation was chosen as the reference value for the classification of surface water quality this value is the most unfavourable of all characteristics i e relevant for the assessment of environmental risks in the river basin subsequently the characteristic value of the pollution indicator bod 5 and n total was included in the water quality class according to the limit values of the indicator are presented in table 4 this evaluation and classification created a stressor response profile as the resulting water quality class is a response to the stressor pollutants the results achieved in the risk analysis phase are the basis for the river basin environmental risk characterization phase 3 3 risk characterization this phase is the final step in the assessment of environmental risks in the laborec river basin here the probability consequence and significance of adverse effects due to stressor exposure will be assessed from the previous assessment bod5 and total nitrogen were selected as risk indicators for the given river basin the source of the bod5 stressor is mainly point sources of pollution and nitrogen enters the surface water sources mainly from agricultural production the risk assessment includes the assessment of the environmental burden in the laborec river basin i e assessment and classification of point and diffuse sources of pollution there are 66 point sources of pollution in the laborec river basin the decisive indicator in this case is the production of wastewater in the bod5 indicator as a source of pollution the data were provided by slovak water management company a classification scale has been established for each source 1 bod5 production up to 50 t year 2 bod5 production 50 100 t year 3 bod5 production 100 500 t year 4 bod5 production over 500 t year point sources of pollution classified according to the mentioned methodology can be evaluated by a summary classification for individual sub basins according to the evaluated control profiles the summary classification is obtained as the sum of values from the point classification for point sources located in individual sub basins are presented in table 5 the summary point classification expresses the load of the laborec river with pollution from the point sources the most unfavourable influences are the sources vk humenné vk michalovce and evo vojany which produce the largest amount of wastewater in the bod5 indicator however the accumulation of even smaller sources is most burdened by the partial catchments laborec to road bridge strážske krivošťany laborec above the uh and laborec below the duša laborec the source of increased nitrogen concentrations in the surface water resources of a given river basin is mainly agricultural production the methodology for evaluating the source of this stressor is based on the size of the non forested area in a particular river basin which can be considered as having agricultural use or the urbanized area population without sewage systems the following classification scale was set for the evaluation 1 non forested area 0 25 2 non forested area 25 50 3 non forested area 50 75 4 non forested area 75 100 table 6 shows that more than 50 of the unforested area is in the lower part of the stream in the area of the east slovakian lowlands for this reason this area is more burdened by the main area source of pollution agricultural especially plant production the obtained results of the evaluation of pollution sources according to the chosen methodologies are the basis for the risk description table 7 shows that more than 50 of the unforested area is in the lower part of the stream in the area of the east slovakian lowlands for this reason this area is more burdened by the main area source of pollution agricultural especially plant production the obtained results of the evaluation of pollution sources according to the chosen methodologies are the basis for the risk description 3 3 1 risk description according to the risk definition mathematically expressed by relation 4 the risk expresses the probability of occurrence and at the same time the severity of the consequence effect of possible side effects risk is thus a function of two basic parameters probability p and consequence c the sign expresses the function according to the type of evaluation it can be a matrix or a product for practical purposes the methodology uses the procedure of semi quantitative evaluation the point method and calculation of risk index respectively the hazard coefficient according to the relationship 4 r p c to determine the risk index it is necessary to estimate the parameters probability and consequence a point method with four degrees of probability was chosen to classify the probability of the occurrence of an adverse effect deterioration of water quality in the stream the characteristics of the individual degrees of probability the frequency of risk and the temporal effect of the threat are given in table 7 according to the methodologies used to assess the stressor s resources the consequence of a negative phenomenon water pollution was classified into one of five categories according to the point method from very clear water 1 to very heavily polluted water 5 the starting point for determining the consequence category is the characteristic value of the water quality classification obtained from the stressor response profile for the selected indicator bod5 ntotal the combination of the probability parameter and the consequence of the adverse effect indicates the value of the risk evaluating the data in table 8 where p b is the probability of point pollution resulting classification from table 5 c b is the consequence of point pollution the resulting value of the stressor response profile p p is the probability of surface pollution resulting classification from table 6 c p is the consequence of surface pollution the resulting value of the stressor response profile 3 3 2 comprehensive evaluation the resulting risk index is expressed by relation 5 which can be further adjusted 5 r p b c b p p c p the acceptability of risk is assessed on the basis of table 9 where four levels are defined the calculated risk index determines the acceptability of the risk and the significance criteria for each river basin according to its classification within a certain point range the outputs of the risk characterization phase are therefore the risk acceptability table 9 and the risk index which are listed for the separate sub basins in table 10 the resulting values of risk indices for individual sub basins are shown in table 10 that presents summary of the environmental risk assessment in the laborec river basin there is an unacceptable risk in the lower part of the river basin the source of which is mainly agriculture and in the vicinity of humenné where the primary source is industry but also urbanization especially settlements without public sewerage risk characterized as acceptable is in the upper section of the laborec river basin as industrial production is minimal in this locality in terms of morphology this part of the catchment area is mountainous nízke beskydy and agriculture is not as intense as in the lower part of the laborec catchment area east slovakian lowland in the other mostly the middle part of the flow the risk can be characterized as mild to undesirable however we would like to emphasize that the area of the sub basins laborec below močidlom and laborec to road bridge in lastomír is significantly smaller and there is no accumulation of pollution sources when assessing these river basins together the risk would be characterized as unacceptable for this reason it is more appropriate to focus on the assessment of sub basins with approximately the same area geographic information systems are a suitable tool not only for water quality assessment and environmental risk assessment but especially for the graphical presentation of the results obtained see figure 6 risks for individual sub basins are marked in colour according to the risk scale table 9 based on the determined risk index table 10 the definition of a comprehensive risk assessment is the starting point for water managers to take measures to reduce environmental hazards which will consequently lead to an improvement in the quality of surface water in watercourses the proposed solution can be used for small catchments where there is no detailed initial data the streeter phelps model was used by long 2020 to estimate pollutant discharges based on the results of measuring the water quality parameter in stream channels in the case of several discharges of pollution the sources of pollution accumulated the proposed solution in conjunction with the use of gis tools may be subject to modification along with an increase in the output data especially in the field of information on spatial layers and variables fan et al 2015 based on the previous results to reduce the environmental risks in the river basin and subsequently improve the quality of surface water in the laborec it is possible to propose some of the technological technical and economic measures or their combination 3 4 discussion ecological risk assessment is a process that assesses potential risks that human activities pose on the ecosystems and their components kang et al 2018 as shown in this paper it is a multi stage task consisting in gathering the necessary data to assess the scale of exposure and to estimate the likely ecological effects this process included three basic phases which included first problem formulation then problem identification and risk analysis there are many methods of risk assessment in the literature which are used in many areas of human activity depending on the availability and type of data describing the system these methods can be divided into quantitative qualitative mixed quantitative qualitative methods and simulation methods using various scenarios tchórzewska cieślak et al 2015 gui et al 2015 landis et al 2017 wade et al 2021 environmental risk assessment is an increasingly used tool in integrated water resource management these were mainly analyzes performed to determine the risk of supplies and contamination of water resources which were a source of drinking water supply for the population diamantino et al 2007 teichmann and kuda 2015 abuzzer et al 2020 janoska and gruszecka kosowska 2020 in this study a quantitative method has been proposed which is based on measurable quantitative data including pollutant concentrations within the basic hydrographic unit which is the river basin the proposed method allowed for the determination of a specific numerical value of the risk which made it possible to compare the risk between individual regions this approach has been used around the world at various spatial scales and in various ways with source stressor and endpoint combinations hines and landis 2014 o brien et al 2018 the research was carried out in the laborec river catchment which has different natural conditions in the upper and lower parts of the catchment and is disproportionately burdened with economic activities an analysis of the available information has identified the main threats in the different catchment regions that affect water quality man made stressors have a direct negative impact on the regional ecological status of processes and the resulting losses of ecosystem services can be seen as potential threats to ecosystems wong et al 2015 xing et al 2020 in the case of the laborec river the most important threats affecting the water quality are caused by industrial point sources of the pollution and agricultural diffuse sources of the pollution activities quantitative comparison of pollutant concentrations indicated the most risky stressors pollutants in the river basin biochemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen the adopted point classification of the stressors sources of pollution in the river basin in accordance with the proposed methodology allows the quantification of the impacts on the environment it has been shown that individual sub catchments of the laborec river are characterized by a different risk level related to the magnitude of the pollution of the laborec river risk assessment is especially important for catchments subjected to the high anthropopressure where are many potential sources of municipal and industrial pollution the selected priority substances ni pb cd hg and specific non synthetic pollutants cu zn can be assumed as sources of stressors wiesner sękała et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 notes that an important feature of any water quality model is the simplified structure of the model and fewer input parameters are the most attractive features of this model the proposed methodology of environmental risk assessment can be used both in poorly controlled catchments and in catchments subjected to detailed water quality monitoring 4 conclusion the methodology of environmental risk assessment in river basins elaborated in the paper and the model of the modified streeter phelps equation are generally applicable for watercourses and their river basins the risk index helps to quantify the environmental burden which is the primary cause of the existence of environmental risks in a river basin the determination of the risk index of the assessed river basin and its classification into a risk scale according to the point method also determines the criteria of significance of the assessed river basin the first stage is a satisfactory situation where it can be stated that the risk is acceptable the second stage helps to terminate the assessment of the river basin on a preliminary basis but with a certain condition such as the establishment of a risk factor control etc the last two stages undesirable and unacceptable indicate that appropriate measures need to be taken in the river basin the point range expresses the priority according to which the measures are to be implemented the conclusion of the environmental risk assessment in the laborec river basin is the statement that the measures mentioned above would significantly help to improve the quality of surface waters many of these measures are gradually being implemented for example as part of the process of approximating our legislation with european union directives reducing the current pollution load of watercourses alone will not mean an immediate visible improvement in water quality but over time this change can be very significant the risk assessment process for river basin management scientifically elaborated in the paper has a wider application also in other areas of environmental engineering it can be used with any other issues dealing with environmental issues it represents a source of information on the degree of risk to humans and the ecosystem in relation to the existing state of environmental quality as well as the prediction of the state it provides a method of prioritizing problems in the area in relation to the quality of the environment with the recommendation of preferential spending of funds it indicates a method for assessing the degree of risk to humans and the ecosystem arising from specific existing as well as planned constructions activities and technologies but also from specific chemicals and preparations the risk assessment process presents a means of initiating the creation and implementation of measures to reduce risks from pollution in the water bodies and is the basis for the elaboration of proposals for measures to reduce the level of risk from pollution the scientific results of this research increase the understanding of water biota pollution interface and exploring how this knowledge can be used to regulate hydrological and ecological processes to enhance the carrying capacity especially of anthropogenically modified and polluted ecosystems declaration

valuable tool for water management since it can simulate the potential response of the aquatic system to changes such as the addition of organic pollution an increase in nutrient levels or water abstraction rates and changes in sewage treatment operations the negative effects of human activity on water quality are manifested both by the contamination of resources and by violation of the natural conditions of water circulation this study aims to determine the relationships between anthropogenic activities stressors and adverse effects based on previously acquired knowledge about the state of water quality in the laborec river and the sources of pollution in the river basin the exposure profile developed within this research is the output of an analysis of environmental risks in the studied river basin and is focused on an evaluation of the surface water quality in the laborec river the results from the evaluation are following risk is characterized as acceptable in the upper section of the laborec basin it can be characterized as moderate to undesirable in the middle part of the river basin and the risk is unacceptable in the lower part of the river basin mainly due to industry this results can identify the priority areas where measures for decreasing of the water pollution have to be done keywords risk assessment water quality laborec river slovakia 1 introduction over the past several decades many rivers and streams have been subjected to intense human pressure which has influenced the functioning of river ecosystems malmqvist and rundle 2002 kubiak wójcicka et al 2017 teurlincx et al 2019 rivers are the main source of water for the population agriculture and industry they are endangered by human activities which increases water pollution milanovic 2007 zhang et al 2012 bashar and fung 2020 water pollution is one of the most important environmental problems faced by water managers the solution to the problem may be based on various technologies and programs there is now a large selection of models developed for water quality simulation that have become useful and provide a good tool for planning and managing water quality erturk 2010 paca et al 2019 in the development of water quality models small river basins pose specific problems due to data scarcity a lack of major investments as a consequence of their minor importance and the large number of diverse inputs especially if these rivers flow through densely populated areas for these reasons it is difficult to adapt major water quality models which require more information regarding the river system than is often available in these cases it makes sense to use simple ad hoc models in order to derive crucial information about the river quality and to become part of a decision support system the complexity of water quality models covers a wide range from a simple streeter phelps model streeter and phelps 1925 with two fixed variables through swqm spreadsheet water quality model alabama department of environmental management 2001 based on the streeter phelps equation additional methods include qual2 hoang et al 2019 and similar tools describing in detail oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus cycles with about ten variables brown and barnwell 1987 hoang et al 2019 and ecosystem models that assess suspended insoluble substances algae zooplankton invertebrates plants and fish and modelling using artificial neural network techniques sarkar and pandey 2015 solgi et al 2017 the idea of using model structures that are appropriate for application and the available data was first advocated by halfon 1989 and beck 1987 pearl 1978 also noted that the tendency to prefer simple models is partly based on the notion that they are easier to calibrate and therefore more reliable as confirmed by snowling and kramer 2001 who showed that complex models are generally very sensitive and therefore difficult to identify and lindenschmidt 2006 who pointed out that the most complex model is not necessarily the most accurate on the other hand data scarcity may lead to heavily overdetermined calibration problems because the large number of adjustable parameters and the few experimental constraints make good fits almost guaranteed at least using mean parameter values european management strategies have tended to address single issues e g diffuse or point sources or particular regions e g upland or lowland areas wade 2001 there is no clear cut distinction between point sources or diffuse sources non point sources chapman 1996 in general with increasing discharge points sources of contaminants are diluted whereas diffuse sources show increased concentrations progressive urbanization and industrial development have also led to the increasing use of rivers for waste disposal activities abd elaziz et al 2020 abd elhamid et al 2020 the pollution arising from these and other sources such as the use of agricultural pesticides has led to an increasing need for rigorous assessment of river water quality zeleňáková and čarnogurská 2013 zeleňáková et al 2013 zeleňáková et al 2016 the complexity and components of such assessment programmes are defined by the uses of the water and local water quality requirements as well as a need to protect the aquatic environment from further degradation superimposed on these anthropogenic inputs an integrated management approach is required and environmental risk assessment is one of the effective possibilities the importance of this is acknowledged in the united states of america where an integrated approach was implemented through permit trading between diffuse and point source polluters epa 1999 in particular such an approach is needed to assess the likely impacts of land management and climatic change on eu polluted rivers an environmental risk assessment evaluates the potential adverse effects that human activities have on the plants and animals that make up an ecosystem was presented by zeleňáková and zvijáková 2017 the risk assessment process provides a way to develop organize and present scientific information so that it is relevant to environmental decisions when conducted for a particular place such as a river basin the environmental risk assessment process can be used to identify vulnerable and valued resources prioritize data collection activity and link human activities with their potential effects this paper presents an environmental risk assessment in a river basin due to the water quality in the river basin this paper aims to determine the relationships between anthropogenic activities stressors and adverse effects based on the sources of water pollution in the laborec river basin the exposure profile is focused on an evaluation of the surface water quality in the laborec river and the assessment of environmental risks in the river basin 2 material and methods the sources of environmental risks related to water quality in the river basins of eastern slovakia are primarily industrial and agricultural production which endanger water resources the main causes of the persistent unfavourable status in surface water quality in the area are considered to be the hydraulically insufficient qualitatively unsatisfactory and or a lack of treatment of wastewater produced in the area by point sources of pollution the high level of water contamination not only of surface water but also of groundwater due to extensive surface pollution which is caused by wastewater produced from the population without sewerage landfills intensive agricultural activity soil erosion and others the significant point sources of pollution in the area in question which have a direct impact on recipients through discharged wastewater in terms of quantity and nature 2 1 environmental risks assessment the methodology applied in this study is expressed in fig 1 the environmental risk assessment process consists of three main phases as depicted problem formulation risk analysis and risk characterization epa 1999 three additional compartments appear in the flow chart planning risk management and iterative monitoring and data acquisition during planning scientists and managers with input from stakeholders seek agreement on the focus scope and complexity of the assessment then the formal risk assessment process commences with problem formulation during which key questions conceptual models and an analysis plan are developed the analysis phase evaluates the exposure of the assessed resources to stressors and the relationship between stressor levels and environmental effects during risk characterization the risks are described and if possible estimated quantitatively forming the basis for the assessment s conclusions and a report monitoring and new data acquisition may occur in support of any of these phases wherever needed after completion the risk assessment s findings are communicated to managers who then determine a course of action epa 1999 2 2 study area the laborec catchment area where the mentioned conditions are most pronounced was selected as the model area for the needs of this work the characteristics of the river basin are elaborated as following the laborec river basin fig 2 is bordered on the north by the state border with poland which is also the ridge that forms the dividing line separating the baltic and black sea basins in the east this area is delimited by the state border with ukraine in the south by the left hand bank of the latorica and in the west by the basic catchment area of the ondava the basin is situated in the north eastern part of eastern slovakia the largest part of the laborec catchment area is located in the medzilaborce humenné michalovce snina and sobrance districts the total area of the laborec basin is 4 522 5 km2 the laborec springs in the nízke beskydy mountains at an altitude of 682 m above sea level and is 129 km long it receives mostly left side well developed tributaries of the výrava udava and cirocha which form a fan of streams above humenné next the river bypasses the vihorlat mountains and flows into the lowlands where its slope is reduced after a long section with no tributaries it merges with the large left hand tributary the uh river most of which is located in transcarpathian ukraine 11 613 km2 which is 61 of the area after the connection with the uh the enclosed modified laborec flows all the way to the latorica before the mouth the duša river flows into it the natural conditions in the upper and lower parts of the study area are quite different in nature but a common feature of both parts is their significant deterioration the catchment area is disproportionately burdened by economic activity especially in the central part the predominant part of the anthropogenic interventions have occurred in the east slovakian lowlands where in the flat and hilly parts the vegetation cover was first removed the increase in soil pollution due to oil contamination čierna nad tisou is also characteristic but also due to outputs from industrial plants concentrated in the middle part of the catchment area around strážské michalovce and humenné these facts worsen the conditions for maintaining the vegetation cover which plays an irreplaceable role in the water cycle parts of the forest stands are also damaged by emissions which is an undesirable phenomenon in the flysch area where the forest functions all the more strongly as a runoff regulator deterioration of natural conditions has begun to manifest itself in recent years especially with the outflow of large amounts of water as in the upper part of the basin where there have been rapidly occurring floods there has been an increase in the transport of sediments and intensive clogging of reservoirs as well as the lower sections of streams these phenomena should be seen as signs of a disturbance of the natural balance due to current land use trends if such trends continue serious disturbances to the natural renewal of water resources may occur in the whole river basin in the future the most conflicted areas those with a high anthropogenic load can be found in the area of larger settlements namely in michalovce and humenné the load on the area is at the limit of the environment s carrying capacity and reducing the intensity of anthropogenic activities is recommended 2 3 sources of pollution problem formulation phase pollution decreases biodiversity in rivers and is a negative factor mainly for fishes and the bio habitats of rivers the aim of the environmental risk assessment in the laborec river basin is to characterize the sources of pollution affecting the quality of the water in the basin the essence of this evaluation phase is the selection of endpoints and the creation of a conceptual model for the needs of the next phase of evaluation risk analysis data were provided by the slovak water management company the evaluated period covers five years from 2015 to 2019 2 3 1 point sources of pollution there are 66 points of wastewater discharge in the laborec river basin mainly from industry mining education health care social care homes dss and public sewers vk the sources of pollution in the laborec river basin include public sewers of which there are 20 industrial production also has a significant share in the pollution with 22 sources of pollution from industrial production registered in the river basin other sources of pollution 24 include agriculture and forestry wholesale and retail trade hotels and restaurants public administration and defence education health and social work the total amount of pollution discharged from point sources of pollution in the laborec basin according to the bod5 indicator is expressed in fig 3 discharged pollution expressed by the bod5 indicator from public sewers makes up 49 41 of the total production of resources in the river basin the reason is insufficient wastewater treatment from public sewers as well as the inability of existing wastewater treatment plants to treat the entire amount of inflowing wastewater the discharged pollution from industry expressed by the bod5 indicator is 50 31 this high percentage is mainly influenced by the discharge of cooling water from chemko strážske and evo vojany the remaining 0 28 belongs to other sources of pollution which do not contribute to a significant increase in the concentration of bod5 in the stream a longitudinal profile of the river fig 4 presents an overview of the main point sources of pollution of the laborec watercourse as well as control profiles to the left in fig 4 in which the water quality is monitored and the main tributaries of the laborec in addition to point sources of pollution diffuse sources of pollution also contribute to the environmental risks of the river basin the main sources of surface pollution in the laborec basin are agriculture plant and animal production silage pits forestry logging afforestation construction of forest roads population without sewage systems septic tanks outlets of domestic sewers flushing from urban areas rainfall relief of sewer networks surface flushes landfilling solid waste landfills wastewater irrigation sludge landfilling from wwtps septic tanks hazardous waste landfills construction construction of motorways bridges and roads mines surface and deep mines heaps hydrology stream modification dredging construction of dams flow regulation other atmospheric deposition accidents seepage from underground storage containers more than half of all pollution in the surface waters of the laborec river basin comes from surface sources these include diffuse sources that do not discharge wastewater directly but do degrade water quality in the laborec basin point and area sources of pollution cause a significant environmental burden the overall evaluation is documented in table 1 in as many as 14 of the 66 registered wastewater outlets non compliance with the emission limits for wastewater discharge set by a water management decision is observed and in the three other cases these are sources that discharge wastewater without treatment waste from plant and animal production as a surface source of pollution also contributes greatly to polluting the river where undesirable substances enter the water through erosion and flushing 2 3 2 diffuse sources of pollution in order to reduce the environmental burden of the laborec river basin more effective measures to protect surface waters need to be taken in the future the quality of surface waters in the laborec watercourse has long been monitored in control profiles for the needs of this work seven control profiles were selected for which it was possible to obtain the necessary data see fig 4 left the selection of evaluation endpoints is based on a comparison of pollutant concentrations with the limits given in legislative and standards the following pollutants are considered in the current study biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and total nitrogen ntotal in this part of the problem formulation the relationships between anthropogenic activities stressors and adverse effects are based on previously acquired knowledge about the state of water quality in the stream and the sources of pollution in the river basin the conceptual model which is presented in fig 5 was developed as part of the risk analysis plan 3 results and discussion 3 1 risk analysis this phase involves the analysis of exposure and environmental effects which requires the application of water quality modelling methods the output of risk analysis consists of the summary profiles that are needed in the risk characterization phase 3 1 1 exposure characterization and analysis exposure profile the exposure profile which is the output of the analysis of environmental risks in a river basin is focused on evaluating the quality of surface water in a stream for the purposes of this work a method of water quality assessment using modelling was used the model is based on a modified streeter phelps equation water quality models introduce the value of basic pollution in accordance with the actual state of the environment the modified streeter phelps equation applies to one source of pollution 1 c c z c 0 c z 10 k 1 t where c value of the pollution indicator e g bod5 at a distance x from the source pollution g m 3 c z value of basic pollution g m 3 c 0 value of the pollution indicator just below the source of pollution g m 3 k 1 coefficient of formal first order kinetics d 1 t outflow time along path x d the values of the basic pollution cz can be determined using the equation 2 log c z a b log p z c log 1 p o p where p catchment area km2 p z catchment area without forests approximately agricultural land km2 po number of inhabitants in the river basin a b c coefficients the models are characterized in that the river network is divided into sections by control profiles which are further divided into sub sections by nodes a node is a place where the quantity and quality of water changes by jumping river tributary wastewater discharge in a broader sense a control or interest profile is also considered a node in the control profile the concentrations of the bod5 pollution indicator were calculated on the basis of the model of the modified streeter phelps eq 1 the input value for the model was the value of the basic pollution cz calculated from eq 2 the determination of basic pollution cz was based on the average values of measured bod5 concentrations in seven control profiles on the laborec watercourse in the period 2015 2019 on the area of agricultural land the number of inhabitants in the sub basin for the relevant control profile the values are presented in table 2 and logarithmic values at table 3 the input value for the model was the value of the basic pollution cz calculated from eq 2 the determination of basic pollution cz was based on the average values of measured bod5 concentrations in seven control profiles on the laborec watercourse in the period 2015 2019 on the area of agricultural land the number of inhabitants in the sub basin for the relevant control profile table 2 and the logarithmic values table 3 eq 2 was solved by regression with two independent variables 3 the resulting regression coefficients a 0 018295 b 0 036536 c 0 035068 were calculated for bod5 by means of which it is possible to determine the value of basic pollution cz by substituting into relation 2 log c z 0 018295 0 036536 3 431 0 035068 2 029 0 2148 the resulting value of the basic pollution is cz 1 6398 mg l bod5 this value can be considered as authoritative for the laborec river basin or its lower part if necessary the basic pollution value can be calculated specifically for each sub basin according to the above procedure to determine the concentration c of the bod5 indicator a modified streeter phelps eq 1 was used taking into account the values k 1 0 2 d 1 is the coefficient of formal first order kinetics a value obtained from the literature t is the outflow time along path x a value calculated from the relation t x u x is the path m distance e g wastewater discharge points from the wwtp and the control profile u is the flow rate m s 1 in which case the average rate over a period of time c 0 is the value of the pollution indicator just below the source of pollution g m 3 calculated from the mixing eq 3 the mixing equation can be written in the form 3 c 0 q ov c ov q r c r q ov q r where c 0 concentration of the substance in the water stream after mixing with the discharged waste water kg m 3 c ov concentration of the substance in the discharged wastewater kg m 3 c r concentration of the substance in the

for surface water quality in the lastomír control profile in the bod5 pollution indicator 3 2 characterization and analysis of environmental effects a stressor response profile for the purposes of the work the calculated values of the concentrations of pollutants from the modified streeter phelps equation exposure profile were used for the classification of surface water quality the classification of surface water quality is based on the characteristic value according to table 5 based on previous water quality standard in slovakia and the calculated statistical characteristics for the calculated concentrations of the pollution indicator the characteristic value of the calculated concentration from the modified streeter phelps equation was chosen as the reference value for the classification of surface water quality this value is the most unfavourable of all characteristics i e relevant for the assessment of environmental risks in the river basin subsequently the characteristic value of the pollution indicator bod 5 and n total was included in the water quality class according to the limit values of the indicator are presented in table 4 this evaluation and classification created a stressor response profile as the resulting water quality class is a response to the stressor pollutants the results achieved in the risk analysis phase are the basis for the river basin environmental risk characterization phase 3 3 risk characterization this phase is the final step in the assessment of environmental risks in the laborec river basin here the probability consequence and significance of adverse effects due to stressor exposure will be assessed from the previous assessment bod5 and total nitrogen were selected as risk indicators for the given river basin the source of the bod5 stressor is mainly point sources of pollution and nitrogen enters the surface water sources mainly from agricultural production the risk assessment includes the assessment of the environmental burden in the laborec river basin i e assessment and classification of point and diffuse sources of pollution there are 66 point sources of pollution in the laborec river basin the decisive indicator in this case is the production of wastewater in the bod5 indicator as a source of pollution the data were provided by slovak water management company a classification scale has been established for each source 1 bod5 production up to 50 t year 2 bod5 production 50 100 t year 3 bod5 production 100 500 t year 4 bod5 production over 500 t year point sources of pollution classified according to the mentioned methodology can be evaluated by a summary classification for individual sub basins according to the evaluated control profiles the summary classification is obtained as the sum of values from the point classification for point sources located in individual sub basins are presented in table 5 the summary point classification expresses the load of the laborec river with pollution from the point sources the most unfavourable influences are the sources vk humenné vk michalovce and evo vojany which produce the largest amount of wastewater in the bod5 indicator however the accumulation of even smaller sources is most burdened by the partial catchments laborec to road bridge strážske krivošťany laborec above the uh and laborec below the duša laborec the source of increased nitrogen concentrations in the surface water resources of a given river basin is mainly agricultural production the methodology for evaluating the source of this stressor is based on the size of the non forested area in a particular river basin which can be considered as having agricultural use or the urbanized area population without sewage systems the following classification scale was set for the evaluation 1 non forested area 0 25 2 non forested area 25 50 3 non forested area 50 75 4 non forested area 75 100 table 6 shows that more than 50 of the unforested area is in the lower part of the stream in the area of the east slovakian lowlands for this reason this area is more burdened by the main area source of pollution agricultural especially plant production the obtained results of the evaluation of pollution sources according to the chosen methodologies are the basis for the risk description table 7 shows that more than 50 of the unforested area is in the lower part of the stream in the area of the east slovakian lowlands for this reason this area is more burdened by the main area source of pollution agricultural especially plant production the obtained results of the evaluation of pollution sources according to the chosen methodologies are the basis for the risk description 3 3 1 risk description according to the risk definition mathematically expressed by relation 4 the risk expresses the probability of occurrence and at the same time the severity of the consequence effect of possible side effects risk is thus a function of two basic parameters probability p and consequence c the sign expresses the function according to the type of evaluation it can be a matrix or a product for practical purposes the methodology uses the procedure of semi quantitative evaluation the point method and calculation of risk index respectively the hazard coefficient according to the relationship 4 r p c to determine the risk index it is necessary to estimate the parameters probability and consequence a point method with four degrees of probability was chosen to classify the probability of the occurrence of an adverse effect deterioration of water quality in the stream the characteristics of the individual degrees of probability the frequency of risk and the temporal effect of the threat are given in table 7 according to the methodologies used to assess the stressor s resources the consequence of a negative phenomenon water pollution was classified into one of five categories according to the point method from very clear water 1 to very heavily polluted water 5 the starting point for determining the consequence category is the characteristic value of the water quality classification obtained from the stressor response profile for the selected indicator bod5 ntotal the combination of the probability parameter and the consequence of the adverse effect indicates the value of the risk evaluating the data in table 8 where p b is the probability of point pollution resulting classification from table 5 c b is the consequence of point pollution the resulting value of the stressor response profile p p is the probability of surface pollution resulting classification from table 6 c p is the consequence of surface pollution the resulting value of the stressor response profile 3 3 2 comprehensive evaluation the resulting risk index is expressed by relation 5 which can be further adjusted 5 r p b c b p p c p the acceptability of risk is assessed on the basis of table 9 where four levels are defined the calculated risk index determines the acceptability of the risk and the significance criteria for each river basin according to its classification within a certain point range the outputs of the risk characterization phase are therefore the risk acceptability table 9 and the risk index which are listed for the separate sub basins in table 10 the resulting values of risk indices for individual sub basins are shown in table 10 that presents summary of the environmental risk assessment in the laborec river basin there is an unacceptable risk in the lower part of the river basin the source of which is mainly agriculture and in the vicinity of humenné where the primary source is industry but also urbanization especially settlements without public sewerage risk characterized as acceptable is in the upper section of the laborec river basin as industrial production is minimal in this locality in terms of morphology this part of the catchment area is mountainous nízke beskydy and agriculture is not as intense as in the lower part of the laborec catchment area east slovakian lowland in the other mostly the middle part of the flow the risk can be characterized as mild to undesirable however we would like to emphasize that the area of the sub basins laborec below močidlom and laborec to road bridge in lastomír is significantly smaller and there is no accumulation of pollution sources when assessing these river basins together the risk would be characterized as unacceptable for this reason it is more appropriate to focus on the assessment of sub basins with approximately the same area geographic information systems are a suitable tool not only for water quality assessment and environmental risk assessment but especially for the graphical presentation of the results obtained see figure 6 risks for individual sub basins are marked in colour according to the risk scale table 9 based on the determined risk index table 10 the definition of a comprehensive risk assessment is the starting point for water managers to take measures to reduce environmental hazards which will consequently lead to an improvement in the quality of surface water in watercourses the proposed solution can be used for small catchments where there is no detailed initial data the streeter phelps model was used by long 2020 to estimate pollutant discharges based on the results of measuring the water quality parameter in stream channels in the case of several discharges of pollution the sources of pollution accumulated the proposed solution in conjunction with the use of gis tools may be subject to modification along with an increase in the output data especially in the field of information on spatial layers and variables fan et al 2015 based on the previous results to reduce the environmental risks in the river basin and subsequently improve the quality of surface water in the laborec it is possible to propose some of the technological technical and economic measures or their combination 3 4 discussion ecological risk assessment is a process that assesses potential risks that human activities pose on the ecosystems and their components kang et al 2018 as shown in this paper it is a multi stage task consisting in gathering the necessary data to assess the scale of exposure and to estimate the likely ecological effects this process included three basic phases which included first problem formulation then problem identification and risk analysis there are many methods of risk assessment in the literature which are used in many areas of human activity depending on the availability and type of data describing the system these methods can be divided into quantitative qualitative mixed quantitative qualitative methods and simulation methods using various scenarios tchórzewska cieślak et al 2015 gui et al 2015 landis et al 2017 wade et al 2021 environmental risk assessment is an increasingly used tool in integrated water resource management these were mainly analyzes performed to determine the risk of supplies and contamination of water resources which were a source of drinking water supply for the population diamantino et al 2007 teichmann and kuda 2015 abuzzer et al 2020 janoska and gruszecka kosowska 2020 in this study a quantitative method has been proposed which is based on measurable quantitative data including pollutant concentrations within the basic hydrographic unit which is the river basin the proposed method allowed for the determination of a specific numerical value of the risk which made it possible to compare the risk between individual regions this approach has been used around the world at various spatial scales and in various ways with source stressor and endpoint combinations hines and landis 2014 o brien et al 2018 the research was carried out in the laborec river catchment which has different natural conditions in the upper and lower parts of the catchment and is disproportionately burdened with economic activities an analysis of the available information has identified the main threats in the different catchment regions that affect water quality man made stressors have a direct negative impact on the regional ecological status of processes and the resulting losses of ecosystem services can be seen as potential threats to ecosystems wong et al 2015 xing et al 2020 in the case of the laborec river the most important threats affecting the water quality are caused by industrial point sources of the pollution and agricultural diffuse sources of the pollution activities quantitative comparison of pollutant concentrations indicated the most risky stressors pollutants in the river basin biochemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen the adopted point classification of the stressors sources of pollution in the river basin in accordance with the proposed methodology allows the quantification of the impacts on the environment it has been shown that individual sub catchments of the laborec river are characterized by a different risk level related to the magnitude of the pollution of the laborec river risk assessment is especially important for catchments subjected to the high anthropopressure where are many potential sources of municipal and industrial pollution the selected priority substances ni pb cd hg and specific non synthetic pollutants cu zn can be assumed as sources of stressors wiesner sękała et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 notes that an important feature of any water quality model is the simplified structure of the model and fewer input parameters are the most attractive features of this model the proposed methodology of environmental risk assessment can be used both in poorly controlled catchments and in catchments subjected to detailed water quality monitoring 4 conclusion the methodology of environmental risk assessment in river basins elaborated in the paper and the model of the modified streeter phelps equation are generally applicable for watercourses and their river basins the risk index helps to quantify the environmental burden which is the primary cause of the existence of environmental risks in a river basin the determination of the risk index of the assessed river basin and its classification into a risk scale according to the point method also determines the criteria of significance of the assessed river basin the first stage is a satisfactory situation where it can be stated that the risk is acceptable the second stage helps to terminate the assessment of the river basin on a preliminary basis but with a certain condition such as the establishment of a risk factor control etc the last two stages undesirable and unacceptable indicate that appropriate measures need to be taken in the river basin the point range expresses the priority according to which the measures are to be implemented the conclusion of the environmental risk assessment in the laborec river basin is the statement that the measures mentioned above would significantly help to improve the quality of surface waters many of these measures are gradually being implemented for example as part of the process of approximating our legislation with european union directives reducing the current pollution load of watercourses alone will not mean an immediate visible improvement in water quality but over time this change can be very significant the risk assessment process for river basin management scientifically elaborated in the paper has a wider application also in other areas of environmental engineering it can be used with any other issues dealing with environmental issues it represents a source of information on the degree of risk to humans and the ecosystem in relation to the existing state of environmental quality as well as the prediction of the state it provides a method of prioritizing problems in the area in relation to the quality of the environment with the recommendation of preferential spending of funds it indicates a method for assessing the degree of risk to humans and the ecosystem arising from specific existing as well as planned constructions activities and technologies but also from specific chemicals and preparations the risk assessment process presents a means of initiating the creation and implementation of measures to reduce risks from pollution in the water bodies and is the basis for the elaboration of proposals for measures to reduce the level of risk from pollution the scientific results of this research increase the understanding of water biota pollution interface and exploring how this knowledge can be used to regulate hydrological and ecological processes to enhance the carrying capacity especially of anthropogenically modified and polluted ecosystems declaration

987,the article presents predictive estimates of changes in river water resources in eleven economic regions of the russian federation for the period of 2030 and 2050 based on the use of river runoff data of the atmospheric and ocean general circulation models aogcm of the cmip5 project an overview of the design schemes of the aogcm river runoff used in the research is made the methodology uses an ensemble approach the predictive estimates were carried out for two forecast periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in relation to the period 1981 2000 which was chosen as the base one the calculations were made on the basis of an ensemble of 24 selected models for both the moderately aggressive rcp4 5 scenario and the hard rcp8 5 scenario the results obtained were averaged over 20 year periods and compared with the corresponding values for the period 1981 2000 according to the results obtained in the coming decades there is no reason to expect any significant changes in river flow as a result of climate change for most of the country s territory a slight increase in annual runoff is most likely which is within the limits of its natural variability the most abundant river water resources will be the asian part of the russian federation and the adjacent eastern part of the european territory of russia the most problematic from the point of view of water resources provision will be the central black earth north caucasus and volga economic regions there will be more water in those regions where it is sufficient and less where it is most needed it should be noted that the technique presented in this article is considered by the authors primarily as one of the alternative forecasting methods that must be used in conjunction with other accepted methods however given the continuous process of improving the aogcms as well as the quality of the information they provide this approach should be considered as one of the most promising keywords predictive modeling climate change cmip5 economic regions of the russian federation river water resources 1 introduction reliable water supply for the population and sectors of the economy is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of any state when developing a strategy for the rational use and protection of water resources planning and implementing expensive water management measures it is necessary to have scientifically grounded estimates of the likely changes in water resources and the water regime of rivers in the future under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors the complexity of solving these issues for the territory of the russian federation is largely due to the peculiarities of climatic changes over the past few decades since the late 1970s early 1980s the consequences of the global warming process have been clearly manifested in the country an increase in surface air temperature in most of the country especially intense in the winter months for temperate and northern latitudes roshydromet 2014 2019 changes in the water regime of rivers frolova et al 2018 most pronounced in the increase in the winter component of river runoff georgievsky et al 2014 georgievsky 2016 redistribution of seasonal precipitation kokorev and sherstiukov 2005 anisimov and kokorev 2016 an increase in the number of hazardous phenomena associated with water frolov 2014 georgievsky 2015 etc in this regard one of the most important problems facing hydrologists is the assessment of the likely changes in river water resources in the future this is especially important for the economic regions of russia since initially the economic zoning is intended for the territorial organization of the national economy and justification of the rational location of production the improvement of its specializations and the socio economic development of both a separate economic region and the entire country as a whole the article provides a methodology for predictive assessments of changes in river water resources for the prospect of 2030 and 2050 based on the direct use of river runoff data from the atmospheric and ocean general circulation models of the cmip5 project aogcm the authors began to develop this technique more than 10 years ago starting from the data on the river flow of the previous project cmip3 shiklomanov et al 2008 subsequently the methodology with the advent of new data cmip5 project and new approaches to probable climate changes in the future rcp scenarios wayne 2013 was gradually refined and improved and the results obtained from it were used as one of the alternative methods for forecasting river water resources in various budgetary budgetary themes of roshydromet and contractual research works carried out by the state hydrological institute www hydrology ru the final stage in the development of this methodology was the forecast estimates of changes in river water resources of the largest rivers of the russian federation 35 largest catchments were used in the studies presented in georgievsky and golovanov 2019 it should be noted that the technique presented in this article is considered by the authors primarily as one of the alternative forecasting methods that must be used in conjunction with other accepted methods however given the continuous process of improving the aogcms as well as the quality of the information they provide project cmip6 this approach should be considered as one of the most promising 2 economic regions of russian federation economic regions are territories within which a specialized economy is formed and developed which is a part of the national economy of the russian federation and is interconnected with other parts of it by the exchange of goods produced in them and other economic relations economic zoning is the basis of the territorial management of the national economy of russia currently russia is divided into 11 large economic regions northern northwestern central central black earth volga volga vyatka north caucasus ural west siberian east siberian and far eastern the kaliningrad region is not included in any economic region and is endowed with the status of a special economic zone figures 1 and 2 show the location of the economic regions of the russian federation and table 1 shows their main characteristics below is a brief description of the potential reserves for sustainable development of each major economic region according to the ministry of economic development of the russian federation http economy gov ru en home taking into account the current economic situation see table 1 morozova et al 2017 the current and future problems of the stability of the regions of the central economic region are specific since there is no possibility here to increase generating capacities it is difficult to sell the products of industries specializing in foreign and domestic markets the stability of the economy here is largely due to the presence of the capital which is attractive to investors the main priority areas of development for the central region are termination of the decline in production stabilization and growth of production conversion of the defense complex development of industrial social infrastructure completion of agrarian reforms in agriculture reconstruction and re equipment of enterprises introduction of the latest technologies capable of producing environmentally friendly products development of industrial and social infrastructure the central black earth economic region has unique reserves of iron ores a powerful industrial potential and a developed agro industrial complex have been created therefore the potential for improving the socio economic situation here includes the restructuring of the defense industries and civil engineering stabilization of the mining and metallurgical complex and chemical industry enterprises sustainable energy supply to the region including through the development of nuclear energy strengthening the agro industrial complex improving the living conditions of the population ensuring its environmental safety etc the east siberian economic region possesses unique deposits of non ferrous metals nickel copper molybdenum cobalt lead zinc iron ores coal including coking coal etc it produces 17 of all electricity generated in the country 74 of aluminum and etc for a number of reasons the regions of eastern siberia cannot be guided by large investments from outside the problems of building the potential for the sustainability of the functioning of the economy will have to be resolved taking into account the fact that according to forecasts in the next few years imbalances in the economic complex will increase the degree of depreciation of fixed assets and the lag of the region from the average russian level in terms of the main indicators of the social sphere the far eastern economic region has been in deep crisis for a long time the economic stability of this region is possible if a set of urgent measures is taken to significantly improve the situation providing the region with fuel and energy resources regulating energy and transport tariffs removing the problem of non payments optimizing inter budgetary relations etc further growth of economic potential is associated with the use of reserves a relative decrease in the energy and transport components in the cost of production increased fishing and seafood production development of transport infrastructure multiple expansion of the business sector network suspension of the outflow of the population etc prospects for the sustainability of the economy of the regions that make up the northern economic region lie in the available opportunities to increase the production of the most valuable natural resources to develop the fuel and energy complex the potential of such a territory is determined by the mineral resource base the dynamics of prices in foreign markets the situation and solvency of the consumer regions the environmental safety of geological exploration and operational work etc the north caucasus plays an important role in the country s economy and protects its strategic interests there are unique natural resources and favorable climatic conditions here it can be recommended restructuring of the economy with a reduction in the share of the region s heavy engineering chemicals and petrochemicals as well as the development of production equipment for the agricultural sector power and food processing industry construction industry prospects for the sustainability of the economy of the regions of the north western economic region are associated with the implementation of their special geopolitical position the development of infrastructure transport and communications the conversion of military industrial complex capacities the restructuring of the timber processing complex and an increase in the share of high availability products in the total volume of manufactured products the volga economic region is a large region with industrial and agricultural specialization the transition to sustainable economic growth is possible here by attracting additional financial resources developing exports by enterprises of the chemical and petrochemical industries increasing the capacity of mechanical engineering as well as converting military industrial complex enterprises the guarantors of economic revival are the development of the resource base of the oil industry additional exploration and commissioning of new fields the ural economic region is distinguished by significant industrial and scientific potential the availability of highly qualified personnel and sufficient natural resources however most of the constituent entities of the federation included in this economic region are subsidized the potential for sustainability of the region s economy is determined primarily by the prospects for the modernization of industrial complexes the conversion of military industrial complex enterprises and the implementation of large investment projects in the future it is also rational to produce electricity at a rate exceeding the average russian one in the volga vyatka economic region there are no highly efficient fuel and energy and mineral resources therefore the sustainability of the economy can be ensured through a relative reduction in fuel and energy consumption stabilization and development of agro industrial production and improvement of socio economic conditions of life in the countryside development of enterprises through their technological re equipment and reconstruction increasing the competitiveness of products the west siberian economic region accounts for most of the oil production more than 90 of natural gas the oil and gas complex of western siberia largely guarantees the energy security of the russian federation and provides most of the foreign exchange earnings the increase in the sustainability pace and quality of the region s development according to experts is due to provision of the fuel and energy complex fec with highly efficient equipment introduction of technologies for deep processing of fuel and energy and mineral resources commissioning of capacities for the extraction and production of iron and lead ore stabilization of electricity production and covering its deficit by means of transportation from eastern siberia the development of the machine building complex at a rate exceeding the average for the russian federation strengthening of the region s specialization in the production of advanced polymer materials as can be seen from the above in each region there are certain economic problems as well as possible measures for their solution of course reliable water supply in the near future based on a reliable assessment of the likely changes in river water resources in the future will not solve all the identified problems but it will undoubtedly make a certain contribution to the economic development of regions and the country as a whole 3 current situation with water supply in the regions of the russian federation one of the tasks outlined in the water strategy of the russian federation is to eliminate the shortage of water resources in certain regions of russia to ensure the socio economic development of the country water strategy 2012 despite the decrease in the volume of water use in russia as a whole over the past three decades from 95 4 km3 per year in 1990 to 53 km3 per year in 2018 babkin and balonishnikova 2018 there are currently problems of water scarcity and low water availability in a number of regions an analysis of the current dynamics of water resources and the tendency for a decrease in water use in russia testifies to a quite favorable situation with water supply in the country as a whole since over the past 30 years the specific water availability per inhabitant has noticeably increased however in the regions the situation with water supply is ambiguous according to the estimates of the state hydrological institute some regions in the volga don kuban terek sunzha sura and ural river basins experience the highest anthropogenic load on water resources the ratio of water withdrawal and water resources of a water body where water is taken from and where it is discharged after use in years with average river runoff low water availability is observed in a number of subjects of the central central black earth volga north caucasus ural and even west siberian economic regions the latest assessments of the water availability of the subjects belonging to the category with low water availability at the level of 2019 are presented in table 2 the analysis of the dynamics of water availability values for the long term period 2005 2019 gives reason to believe that there is a high probability of a further decrease in water availability in those subjects of the russian federation in which there are currently problems of water shortage 4 data runoff data of cmip5 project models the cmip5 project includes over 60 aogcms the main objective of the project was to scientifically substantiate the preparation of the 5th assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc a detailed description of the project is presented in tailor et al 2012 modeling data provided by the aogcms participating in the project is available for download through the data portal http pcmdi9 llnl gov each aogcm is a set of models of interacting climate systems the calculation of the river runoff is carried out in the earth s surface climatic system which includes the surface of the continents with its hydrological system inland water bodies swamps rivers etc and the soil layer with groundwater the standardized set of computational variables of climatic models includes two parameters characterizing river runoff total river runoff total runoff flux mrro and surface runoff surface runoff flux mrros http www pcmdi llnl gov ipcc ipcc output requirements htm analyzing the information on river runoff provided in the framework of the cmip5 project it was revealed that out of more than 60 models participating in the project only 29 provide runoff data in full volume for carrying out research first of all we were interested in data for the base period 1981 2000 as well as for two forecast periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 for two scenarios of climate change in the future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for comparison at the previous stage of the project cmip3 no more than 10 models provided information on runoff at the first stage of research the authors carried out a comprehensive analysis of the main schemes for calculating the river runoff of the aogcm of the cmip5 project see table 3 it was found that the calculation schemes in different models differ significantly nevertheless it can be noted that the most frequently analyzed models use different versions of the topmodel model developed by k beven beven and kirkby 1979 topmodel is a well known and widely used distributed precipitation runoff model that uses river basin topography as input the calculation schemes of aogcm also include blocks for calculating the total evaporation including transpiration as well as soil freezing and the process of accumulation and melting of snow cover a more detailed description of the schemes for calculating river flow is presented by the authors in georgievsky and golovanov 2015 analysis of the calculated river runoff schemes shows that this component of the aogcm is in the process of constant development after loading and processing information on the river flow the quality of these data was verified the verification was carried out in several stages first the average long term model river runoff for the base period 1981 2000 was compared with the long term average values of the actual runoff of the main rivers of the russian federation see table 4 additionally the spatial distribution of the aogcm runoff over the territory of russia was analyzed then the adequacy presence of negative or unrealistic runoff values etc of the simulated future runoff changes was tested for each of the forecast scenarios i e unrealistic values were identified if according to any of the validation tests the incorrect provision of data on the river flow of a particular aogcm was revealed the model was excluded from further studies as a result of the verification performed five models were eliminated and further analysis was carried out on the basis of data from the 24 remaining aogcms also during the validation it was revealed that the values of the surface runoff mrros are significantly underestimated in comparison with the actual runoff as well as the values of the total runoff mrro which is more consistent with the real river runoff integrating both surface and underground components and which was used for further analysis analyzing the results presented in table 4 it can be concluded that the most significant discrepancies more than 100 in the river runoff were obtained for four basins don ural irtysh and selenga where there are small values of the runoff layer less than 60 mm selenga 70 mm the simulated runoff in these basins is significantly overestimated secondly there is also a significant underestimation of the river runoff values in the basins where a significant part of the flow is formed in the mountains kuban terek and sulak this is probably due to the coarse spatial resolution and the underestimation of snow and glacier melt in these mountainous regions the ensemble river runoff values for the entire largest river basins in russia neva volga severnaya dvina ob yenisei lena amur with the exception of the pechora are close to the observed runoff there is an overestimation of the runoff for the basins of the yama indirigka and kolyma rivers located in the north east of the asian part of the country 5 method a methodology of assessment of probable changes in river water resources in the future because climatic models have different spatial resolution from 0 95 x1 25 for cesm1 bgc to 2 8 2 8 for bcc csm1 1 canesm2 miroc esm etc the runoff data of each aogcm were interpolated with the help of specially developed software into a common grid with resolution 0 5 x 0 5 thus a database of initial information was created which includes grid data for each model for the historical and forecast periods for each of the forecast scenarios spatial coverage of the unified data grid is from 14 to 82 n and 0 192 e the interpolation was carried out in a simple way the nearest model value was assigned to each specific grid point on the basis of the obtained regular grid matrices monthly values of the runoff layer for 11 economic regions of the russian federation were calculated by averaging over the territory of their basins from the monthly values obtained in this way the values of the annual runoff layers were calculated for all models which were then used to estimate the ensemble averaged for 24 aogcms values of the annual runoff layers the calculations were carried out for two forecast periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in relation to the period 1981 2000 which was chosen as the base one the calculations were made for both the moderately aggressive rcp4 5 scenario and the hard rcp8 5 scenario the results obtained were averaged over 20 year periods and compared with the corresponding values for the period 1981 2000 as noted above the forecast projections rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used as climatic scenarios which are forecast projections of climate change in the future depending on the options for radiative forcing on the atmosphere in the future rcp4 5 is a moderately aggressive scenario developed by the minicam global change assessment model group at the pacific northwest national laboratory s joint global change research institute rcp8 5 is an aggressive scenario of anthropogenic impact on the planet s climate created by the message model for energy supply strategy alternatives and their general environmental impact and iiasa integrated assessment framework groups at the international institute for applies systems analysis austria a detailed description can be found in riahi et al 2007 wayne 2013 for a prognostic assessment of water availability in addition to predicted water resources it is necessary to take into account the forecast of socio economic development in the country which determines water use in all sectors of the economy taken together these factors determine the degree of water availability for the territory and population in various regions of russia water use forecasts along with long term water resource assessments are essential to address sustainable water availability problems in the future however the complexity of such an assessment lies in the fact that in the current crisis unplanned economic development there are no realistic long term plans for the socio economic development of individual regions and the country as a whole the previously developed documents strategy 2020 in 2011 and forecast of long term socio economic development of russia until 2030 of the ministry of economic development in 2013 show their insolvency the parameters of these plans which were based on a gdp growth of at least 5 annually cannot be achieved at the current growth rates of the russian economy overly optimistic plans were dictated by the relatively high oil prices which prevailed for a long time the forecast of the socio economic development of the russian federation for the period up to 2036 developed in 2018 provides for a moderate economic growth at the level of 3 at the same time changes in the structure of gdp for the period from 2018 to 2036 were incorporated the contribution of manufacturing industries increased from 12 3 to 13 4 construction from 5 6 to 8 2 the contribution of agriculture was reduced from 3 7 to 3 3 water supply from 0 5 to 0 3 industry from 28 3 to 27 6 that is with this version of the economic forecast an inertial scenario of water use can be adopted according to the trend of recent years taking into account changes in water resources a decrease in water use in the main branches of the economy and a decrease in the population of the russian federation from 146 9 million in 2018 up to 143 million people in 2036 according to the most realistic medium variant forecast russian federal state statistics service 2018 forecast estimates of water availability for russia as a whole and its individual regions were made 6 results and discussion figure 1 shows changes in the annual values of river water resources of the main economic regions of the russian federation including the kaliningrad region for the period 1935 2013 for each region the average long term value is additionally indicated as well as the change in water resources for the period 1981 2013 the period of significant climatic changes compared to the period 1948 1980 period of relatively stationary climate shown in figure 1 the analysis was carried out on the basis of data provided by the laboratory of water resources and water balance of the state hydrological institute the methodology for assessing renewable water resources is given in babkin and markelova 2008 as can be seen from the graphs presented in figure 1 practically throughout the entire territory of the russian federation that is in all economic regions an increase in river water resources has been observed in recent decades the exception is the central black earth economic region where there is a slight decrease of less than 2 of the average annual value of water resources in terms of quantity the most significant increase in resources occurred in the east siberian 82 1 km3 far eastern 52 2 km3 and northern 24 9 km3 economic regions in a relative percentage of the average long term value 1981 2013 the increase in resources is in the volga vyatka 14 5 ural 14 1 and north caucasus 13 0 economic regions there is no doubt that the changes in water resources presented above that have taken place in recent decades starting from the late 1970s early 1980s of the last century on the territory of russia are directly related to the ongoing climatic changes a more detailed description of the causes of changes in the runoff of russian rivers and the influence of climate on these changes is presented in georgievsky at al 2014 frolov 2014 georgievsky 2015 georgievsky 2016 these changes have a positive effect on water supply to the economic regions of the russian federation and accordingly on their economic development although it is difficult to accurately assess how strong this influence is therefore it is very important given the country s economic problems of the last decade to have a clear idea of either the persistence of this trend or other possibly negative changes in river water resources in the near future figure 2 shows forecast estimates of possible changes in river water resources for 11 large economic regions of the russian federation calculated for two forecast scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the period 2021 2040 compared to estimates for the period 1981 2000 based on the above forecasting estimation techniques table 5 shows the values of possible changes presented in figure 2 and in addition the change in water resources for the period 2041 2060 from the results obtained it can be seen that the most favorable from the point of view of providing river water resources is and will be in the near future the asian part of the russian federation west siberian east siberian and far eastern regions as well as the adjacent eastern part of the european territory of russia northern ural and volga vyatka regions where there is and will be for each of the two forecast periods for each forecast scenario an increase in river water resources the most significant increase in water resources is likely in the asian part of russia that is in that part of it with the lowest population density as for the rest of the territory of the russian federation three regions can be distinguished where a decrease in river water resources is possible the central black earth north caucasus and volga regions in the central economic region water resources will fluctuate around the current value that is there will not be any significant changes and in the northwestern region a slight increase in resources is more likely than their decrease thus the most problematic regions are the central black earth north caucasus and volga regions economic regions where there are still certain problems with the environment and water supply the central black earth region is a food base of the country with favorable agroclimatic conditions and black earth soils which supplies the central and northern regions of the russian federation this is the only economic region where the current decrease in river water resources as well as the direct decrease in the groundwater level associated with this decrease as well as the problems of water supply and preservation of land fertility with a high degree of probability will continue in the future the north caucasus economic region is 20 of the agro industrial complex one of the main suppliers of grain 1 3 of all fruit and vegetable crops in the country almost all grape products and the only supplier of subtropical products a decrease in water supply in the region given the specificity of the region can have serious negative consequences both for economic development and for the political and ethnic stability of the region the volga region occupies a leading place in the agro industrial complex of the russian federation and is one of the most prosperous economic regions nevertheless environmental problems are acute in this region the purification of the volga reservoirs the lack of treatment facilities with a significant development of petrochemistry measures to combat soil erosion etc when forecasting for the future the high accuracy of calculations does not play a significant role in this case it is important to correctly represent the situation with water availability for the considered prospect in a particular region voropaev et al 1986 blagoverov 1976 taking into account the trends in the water use development during the crisis of the 90s of the last century one can draw an analogy and assume a decrease in industrial water use by an average of 15 20 by the beginning of the 2040s agricultural water use will decrease to 15 depending on the region and the degree of its development by now in the south of russia in the basins of the kuban terek and sulak rivers a further increase in irrigated areas is practically not expected due to limited water resources federal target program 2013 the increase in irrigated areas is planned in the basin of the volga and the main increase in irrigated land can be expected on the territory of the middle and lower volga as well as in the kama river basin in the don basin there is a slight increase of irrigated areas in the voronezh and lipetsk belgorod kursk tambov penza and volgograd regions which are currently regions with insufficient water resources thus in the main territory of the european part of the country a decrease in agricultural water use is possible within 10 in the south without changes in the basins of the ob irtysh amur yenisei rivers a decrease in agricultural water use can be within 15 municipal water use will tend to decrease regardless of the economic situation but due to a decrease in the population savings in water supply and an expansion of the practice of water accounting a decrease is possible up to 8 10 by the forecast period of 2040 within the economic regions the situation with water availability will worsen in the central black earth region in the voronezh lipetsk belgorod kursk tambov and oryol regions the water availability will decrease to 10 in the belgorod and kursk regions in dry years water availability can be close to 1 0 1 5 thousand m3 per year per capita which according to the international classification is considered as very low or even catastrophically low on the territory of the volga economic region the penza region will be the problem area with water availability of less than 3 thousand m3 per capita per year in the ural economic region despite the projected increase in water availability by 10 15 in dry years for the kurgan and chelyabinsk regions it will remain at a critically low level which inevitably causes acute water availability problems in the north caucasian economic region a decrease in the annual runoff an increase in the population and the preservation of agricultural water use irrigation at the current level will inevitably lead to an aggravation of water availability problems in almost all constituent subjects of the region at the same time a decrease in water availability in dagestan is predicted by 13 in the stavropol territory by 27 in the stavropol territory and kalmykia in dry years water availability can decrease to less than 1000 m3 per year per capita which is catastrophically low summarizing the performed studies we can conclude that an ironic feature of the results obtained is that according to predictive estimates there will be more water in those regions where it is sufficient and less where it is most needed 7 conclusion recently it is widely believed among climatologists that a practical solution to the problem of climate forecasting has become possible only now when mathematical modeling has reached a sufficiently high level this is primarily due to the efforts of teams engaged in the development and application of global numerical models of general circulation and atmosphere aogcm united in the framework of the cmip coupled model intercomparison project comparison project carried out under the auspices of the world climate research program wcrp world climate research program however this approach has not yet received wide application in relation to forecasting river runoff primarily due to the widespread opinion that despite the fact that modern hydrometeorological science has achieved noticeable success in modeling climate and its changes and numerical climate models are able to reproduce a large number of physical processes in the atmosphere ocean and land hydrosphere the hydrological component in climatic models is not yet sufficiently developed frolov 2014 the basis for skepticism in the use of modeled data on river flow is the widespread assertion about simplified schemes for calculating river flow embedded in the aogcm which are unable to adequately reproduce flow fluctuations on the other hand one cannot ignore the fact that there is a constant process of improving the models which are being developed by the leading scientific centers specialists of world hydrometeorology if we compare the main characteristics of the aogcms presented in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip of the third stage 3 cmip3 and the next fifth stage cmip5 wcrp 2011 we can see significant changes improved model detail which directly leads to an increase in the spatial resolution of the simulated information provided improvement of calculation schemes of the main climatic systems improving the quality of the information provided etc there is no doubt that the aogcm development process will continue cmip6 therefore the approach proposed in the article for assessing future changes in river water resources has a good prospect of moving from auxiliary methods to basic ones as for the generalized assessment of changes in water resources in the future for the entire territory of the russian federation according to the results obtained in the coming decades there is no reason to expect any significant changes in river flow as a result of climate change for most of the country s territory a slight increase in annual runoff is most likely which is within the limits of its natural variability the most abundant river water resources will be the asian part of the russian federation and the adjacent eastern part of the european territory of russia the most problematic from the point of view of water resources provision will be the central black earth north caucasus and volga regions however it should be noted once again that the likely increases and decreases in water resources in the regions will be insignificant with the possible exception of the far eastern region taking into account that forecasts of socio economic development for the long term have not been developed the assessment of water availability at the level of 2060 was not carried out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors express their gratitude to the cmip5 project as well as to all scientific teams who provide modeling data within the framework of this project for the opportunity to use the river runoff data on the basis of which the studies presented in this article were carried out the authors also express their gratitude to the laboratory of water resources and water balance of the state hydrological institute for the provided long term data on river water resources of the economic regions of the russian federation which were used in these studies 
987,the article presents predictive estimates of changes in river water resources in eleven economic regions of the russian federation for the period of 2030 and 2050 based on the use of river runoff data of the atmospheric and ocean general circulation models aogcm of the cmip5 project an overview of the design schemes of the aogcm river runoff used in the research is made the methodology uses an ensemble approach the predictive estimates were carried out for two forecast periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in relation to the period 1981 2000 which was chosen as the base one the calculations were made on the basis of an ensemble of 24 selected models for both the moderately aggressive rcp4 5 scenario and the hard rcp8 5 scenario the results obtained were averaged over 20 year periods and compared with the corresponding values for the period 1981 2000 according to the results obtained in the coming decades there is no reason to expect any significant changes in river flow as a result of climate change for most of the country s territory a slight increase in annual runoff is most likely which is within the limits of its natural variability the most abundant river water resources will be the asian part of the russian federation and the adjacent eastern part of the european territory of russia the most problematic from the point of view of water resources provision will be the central black earth north caucasus and volga economic regions there will be more water in those regions where it is sufficient and less where it is most needed it should be noted that the technique presented in this article is considered by the authors primarily as one of the alternative forecasting methods that must be used in conjunction with other accepted methods however given the continuous process of improving the aogcms as well as the quality of the information they provide this approach should be considered as one of the most promising keywords predictive modeling climate change cmip5 economic regions of the russian federation river water resources 1 introduction reliable water supply for the population and sectors of the economy is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of any state when developing a strategy for the rational use and protection of water resources planning and implementing expensive water management measures it is necessary to have scientifically grounded estimates of the likely changes in water resources and the water regime of rivers in the future under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors the complexity of solving these issues for the territory of the russian federation is largely due to the peculiarities of climatic changes over the past few decades since the late 1970s early 1980s the consequences of the global warming process have been clearly manifested in the country an increase in surface air temperature in most of the country especially intense in the winter months for temperate and northern latitudes roshydromet 2014 2019 changes in the water regime of rivers frolova et al 2018 most pronounced in the increase in the winter component of river runoff georgievsky et al 2014 georgievsky 2016 redistribution of seasonal precipitation kokorev and sherstiukov 2005 anisimov and kokorev 2016 an increase in the number of hazardous phenomena associated with water frolov 2014 georgievsky 2015 etc in this regard one of the most important problems facing hydrologists is the assessment of the likely changes in river water resources in the future this is especially important for the economic regions of russia since initially the economic zoning is intended for the territorial organization of the national economy and justification of the rational location of production the improvement of its specializations and the socio economic development of both a separate economic region and the entire country as a whole the article provides a methodology for predictive assessments of changes in river water resources for the prospect of 2030 and 2050 based on the direct use of river runoff data from the atmospheric and ocean general circulation models of the cmip5 project aogcm the authors began to develop this technique more than 10 years ago starting from the data on the river flow of the previous project cmip3 shiklomanov et al 2008 subsequently the methodology with the advent of new data cmip5 project and new approaches to probable climate changes in the future rcp scenarios wayne 2013 was gradually refined and improved and the results obtained from it were used as one of the alternative methods for forecasting river water resources in various budgetary budgetary themes of roshydromet and contractual research works carried out by the state hydrological institute www hydrology ru the final stage in the development of this methodology was the forecast estimates of changes in river water resources of the largest rivers of the russian federation 35 largest catchments were used in the studies presented in georgievsky and golovanov 2019 it should be noted that the technique presented in this article is considered by the authors primarily as one of the alternative forecasting methods that must be used in conjunction with other accepted methods however given the continuous process of improving the aogcms as well as the quality of the information they provide project cmip6 this approach should be considered as one of the most promising 2 economic regions of russian federation economic regions are territories within which a specialized economy is formed and developed which is a part of the national economy of the russian federation and is interconnected with other parts of it by the exchange of goods produced in them and other economic relations economic zoning is the basis of the territorial management of the national economy of russia currently russia is divided into 11 large economic regions northern northwestern central central black earth volga volga vyatka north caucasus ural west siberian east siberian and far eastern the kaliningrad region is not included in any economic region and is endowed with the status of a special economic zone figures 1 and 2 show the location of the economic regions of the russian federation and table 1 shows their main characteristics below is a brief description of the potential reserves for sustainable development of each major economic region according to the ministry of economic development of the russian federation http economy gov ru en home taking into account the current economic situation see table 1 morozova et al 2017 the current and future problems of the stability of the regions of the central economic region are specific since there is no possibility here to increase generating capacities it is difficult to sell the products of industries specializing in foreign and domestic markets the stability of the economy here is largely due to the presence of the capital which is attractive to investors the main priority areas of development for the central region are termination of the decline in production stabilization and growth of production conversion of the defense complex development of industrial social infrastructure completion of agrarian reforms in agriculture reconstruction and re equipment of enterprises introduction of the latest technologies capable of producing environmentally friendly products development of industrial and social infrastructure the central black earth economic region has unique reserves of iron ores a powerful industrial potential and a developed agro industrial complex have been created therefore the potential for improving the socio economic situation here includes the restructuring of the defense industries and civil engineering stabilization of the mining and metallurgical complex and chemical industry enterprises sustainable energy supply to the region including through the development of nuclear energy strengthening the agro industrial complex improving the living conditions of the population ensuring its environmental safety etc the east siberian economic region possesses unique deposits of non ferrous metals nickel copper molybdenum cobalt lead zinc iron ores coal including coking coal etc it produces 17 of all electricity generated in the country 74 of aluminum and etc for a number of reasons the regions of eastern siberia cannot be guided by large investments from outside the problems of building the potential for the sustainability of the functioning of the economy will have to be resolved taking into account the fact that according to forecasts in the next few years imbalances in the economic complex will increase the degree of depreciation of fixed assets and the lag of the region from the average russian level in terms of the main indicators of the social sphere the far eastern economic region has been in deep crisis for a long time the economic stability of this region is possible if a set of urgent measures is taken to significantly improve the situation providing the region with fuel and energy resources regulating energy and transport tariffs removing the problem of non payments optimizing inter budgetary relations etc further growth of economic potential is associated with the use of reserves a relative decrease in the energy and transport components in the cost of production increased fishing and seafood production development of transport infrastructure multiple expansion of the business sector network suspension of the outflow of the population etc prospects for the sustainability of the economy of the regions that make up the northern economic region lie in the available opportunities to increase the production of the most valuable natural resources to develop the fuel and energy complex the potential of such a territory is determined by the mineral resource base the dynamics of prices in foreign markets the situation and solvency of the consumer regions the environmental safety of geological exploration and operational work etc the north caucasus plays an important role in the country s economy and protects its strategic interests there are unique natural resources and favorable climatic conditions here it can be recommended restructuring of the economy with a reduction in the share of the region s heavy engineering chemicals and petrochemicals as well as the development of production equipment for the agricultural sector power and food processing industry construction industry prospects for the sustainability of the economy of the regions of the north western economic region are associated with the implementation of their special geopolitical position the development of infrastructure transport and communications the conversion of military industrial complex capacities the restructuring of the timber processing complex and an increase in the share of high availability products in the total volume of manufactured products the volga economic region is a large region with industrial and agricultural specialization the transition to sustainable economic growth is possible here by attracting additional financial resources developing exports by enterprises of the chemical and petrochemical industries increasing the capacity of mechanical engineering as well as converting military industrial complex enterprises the guarantors of economic revival are the development of the resource base of the oil industry additional exploration and commissioning of new fields the ural economic region is distinguished by significant industrial and scientific potential the availability of highly qualified personnel and sufficient natural resources however most of the constituent entities of the federation included in this economic region are subsidized the potential for sustainability of the region s economy is determined primarily by the prospects for the modernization of industrial complexes the conversion of military industrial complex enterprises and the implementation of large investment projects in the future it is also rational to produce electricity at a rate exceeding the average russian one in the volga vyatka economic region there are no highly efficient fuel and energy and mineral resources therefore the sustainability of the economy can be ensured through a relative reduction in fuel and energy consumption stabilization and development of agro industrial production and improvement of socio economic conditions of life in the countryside development of enterprises through their technological re equipment and reconstruction increasing the competitiveness of products the west siberian economic region accounts for most of the oil production more than 90 of natural gas the oil and gas complex of western siberia largely guarantees the energy security of the russian federation and provides most of the foreign exchange earnings the increase in the sustainability pace and quality of the region s development according to experts is due to provision of the fuel and energy complex fec with highly efficient equipment introduction of technologies for deep processing of fuel and energy and mineral resources commissioning of capacities for the extraction and production of iron and lead ore stabilization of electricity production and covering its deficit by means of transportation from eastern siberia the development of the machine building complex at a rate exceeding the average for the russian federation strengthening of the region s specialization in the production of advanced polymer materials as can be seen from the above in each region there are certain economic problems as well as possible measures for their solution of course reliable water supply in the near future based on a reliable assessment of the likely changes in river water resources in the future will not solve all the identified problems but it will undoubtedly make a certain contribution to the economic development of regions and the country as a whole 3 current situation with water supply in the regions of the russian federation one of the tasks outlined in the water strategy of the russian federation is to eliminate the shortage of water resources in certain regions of russia to ensure the socio economic development of the country water strategy 2012 despite the decrease in the volume of water use in russia as a whole over the past three decades from 95 4 km3 per year in 1990 to 53 km3 per year in 2018 babkin and balonishnikova 2018 there are currently problems of water scarcity and low water availability in a number of regions an analysis of the current dynamics of water resources and the tendency for a decrease in water use in russia testifies to a quite favorable situation with water supply in the country as a whole since over the past 30 years the specific water availability per inhabitant has noticeably increased however in the regions the situation with water supply is ambiguous according to the estimates of the state hydrological institute some regions in the volga don kuban terek sunzha sura and ural river basins experience the highest anthropogenic load on water resources the ratio of water withdrawal and water resources of a water body where water is taken from and where it is discharged after use in years with average river runoff low water availability is observed in a number of subjects of the central central black earth volga north caucasus ural and even west siberian economic regions the latest assessments of the water availability of the subjects belonging to the category with low water availability at the level of 2019 are presented in table 2 the analysis of the dynamics of water availability values for the long term period 2005 2019 gives reason to believe that there is a high probability of a further decrease in water availability in those subjects of the russian federation in which there are currently problems of water shortage 4 data runoff data of cmip5 project models the cmip5 project includes over 60 aogcms the main objective of the project was to scientifically substantiate the preparation of the 5th assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc a detailed description of the project is presented in tailor et al 2012 modeling data provided by the aogcms participating in the project is available for download through the data portal http pcmdi9 llnl gov each aogcm is a set of models of interacting climate systems the calculation of the river runoff is carried out in the earth s surface climatic system which includes the surface of the continents with its hydrological system inland water bodies swamps rivers etc and the soil layer with groundwater the standardized set of computational variables of climatic models includes two parameters characterizing river runoff total river runoff total runoff flux mrro and surface runoff surface runoff flux mrros http www pcmdi llnl gov ipcc ipcc output requirements htm analyzing the information on river runoff provided in the framework of the cmip5 project it was revealed that out of more than 60 models participating in the project only 29 provide runoff data in full volume for carrying out research first of all we were interested in data for the base period 1981 2000 as well as for two forecast periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 for two scenarios of climate change in the future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for comparison at the previous stage of the project cmip3 no more than 10 models provided information on runoff at the first stage of research the authors carried out a comprehensive analysis of the main schemes for calculating the river runoff of the aogcm of the cmip5 project see table 3 it was found that the calculation schemes in different models differ significantly nevertheless it can be noted that the most frequently analyzed models use different versions of the topmodel model developed by k beven beven and kirkby 1979 topmodel is a well known and widely used distributed precipitation runoff model that uses river basin topography as input the calculation schemes of aogcm also include blocks for calculating the total evaporation including transpiration as well as soil freezing and the process of accumulation and melting of snow cover a more detailed description of the schemes for calculating river flow is presented by the authors in georgievsky and golovanov 2015 analysis of the calculated river runoff schemes shows that this component of the aogcm is in the process of constant development after loading and processing information on the river flow the quality of these data was verified the verification was carried out in several stages first the average long term model river runoff for the base period 1981 2000 was compared with the long term average values of the actual runoff of the main rivers of the russian federation see table 4 additionally the spatial distribution of the aogcm runoff over the territory of russia was analyzed then the adequacy presence of negative or unrealistic runoff values etc of the simulated future runoff changes was tested for each of the forecast scenarios i e unrealistic values were identified if according to any of the validation tests the incorrect provision of data on the river flow of a particular aogcm was revealed the model was excluded from further studies as a result of the verification performed five models were eliminated and further analysis was carried out on the basis of data from the 24 remaining aogcms also during the validation it was revealed that the values of the surface runoff mrros are significantly underestimated in comparison with the actual runoff as well as the values of the total runoff mrro which is more consistent with the real river runoff integrating both surface and underground components and which was used for further analysis analyzing the results presented in table 4 it can be concluded that the most significant discrepancies more than 100 in the river runoff were obtained for four basins don ural irtysh and selenga where there are small values of the runoff layer less than 60 mm selenga 70 mm the simulated runoff in these basins is significantly overestimated secondly there is also a significant underestimation of the river runoff values in the basins where a significant part of the flow is formed in the mountains kuban terek and sulak this is probably due to the coarse spatial resolution and the underestimation of snow and glacier melt in these mountainous regions the ensemble river runoff values for the entire largest river basins in russia neva volga severnaya dvina ob yenisei lena amur with the exception of the pechora are close to the observed runoff there is an overestimation of the runoff for the basins of the yama indirigka and kolyma rivers located in the north east of the asian part of the country 5 method a methodology of assessment of probable changes in river water resources in the future because climatic models have different spatial resolution from 0 95 x1 25 for cesm1 bgc to 2 8 2 8 for bcc csm1 1 canesm2 miroc esm etc the runoff data of each aogcm were interpolated with the help of specially developed software into a common grid with resolution 0 5 x 0 5 thus a database of initial information was created which includes grid data for each model for the historical and forecast periods for each of the forecast scenarios spatial coverage of the unified data grid is from 14 to 82 n and 0 192 e the interpolation was carried out in a simple way the nearest model value was assigned to each specific grid point on the basis of the obtained regular grid matrices monthly values of the runoff layer for 11 economic regions of the russian federation were calculated by averaging over the territory of their basins from the monthly values obtained in this way the values of the annual runoff layers were calculated for all models which were then used to estimate the ensemble averaged for 24 aogcms values of the annual runoff layers the calculations were carried out for two forecast periods 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 in relation to the period 1981 2000 which was chosen as the base one the calculations were made for both the moderately aggressive rcp4 5 scenario and the hard rcp8 5 scenario the results obtained were averaged over 20 year periods and compared with the corresponding values for the period 1981 2000 as noted above the forecast projections rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used as climatic scenarios which are forecast projections of climate change in the future depending on the options for radiative forcing on the atmosphere in the future rcp4 5 is a moderately aggressive scenario developed by the minicam global change assessment model group at the pacific northwest national laboratory s joint global change research institute rcp8 5 is an aggressive scenario of anthropogenic impact on the planet s climate created by the message model for energy supply strategy alternatives and their general environmental impact and iiasa integrated assessment framework groups at the international institute for applies systems analysis austria a detailed description can be found in riahi et al 2007 wayne 2013 for a prognostic assessment of water availability in addition to predicted water resources it is necessary to take into account the forecast of socio economic development in the country which determines water use in all sectors of the economy taken together these factors determine the degree of water availability for the territory and population in various regions of russia water use forecasts along with long term water resource assessments are essential to address sustainable water availability problems in the future however the complexity of such an assessment lies in the fact that in the current crisis unplanned economic development there are no realistic long term plans for the socio economic development of individual regions and the country as a whole the previously developed documents strategy 2020 in 2011 and forecast of long term socio economic development of russia until 2030 of the ministry of economic development in 2013 show their insolvency the parameters of these plans which were based on a gdp growth of at least 5 annually cannot be achieved at the current growth rates of the russian economy overly optimistic plans were dictated by the relatively high oil prices which prevailed for a long time the forecast of the socio economic development of the russian federation for the period up to 2036 developed in 2018 provides for a moderate economic growth at the level of 3 at the same time changes in the structure of gdp for the period from 2018 to 2036 were incorporated the contribution of manufacturing industries increased from 12 3 to 13 4 construction from 5 6 to 8 2 the contribution of agriculture was reduced from 3 7 to 3 3 water supply from 0 5 to 0 3 industry from 28 3 to 27 6 that is with this version of the economic forecast an inertial scenario of water use can be adopted according to the trend of recent years taking into account changes in water resources a decrease in water use in the main branches of the economy and a decrease in the population of the russian federation from 146 9 million in 2018 up to 143 million people in 2036 according to the most realistic medium variant forecast russian federal state statistics service 2018 forecast estimates of water availability for russia as a whole and its individual regions were made 6 results and discussion figure 1 shows changes in the annual values of river water resources of the main economic regions of the russian federation including the kaliningrad region for the period 1935 2013 for each region the average long term value is additionally indicated as well as the change in water resources for the period 1981 2013 the period of significant climatic changes compared to the period 1948 1980 period of relatively stationary climate shown in figure 1 the analysis was carried out on the basis of data provided by the laboratory of water resources and water balance of the state hydrological institute the methodology for assessing renewable water resources is given in babkin and markelova 2008 as can be seen from the graphs presented in figure 1 practically throughout the entire territory of the russian federation that is in all economic regions an increase in river water resources has been observed in recent decades the exception is the central black earth economic region where there is a slight decrease of less than 2 of the average annual value of water resources in terms of quantity the most significant increase in resources occurred in the east siberian 82 1 km3 far eastern 52 2 km3 and northern 24 9 km3 economic regions in a relative percentage of the average long term value 1981 2013 the increase in resources is in the volga vyatka 14 5 ural 14 1 and north caucasus 13 0 economic regions there is no doubt that the changes in water resources presented above that have taken place in recent decades starting from the late 1970s early 1980s of the last century on the territory of russia are directly related to the ongoing climatic changes a more detailed description of the causes of changes in the runoff of russian rivers and the influence of climate on these changes is presented in georgievsky at al 2014 frolov 2014 georgievsky 2015 georgievsky 2016 these changes have a positive effect on water supply to the economic regions of the russian federation and accordingly on their economic development although it is difficult to accurately assess how strong this influence is therefore it is very important given the country s economic problems of the last decade to have a clear idea of either the persistence of this trend or other possibly negative changes in river water resources in the near future figure 2 shows forecast estimates of possible changes in river water resources for 11 large economic regions of the russian federation calculated for two forecast scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the period 2021 2040 compared to estimates for the period 1981 2000 based on the above forecasting estimation techniques table 5 shows the values of possible changes presented in figure 2 and in addition the change in water resources for the period 2041 2060 from the results obtained it can be seen that the most favorable from the point of view of providing river water resources is and will be in the near future the asian part of the russian federation west siberian east siberian and far eastern regions as well as the adjacent eastern part of the european territory of russia northern ural and volga vyatka regions where there is and will be for each of the two forecast periods for each forecast scenario an increase in river water resources the most significant increase in water resources is likely in the asian part of russia that is in that part of it with the lowest population density as for the rest of the territory of the russian federation three regions can be distinguished where a decrease in river water resources is possible the central black earth north caucasus and volga regions in the central economic region water resources will fluctuate around the current value that is there will not be any significant changes and in the northwestern region a slight increase in resources is more likely than their decrease thus the most problematic regions are the central black earth north caucasus and volga regions economic regions where there are still certain problems with the environment and water supply the central black earth region is a food base of the country with favorable agroclimatic conditions and black earth soils which supplies the central and northern regions of the russian federation this is the only economic region where the current decrease in river water resources as well as the direct decrease in the groundwater level associated with this decrease as well as the problems of water supply and preservation of land fertility with a high degree of probability will continue in the future the north caucasus economic region is 20 of the agro industrial complex one of the main suppliers of grain 1 3 of all fruit and vegetable crops in the country almost all grape products and the only supplier of subtropical products a decrease in water supply in the region given the specificity of the region can have serious negative consequences both for economic development and for the political and ethnic stability of the region the volga region occupies a leading place in the agro industrial complex of the russian federation and is one of the most prosperous economic regions nevertheless environmental problems are acute in this region the purification of the volga reservoirs the lack of treatment facilities with a significant development of petrochemistry measures to combat soil erosion etc when forecasting for the future the high accuracy of calculations does not play a significant role in this case it is important to correctly represent the situation with water availability for the considered prospect in a particular region voropaev et al 1986 blagoverov 1976 taking into account the trends in the water use development during the crisis of the 90s of the last century one can draw an analogy and assume a decrease in industrial water use by an average of 15 20 by the beginning of the 2040s agricultural water use will decrease to 15 depending on the region and the degree of its development by now in the south of russia in the basins of the kuban terek and sulak rivers a further increase in irrigated areas is practically not expected due to limited water resources federal target program 2013 the increase in irrigated areas is planned in the basin of the volga and the main increase in irrigated land can be expected on the territory of the middle and lower volga as well as in the kama river basin in the don basin there is a slight increase of irrigated areas in the voronezh and lipetsk belgorod kursk tambov penza and volgograd regions which are currently regions with insufficient water resources thus in the main territory of the european part of the country a decrease in agricultural water use is possible within 10 in the south without changes in the basins of the ob irtysh amur yenisei rivers a decrease in agricultural water use can be within 15 municipal water use will tend to decrease regardless of the economic situation but due to a decrease in the population savings in water supply and an expansion of the practice of water accounting a decrease is possible up to 8 10 by the forecast period of 2040 within the economic regions the situation with water availability will worsen in the central black earth region in the voronezh lipetsk belgorod kursk tambov and oryol regions the water availability will decrease to 10 in the belgorod and kursk regions in dry years water availability can be close to 1 0 1 5 thousand m3 per year per capita which according to the international classification is considered as very low or even catastrophically low on the territory of the volga economic region the penza region will be the problem area with water availability of less than 3 thousand m3 per capita per year in the ural economic region despite the projected increase in water availability by 10 15 in dry years for the kurgan and chelyabinsk regions it will remain at a critically low level which inevitably causes acute water availability problems in the north caucasian economic region a decrease in the annual runoff an increase in the population and the preservation of agricultural water use irrigation at the current level will inevitably lead to an aggravation of water availability problems in almost all constituent subjects of the region at the same time a decrease in water availability in dagestan is predicted by 13 in the stavropol territory by 27 in the stavropol territory and kalmykia in dry years water availability can decrease to less than 1000 m3 per year per capita which is catastrophically low summarizing the performed studies we can conclude that an ironic feature of the results obtained is that according to predictive estimates there will be more water in those regions where it is sufficient and less where it is most needed 7 conclusion recently it is widely believed among climatologists that a practical solution to the problem of climate forecasting has become possible only now when mathematical modeling has reached a sufficiently high level this is primarily due to the efforts of teams engaged in the development and application of global numerical models of general circulation and atmosphere aogcm united in the framework of the cmip coupled model intercomparison project comparison project carried out under the auspices of the world climate research program wcrp world climate research program however this approach has not yet received wide application in relation to forecasting river runoff primarily due to the widespread opinion that despite the fact that modern hydrometeorological science has achieved noticeable success in modeling climate and its changes and numerical climate models are able to reproduce a large number of physical processes in the atmosphere ocean and land hydrosphere the hydrological component in climatic models is not yet sufficiently developed frolov 2014 the basis for skepticism in the use of modeled data on river flow is the widespread assertion about simplified schemes for calculating river flow embedded in the aogcm which are unable to adequately reproduce flow fluctuations on the other hand one cannot ignore the fact that there is a constant process of improving the models which are being developed by the leading scientific centers specialists of world hydrometeorology if we compare the main characteristics of the aogcms presented in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip of the third stage 3 cmip3 and the next fifth stage cmip5 wcrp 2011 we can see significant changes improved model detail which directly leads to an increase in the spatial resolution of the simulated information provided improvement of calculation schemes of the main climatic systems improving the quality of the information provided etc there is no doubt that the aogcm development process will continue cmip6 therefore the approach proposed in the article for assessing future changes in river water resources has a good prospect of moving from auxiliary methods to basic ones as for the generalized assessment of changes in water resources in the future for the entire territory of the russian federation according to the results obtained in the coming decades there is no reason to expect any significant changes in river flow as a result of climate change for most of the country s territory a slight increase in annual runoff is most likely which is within the limits of its natural variability the most abundant river water resources will be the asian part of the russian federation and the adjacent eastern part of the european territory of russia the most problematic from the point of view of water resources provision will be the central black earth north caucasus and volga regions however it should be noted once again that the likely increases and decreases in water resources in the regions will be insignificant with the possible exception of the far eastern region taking into account that forecasts of socio economic development for the long term have not been developed the assessment of water availability at the level of 2060 was not carried out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors express their gratitude to the cmip5 project as well as to all scientific teams who provide modeling data within the framework of this project for the opportunity to use the river runoff data on the basis of which the studies presented in this article were carried out the authors also express their gratitude to the laboratory of water resources and water balance of the state hydrological institute for the provided long term data on river water resources of the economic regions of the russian federation which were used in

respect to cc 25 c ph 9 0 saturation index for cc sicc 1 4 and 10 c ph 7 1 sicc 0 7 respectively at an initial op concentration of 1 mg po4 3 l 1 in the range of cc dosages of 0 01 20 1 g l 1 resulting in op cc mass ratios of 0 06 85 mg g prevailing op binding processes were adsorption and precipitation depending on op cc mass ratio adsorption predominated at low op cc and precipitation at high op cc under epilimnetic conditions approximately five times lower op cc mass ratio was needed to induce precipitation as compared to hypolimnion indicating at a greater probability of precipitation in epilimnion while adsorption was more likely to occur in hypolimnion in epilimnion co precipitation of op was also involved together with adsorption calculated maximum adsorption was 35 higher in epilimnion whereas obtained precipitation rates measured as unit sorption were 87 higher showing promoting effect of epilimnetic conditions on op removal application of cc into epilimnion will result in a ph drop which can reduce occurrence of cyanobacteria application of cc into hypolimnion will result in its partial dissolution while most of the applied cc mass will be removable after the finished treatment keywords calcite orthophosphate sorption p immoblisation lake restoration non invasive phosphate removal 1 introduction inactivation of phosphorus p in eutrophic water bodies has been widely applied eutrophication mitigation strategy its aim is to immobilise the most available form of phosphorus orthophosphate op to reduce algal productivity cooke et al 2005 this is typically achieved by application of a p binding agent into water where sorption processes fast strip op from the water column and by further p immobilisation in sediments after the p binding agent has reached the lake s bottom numerous p binding agents have been applied worldwide with the most commonly used coagulants such as al or fe salts and a solid material lanthanum modified bentonite cooke et al 2005 gibbs hickey 2018 the method has been generally proven to be successful in reducing p release from sediment gołdyn et al 2014 dithmer et al 2016 huser et al 2016 grochowska et al 2019 although multiple applications of p binding agent are frequently required to achieve desirable effect lürling van oosterhout 2013 zamparas zacharias 2014 unfortunately some risks and uncertainties are related to this technology including translocation of p binding agent and its accumulation in non target areas of the lake s bottom van hullebusch et al 2002 huser et al 2016 and limited longevity resulting from resuspension bioturbation or change in the physio chemical conditions or aging cooke et al 1993 hupfer hilt 2008 reitzel et al 2013 dithmer et al 2016 welch et al 2017 van oosterhout et al 2020 on the other hand some non target effects such as increased concentration of metals wauer teien 2010 van oosterhout et al 2020 łopata et al 2020 and increased sensitivity of aquatic biota schumaker et al 1993 van oosterhout lürling 2011 have also been reported in response to these limitations an alternate method of p binding agent application into water bodies has recently been proposed its principle is the application of a p binding agent fixed in or onto a carrier as filling of bags burska et al 2019 zamparas et al 2020 or as a coating of the so called laminates bańkowska sobczak et al 2019 both solutions assume introduction of the p binding agent fixed in or onto a carrier into the lake for a specific time and its subsequent removal from the ecosystem together with the sorbed op by doing so not only the op immobilization but also its removal can be achieved another advantage of this approach is the fact that the p biding agent does not remain in the aquatic environment which fundamentally reduces non target effects resulting from agent accumulation and possible op release for that reason this approach was called non invasive phosphate removal bańkowska sobczak et al 2019 pryputniewicz flis et al 2021 moreover the newly proposed method use of a p binding agent fixed in or onto a carrier enables application of a p binding agent to target depths depending on the actual op distribution in the water column zamparas et al 2020 due to the fact that in lakes physio chemical conditions substantially change with depth which can strongly affect op sorption it is important to predict behaviour of a p binding agent under conditions typically occurring at specific lake s depths or layers in this study calcite cc has been investigated as a potential candidate to be used as a p binding agent in non invasive phosphate removal approach cc is a calcium carbonate mineral it is known to play an important role in p cycling in the aquatic environment golterman 2004 cc is naturally formed in water bodies mainly during intense photosynthesis due to enhanced ph resulting from co2 sequestration by plants and algae which lowers cc solubility stabel 1986 dittrich koschel 2002 during cc precipitation in the aquatic environment op is adsorbed onto cc crystals and partly incorporated into their structure this phenomenon called p co precipitation with cc has been recognised as an important self purification mechanism in hard water ecosystems danen louwerse et al 1995 neal 2002 walsh et al 2019 thus different powdered cc based materials have been used as p binding agents for lake restoration purposes klapper 1992 stüben et al 1998 prepas et al 2001 hupfer 2004 previously ca oh 2 was applied to induce artificial cc precipitation dittrich et al 2011 murphy et al 1993 but its use was given up due to rapid ph increase leading to harmful effects on aquatic biota miskimmin et al 1995 zhang prepas 1996 cc was further proposed as a nature based solution not leading to rapid changes in physio chemical conditions and thus securing high environmental safety of p inactivation berg 2001 walpersdorf et al 2004 ditrrich et al 2011 further works on cc application in lakes and reservoirs focused on active barriers onto sediment surface see for example berg et al 2004 lin et al 2011 ding et al 2012 yu et al 2018 and calcite application into the sediment using controlled resuspension bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 which all aimed at reduction of p internal loading apart from co precipitation of p cc is able to remove op from the solution by other mechanism these are adsorption without op incorporation into crystal lattice which only takes place during co precipitation griffin jurinak 1973 plant house 2002 and precipitation of op with calcium in form of different calcium phosphate compounds ca po4 xu et al 2014 op adsorption onto cc proceeds by binding of cahpo4 0 aq complex to the cc surface lin singer 2006 xu et al 2014 is endothermic griffin jurinak 1973 and reversible freeman rowell 1981 millero et al 2001 in contrast to that other op fixation mechanisms induced by cc ensure stable op removal which is attributed to the incorporation of op into the cc crystal lattice co precipitation and relatively low solubility of ca po4 precipitation freeman rowell 1981 valsami jones 2001 naidu and scherer 2014 occurrence of the above mentioned op removal mechanisms is mainly controlled by saturation of the solution with respect to cc if the solution is oversaturated cc precipitates leading to co precipitation of op suzuki et al 1986 plant house 2002 however at high concentrations phosphate ions retard or fully inhibit precipitation of cc and thus op co precipitation sawada 1997 lin singer 2006 however this effect can be to some extent overcome by high oversaturation of the solution with respect to cc plant house 2002 on the other hand increasing op concentration under oversaturation may promote ca po4 formation plant house 2002 if the solution is subsaturated cc dissolves enhancing ph and supplying ca2 ions which may result in a dissolution induced ca po4 formation berg et al 2005 donnert et al 2002 ruiz agudo et al 2013 wang et al 2012 in equilibrium conditions with respect to cc adsorption of op is expected to dominate at low op concentrations whereas at high op levels precipitation sets in sø et al 2011 li et al 2017 2020 important factors determining op fixation on cc are also ph and temperature as they affect solubility of cc and thus saturation conditions with respect to cc solubility of ca po4 compounds house 1999 and adsorption rate griffin jurinak 1973 sø et al 2011 in addition to that ph influences cc surface chemistry van cappellen 1993 mechanism of op binding onto calcite is also dependent on the solid solution ratio bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 properties of cc based materials mainly particle size and specific surface area also play important role in shaping op cc interactions as they determine adsorption rate and dissolution potential berg et al 2004 eiche et al 2008 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 in eutrophic lakes the previously mentioned conditions important for op interactions with cc saturation with respect to cc temperature ph change with depth due to thermal stratification and biological processes in summer high temperature and alkaline ph occur in epilimnion the latter resulting from intense photosynthesis stabel 1986 whereas in hypolimnion relatively low temperature and low ph prevail the latter resulting from decomposition of organic matter dean 1999 müller et al 2006 because of this contrasting saturation conditions with respect to cc can occur in eutrophic lakes with oversaturation in epilimnion and subsaturation in hypolimnion dean 1999 dean 2002 roeser et al 2016 many studies freeman rowell 1981 donnert et al 2002 song et al 2006a karageorgiou et al 2007 sanciolo et al 2008 lin et al 2011 xu et al 2014 wan et al 2016 qin et al 2018 li et al 2020 investigated interactions between cc and op at very high initial op concentrations which are fairly higher than typically found in lakes water column the range applied in the above listed papers was from 15 mg po4 3 l 1 to as high as 3060 mg po4 3 l 1 and thus cannot be used to predict op mechanism removal onto cc in natural water bodies although op concentrations representative for the aquatic environment have already been employed in numerous works eg house donaldson 1986 plant house 2002 lin singer 2006 sø et al 2011 li et al 2017 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 łożyńska et al 2020 none of them compared calcite interactions with op under initial subsaturation and oversaturation such a comparison at lake specific levels of op was involved by eiche et al 2008 and berg 2001 however eiche et al 2008 did not compare op fixation onto cc in subsaturation and oversaturation conditions for the same cc based material and both conditions were modelled for the same temperature 20 c finally berg 2001 and berg at al 2004 compared op removal onto calcite for the same calcite based material under both oversaturation and subsaturation with respect to calcite but in that work different saturation states resulted mainly from differences in ph and alkalinity but not from the temperature hence to our knowledge a comparative analysis of cc interactions with op in over and subsaturation reflecting lake specific conditions typically found in epilimion high ph and temperature and hypolimnion low ph and temperature is still lacking therefore in the current work mechanism of op removal onto cc was investigated under conditions mimicking epilimnion and hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes differing in temperature ph and thus saturation with respect to cc sorption isotherms and thermodynamic modelling were used to determine op fixation processes and op sorption efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 cc material the cc material used was ground calcium carbonate gcc obtained from limestone deposits in southern poland the material is commercially available as flue gas desulphurization sorbent grain size of the material is 0 68 52 µm with the median of 10 µm and its specific surface area measured with n2 adsorption method bet is 1 83 m2 g 1 calcium carbonate constitutes min 95 of the material by

m respectively the lake is stratified with high biological productivity and anoxia occurring in the thermocline and in the hypolimnion mggp ioś 2010 in 2016 the total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations in the trophogenic zone were 0 02 0 06 mg p l 1 and 2 7 5 4 mg n l 1 respectively with op concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 0 06 mg po4 3 l 1 mai august burska et al 2017 during summer stratification anoxia established at the depth of 15 m and the ph dropped from 8 5 surface to 7 1 near bottom burska et al 2017 the lake water sampled for the experiment was spiked with 1mhcl or 1mnaoh to achieve ph typically found in epilimnion and hypolimnion of eutrophic stratified lakes table 1 alkaline ph was adjusted for the epilimnion to mimic conditions typically present during algal blooms table 1 for hypolimnion nearly neutral ph was modelled table 1 as it is typical in the bottom layers of eutrophic lakes due to organic matter decomposition concentration of op in the lake water was 0 45 mg po4 3 l 1 and it was set to 1 1 0 05 mg po4 3 l 1 by adding kh2po4 the concentration of 1 mg po4 3 l 1 was chosen as a representative level for eutrophic lakes whose waters show a wide range of op summer concentrations depending on time and depth from as low as 0 01 0 05 mg po4 3 l 1 bańkowska 2007 özkundakci et al 2011 read et al 2014 mikulski et al 2017 to orders of magnitude higher levels such as 0 5 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 mau et al 2004 dunalska et al 2007 łożyńska et al 2021 series of doses of gcc material ranging from 0 013 to 20 01 g l 1 epilimnion and from 0 020 to 20 08 g l 1 hypolimnion were added to centrifuge tubes further filled with the lake water adjusted to epilimnetic and hypolimnetic conditions with respect to ph table 1 hence mass ratio of the initial op to the added cc ranged from 0 06 to 85 mg g and 0 06 55 mg g respectively this ratio was further denoted as op cc mass ratio except for the lowest gcc dosages 0 013 and 0 020 g l 1 the mass of ggc applied in both variants epilimnion and hypolimnion was the same with some negligible deviations 2 5 within the lower doses range 0 04 0 4 g l 1 and up 0 5 within the higher doses range 1 0 20 g l 1 consequently except for the highest op cc mass ratios 85 and 55 mg g in epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively the op cc mass ratios in both variants were the same the gcc additions employed in the experiment were chosen to cover the range of cc doses which were used in earlier studies on op fixation onto cc which covered different op cc mass ratios these dosages were 0 20 g l 1 berg et al 2004 0 23 g l 1 or 0 40 g l 1 eiche et al 2008 and 0 40 g l 1 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 suspensions of gcc and the lake water were shaken for 24h 400 rpm on a horizontal shaker in the temperature of 25 c simulated epilimnion and 10 c simulated hypolimnion at the given ph temperature and ionic composition the lake water was oversaturated with respect to cc in epilimnetic water and subsaturated in the hypolimnetic water table 1 blank samples without gcc addition were prepared and treated the same way the experiments were conducted in two replicates after shaking ph of the suspensions was measured the suspensions were centrifuged 3000 rpm 10 and filtered through cellulose ester filters 0 45 µm for determination of op ca2 and alkalinity details of these measurements were provided in section 2 4 2 3 data analysis mass of op sorbed by the unit mass of gcc further called load was calculated based on the difference between initial and final op concentration q c 0 c i v m where q mg g 1 is the mass of po4 3 sorbed per unit mass of gcc co and ci is the initial and final op concentration mg po4 3 l 1 respectively v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of gcc g langmuir and freundlich adsorption models were used to quantitatively describe the sorption of op onto gcc the langmuir model assumes monolayer adsorption and its linear form is given by the following equation q q m a x k l c i 1 k l c i where q mg po4 3 g 1 is the modelled amount of op adsorbed per unit mass of gcc at equilibrium qmax is the maximum adsorption mg po4 3 g 1 k l is adsorption energy coefficient and ci is the op concentration at equilibrium mg po4 3 l 1 the freundlich adsorption model can be applied to complex systems with multilayer adsorption processes on heterogeneous surfaces and is described by the following equation q k f c 1 n where q mg po4 3 g 1 is the amount of po4 3 adsorbed per unit mass of gcc at equilibrium ci is the po4 3 concentration at equilibrium mg po4 3 l 1 and k f and n are freundlich constants the saturation indices si for cc and ca po4 compounds were calculated with the phreeqc software using solubilities provided in table 2 the index is basically determining whether a mineral will dissolve or precipitate at si values 0 oversaturation with respect to the mineral is assumed to occur whereas si 0 indicates subsaturation and si 0 indicates equilibrium nevertheless taking into account analytical and thermodynamic uncertainties equilibrium conditions are typically assumed at a wider si range of 0 5 si 0 5 deutsch siegel 1997 upchurch et al 2019 2 4 physio chemical measurements the ph of the water samples was measured using a standard electrode wtw germany ion chromatography isc 1000 dionex usa and direct titration merck no 11109 germany were used to

spectrophotometer unicam usa 3 results 3 1 sorption isotherms the isotherms present loads of op fixed onto gcc with respect to residual op concentration fig 1 the loads were the higher the lower was the dosage of gcc and the higher was the op cc mass ratio fig 1 for both experimental sets epilimnion and hypolimnion the isotherms are characterised by curved shape with clear inflections and can be divided into specific parts fig 1 the isotherm obtained for epilimnetic conditions starts with a logarithmic shaped section denoted as section a characterised by slowly increasing loads being in equilibrium with low increasing residual op concentration and well modelled with langmuir and freundlich adsorption models fig 1b table 3 this section corresponds to high gcc additions of 4 20 g l 1 and thus low initial op cc mass ratios of 0 06 0 28 mg g further part of the isotherm shows exponential course with substantially rising loads section b which could be satisfactorily modelled with freundlich equation only fig 1b table 3 gcc additions of 0 10 2 0 g l 1 and op cc mass ratios of 0 6 11 mg g the inflection of the isotherm from section a to section b takes place at a load q 0 22 mg po4 3 g 1 which is lower than the maximum adsorption capacity q max 0 27 mg po4 3 g 1 calculated for the section a from langmuir adsorption model table 3 within the highest loads the isotherm is linear the loads increase without meaningful change in residual op and are in equilibrium with high residual op concentration section c fig 1b this part of the isotherm represents loads resulting from low gcc additions of 0 013 0 08 g l 1 and high op cc mass ratio of 14 85 mg g the isotherm obtained under hypolimnetic conditions fig 1a c shows different course and shape it is less curved with only two distinguishable sections the logarithmic part section a corresponding to gcc additions of 1 20 08 g l 1 and op cc mass ratios of 0 06 1 1 mg g well modelled with both adsorption models table 3 and the linear part section c gcc additions of 0 02 0 4 g l 1 op cc mass ratios of 2 8 55 mg g the inflection of the isotherm in hypolimnion takes place at the same op load as in epilimnion q 0 22 mg po4 3 g 1 but at higher residual op concentration after the maximum adsorption was achieved fig 1c maximum adsorption calculated for section a in hypolimnion q max 0 20 mg po4 3 g 1 is lower as compared to epilimnion q max 0 27 mg po4 3 g 1 table 3 it has to be stressed that in epilimnion the loads obtained except for section a are generally higher as compared to corresponding loads in hypolimnion within section b the loads are on average 2 2 times higher q 0 22 0 82 mg po4 3 g 1 in epilimnion b versus q 0 13 0 44 mg po4 3 g 1 in hypolimnion upper part of section a and lower part of section c fig 1 similarly within section c of the isotherm epilimnetic loads are on average 82 higher q 1 33 2 84 mg po4 3 g 1 in epilimnion versus q 0 71 1 63 mg po4 3 g 1 in hypolimnion fig 1 however the highest loads recorded 2 84 and 1 63 mg po4 3 g 1 respectively can not be directly compared as they were achieved after adding different gcc doses 0 013 and 0 020 g l 1 and the resulting op cc mass ratio was much higher in epilimnion epilimnetic 85 mg g versus hypolimnetic 55 mg g if these maximum loads were however omitted the difference between the loads obtained within section c in epilimnion and corresponding loads in hypolimnion is even higher 87 on average fig 1a 3 2 water chemistry and saturation indices physio chemical parameters of the lake water and saturation indices after sorption experiment are presented in fig 2 4 these results were shown as a function of the remaining op concentration in order to easily relate thm to specific sections of the isotherms shown in fig 1 the higher residual op concentration the lower the gcc addition and the higher initial op cc mass ratio data presented in fig 2 4 were described according to the decreasing residual op concentration which corresponds to decreasing op loads in fig 1 and increasing additions of gcc chemistry of the lake water without addition of gcc blank solution after shaking in both epilimnetic and hypolimentic variants distinctly changed as compared to initial conditions revealing internal processes taking place figs 2 3 in epilimnion ph and alkalinity decreased from 9 0 and 2 7 mmol l 1 to 8 9 and 2 5 mmol l 1 lake water prior to shaking initial conditions versus lake water after the experiment blank respectively the values are given as means fig 2a c at the same time concentration of ca2 remained nearly the same mean concentrations were 47 mg l 1 and 46 mg l 1 accordingly fig 2b and slight decrease was recorded for sicc from the initial 1 4 to 1 3 in the blank solution after the experiment fig 2d under hypolimnetic conditions there was a reverse change of ph with ph increase from 7 1 to 7 3 initial conditions versus blank solution after the experiment respectively mean values fig 3a in contrast alkalinity decreased from 2 2 mmol l 1 to 1 8 mmol l 1 accordingly mean values fig 3c showing the same direction as observed in epilimnion fig 2c ca2 concentration remained almost unchanged mean concentrations were 51 mg l 1 initial conditions and 50 mg l 1 blank solution after shaking fig 3b whereas sicc slightly increased from 0 7 to 0 6 respectively fig 3d as compared to blank solutions additions of gcc further affected lake water chemistry figs 2 3 in epilimnion ph concentration of ca2 and consequently saturation of the lake water with respect to cc initially increased with decreasing op concentration and decreasing op cc mass ratios resulting from increasing gcc additions this was observed within op range corresponding to section c of the isotherm and upper part of section b fig 2a 2c concomitant rise in ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration clearly suggests dissolution of gcc which led to sicc increase to 1 5 fig 2d however further decline in residual op concentration resulting from increasing gcc dosages within section b and upper part of section a was accompanied by the drop of sicc fig 2d this is due to decrease in ph ca2 and alkalinity fig 2a 2c which points at precipitation of calcium carbonate within lower part of section a with decreasing residual op high gcc additions low op cc mass ratios ph ca2 and sicc were relatively stable fig 2 this was probably because sicc nearly approached equilibrium level here mean sicc 0 6 fig 2d under hypolimentic conditions similarly to epilimentic variant initial increase in ph ca2 and alkalinity and thus in sicc took place with decreasing residual op concertation increasing gcc additions decreasing op cc mass ratios within a range of op concentrations corresponding to the section c and upper part of the section a of the isotherm fig 3 these changes clearly suggest gcc dissolution with further declining op increasing gcc dosages decreasing op cc mass ratios corresponding to the lower part of section a ph and sicc were relatively stable fig 3a d in turn ca2 and alkalinity changed without clear trend although at the lowest op concentrations the highest gcc additions the lowest op gcc ratios both showed increasing tendency with decreasing op and increasing gcc dosage fig 3b c saturation of the lake water with respect to cc changed following the same pattern as ca2 and alkalinity and reached upper threshold of equilibrium level mean sic c 0 5 fig 3d saturation indices calculated for different ca po4 compounds show generally decreasing trend with decreasing residual op concentration increasing gcc doses decreasing op gcc ratio fig 4 under epilimnetic conditions oversaturation of the solution with respect to sc and hap was achieved over the whole range of the applied gcc doses whereas for acp and β tcp oversaturation was recorded within residual op concentration corresponding to section b and c of the isotherm fig 4a under hypolimnetic conditions the lake water was oversaturated with respect to sc and hap throughout the whole range of residual op and applied gcc mass and with respect to ß tcp only part of section c and a fig 4b 4 discussion 4 1 sorption mechanism under contrasting in lake conditions as derived from sorption isotherms shape of sorption isotherms can give a clue of kinetically driven formation of surface complexes or ripening processes stumm morgan 1996 typically the logarithmic like shape with loads increasing gradually with increasing residual op concentration which follow langmuir model is attributed to adsorptive binding inflection of the isotherm and its further linear or sigmoidal course indicate at the initialisation of ca po4 precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation holford mattingly 1975 freeman rowell 1981 stumm morgan 1996 zhou li 2001 yagi fukushi 2012 a specific case is an isotherm with exponential part being consistent with freundlich model which follows the first logarithmic part adsorption according to langmuir model and turns into linear section heterogeneous nucleation such a course of the isotherm represents adsorption followed by surface precipitation by solid solution formation which is than replaced by precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation farley et al 1985 stumm and morgan 1996 the isotherm obtained in the current work for epilimnetic conditions fig 1b clearly follows the above mentioned model with three sections indicating predomination of adsorption section a surface precipitation via solid solution formation section b and precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation section c under hypolimnetic conditions in turn two separated sections can be observed fig 1c pointing at adsorption section a and precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation section c without solid solution formation step under epilimnetic conditions calculated maximum adsorption was 35 higher than under hypolimnetic conditions table 2 which suggests favoured adsorption in epilimnion this effect can be explained by high ph and temperature alkaline ph promotes phosphate adsorption onto cc suzuki et al 1986 karageorgiou et al 2007 sø et al 2011 probably due to increased concentration of deprotonated phosphate species which are preferably bound to cc surface sø et al 2011 while high temperature enhances adsorption due to endothermic nature of this process griffin jurinak 1973 nevertheless it has to be noted that under epilimnetic conditions higher concentration of co3 2 was present as compared to hypolimnion due to alkaline ph causing changes in the speciation of carbonate species in the solution which should limit adsorption as carbonates compete with phosphate ions for sorption sites on the cc surface sø et al 2011 higher maximum adsorption in epilimnion suggests however that this limiting effect must have been compensated by previously mentioned factors enhancing adsorptive binding taking into account different op cc mass ratios corresponding to distinguished sections of the isotherms which represent specific binding mechanisms it can be concluded that under epilimnetic conditions about five times lower op cc mass ratio was needed to induce precipitation as compared to hypolimnion epilimnetic op cc 0 6 mg g versus hypolimnetic op cc 2 8 mg g respectively section 3 1 thus precipitation is to be expected at a wider range of gcc doses applied in epilimnion and in this term can be regarded as more probable as compared to hypolimnion where adsorption predominated at a wider range of the applied gcc doses and op cc mass ratios fig 1 promoting effect of epilimnetic conditions on precipitation processes is also expressed by the fact that in epilimnion much higher loads 87 higher on average were obtained in section c precipitation as compared to corresponding loads in hypolimnion moreover inflection of the isotherm took place despite the maximum adsorption was not achieved fig 1a this effect can be explained by high temperature and alkaline ph in epilimnion as both factors lower solubility of calcium phosphates and could hence promote their precipitation under epilimnetic conditions house 1999 sanciolo et al 2008 this is confirmed by saturation with respect to ca po4 compounds which show generally higher si values in epilimnion with four of the ca po4 minerals indicating oversaturation within section c of the isotherm in hypolimnion oversaturation was achieved only for two of them within this section fig 4 in addition to that in epilimnion high ph initial level of 9 0 table 1 could favor the precipitation of ca po4 by the fact that it can counteract the effect of some natural compounds probably present in the lake water that hamper precipitation process for example organic acids have been reported to strongly inhibit ca po4 formation at the ph 8 but at ph 9 this effect was very small song et al 2006b as previously stressed possibility of calcium phosphates formation was indicated by isotherms for both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic conditions although in the hypolimnetic set sorption processes did not involve formation of solid solution section b nevertheless taking into account low initial op concentration employed in this study 1 mg po4 3 l 1 precipitation of calcium phosphates obviously indicated by the shape of the isotherms seems to be a surprising result as this fixation mechanism is reported to occur at high initial op concentrations plant house 2002 li et al 2017 li et al 2020 li et al 2017 investigated phosphate sorption onto cc at different initial op concentrations ranging from 1 5 to 30 6 mg po4 3 l 1 initial ph ranging from 7 7 to 10 1 and contact time 0 5 24h the results showed precipitation of calcium phosphates at different levels of op ph and contact time nevertheless at initial ph 9 1 which is nearly the same as employed in the current study in epilimnetic variant ph 9 0 table 1 precipitation did not occur and adsorption dominated despite relatively high op level 30 6 mg po4 3 l 1 li et al 2017 which is substantially higher as op concentration employed in the current study 1 mg po4 3 l 1 this clearly contradicts results of the current study pointing at precipitation taking place under epilimnetic conditions as derived from the sorption isotherm furthermore the same authors stated that the lowest initial op concentration being sufficient for precipitation was 9 2 mg po4 3 l 1 at initial ph 7 7 and reaction time 24h sø et al 2011 reported faster onset of precipitation after 24h at only slightly higher initial op concentration of 9 5 mg po4 3 l 1 and similar initial ph 7 5 at lower initial op level 0 1 4 8 mg po4 3 l 1 any signs of precipitation occurred in this light precipitation of ca po4 compounds under modelled hypolimnetic conditions initial ph 7 0 contact time 24h initial op concentration 1 mg po4 3 l 1 although indicated by isotherms course and shape is also quite unexpected this discrepancy between literature and results of the current study can be due to different initial saturation conditions sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 investigated calcite interactions with op under equilibrium conditions while in the current work oversaturation and subsaturation epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively were employed both of these saturation states could have promoted precipitation of op with ca as previously stressed plant house 2002 berg et al 2004 moreover different ratios of initial op concentration to cc mass probably played an important role in the study of sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 op cc mass ratios were low 0 001 0 1 and 0 04 0 77 mg g respectively whereas in the current work op cc ratios were much higher up to 85 mg g within isotherms in parts a which indicate predominance of adsorption low op cc mass ratios were employed 0 06 0 28 mg g under epilimnetic and 0 06 1 1 mg g under hypolimnetic conditions which are similar to those in works by sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 in this term results of the current study are in agreement with those of sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 and point at mainly adsorption taking place at relatively low op concentration 1 mg po4 3 l 1 and low op cc ratios up to 1 1 mg g the dominance of adsorption at these low op cc mass ratios high gcc additions can be explained by a large surface area which was available for adsorption probably leading to fast and substantial op stripping from the solution adsorption is terminated within 2 3 hours while ca po4 precipitation needs at least 8 hours to set in sø et al 2011 hence it can be assumed that at low op cc mass ratio high calcite addition concentration of op left after very fast adsorption was too low so that ca po4 can form however within isotherms sections b and c precipitation gcc doses applied were very small so op cc ratios were high 0 6 11 and 14 85 mg g in epilimnion section b and c respectively and 2 8 55 mg g in hypolimnion section c these are much higher values as compared to op cc ratios corresponding to section a adsorption and those employed in the studies of sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 in this case sections b and c of the isotherms pointing at precipitation fig 1b c due to low mass of added gcc only a small surface area of calcite was present in the solution consequently adsorption was able to eliminate only portion of the available op and remaining op could take part in precipitation processes which set in later on this explains why precipitation could occur despite low initial op concentration therefore results of this study show that initial op cc ratio is an important factor controlling op binding mechanism onto cc as it affects op concentration available for processes other than adsorption similar pattern of op binding processes adsorption at high gcc dosages low op cc ratio and precipitation at low gcc dosages high op cc ratio was observed by eiche et al 2008 and bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 4 2 sorption mechanism as revealed by solution chemistry chemistry of the lake water can give important information about sorption mechanism as precipitation processes induce changes in ionic composition and physio chemical parameters of the solution as indicated in section 4 1 the isotherms suggest importance of calcium phosphates precipitation fig 1 which is also supported by saturation indices fig 4 under epilimnetic conditions formation of acp ß tcp and sc was thermodynamically possible as the lake water was saturated with respect to these phases within the section b and c precipitation fig 4a under hypolimnetic conditions in turn the lake water was saturated with respect to sc within the whole range of the applied gcc doses fig 4b interestingly in simulated epilimnion first inflection of the isotherm is accompanied by establishment of saturation of the lake water with respect to ß tcp and acp fig 4a bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 reported similar convergence between inversion point of the isotherm and saturation achieved for another ca po4 mineral ocp in experiments with initial op concentration of 4 1 mg po4 3 l 1 even though precipitation via solid solution section b of the isotherm in simulated epilimnion fig 1 does not require oversaturation of the solution with respect to any distinct phase stumm morgan 1996 establishment of saturation of the lake water with respect to ß tcp and acp within section b of the isotherm fig 4a seems to support importance of precipitation processes as derived from the sorption isotherms other results regarding solution chemistry shed some light on the sorption mechanism too under epilimnetic conditions clear correspondence between ph alkalinity and calcium concentration can be seen as all these parameters slightly increased after addition of small gcc doses section c and upper part of section b in the isotherm corresponding to precipitation fig 2a 2c for example ph increased from 8 9 blank to 9 2 gcc addition 0 2 g l 1 fig 2a these changes naturally suggest dissolution of gcc which is quite surprising as the lake water was initially oversaturated with respect to cc sicc 1 4 table 1 still it is possible that very fine crystals dissolved under these conditions stumm morgan 1996 the smallest crystals in the gcc material are 0 68 µm section 2 1 heberling et al 2016 stressed that solubility of the material is governed by the smallest particles slight change in ph and alkalinity despite oversaturation of the solution with respect to calcite can be also explained by the dissolution of amorphous calcium carbonate which is much more soluble than cc amorphous material could have been present in the gcc sample as it can be formed during grinding li et al 2014 heberling et al 2016 irrespectively on that slight increase in ca2 concentration within section b upper part and section c fig 2b rather contradicts the conclusion that precipitation took place precipitation was indicated by the sorption isotherms for these sections fig 1 in the case of precipitation ca2 drop should be observed due to ca2 striping by forming calcium phosphates however results suggest that portion of ca2 added to the system by gcc dissolution was higher than portion of ca2 used by ca po4 formation so ca2 removal by precipitation cannot be seen fig 2b dissolution of gcc indicated by simultaneous increase in ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration within section b and c assumed precipitation fig 2a 2c seems to even support conclusions derived from sorption isotherms which point at precipitation of ca po4 this is because dissolving cc supplies ca2 ions favouring formation of these compounds berg et al 2005 wan et al 2016 at the same time at higher additions of gcc in simulated epilimnion ph alkalinity and calcium showed strong decreasing trend corresponding to part of section b precipitation via solid solution formation and full section a adsorption fig 2a 2c simultaneous drop of ph and alkalinity accompanied by ca2 stripping from the solution suggests that cc precipitated during the experiment under epilimnetic conditions in that case co precipitation of op with cc should also be assumed as one of the sorption mechanisms contributing to op removal in epilimnion however it should be noted that drop in ph ca2 concentration and alkalinity can to some extent result from other processes than cc precipitation in the lake water during the experiment these could have been several internal processes not related to gcc addition such as decomposition of organic matter as it drives ph and alkalinity down kuivila murray 1984 this seems to be confirmed by the fact that both ph and alkalinity decreased in the blank sample no gcc addition as compared to the initial conditions in the lake water fig 2a 2c another possible process is ca2 complexation by organic compounds sinderal et al 2015 but this can be rather excluded as actually no changes in ca2 were recorded in the blank sample as compared to the initial conditions fig 2b in samples treated with gcc ca2 could have been also stripped by complexation with op adsorbing on the cc surface lin singer 2006 however the level of ph and ca2 in gcc treated samples reached lower values as compared to the blank solution no gcc addition within the lower part of section b and full section a fig 2a b the same was observed for alkalinity in part of section a fig 2c moreover all these parameters together with sicc generally decreased with increasing gcc addition fig 2 this indicates that decrease in ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration under epilimnetic conditions was in fact at least partially caused by cc precipitation in this case it should be assumed that op removal via co precipitation with cc played some role in this system this is in accordance with suzuki et al 1986 and plant house 2002 who claimed importance of co precipitation under oversaturation of the solution with respect to cc nevertheless it has to be noted that cc precipitation is strongly inhibited or retarded by phosphate ions which block active crystal growth sites on the crystal surface this effect was reported to take place at similar or even lower concentrations of op as employed in the current study 0 10 0 48 mg po4 3 l 1 lin singer 2006 0 57 0 95 mg po4 3 l 1 dove hochella 1993 0 24 mg po4 3 l 1 house et al 1986 and is generally the more pronounced the lower the oversaturation with respect to cc plant house 2002 lin singer 2006 reported substantial reduction of cc precipitation rate by about 50 at initial op concertation being two times lower than used in the current work 0 48 mg po4 3 l 1 vs 1 mg po4 3 l 1 and at much higher oversaturation 5 3 vs 1 4 thus in the current study only limited importance of cc precipitation should be expected due to inhibitory effect of op on the other hand it can be assumed that precipitation of cc in the natural lake water was also affected by other substances which are known to retard or block growth of cc crystals such as humic acids sinderal et al 2015 magnesium tang et al 2020 or iron house donaldson 1986 however clear signs of cc precipitation as previously mentioned were recorded in the lake water chemistry under epilimnetic conditions at medium to high gcc additions corresponding to section b lower part and full section a of the isotherm fig 2 therefore cc precipitation although probably limited played some role in the system most probably contributing to op removal via co precipitation the question arises as to what was the contribution of co precipitation within section a adsorption as signs of cc precipitation were mainly recorded after adding gcc doses corresponding to this section as co precipitation involves only small part of cc surface ca 2 and adsorption can take place on the remaining surface house and donaldson 1986 co precipitation was likely a kind of accompanying mechanism within section a dominated by adsorption in contrast who obtained similar sorption isotherms for po4 3 uptake onto monohydrocalcite attributed the first logarithmic section of the isotherm to predomination of co precipitation process however in the current study co precipitation cannot be assumed as a sole op binding mechanism within section a adsorption as relationship between ca2 and po4 3 removal from the lake water calculated as molar mass ratio ca p accounted for 19 33 this is less than ca p ratios reported for pure co precipitation which are higher than 50 house 1999 danen louwerse et al 1995 dittrich et al 2011 thus recorded ca p ratios 19 33 can not be result of co precipitation alone on the other hand obtained ca p ratios are much higher than expected for calcium phosphates precipitation ca p 1 3 table 2 and adsorption of cahpo4 0 aq complex ca p 1 therefore changes in the lake water chemistry and recorded ca p ratios together with good fit to adsorption models suggest that adsorption prevailed within section a of the isotherm in epilimnion but was accompanied by co precipitation under hypolimnetic conditions changes in the lake water chemistry were also directional fig 3 and show distinct dissolution of gcc which was expected due to initial subsaturation of the solution with respect to cc table 1 similarly ramisch et al 1999 reported intense dissolution of naturally precipitated cc during its settling in the hypolimnion of deep eutrophic lakes interestingly in the hypolimnetic variant the most intense changes in ph ca2 and alkalinity can be observed after small and medium gcc dosages which correspond to section c precipitation of the isotherm fig 3a 3c this observation seems to support postulated ca po4 precipitation in hypolimnion as dissolution of cc is a factor initiating ca po4 formation donnert et al 2002 berg et al 2004 wang et al 2012 within section a adsorption ph ca2 alkalinity and hence sicc were rather stable and did not show distinct changes with increasing gcc additions fig 3a 3c this is mainly due to the fact that saturation with respect to cc achieved equilibrium level here sicc within section a was 0 3 0 5 fig 3d however it is worth to note that ph ca2 and alkalinity within section a adsorption were higher than in the blank solution indicating dissolution of gcc taking place also within this section fig 3a 3c the question is why this did not initiate ca po4 formation as it obviously did within section c precipitation this should be attributed to large specific surface area which was available due to high gcc doses corresponding to section a as previously discussed most of op was fast stripped from the lake water by adsorption so the remaining op concentration was probably too low for ca po4 to form 4 3 implications for op inactivation in lakes as this study showed if cc is regarded as potential p binding agent its behaviour and p sorption mechanism will be different depending on the environmental conditions during and after application it was demonstrated that sorption mechanism will also depend on the dosage of gcc with respect to actual op concentration in epilimnion precipitation processes as op fixation mechanism will be more likely to occur presence of calcite in the water column as fixed in or onto a carrier according the approach of non invasive phosphate removal can support natural cc precipitation and consequently p co precipitation in contrast in hypolimnion adsorption can take place at a wider range of the material doses used fig 1 irrespectively of that adsorption will take place in the very initial phase after application as it proceeds very fast kuo lotse 1972 due to the fact that op adsorbed on cc can be easily desorbed if op concentration will substantially drop millero et al 2001 there is a risk of op release some of this op can be than fixed again by precipitation during further cc exposure in water still time of exposure of the material in the lake needs to be optimised to ensure possibly high sorption and reduce desorption risk op removal efficiency can be enhanced or remain unaffected by in lake conditions depending on gcc dose under epilimnetic conditions higher efficiency is expected due to onset of precipitation at a wider range of gcc doses and higher op removal via precipitation fig 1 as well as higher adsorption table 3 in this term as compared to hypolimnion application of gcc into epilimnion will require lower doses of gcc to achieve the same level of op removal assuming the same initial op concentration nevertheless it has to be stressed that irrespectively of physio chemical conditions in the lake the prevailing sorption mechanism will be strongly affected by the dose of gcc applied as indicated by the sorption isotherms the higher the dose the higher the probability of adsorption fig 1 application into hypolimnion will result in dissolution of cc material as was observed for gcc fig 3 in the field rate of dissolution will be controlled mainly by saturation conditions with respect to cc they can be especially inconvenient at the end of summer stagnation due to co2 accumulation during the season at the same time end of summer stagnation seems to be the best time for hypolimnion treatment as p can accumulate in hypolimnion as stratification progresses eg dunalska et al 2007 read et al 2014 hypolimnion treatment should result in op sorption and removal from this layer leading to reduced p supply to the photic zone during the autumn turnover and thus limiting the lakes productivity in this term application of p binding agent into hypolimnion shortly before mixing starts seems to be the most reasonable solution to achieve the desired effect on op cycling however such timing would be probably also related to the highest dissolution rate of cc due to hypolimnetic co2 accumulation during the season dissolution of gcc as observed in hypolimnion questions the basic premise of the non invasive p removal method this approach assumes that the p binding agent applied in or on carriers bags laminates will be pulled out after given time to avoid its deposition in the environment burska et al 2019 zamparas et al 2020 if calcite partially dissolves some of its mass initially applied will not be possible to be extracted from the lake after the finished treatment the amount of gcc dissolved during the experiment under hypolimnetic conditions is hard to asses numerous processes shaped hydrochemistry of the lake water and thus strongly affected carbonate alkalinity and calcium concentration which could be used to determine mass of the dissolved gcc rough estimation showed that at high gcc additions not more than 3 of the initial mass undergone dissolution at lower dosages this could be even 20 this is because dissolution dominates as long as equilibrium will be achieved housecroft sharpe 2007 so it can be predicted that irrespectively of the mass of the applied gcc there is a maximum amount of cc which can get dissolved under the same initial conditions in the solution thus at high cc doses which can be required for satisfactory reduction of op level only minor part by percentage of the cc mass applied will be lost by dissolution therefore the vast majority of the applied material will be probably preserved in hypolimnion and thus removable loss of cc resulting from dissolution will depend on in lake conditions i a saturation with respect to calcite in hypolimnion and grain size of the applied cc material as smaller grains are more prone to dissolution ramisch et al 1999 thus due to problem of cc dissolution application of very fine cc powdered materials to hypolimnion should be avoided median particle size of synthetic cc materials can be even smaller than 0 1 µm heberling et al 2016 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 apart from the fact that dissolution of cc will make it impossible to remove all the mass of cc applied it will also affect physio chemical conditions in the lake water ph increase in hypolimnion from nearly neutral to moderately alkaline up to 8 2 in the experiments fig 3a caused by gcc dissolution can induce p release due to ligand exchange effect on fe p al p compounds in sediment lewandowski 2002 huang et al 2005 sobczyński 2009 however this negative effect of ph increase is lower if it s accompanied by ca2 supply as ca2 is another next to fe and al p binding metal in sediments dittrich et al 2011 increase in ph ca2 and alkalinity resulting from cc dissolution can potentially support op precipitation with calcium compounds at the sediment water interface as ca p compounds are considered to be non mobile in contrast to the mobile al fe p compounds lewandowski 2002 this will lead to increased op retention in sediment moreover products of cc dissolution are natural components of surface water in the experiments their concentration remained at the natural level up to 62 mg ca2 l 1 and alkalinity of max 2 50 mmol l even after adding the highest dosages of gcc hence cc dissolution should not be an alarming issue in terms of changing hydrochemistry as long as cc dissolution will show stronger effect on op retention in sediments with ca compounds than on op release from al fe compounds nevertheless application of gcc should be carefully considered at near bottom depths especially in soft water lakes saturation conditions and grain size of the cc material which are important for potential cc dissolution and its effects have to be taken into account prior to treatment in epilimnion very slight gcc dissolution was recorded after additions of small gcc doses with ph increase by 0 05 0 3 as compared to blank solution fig 2a but symptoms of cc precipitation were observed after treatment with higher gcc doses with ph decrease by 0 1 0 6 as compared to blank solution fig 2a in field practice rather high doses of cc will be required to achieve satisfactory reduction in op concentration leading to ph drop moreover with respect to the initial ph value 9 0 table 1 ph of the epilimnetic water decreased by 0 1 0 8 after addition of gcc dosages except for three of them for which actually no ph change was recorded fig 2a lowering of the ph level in epilimnion was somehow expected due to initial oversaturation with respect to cc epilimnion treatment using the p binding agent fixed onto a carrier according to the non invasive p removal approach will result in reduced op concentration and thus limit the lake s productivity if cc will be used lowering of the ph in the trophogenic zone will also be a result as lowered ph can limit abundance of some cyanobacteria species huisman hulot 2005 cc effect on ph can be considered an additional supporting mechanism of the lakes recovery due to treatment the results obtained in this study are representative for the cc based material used application of other cc based material depending on its grain size and surface area may result in somehow different cc behaviour and partly different pattern of op interactions with calcite for example with decrease in grain size higher or faster dissolution of cc materials can be expected berg et al 2004 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 this can lead to 1 limitations regarding p binding agent removal from the lake after the treatment is terminated and 2 more pronounced ph and alkalinity changes especially in hypolimnion as compared to cc based material showing lower dissolution potential which will in turn 3 affect op binding processes i e by changing saturation with respect to cc and ca po4 in case of finely grained materials higher importance of adsorption can be assumed too due to their larger specific surface area cc based materials are highly variable in terms of physical properties for example surface area of cc materials investigated as potential p binding agents in lakes ranged from 1 to 70 m2 g 1 eiche et al 2008 berg et al 2004 ding et al 2012 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 nevertheless the current work shows clear effect of epililmentic vs hypolimnetic conditions on cc interactions with calcite with precipitation processes prevailing in epilimnion as compared to hypolimnion if initial op concentration in both systems is the same as interactions of cc with op are to a high degree determined by physio chemical conditions in the solution this relative pattern can be expected in case of other cc based materials too of course it s impossible not to mention the importance of op concentration which is typically higher in hypolimnion as compared to epilimnion wetzel 2001 weiner matthews 2003 op can accumulate in hypolimnion during the season leading to stepwise increase in p concentration eg dunalska et al 2007 read et al 2014 with increasing op in hypolimnion higher probability of precipitation can be expected in case of the same cc based material on the other hand with decreasing op concentration in epilimnion higher importance of op co precipitation and or lower importance of ca po4 precipitation can be predicted under large differences between epi and hypolimnetic op concentrations the ultimate pattern of op binding onto calcite will be probably determined by combined effect of physio chemical conditions ca alkalinity ph temperature op as they influence i e adsorption and solubility of cc and ca po4 the current work did not covered issue of changing op concentration as its aim was to assess the relative effect of over and subsaturation with respect to cc which are mainly determined by different ph and temperature typically occurring during summer in lakes however further studies considering changing op concentration under contrasting in lake saturation conditions are needed 5 conclusions op removal expressed as op loads measured as unit sorption was higher in epilimnion showing promoting effect of epilimnetic conditions on op fixation onto cc most probably caused by combined effect of high ph temperature and saturation with respect to cc and ca po4 irrespectively of initial environmental conditions epilimnetic vs hypolimnetic op fixation onto gcc proceeded through adsorption in epilimnion accompanied probably by co precipitation or ca po4 precipitation depending on initial op cc ratio resulting from different gcc doses in general at low op cc ratios adsorption prevailed whereas higher op cc ratios resulted in precipitation most probably at low op cc ratio adsorption onto relatively large surface area took place due to large gcc doses applied leading to substantial stripping of op from the lake water in the initial stage of the experiment so that not sufficient op was available for the precipitation processes which set in in the further stage at high initial op cc ratio low gcc dose only small part of op could be removed via adsorption so that relatively high op concentration left which were high enough to provide saturation with respect to ca po4 compounds and enabled their precipitation however mechanism of ca po4 precipitation differed under conditions employed with surface precipitation through solid solution formation at intermediate op cc ratios and precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation at high initial op cc ratios in epilimnion whereas in hypolimnion only the latter mechanism of precipitation was recorded in addition to that in hypolimnion ca po4 precipitation took place at higher op cc ratio smaller range of the applied gcc doses thus showing lower probability of precipitation and higher probability of adsorption application of cc based material into hypolimnion will result in partial dissolution of cc therefore most of the applied cc mass but not all of it is expected to be removable after the finished treatment application into epilimnion will result in a ph drop which can help limit occurrence of some cyanobacteria species declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the study was performed within a project probiowoda no gekon 2 03 267948 21 2016 funded

988,calcite cc has been tested as a potential phosphorus p binding agent to be used for non invasive p removal from lakes in this approach p binding agent is placed in the water column and subsequently removed together with the sorbed p mechanism of orthophosphate op sorption onto cc and cc behaviour were investigated under epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temperature ph and saturation with respect to cc 25 c ph 9 0 saturation index for cc sicc 1 4 and 10 c ph 7 1 sicc 0 7 respectively at an initial op concentration of 1 mg po4 3 l 1 in the range of cc dosages of 0 01 20 1 g l 1 resulting in op cc mass ratios of 0 06 85 mg g prevailing op binding processes were adsorption and precipitation depending on op cc mass ratio adsorption predominated at low op cc and precipitation at high op cc under epilimnetic conditions approximately five times lower op cc mass ratio was needed to induce precipitation as compared to hypolimnion indicating at a greater probability of precipitation in epilimnion while adsorption was more likely to occur in hypolimnion in epilimnion co precipitation of op was also involved together with adsorption calculated maximum adsorption was 35 higher in epilimnion whereas obtained precipitation rates measured as unit sorption were 87 higher showing promoting effect of epilimnetic conditions on op removal application of cc into epilimnion will result in a ph drop which can reduce occurrence of cyanobacteria application of cc into hypolimnion will result in its partial dissolution while most of the applied cc mass will be removable after the finished treatment keywords calcite orthophosphate sorption p immoblisation lake restoration non invasive phosphate removal 1 introduction inactivation of phosphorus p in eutrophic water bodies has been widely applied eutrophication mitigation strategy its aim is to immobilise the most available form of phosphorus orthophosphate op to reduce algal productivity cooke et al 2005 this is typically achieved by application of a p binding agent into water where sorption processes fast strip op from the water column and by further p immobilisation in sediments after the p binding agent has reached the lake s bottom numerous p binding agents have been applied worldwide with the most commonly used coagulants such as al or fe salts and a solid material lanthanum modified bentonite cooke et al 2005 gibbs hickey 2018 the method has been generally proven to be successful in reducing p release from sediment gołdyn et al 2014 dithmer et al 2016 huser et al 2016 grochowska et al 2019 although multiple applications of p binding agent are frequently required to achieve desirable effect lürling van oosterhout 2013 zamparas zacharias 2014 unfortunately some risks and uncertainties are related to this technology including translocation of p binding agent and its accumulation in non target areas of the lake s bottom van hullebusch et al 2002 huser et al 2016 and limited longevity resulting from resuspension bioturbation or change in the physio chemical conditions or aging cooke et al 1993 hupfer hilt 2008 reitzel et al 2013 dithmer et al 2016 welch et al 2017 van oosterhout et al 2020 on the other hand some non target effects such as increased concentration of metals wauer teien 2010 van oosterhout et al 2020 łopata et al 2020 and increased sensitivity of aquatic biota schumaker et al 1993 van oosterhout lürling 2011 have also been reported in response to these limitations an alternate method of p binding agent application into water bodies has recently been proposed its principle is the application of a p binding agent fixed in or onto a carrier as filling of bags burska et al 2019 zamparas et al 2020 or as a coating of the so called laminates bańkowska sobczak et al 2019 both solutions assume introduction of the p binding agent fixed in or onto a carrier into the lake for a specific time and its subsequent removal from the ecosystem together with the sorbed op by doing so not only the op immobilization but also its removal can be achieved another advantage of this approach is the fact that the p biding agent does not remain in the aquatic environment which fundamentally reduces non target effects resulting from agent accumulation and possible op release for that reason this approach was called non invasive phosphate removal bańkowska sobczak et al 2019 pryputniewicz flis et al 2021 moreover the newly proposed method use of a p binding agent fixed in or onto a carrier enables application of a p binding agent to target depths depending on the actual op distribution in the water column zamparas et al 2020 due to the fact that in lakes physio chemical conditions substantially change with depth which can strongly affect op sorption it is important to predict behaviour of a p binding agent under conditions typically occurring at specific lake s depths or layers in this study calcite cc has been investigated as a potential candidate to be used as a p binding agent in non invasive phosphate removal approach cc is a calcium carbonate mineral it is known to play an important role in p cycling in the aquatic environment golterman 2004 cc is naturally formed in water bodies mainly during intense photosynthesis due to enhanced ph resulting from co2 sequestration by plants and algae which lowers cc solubility stabel 1986 dittrich koschel 2002 during cc precipitation in the aquatic environment op is adsorbed onto cc crystals and partly incorporated into their structure this phenomenon called p co precipitation with cc has been recognised as an important self purification mechanism in hard water ecosystems danen louwerse et al 1995 neal 2002 walsh et al 2019 thus different powdered cc based materials have been used as p binding agents for lake restoration purposes klapper 1992 stüben et al 1998 prepas et al 2001 hupfer 2004 previously ca oh 2 was applied to induce artificial cc precipitation dittrich et al 2011 murphy et al 1993 but its use was given up due to rapid ph increase leading to harmful effects on aquatic biota miskimmin et al 1995 zhang prepas 1996 cc was further proposed as a nature based solution not leading to rapid changes in physio chemical conditions and thus securing high environmental safety of p inactivation berg 2001 walpersdorf et al 2004 ditrrich et al 2011 further works on cc application in lakes and reservoirs focused on active barriers onto sediment surface see for example berg et al 2004 lin et al 2011 ding et al 2012 yu et al 2018 and calcite application into the sediment using controlled resuspension bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 which all aimed at reduction of p internal loading apart from co precipitation of p cc is able to remove op from the solution by other mechanism these are adsorption without op incorporation into crystal lattice which only takes place during co precipitation griffin jurinak 1973 plant house 2002 and precipitation of op with calcium in form of different calcium phosphate compounds ca po4 xu et al 2014 op adsorption onto cc proceeds by binding of cahpo4 0 aq complex to the cc surface lin singer 2006 xu et al 2014 is endothermic griffin jurinak 1973 and reversible freeman rowell 1981 millero et al 2001 in contrast to that other op fixation mechanisms induced by cc ensure stable op removal which is attributed to the incorporation of op into the cc crystal lattice co precipitation and relatively low solubility of ca po4 precipitation freeman rowell 1981 valsami jones 2001 naidu and scherer 2014 occurrence of the above mentioned op removal mechanisms is mainly controlled by saturation of the solution with respect to cc if the solution is oversaturated cc precipitates leading to co precipitation of op suzuki et al 1986 plant house 2002 however at high concentrations phosphate ions retard or fully inhibit precipitation of cc and thus op co precipitation sawada 1997 lin singer 2006 however this effect can be to some extent overcome by high oversaturation of the solution with respect to cc plant house 2002 on the other hand increasing op concentration under oversaturation may promote ca po4 formation plant house 2002 if the solution is subsaturated cc dissolves enhancing ph and supplying ca2 ions which may result in a dissolution induced ca po4 formation berg et al 2005 donnert et al 2002 ruiz agudo et al 2013 wang et al 2012 in equilibrium conditions with respect to cc adsorption of op is expected to dominate at low op concentrations whereas at high op levels precipitation sets in sø et al 2011 li et al 2017 2020 important factors determining op fixation on cc are also ph and temperature as they affect solubility of cc and thus saturation conditions with respect to cc solubility of ca po4 compounds house 1999 and adsorption rate griffin jurinak 1973 sø et al 2011 in addition to that ph influences cc surface chemistry van cappellen 1993 mechanism of op binding onto calcite is also dependent on the solid solution ratio bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 properties of cc based materials mainly particle size and specific surface area also play important role in shaping op cc interactions as they determine adsorption rate and dissolution potential berg et al 2004 eiche et al 2008 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 in eutrophic lakes the previously mentioned conditions important for op interactions with cc saturation with respect to cc temperature ph change with depth due to thermal stratification and biological processes in summer high temperature and alkaline ph occur in epilimnion the latter resulting from intense photosynthesis stabel 1986 whereas in hypolimnion relatively low temperature and low ph prevail the latter resulting from decomposition of organic matter dean 1999 müller et al 2006 because of this contrasting saturation conditions with respect to cc can occur in eutrophic lakes with oversaturation in epilimnion and subsaturation in hypolimnion dean 1999 dean 2002 roeser et al 2016 many studies freeman rowell 1981 donnert et al 2002 song et al 2006a karageorgiou et al 2007 sanciolo et al 2008 lin et al 2011 xu et al 2014 wan et al 2016 qin et al 2018 li et al 2020 investigated interactions between cc and op at very high initial op concentrations which are fairly higher than typically found in lakes water column the range applied in the above listed papers was from 15 mg po4 3 l 1 to as high as 3060 mg po4 3 l 1 and thus cannot be used to predict op mechanism removal onto cc in natural water bodies although op concentrations representative for the aquatic environment have already been employed in numerous works eg house donaldson 1986 plant house 2002 lin singer 2006 sø et al 2011 li et al 2017 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 łożyńska et al 2020 none of them compared calcite interactions with op under initial subsaturation and oversaturation such a comparison at lake specific levels of op was involved by eiche et al 2008 and berg 2001 however eiche et al 2008 did not compare op fixation onto cc in subsaturation and oversaturation conditions for the same cc based material and both conditions were modelled for the same temperature 20 c finally berg 2001 and berg at al 2004 compared op removal onto calcite for the same calcite based material under both oversaturation and subsaturation with respect to calcite but in that work different saturation states resulted mainly from differences in ph and alkalinity but not from the temperature hence to our knowledge a comparative analysis of cc interactions with op in over and subsaturation reflecting lake specific conditions typically found in epilimion high ph and temperature and hypolimnion low ph and temperature is still lacking therefore in the current work mechanism of op removal onto cc was investigated under conditions mimicking epilimnion and hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes differing in temperature ph and thus saturation with respect to cc sorption isotherms and thermodynamic modelling were used to determine op fixation processes and op sorption efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 cc material the cc material used was ground calcium carbonate gcc obtained from limestone deposits in southern poland the material is commercially available as flue gas desulphurization sorbent grain size of the material is 0 68 52 µm with the median of 10 µm and its specific surface area measured with n2 adsorption method bet is 1 83 m2 g 1 calcium carbonate constitutes min 95 of the material by mass 2 2 batch tests batch experiments were conducted in a lake water sampled in summer 2016 from the lake głębokie located in nw poland the mean and the maximum depth of the lake are 10 1 m and 21 9 m respectively the lake is stratified with high biological productivity and anoxia occurring in the thermocline and in the hypolimnion mggp ioś 2010 in 2016 the total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations in the trophogenic zone were 0 02 0 06 mg p l 1 and 2 7 5 4 mg n l 1 respectively with op concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 0 06 mg po4 3 l 1 mai august burska et al 2017 during summer stratification anoxia established at the depth of 15 m and the ph dropped from 8 5 surface to 7 1 near bottom burska et al 2017 the lake water sampled for the experiment was spiked with 1mhcl or 1mnaoh to achieve ph typically found in epilimnion and hypolimnion of eutrophic stratified lakes table 1 alkaline ph was adjusted for the epilimnion to mimic conditions typically present during algal blooms table 1 for hypolimnion nearly neutral ph was modelled table 1 as it is typical in the bottom layers of eutrophic lakes due to organic matter decomposition concentration of op in the lake water was 0 45 mg po4 3 l 1 and it was set to 1 1 0 05 mg po4 3 l 1 by adding kh2po4 the concentration of 1 mg po4 3 l 1 was chosen as a representative level for eutrophic lakes whose waters show a wide range of op summer concentrations depending on time and depth from as low as 0 01 0 05 mg po4 3 l 1 bańkowska 2007 özkundakci et al 2011 read et al 2014 mikulski et al 2017 to orders of magnitude higher levels such as 0 5 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 mau et al 2004 dunalska et al 2007 łożyńska et al 2021 series of doses of gcc material ranging from 0 013 to 20 01 g l 1 epilimnion and from 0 020 to 20 08 g l 1 hypolimnion were added to centrifuge tubes further filled with the lake water adjusted to epilimnetic and hypolimnetic conditions with respect to ph table 1 hence mass ratio of the initial op to the added cc ranged from 0 06 to 85 mg g and 0 06 55 mg g respectively this ratio was further denoted as op cc mass ratio except for the lowest gcc dosages 0 013 and 0 020 g l 1 the mass of ggc applied in both variants epilimnion and hypolimnion was the same with some negligible deviations 2 5 within the lower doses range 0 04 0 4 g l 1 and up 0 5 within the higher doses range 1 0 20 g l 1 consequently except for the highest op cc mass ratios 85 and 55 mg g in epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively the op cc mass ratios in both variants were the same the gcc additions employed in the experiment were chosen to cover the range of cc doses which were used in earlier studies on op fixation onto cc which covered different op cc mass ratios these dosages were 0 20 g l 1 berg et al 2004 0 23 g l 1 or 0 40 g l 1 eiche et al 2008 and 0 40 g l 1 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 suspensions of gcc and the lake water were shaken for 24h 400 rpm on a horizontal shaker in the temperature of 25 c simulated epilimnion and 10 c simulated hypolimnion at the given ph temperature and ionic composition the lake water was oversaturated with respect to cc in epilimnetic water and subsaturated in the hypolimnetic water table 1 blank samples without gcc addition were prepared and treated the same way the experiments were conducted in two replicates after shaking ph of the suspensions was measured the suspensions were centrifuged 3000 rpm 10 and filtered through cellulose ester filters 0 45 µm for determination of op ca2 and alkalinity details of these measurements were provided in section 2 4 2 3 data analysis mass of op sorbed by the unit mass of gcc further called load was calculated based on the difference between initial and final op concentration q c 0 c i v m where q mg g 1 is the mass of po4 3 sorbed per unit mass of gcc co and ci is the initial and final op concentration mg po4 3 l 1 respectively v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of gcc g langmuir and freundlich adsorption models were used to quantitatively describe the sorption of op onto gcc the langmuir model assumes monolayer adsorption and its linear form is given by the following equation q q m a x k l c i 1 k l c i where q mg po4 3 g 1 is the modelled amount of op adsorbed per unit mass of gcc at equilibrium qmax is the maximum adsorption mg po4 3 g 1 k l is adsorption energy coefficient and ci is the op concentration at equilibrium mg po4 3 l 1 the freundlich adsorption model can be applied to complex systems with multilayer adsorption processes on heterogeneous surfaces and is described by the following equation q k f c 1 n where q mg po4 3 g 1 is the amount of po4 3 adsorbed per unit mass of gcc at equilibrium ci is the po4 3 concentration at equilibrium mg po4 3 l 1 and k f and n are freundlich constants the saturation indices si for cc and ca po4 compounds were calculated with the phreeqc software using solubilities provided in table 2 the index is basically determining whether a mineral will dissolve or precipitate at si values 0 oversaturation with respect to the mineral is assumed to occur whereas si 0 indicates subsaturation and si 0 indicates equilibrium nevertheless taking into account analytical and thermodynamic uncertainties equilibrium conditions are typically assumed at a wider si range of 0 5 si 0 5 deutsch siegel 1997 upchurch et al 2019 2 4 physio chemical measurements the ph of the water samples was measured using a standard electrode wtw germany ion chromatography isc 1000 dionex usa and direct titration merck no 11109 germany were used to

spectrophotometer unicam usa 3 results 3 1 sorption isotherms the isotherms present loads of op fixed onto gcc with respect to residual op concentration fig 1 the loads were the higher the lower was the dosage of gcc and the higher was the op cc mass ratio fig 1 for both experimental sets epilimnion and hypolimnion the isotherms are characterised by curved shape with clear inflections and can be divided into specific parts fig 1 the isotherm obtained for epilimnetic conditions starts with a logarithmic shaped section denoted as section a characterised by slowly increasing loads being in equilibrium with low increasing residual op concentration and well modelled with langmuir and freundlich adsorption models fig 1b table 3 this section corresponds to high gcc additions of 4 20 g l 1 and thus low initial op cc mass ratios of 0 06 0 28 mg g further part of the isotherm shows exponential course with substantially rising loads section b which could be satisfactorily modelled with freundlich equation only fig 1b table 3 gcc additions of 0 10 2 0 g l 1 and op cc mass ratios of 0 6 11 mg g the inflection of the isotherm from section a to section b takes place at a load q 0 22 mg po4 3 g 1 which is lower than the maximum adsorption capacity q max 0 27 mg po4 3 g 1 calculated for the section a from langmuir adsorption model table 3 within the highest loads the isotherm is linear the loads increase without meaningful change in residual op and are in equilibrium with high residual op concentration section c fig 1b this part of the isotherm represents loads resulting from low gcc additions of 0 013 0 08 g l 1 and high op cc mass ratio of 14 85 mg g the isotherm obtained under hypolimnetic conditions fig 1a c shows different course and shape it is less curved with only two distinguishable sections the logarithmic part section a corresponding to gcc additions of 1 20 08 g l 1 and op cc mass ratios of 0 06 1 1 mg g well modelled with both adsorption models table 3 and the linear part section c gcc additions of 0 02 0 4 g l 1 op cc mass ratios of 2 8 55 mg g the inflection of the isotherm in hypolimnion takes place at the same op load as in epilimnion q 0 22 mg po4 3 g 1 but at higher residual op concentration after the maximum adsorption was achieved fig 1c maximum adsorption calculated for section a in hypolimnion q max 0 20 mg po4 3 g 1 is lower as compared to epilimnion q max 0 27 mg po4 3 g 1 table 3 it has to be stressed that in epilimnion the loads obtained except for section a are generally higher as compared to corresponding loads in hypolimnion within section b the loads are on average 2 2 times higher q 0 22 0 82 mg po4 3 g 1 in epilimnion b versus q 0 13 0 44 mg po4 3 g 1 in hypolimnion upper part of section a and lower part of section c fig 1 similarly within section c of the isotherm epilimnetic loads are on average 82 higher q 1 33 2 84 mg po4 3 g 1 in epilimnion versus q 0 71 1 63 mg po4 3 g 1 in hypolimnion fig 1 however the highest loads recorded 2 84 and 1 63 mg po4 3 g 1 respectively can not be directly compared as they were achieved after adding different gcc doses 0 013 and 0 020 g l 1 and the resulting op cc mass ratio was much higher in epilimnion epilimnetic 85 mg g versus hypolimnetic 55 mg g if these maximum loads were however omitted the difference between the loads obtained within section c in epilimnion and corresponding loads in hypolimnion is even higher 87 on average fig 1a 3 2 water chemistry and saturation indices physio chemical parameters of the lake water and saturation indices after sorption experiment are presented in fig 2 4 these results were shown as a function of the remaining op concentration in order to easily relate thm to specific sections of the isotherms shown in fig 1 the higher residual op concentration the lower the gcc addition and the higher initial op cc mass ratio data presented in fig 2 4 were described according to the decreasing residual op concentration which corresponds to decreasing op loads in fig 1 and increasing additions of gcc chemistry of the lake water without addition of gcc blank solution after shaking in both epilimnetic and hypolimentic variants distinctly changed as compared to initial conditions revealing internal processes taking place figs 2 3 in epilimnion ph and alkalinity decreased from 9 0 and 2 7 mmol l 1 to 8 9 and 2 5 mmol l 1 lake water prior to shaking initial conditions versus lake water after the experiment blank respectively the values are given as means fig 2a c at the same time concentration of ca2 remained nearly the same mean concentrations were 47 mg l 1 and 46 mg l 1 accordingly fig 2b and slight decrease was recorded for sicc from the initial 1 4 to 1 3 in the blank solution after the experiment fig 2d under hypolimnetic conditions there was a reverse change of ph with ph increase from 7 1 to 7 3 initial conditions versus blank solution after the experiment respectively mean values fig 3a in contrast alkalinity decreased from 2 2 mmol l 1 to 1 8 mmol l 1 accordingly mean values fig 3c showing the same direction as observed in epilimnion fig 2c ca2 concentration remained almost unchanged mean concentrations were 51 mg l 1 initial conditions and 50 mg l 1 blank solution after shaking fig 3b whereas sicc slightly increased from 0 7 to 0 6 respectively fig 3d as compared to blank solutions additions of gcc further affected lake water chemistry figs 2 3 in epilimnion ph concentration of ca2 and consequently saturation of the lake water with respect to cc initially increased with decreasing op concentration and decreasing op cc mass ratios resulting from increasing gcc additions this was observed within op range corresponding to section c of the isotherm and upper part of section b fig 2a 2c concomitant rise in ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration clearly suggests dissolution of gcc which led to sicc increase to 1 5 fig 2d however further decline in residual op concentration resulting from increasing gcc dosages within section b and upper part of section a was accompanied by the drop of sicc fig 2d this is due to decrease in ph ca2 and alkalinity fig 2a 2c which points at precipitation of calcium carbonate within lower part of section a with decreasing residual op high gcc additions low op cc mass ratios ph ca2 and sicc were relatively stable fig 2 this was probably because sicc nearly approached equilibrium level here mean sicc 0 6 fig 2d under hypolimentic conditions similarly to epilimentic variant initial increase in ph ca2 and alkalinity and thus in sicc took place with decreasing residual op concertation increasing gcc additions decreasing op cc mass ratios within a range of op concentrations corresponding to the section c and upper part of the section a of the isotherm fig 3 these changes clearly suggest gcc dissolution with further declining op increasing gcc dosages decreasing op cc mass ratios corresponding to the lower part of section a ph and sicc were relatively stable fig 3a d in turn ca2 and alkalinity changed without clear trend although at the lowest op concentrations the highest gcc additions the lowest op gcc ratios both showed increasing tendency with decreasing op and increasing gcc dosage fig 3b c saturation of the lake water with respect to cc changed following the same pattern as ca2 and alkalinity and reached upper threshold of equilibrium level mean sic c 0 5 fig 3d saturation indices calculated for different ca po4 compounds show generally decreasing trend with decreasing residual op concentration increasing gcc doses decreasing op gcc ratio fig 4 under epilimnetic conditions oversaturation of the solution with respect to sc and hap was achieved over the whole range of the applied gcc doses whereas for acp and β tcp oversaturation was recorded within residual op concentration corresponding to section b and c of the isotherm fig 4a under hypolimnetic conditions the lake water was oversaturated with respect to sc and hap throughout the whole range of residual op and applied gcc mass and with respect to ß tcp only part of section c and a fig 4b 4 discussion 4 1 sorption mechanism under contrasting in lake conditions as derived from sorption isotherms shape of sorption isotherms can give a clue of kinetically driven formation of surface complexes or ripening processes stumm morgan 1996 typically the logarithmic like shape with loads increasing gradually with increasing residual op concentration which follow langmuir model is attributed to adsorptive binding inflection of the isotherm and its further linear or sigmoidal course indicate at the initialisation of ca po4 precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation holford mattingly 1975 freeman rowell 1981 stumm morgan 1996 zhou li 2001 yagi fukushi 2012 a specific case is an isotherm with exponential part being consistent with freundlich model which follows the first logarithmic part adsorption according to langmuir model and turns into linear section heterogeneous nucleation such a course of the isotherm represents adsorption followed by surface precipitation by solid solution formation which is than replaced by precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation farley et al 1985 stumm and morgan 1996 the isotherm obtained in the current work for epilimnetic conditions fig 1b clearly follows the above mentioned model with three sections indicating predomination of adsorption section a surface precipitation via solid solution formation section b and precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation section c under hypolimnetic conditions in turn two separated sections can be observed fig 1c pointing at adsorption section a and precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation section c without solid solution formation step under epilimnetic conditions calculated maximum adsorption was 35 higher than under hypolimnetic conditions table 2 which suggests favoured adsorption in epilimnion this effect can be explained by high ph and temperature alkaline ph promotes phosphate adsorption onto cc suzuki et al 1986 karageorgiou et al 2007 sø et al 2011 probably due to increased concentration of deprotonated phosphate species which are preferably bound to cc surface sø et al 2011 while high temperature enhances adsorption due to endothermic nature of this process griffin jurinak 1973 nevertheless it has to be noted that under epilimnetic conditions higher concentration of co3 2 was present as compared to hypolimnion due to alkaline ph causing changes in the speciation of carbonate species in the solution which should limit adsorption as carbonates compete with phosphate ions for sorption sites on the cc surface sø et al 2011 higher maximum adsorption in epilimnion suggests however that this limiting effect must have been compensated by previously mentioned factors enhancing adsorptive binding taking into account different op cc mass ratios corresponding to distinguished sections of the isotherms which represent specific binding mechanisms it can be concluded that under epilimnetic conditions about five times lower op cc mass ratio was needed to induce precipitation as compared to hypolimnion epilimnetic op cc 0 6 mg g versus hypolimnetic op cc 2 8 mg g respectively section 3 1 thus precipitation is to be expected at a wider range of gcc doses applied in epilimnion and in this term can be regarded as more probable as compared to hypolimnion where adsorption predominated at a wider range of the applied gcc doses and op cc mass ratios fig 1 promoting effect of epilimnetic conditions on precipitation processes is also expressed by the fact that in epilimnion much higher loads 87 higher on average were obtained in section c precipitation as compared to corresponding loads in hypolimnion moreover inflection of the isotherm took place despite the maximum adsorption was not achieved fig 1a this effect can be explained by high temperature and alkaline ph in epilimnion as both factors lower solubility of calcium phosphates and could hence promote their precipitation under epilimnetic conditions house 1999 sanciolo et al 2008 this is confirmed by saturation with respect to ca po4 compounds which show generally higher si values in epilimnion with four of the ca po4 minerals indicating oversaturation within section c of the isotherm in hypolimnion oversaturation was achieved only for two of them within this section fig 4 in addition to that in epilimnion high ph initial level of 9 0 table 1 could favor the precipitation of ca po4 by the fact that it can counteract the effect of some natural compounds probably present in the lake water that hamper precipitation process for example organic acids have been reported to strongly inhibit ca po4 formation at the ph 8 but at ph 9 this effect was very small song et al 2006b as previously stressed possibility of calcium phosphates formation was indicated by isotherms for both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic conditions although in the hypolimnetic set sorption processes did not involve formation of solid solution section b nevertheless taking into account low initial op concentration employed in this study 1 mg po4 3 l 1 precipitation of calcium phosphates obviously indicated by the shape of the isotherms seems to be a surprising result as this fixation mechanism is reported to occur at high initial op concentrations plant house 2002 li et al 2017 li et al 2020 li et al 2017 investigated phosphate sorption onto cc at different initial op concentrations ranging from 1 5 to 30 6 mg po4 3 l 1 initial ph ranging from 7 7 to 10 1 and contact time 0 5 24h the results showed precipitation of calcium phosphates at different levels of op ph and contact time nevertheless at initial ph 9 1 which is nearly the same as employed in the current study in epilimnetic variant ph 9 0 table 1 precipitation did not occur and adsorption dominated despite relatively high op level 30 6 mg po4 3 l 1 li et al 2017 which is substantially higher as op concentration employed in the current study 1 mg po4 3 l 1 this clearly contradicts results of the current study pointing at precipitation taking place under epilimnetic conditions as derived from the sorption isotherm furthermore the same authors stated that the lowest initial op concentration being sufficient for precipitation was 9 2 mg po4 3 l 1 at initial ph 7 7 and reaction time 24h sø et al 2011 reported faster onset of precipitation after 24h at only slightly higher initial op concentration of 9 5 mg po4 3 l 1 and similar initial ph 7 5 at lower initial op level 0 1 4 8 mg po4 3 l 1 any signs of precipitation occurred in this light precipitation of ca po4 compounds under modelled hypolimnetic conditions initial ph 7 0 contact time 24h initial op concentration 1 mg po4 3 l 1 although indicated by isotherms course and shape is also quite unexpected this discrepancy between literature and results of the current study can be due to different initial saturation conditions sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 investigated calcite interactions with op under equilibrium conditions while in the current work oversaturation and subsaturation epilimnion and hypolimnion respectively were employed both of these saturation states could have promoted precipitation of op with ca as previously stressed plant house 2002 berg et al 2004 moreover different ratios of initial op concentration to cc mass probably played an important role in the study of sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 op cc mass ratios were low 0 001 0 1 and 0 04 0 77 mg g respectively whereas in the current work op cc ratios were much higher up to 85 mg g within isotherms in parts a which indicate predominance of adsorption low op cc mass ratios were employed 0 06 0 28 mg g under epilimnetic and 0 06 1 1 mg g under hypolimnetic conditions which are similar to those in works by sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 in this term results of the current study are in agreement with those of sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 and point at mainly adsorption taking place at relatively low op concentration 1 mg po4 3 l 1 and low op cc ratios up to 1 1 mg g the dominance of adsorption at these low op cc mass ratios high gcc additions can be explained by a large surface area which was available for adsorption probably leading to fast and substantial op stripping from the solution adsorption is terminated within 2 3 hours while ca po4 precipitation needs at least 8 hours to set in sø et al 2011 hence it can be assumed that at low op cc mass ratio high calcite addition concentration of op left after very fast adsorption was too low so that ca po4 can form however within isotherms sections b and c precipitation gcc doses applied were very small so op cc ratios were high 0 6 11 and 14 85 mg g in epilimnion section b and c respectively and 2 8 55 mg g in hypolimnion section c these are much higher values as compared to op cc ratios corresponding to section a adsorption and those employed in the studies of sø et al 2011 and li et al 2017 in this case sections b and c of the isotherms pointing at precipitation fig 1b c due to low mass of added gcc only a small surface area of calcite was present in the solution consequently adsorption was able to eliminate only portion of the available op and remaining op could take part in precipitation processes which set in later on this explains why precipitation could occur despite low initial op concentration therefore results of this study show that initial op cc ratio is an important factor controlling op binding mechanism onto cc as it affects op concentration available for processes other than adsorption similar pattern of op binding processes adsorption at high gcc dosages low op cc ratio and precipitation at low gcc dosages high op cc ratio was observed by eiche et al 2008 and bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 4 2 sorption mechanism as revealed by solution chemistry chemistry of the lake water can give important information about sorption mechanism as precipitation processes induce changes in ionic composition and physio chemical parameters of the solution as indicated in section 4 1 the isotherms suggest importance of calcium phosphates precipitation fig 1 which is also supported by saturation indices fig 4 under epilimnetic conditions formation of acp ß tcp and sc was thermodynamically possible as the lake water was saturated with respect to these phases within the section b and c precipitation fig 4a under hypolimnetic conditions in turn the lake water was saturated with respect to sc within the whole range of the applied gcc doses fig 4b interestingly in simulated epilimnion first inflection of the isotherm is accompanied by establishment of saturation of the lake water with respect to ß tcp and acp fig 4a bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 reported similar convergence between inversion point of the isotherm and saturation achieved for another ca po4 mineral ocp in experiments with initial op concentration of 4 1 mg po4 3 l 1 even though precipitation via solid solution section b of the isotherm in simulated epilimnion fig 1 does not require oversaturation of the solution with respect to any distinct phase stumm morgan 1996 establishment of saturation of the lake water with respect to ß tcp and acp within section b of the isotherm fig 4a seems to support importance of precipitation processes as derived from the sorption isotherms other results regarding solution chemistry shed some light on the sorption mechanism too under epilimnetic conditions clear correspondence between ph alkalinity and calcium concentration can be seen as all these parameters slightly increased after addition of small gcc doses section c and upper part of section b in the isotherm corresponding to precipitation fig 2a 2c for example ph increased from 8 9 blank to 9 2 gcc addition 0 2 g l 1 fig 2a these changes naturally suggest dissolution of gcc which is quite surprising as the lake water was initially oversaturated with respect to cc sicc 1 4 table 1 still it is possible that very fine crystals dissolved under these conditions stumm morgan 1996 the smallest crystals in the gcc material are 0 68 µm section 2 1 heberling et al 2016 stressed that solubility of the material is governed by the smallest particles slight change in ph and alkalinity despite oversaturation of the solution with respect to calcite can be also explained by the dissolution of amorphous calcium carbonate which is much more soluble than cc amorphous material could have been present in the gcc sample as it can be formed during grinding li et al 2014 heberling et al 2016 irrespectively on that slight increase in ca2 concentration within section b upper part and section c fig 2b rather contradicts the conclusion that precipitation took place precipitation was indicated by the sorption isotherms for these sections fig 1 in the case of precipitation ca2 drop should be observed due to ca2 striping by forming calcium phosphates however results suggest that portion of ca2 added to the system by gcc dissolution was higher than portion of ca2 used by ca po4 formation so ca2 removal by precipitation cannot be seen fig 2b dissolution of gcc indicated by simultaneous increase in ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration within section b and c assumed precipitation fig 2a 2c seems to even support conclusions derived from sorption isotherms which point at precipitation of ca po4 this is because dissolving cc supplies ca2 ions favouring formation of these compounds berg et al 2005 wan et al 2016 at the same time at higher additions of gcc in simulated epilimnion ph alkalinity and calcium showed strong decreasing trend corresponding to part of section b precipitation via solid solution formation and full section a adsorption fig 2a 2c simultaneous drop of ph and alkalinity accompanied by ca2 stripping from the solution suggests that cc precipitated during the experiment under epilimnetic conditions in that case co precipitation of op with cc should also be assumed as one of the sorption mechanisms contributing to op removal in epilimnion however it should be noted that drop in ph ca2 concentration and alkalinity can to some extent result from other processes than cc precipitation in the lake water during the experiment these could have been several internal processes not related to gcc addition such as decomposition of organic matter as it drives ph and alkalinity down kuivila murray 1984 this seems to be confirmed by the fact that both ph and alkalinity decreased in the blank sample no gcc addition as compared to the initial conditions in the lake water fig 2a 2c another possible process is ca2 complexation by organic compounds sinderal et al 2015 but this can be rather excluded as actually no changes in ca2 were recorded in the blank sample as compared to the initial conditions fig 2b in samples treated with gcc ca2 could have been also stripped by complexation with op adsorbing on the cc surface lin singer 2006 however the level of ph and ca2 in gcc treated samples reached lower values as compared to the blank solution no gcc addition within the lower part of section b and full section a fig 2a b the same was observed for alkalinity in part of section a fig 2c moreover all these parameters together with sicc generally decreased with increasing gcc addition fig 2 this indicates that decrease in ph alkalinity and ca2 concentration under epilimnetic conditions was in fact at least partially caused by cc precipitation in this case it should be assumed that op removal via co precipitation with cc played some role in this system this is in accordance with suzuki et al 1986 and plant house 2002 who claimed importance of co precipitation under oversaturation of the solution with respect to cc nevertheless it has to be noted that cc precipitation is strongly inhibited or retarded by phosphate ions which block active crystal growth sites on the crystal surface this effect was reported to take place at similar or even lower concentrations of op as employed in the current study 0 10 0 48 mg po4 3 l 1 lin singer 2006 0 57 0 95 mg po4 3 l 1 dove hochella 1993 0 24 mg po4 3 l 1 house et al 1986 and is generally the more pronounced the lower the oversaturation with respect to cc plant house 2002 lin singer 2006 reported substantial reduction of cc precipitation rate by about 50 at initial op concertation being two times lower than used in the current work 0 48 mg po4 3 l 1 vs 1 mg po4 3 l 1 and at much higher oversaturation 5 3 vs 1 4 thus in the current study only limited importance of cc precipitation should be expected due to inhibitory effect of op on the other hand it can be assumed that precipitation of cc in the natural lake water was also affected by other substances which are known to retard or block growth of cc crystals such as humic acids sinderal et al 2015 magnesium tang et al 2020 or iron house donaldson 1986 however clear signs of cc precipitation as previously mentioned were recorded in the lake water chemistry under epilimnetic conditions at medium to high gcc additions corresponding to section b lower part and full section a of the isotherm fig 2 therefore cc precipitation although probably limited played some role in the system most probably contributing to op removal via co precipitation the question arises as to what was the contribution of co precipitation within section a adsorption as signs of cc precipitation were mainly recorded after adding gcc doses corresponding to this section as co precipitation involves only small part of cc surface ca 2 and adsorption can take place on the remaining surface house and donaldson 1986 co precipitation was likely a kind of accompanying mechanism within section a dominated by adsorption in contrast who obtained similar sorption isotherms for po4 3 uptake onto monohydrocalcite attributed the first logarithmic section of the isotherm to predomination of co precipitation process however in the current study co precipitation cannot be assumed as a sole op binding mechanism within section a adsorption as relationship between ca2 and po4 3 removal from the lake water calculated as molar mass ratio ca p accounted for 19 33 this is less than ca p ratios reported for pure co precipitation which are higher than 50 house 1999 danen louwerse et al 1995 dittrich et al 2011 thus recorded ca p ratios 19 33 can not be result of co precipitation alone on the other hand obtained ca p ratios are much higher than expected for calcium phosphates precipitation ca p 1 3 table 2 and adsorption of cahpo4 0 aq complex ca p 1 therefore changes in the lake water chemistry and recorded ca p ratios together with good fit to adsorption models suggest that adsorption prevailed within section a of the isotherm in epilimnion but was accompanied by co precipitation under hypolimnetic conditions changes in the lake water chemistry were also directional fig 3 and show distinct dissolution of gcc which was expected due to initial subsaturation of the solution with respect to cc table 1 similarly ramisch et al 1999 reported intense dissolution of naturally precipitated cc during its settling in the hypolimnion of deep eutrophic lakes interestingly in the hypolimnetic variant the most intense changes in ph ca2 and alkalinity can be observed after small and medium gcc dosages which correspond to section c precipitation of the isotherm fig 3a 3c this observation seems to support postulated ca po4 precipitation in hypolimnion as dissolution of cc is a factor initiating ca po4 formation donnert et al 2002 berg et al 2004 wang et al 2012 within section a adsorption ph ca2 alkalinity and hence sicc were rather stable and did not show distinct changes with increasing gcc additions fig 3a 3c this is mainly due to the fact that saturation with respect to cc achieved equilibrium level here sicc within section a was 0 3 0 5 fig 3d however it is worth to note that ph ca2 and alkalinity within section a adsorption were higher than in the blank solution indicating dissolution of gcc taking place also within this section fig 3a 3c the question is why this did not initiate ca po4 formation as it obviously did within section c precipitation this should be attributed to large specific surface area which was available due to high gcc doses corresponding to section a as previously discussed most of op was fast stripped from the lake water by adsorption so the remaining op concentration was probably too low for ca po4 to form 4 3 implications for op inactivation in lakes as this study showed if cc is regarded as potential p binding agent its behaviour and p sorption mechanism will be different depending on the environmental conditions during and after application it was demonstrated that sorption mechanism will also depend on the dosage of gcc with respect to actual op concentration in epilimnion precipitation processes as op fixation mechanism will be more likely to occur presence of calcite in the water column as fixed in or onto a carrier according the approach of non invasive phosphate removal can support natural cc precipitation and consequently p co precipitation in contrast in hypolimnion adsorption can take place at a wider range of the material doses used fig 1 irrespectively of that adsorption will take place in the very initial phase after application as it proceeds very fast kuo lotse 1972 due to the fact that op adsorbed on cc can be easily desorbed if op concentration will substantially drop millero et al 2001 there is a risk of op release some of this op can be than fixed again by precipitation during further cc exposure in water still time of exposure of the material in the lake needs to be optimised to ensure possibly high sorption and reduce desorption risk op removal efficiency can be enhanced or remain unaffected by in lake conditions depending on gcc dose under epilimnetic conditions higher efficiency is expected due to onset of precipitation at a wider range of gcc doses and higher op removal via precipitation fig 1 as well as higher adsorption table 3 in this term as compared to hypolimnion application of gcc into epilimnion will require lower doses of gcc to achieve the same level of op removal assuming the same initial op concentration nevertheless it has to be stressed that irrespectively of physio chemical conditions in the lake the prevailing sorption mechanism will be strongly affected by the dose of gcc applied as indicated by the sorption isotherms the higher the dose the higher the probability of adsorption fig 1 application into hypolimnion will result in dissolution of cc material as was observed for gcc fig 3 in the field rate of dissolution will be controlled mainly by saturation conditions with respect to cc they can be especially inconvenient at the end of summer stagnation due to co2 accumulation during the season at the same time end of summer stagnation seems to be the best time for hypolimnion treatment as p can accumulate in hypolimnion as stratification progresses eg dunalska et al 2007 read et al 2014 hypolimnion treatment should result in op sorption and removal from this layer leading to reduced p supply to the photic zone during the autumn turnover and thus limiting the lakes productivity in this term application of p binding agent into hypolimnion shortly before mixing starts seems to be the most reasonable solution to achieve the desired effect on op cycling however such timing would be probably also related to the highest dissolution rate of cc due to hypolimnetic co2 accumulation during the season dissolution of gcc as observed in hypolimnion questions the basic premise of the non invasive p removal method this approach assumes that the p binding agent applied in or on carriers bags laminates will be pulled out after given time to avoid its deposition in the environment burska et al 2019 zamparas et al 2020 if calcite partially dissolves some of its mass initially applied will not be possible to be extracted from the lake after the finished treatment the amount of gcc dissolved during the experiment under hypolimnetic conditions is hard to asses numerous processes shaped hydrochemistry of the lake water and thus strongly affected carbonate alkalinity and calcium concentration which could be used to determine mass of the dissolved gcc rough estimation showed that at high gcc additions not more than 3 of the initial mass undergone dissolution at lower dosages this could be even 20 this is because dissolution dominates as long as equilibrium will be achieved housecroft sharpe 2007 so it can be predicted that irrespectively of the mass of the applied gcc there is a maximum amount of cc which can get dissolved under the same initial conditions in the solution thus at high cc doses which can be required for satisfactory reduction of op level only minor part by percentage of the cc mass applied will be lost by dissolution therefore the vast majority of the applied material will be probably preserved in hypolimnion and thus removable loss of cc resulting from dissolution will depend on in lake conditions i a saturation with respect to calcite in hypolimnion and grain size of the applied cc material as smaller grains are more prone to dissolution ramisch et al 1999 thus due to problem of cc dissolution application of very fine cc powdered materials to hypolimnion should be avoided median particle size of synthetic cc materials can be even smaller than 0 1 µm heberling et al 2016 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 apart from the fact that dissolution of cc will make it impossible to remove all the mass of cc applied it will also affect physio chemical conditions in the lake water ph increase in hypolimnion from nearly neutral to moderately alkaline up to 8 2 in the experiments fig 3a caused by gcc dissolution can induce p release due to ligand exchange effect on fe p al p compounds in sediment lewandowski 2002 huang et al 2005 sobczyński 2009 however this negative effect of ph increase is lower if it s accompanied by ca2 supply as ca2 is another next to fe and al p binding metal in sediments dittrich et al 2011 increase in ph ca2 and alkalinity resulting from cc dissolution can potentially support op precipitation with calcium compounds at the sediment water interface as ca p compounds are considered to be non mobile in contrast to the mobile al fe p compounds lewandowski 2002 this will lead to increased op retention in sediment moreover products of cc dissolution are natural components of surface water in the experiments their concentration remained at the natural level up to 62 mg ca2 l 1 and alkalinity of max 2 50 mmol l even after adding the highest dosages of gcc hence cc dissolution should not be an alarming issue in terms of changing hydrochemistry as long as cc dissolution will show stronger effect on op retention in sediments with ca compounds than on op release from al fe compounds nevertheless application of gcc should be carefully considered at near bottom depths especially in soft water lakes saturation conditions and grain size of the cc material which are important for potential cc dissolution and its effects have to be taken into account prior to treatment in epilimnion very slight gcc dissolution was recorded after additions of small gcc doses with ph increase by 0 05 0 3 as compared to blank solution fig 2a but symptoms of cc precipitation were observed after treatment with higher gcc doses with ph decrease by 0 1 0 6 as compared to blank solution fig 2a in field practice rather high doses of cc will be required to achieve satisfactory reduction in op concentration leading to ph drop moreover with respect to the initial ph value 9 0 table 1 ph of the epilimnetic water decreased by 0 1 0 8 after addition of gcc dosages except for three of them for which actually no ph change was recorded fig 2a lowering of the ph level in epilimnion was somehow expected due to initial oversaturation with respect to cc epilimnion treatment using the p binding agent fixed onto a carrier according to the non invasive p removal approach will result in reduced op concentration and thus limit the lake s productivity if cc will be used lowering of the ph in the trophogenic zone will also be a result as lowered ph can limit abundance of some cyanobacteria species huisman hulot 2005 cc effect on ph can be considered an additional supporting mechanism of the lakes recovery due to treatment the results obtained in this study are representative for the cc based material used application of other cc based material depending on its grain size and surface area may result in somehow different cc behaviour and partly different pattern of op interactions with calcite for example with decrease in grain size higher or faster dissolution of cc materials can be expected berg et al 2004 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 this can lead to 1 limitations regarding p binding agent removal from the lake after the treatment is terminated and 2 more pronounced ph and alkalinity changes especially in hypolimnion as compared to cc based material showing lower dissolution potential which will in turn 3 affect op binding processes i e by changing saturation with respect to cc and ca po4 in case of finely grained materials higher importance of adsorption can be assumed too due to their larger specific surface area cc based materials are highly variable in terms of physical properties for example surface area of cc materials investigated as potential p binding agents in lakes ranged from 1 to 70 m2 g 1 eiche et al 2008 berg et al 2004 ding et al 2012 bańkowska sobczak et al 2020 nevertheless the current work shows clear effect of epililmentic vs hypolimnetic conditions on cc interactions with calcite with precipitation processes prevailing in epilimnion as compared to hypolimnion if initial op concentration in both systems is the same as interactions of cc with op are to a high degree determined by physio chemical conditions in the solution this relative pattern can be expected in case of other cc based materials too of course it s impossible not to mention the importance of op concentration which is typically higher in hypolimnion as compared to epilimnion wetzel 2001 weiner matthews 2003 op can accumulate in hypolimnion during the season leading to stepwise increase in p concentration eg dunalska et al 2007 read et al 2014 with increasing op in hypolimnion higher probability of precipitation can be expected in case of the same cc based material on the other hand with decreasing op concentration in epilimnion higher importance of op co precipitation and or lower importance of ca po4 precipitation can be predicted under large differences between epi and hypolimnetic op concentrations the ultimate pattern of op binding onto calcite will be probably determined by combined effect of physio chemical conditions ca alkalinity ph temperature op as they influence i e adsorption and solubility of cc and ca po4 the current work did not covered issue of changing op concentration as its aim was to assess the relative effect of over and subsaturation with respect to cc which are mainly determined by different ph and temperature typically occurring during summer in lakes however further studies considering changing op concentration under contrasting in lake saturation conditions are needed 5 conclusions op removal expressed as op loads measured as unit sorption was higher in epilimnion showing promoting effect of epilimnetic conditions on op fixation onto cc most probably caused by combined effect of high ph temperature and saturation with respect to cc and ca po4 irrespectively of initial environmental conditions epilimnetic vs hypolimnetic op fixation onto gcc proceeded through adsorption in epilimnion accompanied probably by co precipitation or ca po4 precipitation depending on initial op cc ratio resulting from different gcc doses in general at low op cc ratios adsorption prevailed whereas higher op cc ratios resulted in precipitation most probably at low op cc ratio adsorption onto relatively large surface area took place due to large gcc doses applied leading to substantial stripping of op from the lake water in the initial stage of the experiment so that not sufficient op was available for the precipitation processes which set in in the further stage at high initial op cc ratio low gcc dose only small part of op could be removed via adsorption so that relatively high op concentration left which were high enough to provide saturation with respect to ca po4 compounds and enabled their precipitation however mechanism of ca po4 precipitation differed under conditions employed with surface precipitation through solid solution formation at intermediate op cc ratios and precipitation through heterogeneous nucleation at high initial op cc ratios in epilimnion whereas in hypolimnion only the latter mechanism of precipitation was recorded in addition to that in hypolimnion ca po4 precipitation took place at higher op cc ratio smaller range of the applied gcc doses thus showing lower probability of precipitation and higher probability of adsorption application of cc based material into hypolimnion will result in partial dissolution of cc therefore most of the applied cc mass but not all of it is expected to be removable after the finished treatment application into epilimnion will result in a ph drop which can help limit occurrence of some cyanobacteria species declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the study was performed within a project probiowoda no gekon 2 03 267948 21 2016 funded

significant variability of tsm po 4 3 sio 4 4 chl a ppb and phytoplankton abundance during high tide was observed between e1 and e2 table 1 among the inorganic macronutrients significant variability of nh 4 was observed between high and low tide irrespective of sites i e e1 and e2 a higher number of environmental parameters varied significantly between high and low tide at e2 in comparison to e1 the variability of different parameters in response to the tidal oscillation at e1 and e2 is described in detail in the following sections 3 1 tidal and spatial variability of physical parameters among the environmental variables water temperature wt followed a clear pattern with high maximum 32 84 c and low minimum 30 24 c values during low and high tides respectively at e2 fig 3 during high tide wt ranged between 30 24 and 32 40 c whereas during low tide the variability was observed between 31 58 and 32 84 c the station e1 27 68 36 77 c was noticed with a relatively higher range compared to e2 30 24 32 84 c over the entire tidal cycle at e1 wt ranged from 27 68 to 36 77 c during high tide while it was ranged from 30 96 to 34 41 c during low tide in context to the variability from day 1 to day 7 a prominent diurnal cycle depicting an increase in wt during the daytime was evident at e1 fig 3 salinity variability within a very lower range 0 08 2 71 psu delineated e1 as a freshwater regime fig 3 although marginal the influence of high tide in injecting relatively higher saline water from the adjoining bob was observed at e1 the maximum salinity magnitude of 0 54 psu during low tide increased up to 2 71 psu during high tide in general e1 displayed characteristics of a freshwater regime with less quantum of saline water influx over the tidal cycle day 1 to day 7 on the other hand salinity oscillation at e2 was observed with a steep gradient between rising maximum 20 71 psu and fall minimum 1 49 psu of salinity corresponding to high and low tide respectively as the tidal amplitude progressed to a higher range from day 1 to day 7 the salinity variability range also increased showing a pronounced tidal influence in the lower estuary do variability was very dynamic over the tidal cycle at e1 and e2 do concentrations were higher at e1 in comparison to e2 during low tide during high tide conditions with low tidal amplitude day 1 to day 3 do levels were observed higher at e1 fig 3 however the pattern of variability was similar at both stations during high tide with higher tidal amplitudes day 4 to day 7 during high tide the pattern reversed with higher concentration at e2 and lower at e1 in the context of bod the magnitude was below 4 mg l 1 at both lower and upper estuary which indicated the water quality of the mahanadi estuary in between fairly clean and moderately polluted fig 3 in general bod levels 2 mg l 1 5 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 classify the river water quality as clean moderately polluted and heavily polluted respectively hocking 2005 during low tidal amplitude day 1 to day 3 bod levels were observed higher at e1 in comparison to e2 irrespective of tides however during higher tidal amplitude day 4 to day 7 the pattern of variability was sometimes higher during high and low tide at both upper as well as the lower estuary 3 2 tidal and spatial variability of inorganic macronutrients mahanadi estuary showed a wide range of concentration of dissolved nutrients no 2 no 3 nh 4 po 4 3 sio 4 4 during the present study among nitrogenous nutrients no 2 no 3 nh 4 the average concentration of no 2 was observed as 0 14 0 10 µmol l 1 at e1 and 0 43 0 42 µmol l 1 at e2 fig 4 there was no prominent variability of no 2 in response to daily fluctuation in tidal levels in most instances no 2 concentration was relatively higher at e2 in comparison to e1 irrespective of tides however the average concentration of no 2 was higher during low tide at e2 except for few occasions a marginal increasing pattern in the magnitude of no 2 was observed from day 1 to day 7 at e2 no significant variation of no 2 was observed between high tide 0 0 39 µmol l 1 and low tide 0 01 0 21 µmol l 1 at e1 no 3 one of the most important inorganic nitrogenous macronutrients that promote phytoplankton growth was observed with a pattern of rising in concentration during low tide 3 53 8 12 µmol l 1 and fall 2 19 5 93 µmol l 1 during high tide at e2 fig 4 at lower tidal amplitude during day 1 and day 2 maximum difference between the magnitudes of no 3 was noticed at e2 in contrast to e2 no 3 concentration was comparatively lower during low tide at e1 however the range of variability did not differ greatly between low 2 16 7 27 µmol l 1 and high tide 2 28 8 50 µmol l 1 at e1 nh 4 the preferentially assimilated nitrogenous macronutrients by phytoplankton varied within 0 32 4 45 µmol l 1 and 0 44 5 47 µmol l 1 at e1 and e2 respectively fig 4 tidal influence on the variability of nh 4 concentration was more prominent at e2 in comparison to e1 rise and fall in nh 4 levels were associated with low and high tides respectively excluding a couple of instances at e2 at higher tidal amplitude e1 was observed with higher nh 4 concentration during high tide day 5 to day 7 although similar pattern was noticed from day 1 to day 4 the concentration of nh 4 was relatively lower in comparison to day 5 to day 7 at e1 in addition to nitrogenous nutrients the ambient concentration of po 4 3 and sio 4 4 play an important role in phytoplankton growth the concentration of po 4 3 was higher at e2 in comparison to e1 variability of po 4 3 followed a pattern of rising during low tide 5 63 38 13 µmol l 1 and fall during high tide 2 20 22 78 µmol l 1 at e2 fig 4 po 4 3 concentration was ranged within 0 29 18 30 µmol l 1 during high tide and 0 57 27 76 µmol l 1 during low tide at e1 fig 4 po 4 3 was observed with very lower levels day 1 to day 3 excluding a few high values day 4 to day 7 at e1 and no prominent pattern in response to oscillating tides sio 4 4 an important phytoplankton growth promoting nutrient especially for diatoms was observed with higher concentration 118 145 µmol l 1 at e1 irrespective of tides fig 4 in contrast a significant response of sio 4 4 to oscillating tides were observed with rising maximum 150 µmol l 1 and fall minimum 30 µmol l 1 in concentration during low and high tide respectively at e2 a relative decrease in sio 4 4 was observed from day 4 to day 7 at e2 during high tide 3 3 tidal and spatial variability of suspended and organic matter the variability of tsm revealed no significant trend at both e1 and e2 however higher concentrations were observed many times during low tide at both e1 and e2 fig 3 a prominent rise in tsm concentration was noticed from day 5 to day 7 during low tide at e2 tsm concentration varied within a similar range 2 24 mg l 1 at both e1 and e2 during low tide a higher concentration of tsm was observed at e1 in comparison to e2 indicating a riverine source of tsm in the estuary in regards to the organic matter the values of cdom was higher during low tide and varied within a similar range at both e1 6 70 8 24 ppb and e2 6 97 9 73 ppb fig 5 e2 showed prominent variation in cdom concentration in response to tidal oscillation in comparison to e1 from day 5 to day 7 a significant reduction in the levels of cdom was prominent at e2 during high tides the upstream station e1 with a relatively higher degree of freshwater flux was observed with a higher concentration 7 8 ppb during most of the times except a couple of sharp increases and decreases 3 4 tidal and spatial variability of biological variables the estuarine plankton phyto and zoo assemblages were observed to be greatly influenced by the tidal cycle especially in the upper reaches the average abundance of phytoplankton was marginally higher during high tide 38 16 104 cells l 1 in comparison to low tide 31 16 104 cells l 1 at e1 fig 6 this pattern could be attributed to the addition of resilient phytoplankton species with the species carried away from the lower estuary with high tide in contrast a reverse pattern was found at e2 with higher average phytoplankton abundance during low tide 25 16 104 cells l 1 than high tide 21 17 104 cells l 1 this pattern signified the upper estuarine origin of the phytoplankton assemblages the overall phytoplankton abundance was higher at lower tidal amplitude day 1 to day 2 at both e1 and e2 fig 6 in the context of zooplankton tidal amplitude had considerable effects on the zooplankton with increased density during high tide average 14 102 org m 3 in comparison to low tide average 7 102 org m 3 at e1 fig 5 however tidal variability of zooplankton assemblage at e2 1 12 102 org m 3 was not prominent as higher densities were observed during six occasions of each high and low tide in general a marginal increase in the density was noticed from day 4 to day 6 at e2 fig 5 the phytoplankton biomass i e total chl a concentration was observed with a pattern of rising during low tide and fall during high tide with the exception of some instances at both e1 as well as e2 fig 6 the maximum chl a concentration of 13 67 mg m 3 was noticed during low tide at e1 and 9 49 mg m 3 at e2 fig 6 higher degree of fluctuation in chl a with lower magnitude was observed from day 2 to day 4 at e1 on the other hand very low concentration of chl a was observed from day 6 to day 7 at e2 in the context of phytoplankton size class biomass the average concentration of ppb remained higher at e1 irrespective of tides fig 6 whereas average npb concentration was higher at e2 irrespective of tides although the highest concentration was registered for npb among the phytoplankton size classes at e1 9 82 mg m 3 during low tide the average concentration remained higher for ppb over the tidal period at e1 ppb exhibited higher average concentration over the tidal period high tide 4 93 2 mg m 3 and low tide 5 43 3 mg m 3 in comparison to other size classes at e1 fig 6 a prominent pattern of increase in ppb concentration during low tide and decrease during high tide was noticed at e1 from day 2 to day 4 a similar decrease in ppb concentration was also noticed during high tide at e2 from day 4 to day 7 e2 was observed with dominant contribution from both npb and ppb at different occasions during low tide however npb mostly dominated the average phytoplankton size class biomass during low tide at e2 npb concentration remained 3 mg m 3 from day 4 to day 7 at e2 irrespective of tides except two occasions a negligible variation in concentration of npb with respect to tides was observed at e1 from day 2 to day 4 the mpb biomass remained below 2 mg m 3 irrespective of tides at e2 with a single occurrence of high value during both low tide 2 77 mg m 3 and high tide 2 71 mg m 3 in similar e1 was also observed with mpb biomass below 2 mg m 3 with two occasions of marginal high values associated with low tide fig 6 4 discussion estuaries are complex environments and their inhabitants whether migratory or resident are exposed to daily and seasonal changes in physico chemical parameters eddy 2005 the quantum of fresh and marine water influx during a tidal cycle plays important role in estuarine biogeochemistry monbet 1992 montani et al 1998 thus physico chemical and biological datasets were collected during each high as well as low tide over a period of seven consecutive days in general wt in aquatic ecosystems exhibits strong effects on the physiology of organisms madeira et al 2013 on the other hand wt in an estuary is influenced by the intensity of solar radiation evaporation rate freshwater inflow and tidal mixing with seawater srichandan et al 2015b the contrast between the wt variation pattern between e1 and e2 could be attributed to the degree of tidal mixing at both locations the higher mixing at e2 resulted in a lower range of variation in wt and clearly followed the tidal pattern with low during high tide and high during low tide in general wt at e1 was higher in comparison to e2 during low tide the relatively warm water ingress from e1 to e2 could have elevated wt the influx of seawater with a higher rate of mixing during high tide could have resulted in lower wt at e2 among the estuarine hydrological parameters salinity is primarily influenced by the freshwater influx from the river which reflects the hydrologic budget of the watershed rodriguez 1975 salinity gradient from the upper to lower estuary is a major characteristics feature of the estuaries prandle 2009 in the present study e1 was completely occupied with freshwater where tidal influence was less on the other hand e2 showed significant variation over tidal phases with higher salinity during high tide in comparison to low tide similar higher salinity at high tide than low tide has been reported in many tropical estuarine ecosystems gouda and panigrahy 1989 gajbhiye et al 1984 do is an important constituent of aquatic medium and its magnitude serves as an indicator of water quality adequate concentration of do supports well balanced aquatic life george et al 2012 along the tidal scale a noticeable change in do was observed with a higher value during low tide at e1 than e2 e2 is relatively shallower than e1 and susceptible to low oxygenated conditions of sediment water interface attributed to organic matter remineralization noriega and araujo 2014 further high tide conditions with low tidal amplitude showing higher do levels at e1 could be ascribed to the higher degree of oxygen rich riverine freshwater prevalence at e1 irrespective of tides george et al 2012 manna et al 2013 on the other hand a higher degree of mixing during high tide at higher tidal amplitude could have resulted in a higher concentration of do at e2 low tide conditions with lower tidal amplitude restricted seawater influx and allowed more river influx resulting relatively higher do levels the estuaries are susceptible to receive organic matter mainly from agriculture domestic and industrial wastes bod levels in an aquatic system are related to the quantum of biodegradable organic matter and serves as an indicator of the degree of pollution williams and benson 2010 therefore a low bod is an indicator of good water quality while a high bod indicates polluted water the present study showed increased bod at e1 irrespective of tides during low tidal amplitude which could be attributed to the higher amount of fine organic material being flushed from the river sanderson and taylor 2003 in contrast no noteworthy pattern of bod variation was observed during higher tidal amplitude at both upper and lower estuary over tidal phases in general the distribution and concentration of inorganic macronutrient no 2 no 3 nh 4 po 4 3 sio 4 4 in an estuarine ecosystem depends on tidal conditions freshwater flow from land sources and rivers no 2 is the unstable form of nitrogenous nutrients being the intermediate output resulted from oxidation of nh 4 or reduction of no 3 ariza et al 1992 in estuaries no 2 is introduced either through freshwater discharge or released into the water as an extracellular product of plankton higher concentration of no 2 was noticed at e2 in comparison to e1 irrespective of tides could be cumulatively sourced from the riverine input and dinitrification in bottom sediments montani et al 1998 salahudeen et al 2018 it is important to mention here that e2 is relatively shallower than e1 in terms of the tidal scale no distinct tidal variation pattern for no 3 was observed at e1 however no 3 the final oxidation product of nitrogenous nutrients were prominently higher during low tide in comparison to high tide at e2 the higher concentration of no 3 during low tide might be sourced from industrial discharges and human excrement along with riverine flow davies and ugwumba 2013a on the other hand no 3 concentration could have also possibly decreased with increasing salinity attributed to dilution of no 3 enriched freshwater by tidal seawater page et al 1995 in concomitant to the present observation a higher level of no 3 during low tide have been also reported from other tropical estuarine ecosystems such as the pichavarm mangrove india and okpoka creek nigeria davies and ugwumba 2013a senthilkumar et al 2008 another important nitrogenous nutrient nh 4 is primarily introduced in to the estuarine ecosystems through terrestrial runoff zooplankton excretion and remineralisation of organic matter jawed 1973 correll and ford 1982 nh 4 is preferentially assimilated by phytoplankton assemblages for metabolism pennock 1987 on the other hand nh 4 converts to ammonia at elevated ph posing a threat in terms of toxicity to aquatic life especially fish and therefore considered as one of the aquatic pollution indicators eddy 2005 salama et al 2013 in mahanadi estuary higher and lower level of nh 4 were observed during low and high tides respectively at e2 however at e1 higher nh 4 concentrations were found during the higher tidal amplitude of high tide this pattern of nh 4 distribution in response to tides at e1 and e2 suggests influx production of nh 4 at the lower middle part of the estuary resulting in elevated levels at e2 and e1 during low tide and high tide respectively the nh 4 introduction to e2 could be sourced from water discharge industrial effluents and organic wastes from the nearby fishing harbor das et al 1997 madhu et al 2010a dixit et al 2013 srichandan et al 2019 po 4 3 is one of the important nutrients required for phytoplankton growth and therefore regarded as a limiting nutrient for primary production po 4 3 is introduced to estuaries from domestic sewage discharge agro industrial run off and weathering of rocks that mixes with river water in its course liu et al 2009 the higher values of po 4 3 at e2 more significantly during low tide could be attributed to the input of po 4 3 rich industrial effluents to the estuary through river influx srichandan et al 2019 major fertilizer industries discharge effluents to mahanadi estuary and these untreated acidic effluents are mainly responsible for increasing po 4 3 concentration panda et al 2006 the industrial effluents are discharged into the middle part of the estuary i e between e1 and e2 as a result po 4 3 concentration was observed higher during low tide at e2 due to the flow of po 4 3 rich river water towards the mouth the lower values of po 4 3 during high tide at e2 might be attributed to the dilution of seawater leading to the decrease in po 4 3 concentration senthilkumar et al 2008 e1 was observed with a lower concentration of po 4 3 except for some spikes during high tide which signified possible upstream ward flux of po 4 3 rich water from lower to the upper estuary sio 4 4 concentration e1 118 145 µmol l 1 e2 30 150 µmol l 1 observed in the present study is in corroboration to the previous studies that also reported higher levels towards end of south west monsoon period mishra et al 2018 further the above pattern of sio 4 4 variability signified prominent riverine sources at both upper and lower estuary montani et al 1998 at e2 the fall in sio 4 4 levels during high tide could be attributed to the dilution of this region with marine water influx and possible dissolved silica removal by adsorption onto the suspended sediments with increasing salinity panda et al 2006 in general the inorganic macronutrient concentration plays a pivotal role in phytoplankton ecology on the other hand differential rise fall in individual nutrient concentration also results in estuarine water pollution such as eutrophication thus nutrient stoichiometry serves as an important indicator of water quality carpenter et al 1998 phytoplankton species composition changes with the ambient molar ratios of nutrients jickells 1998 the molar ratio of sio 4 4 si nitrogen n no 2 no 3 nh 4 and po 4 3 p is often used to track the nutrient dynamics in an estuarine ecosystem xu et al 2008 srichandan et al 2015c si n p molar ratio of 16 16 1 in an aquatic ecosystem indicates the availability of sufficient nutrients required for phytoplankton growth and deviation from this ratio indicates potential nutrient limitation redfield 1958 brzezinski 1985 justic et al 1995a in general nitrogen limitation occurs in the condition of n p 16 and n si 1 phosphate limitation in the condition of n p 16 and si p 16 and silicate limitation when n si 1 and si p 16 justic et al 1995b xu et al 2008 in the present study n p and n si molar ratio remained 16 except one occasion at e1 and 1 respectively over the tidal period at both stations suggesting nitrogen limiting condition in the mahanadi estuary fig 5 the molar ratio conditions for po 4 3 and sio 4 4 limitation was not satisfied for both stations nitrogen has traditionally been considered as the nutrient that limits phytoplankton growth ryther and dunstan 1971 oviatt et al 1995 in concomitant other estuarine and coastal ecosystems along the east coast of india has been also reported with nitrogen limiting condition thangaradjou et al 2014 srichandan et al 2015c the lower value of n p molar ratio in the mahanadi estuary indicated the predominant contribution of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved inorganic phosphate from urbanized and or industrial watersheds in comparison to agricultural runoff to the estuary dey et al 2013 tsm in the estuarine waters may be organic phytoplankton cells marine detritus land plant fragments fecal pellets zooplankton eggs etc or inorganic various mineral grains colloidal aggregates in origin many factors affect the distribution of tsm in estuaries such as input sources stream discharge basin geology tidal circulation bathymetry water stability flocculation particle size organic productivity and wind d anglejan and smith 1973 in the present study higher tsm concentrations at low salinity conditions at e2 signified cumulative source from river discharge and re suspension of bottom sediment park 2007 furthermore tsm versus salinity plot also proved the prominent influence of freshwater discharge on the tsm loading at the low saline regime of e1 fig 7 cdom is an important component of dissolved organic matter pool in aquatic systems and used as a proxy for dissolved organic carbon in aquatic environments coble 1996 siegel et al 2002 the cdom in aquatic systems is generally of autochthonous and allochthonous origin liang et al 2015 a number of processes such as estuarine discharge local production by phytoplankton act as sources and sinks of cdom moran and zepp 1997 the cdom serves as a good indicator of environmental pollution in estuarine environments zhou et al 2016 a higher concentration of cdom was noticed during low tide at both e1 and e2 the riverine source of cdom having continental origin could be the reason for higher concentration during low tide bucci et al 2012 phytoplankton play a pivotal role in the estuarine oxygen cycle element cycling water quality and food supply to heterotrophs cloern 1996 therefore phytoplankton abundance and biomass are considered as key indicators for the health assessment of estuarine ecosystems however understanding the dynamics of phytoplankton in estuaries is particularly complex due to the interplay of biological chemical processes including growth respiration nutrient uptake remineralization grazing and physical transport processes driven by tides river runoff and vertical mixing cloern et al 2014 the response of the phytoplankton community to environmental change depends on phytoplankton cell size and species composition especially when the inputs are anthropogenic gobler et al 2006 lassen et al 2004 nayar et al 2005 totti et al 2005 the overall phytoplankton abundance gradually decreased with an increase in tidal amplitude this could be attributed to the increased rate of relative low productive marine influx at the lower estuary and further importation towards upper estuary with higher tidal amplitude in estuarine ecosystems the short term phytoplankton fluctuations appear to be tightly controlled by tidal amplitude cloern 1991 in terms of tidal scale chl a was observed to be higher during low tide at both e1 and e2 the upper estuarine region provides a stable environment for comparative better growth of phytoplankton assemblages in comparison to the lower estuary possible export of phytoplankton enriched water during low tide from upper to lower estuary could have elevated the concentration of total chl a in corroboration higher chl a concentration during low tide has been reported in other tropical estuaries bhargava 1973 davies and ugwumba 2013b in the context of phytoplankton size classes micro nano and picophytoplankton contribute proportionately to the concentration of total chl a srichandan et al 2019 the relative contribution of the different size classes to the total planktonic community influences the functioning of the ecosystem due to the effects of cell size on growth rates trophic interactions sinking and resuspension rates cermeno et al 2006 in general large sized phytoplankton have greater potential to export organic matter through a short classical food chain while the small sized phytoplankton are utilized by complex microbial food webs that favor the recycling of organic matter cermeno et al 2006 madhu et al 2010b the phytoplankton size classes respond quickly to the variability in the abiotic and biotic environmental variables lancelot and muylaert 2011 mohan et al 2016 the small sized phytoplankton size class i e picophytoplankton grow faster than large cells attributed to their high surface to volume ratio enabling the assimilation of ambient nutrients during tidal propagation hein et al 1995 picophytoplankton form an important component of phytoplankton size classes in marine and freshwater systems salinity plays an important role in the spatial distribution of picophytoplankton rajaneesh and mitbavkar 2013 synechococcus one of the major representatives of picophytoplankton proliferates in nutrient rich coastal ecosystems jochem 1988 the phycocyanin rich synechococcus dominates in lower saline waters and could have formed the assemblages at e1 resulting in higher biomass murrell and lores 2004 in another scenario picophytoplankton proliferation at e1 might be due to the lower predation pressure from heterotrophic nanophytoplankton as these are largely concentrated at lower estuary sooria et al 2015 in general the significant contribution of nanophytoplankton to the total chl a in nutrient rich estuarine waters is well accepted jyothibabu et al 2013 nanophytoplankton efficiently utilize nutrients in comparison to larger phytoplankton madhu et al 2010b the prevalence of nanophytoplankton in river mouth regions has been observed in estuaries under high saline conditions pan et al 2007 the major phytoplankton grazer zooplankton play important role in estuarine food web and nutrient recycling madhupratap 1987 sterner et al 1992 zooplankton occupy a key position in the plankton food web by transferring organic carbon from phytoplankton and bacteria to higher trophic levels azam et al 1983 in general estuarine zooplankton are enabled with several adaptive mechanisms zooplankton distribution in estuarine ecosystems are controlled by downstream drift and large fluctuations in salinity induced by tidal incursion and river runoff speirs and gurney 2001 vineetha et al 2015 in similar the higher zooplankton density observed at e1 during the high tide could be attributed to the inflow of seawater containing marine zooplankton srichandan et al 2013 on the other hand no prominent tidal pattern of zooplankton density at e2 could be related to the retention of high tide driven zooplankton resulting in cumulative population rise during low tide davies and ugwumba 2013a in general marine zooplankton assemblages migrate to the estuary during high tide and a considerable volume is flushed out during low tide 4 1 interrelation among physico chemical and biological variables the interrelation among the physico chemical and biological variables was studied through pca fig 8 the pca biplot for e1 showed opposite grouping of zooplankton density and phytoplankton signifying grazing pressure of the former on the later calbet and landry 2004 in general sio 4 4 is considered as a controlling factor of phytoplankton production in estuaries dominated by bacillariophyta srichandan et al 2015c in the present study the opposite grouping of sio 4 4 and no 3 with phytoplankton abundance npb and ppb signified efficient assimilation of the siliceous nutrients by the primary producers in concomitant inverse relation between phytoplankton and sio 4 4 has been observed in many other tropical estuarine ecosystems jacquet et al 2006 pednekar et al 2014 srichandan et al 2015c in general bacillariophyta growth can be sio 4 4 limited in the condition of n si molar ratio greater than 1 roberts et al 2003 in the present study the n si molar ratio was 1 which suggested that the system with relatively lower levels of no 3 and very higher levels of sio 4 4 can be less favourable for bacillariophyta proliferation significant control of phytoplankton assemblages on the oxygen dynamics of the estuarine water was observed from the close grouping of do and bod with autotrophic variables in addition simultaneous phytoplankton production and degradation could be the reason behind the association of do bod and autotrophic parameters the distant grouping of salinity and do in the pca biplot could be ascribed to riverine freshwater as source of oxygen sahoo et al 2017 the close association of tsm with no 3 and sio 4 4 suggested source of these inorganic macronutrients from the former sahoo et al 2017 on the other hand nh 4 and po 4 3 was observed in close association with salinity this pattern of component loading indicated lower degree of contribution of riverine freshwater for these inorganic macronutrients the influx of higher saline marine water during high tide acted as the loading factor for the above nutrients at e1 as like the scenario in e1 zooplankton grazing on the phytoplankton community was also evident from the opposite grouping of the former with later along with npb at e2 fig 8 it s important to mention here that nanophytoplankton was the dominant contributor to total phytoplankton biomass at e2 pca biplot also discerned low saline water preferably during low tide enhanced the phytoplankton assemblage especially nanophytoplankton a similar higher phytoplankton assemblages in association with low tide attributed to advection of phytoplankton rich water masses from the upper estuary has been reported in many estuarine systems trigueros and orive 2000 wetz et al 2006 domingues et al 2010 pca biplot showed that in the lower estuarine zone of mahanadi low saline water preferably during low tide elevated do levels as a result of more freshwater influx mitra and zaman 2016 pca biplot also depicted that high production followed by bacterial degradation resulting an increase in bod levels as evident from the distant grouping of bod with do and autotrophic parameters in addition the influx of organic matter sourced from the dumping of fishery waste from the nearby fishing jetty and the fish market could also have played a major role in the increment of bod levels close association of po 4 3 and sio 4 4 with autotrophic variables suggested non limitation of these nutrients for phytoplankton growth a close association of ppb with po 4 3 and nh 4 was evident from the biplot of e2 fig 8 in general the picophytoplankton populations are predominantly represented by cyanobacterial forms that preferentially grow well with higher po 4 3 levels jyothibabu et al 2013 the influence of a low n p molar ratio resulting in higher abundances of cyanobacteria has been reported earlier in the mahanadi estuary dey et al 2013 in addition a close association of ppb with wt signified the role of higher wt for the growth of this smallest phytoplankton size class quinlan and phlips 2007 pca biplot of e2 also explained the possible source of nh 4 and po 4 3 from cdom the photo degradation of cdom releases nh 4 and po 4 3 in estuarine ecosystems francko and heath 1982 bushaw et al 1996 madhu et al 2010a 5 conclusion tidally influenced water movements in an estuary serve as a vehicle for fluxes of particulate and dissolved organic as well as inorganic matter into the adjoining coastal system the present study provides a snapshot of physical chemical and biological parameter dynamics in response to semi diurnal tides in mahanadi estuary all the environmental parameters varied in response to the tidal oscillations and a schematic representation of the variability is illustrated as fig 9 however significant variability was noticed for salinity po 4 3 and ppb between upper and lower estuary irrespective of tides between high and low tide salinity and nh 4 varied significantly irrespective of sites a higher number of environmental parameters varied prominently between high and low tide at the lower estuary in comparison to the upper estuary multivariate statistical ordination also substantiated the pivotal role of tidal forcing on the estuarine water quality the higher mixing at lower estuary resulted in a lower range of variation in water temperature following the tidal pattern with low during high tide and high during low tide salinity distribution signified the upper estuary as a freshwater regime in contrast the steep gradient between rising and fall of salinity corresponding to high and low tide respectively showed prominent tidal influence in the lower estuary riverine source of tsm and cdom into the estuary was denoted from higher concentration during low tide the photo degradation of cdom could have released nh 4 and po 4 3 in the upper estuary do levels responded quickly to tidal amplitude the higher degree of oxygen rich riverine freshwater elevated do concentration at the upper estuary while mixing played a pivotal role in the lower estuary during high tide at higher tidal amplitude bod levels below 4 mg l 1 at both lower and upper estuary signified the water quality in the category between fairly clean and moderately polluted autotrophic production followed by bacterial degradation and possible decomposition of anthropogenic organic matter controlled bod dynamics in the lower estuary spatial variability of no 3 in response to tides discerned possible source from the influx of industrial discharges and human excrement along with the riverine flow nh 4 distribution in response to tides at upper and lower estuary suggested influx production of nh 4 at the lower middle part of the estuary resulting in elevated levels at lower and upper estuary during low and high tide respectively higher concentration of po 4 3 at lower estuary during low tide could be attributed to the importation of po 4 3 rich industrial effluents fluxed from the middle part of the estuary towards the mouth higher concentration of sio 4 4 at upper estuary irrespective of tides signified prominent riverine source inorganic macronutrient stoichiometry suggested potential nitrogen limiting conditions in the estuary the advection of phytoplankton rich water masses from the upper estuary possibly resulted in higher abundances during low tide at the lower estuary pico and nanophytoplankton were emerged as the dominant contributor to total phytoplankton biomass at the upper and lower estuary respectively irrespective of tides lower n p molar ratio possibly stimulated picophytoplankton prevalence in the lower estuary the tidal amplitude had considerable effects on the zooplankton with rising in density during high tide attributed to the inflow of seawater containing marine zooplankton the present study is the first attempt to investigate the water quality parameters over a tidal cycle at upper and lower mahanadi estuary further studies including numerical modeling are very much essential to understand the seasonality of

989,one of the significant aspects of estuarine water quality assessment is to discern the effect of tide on the environmental parameters the variability of different physical chemical and biological parameters in response to semi diurnal tides over a tidal cycle was investigated at contrasting salinity regimes of mahanadi estuary this estuary is formed at the mouth of mahanadi river the third largest river in peninsular india that meets the bay of bengal on the east coast of india significant variability was observed in salinity phosphate concentration picophytoplankton biomass between upper and lower estuary irrespective of tides salinity and ammonium concentration varied significantly between high and low tide irrespective of sites a low salinity regime was observed in the upper estuary dissolved oxygen levels were higher at the lower estuary and relatively decreased at the upper estuary during high tide with increased tidal amplitude the biochemical oxygen demand levels 4 mg l 1 signified estuarine water quality in between fairly clean and moderately polluted ammonium and phosphate distribution suggested anthropogenic influx at the lower middle part of the estuary higher silicate content in upper estuary regardless of tides indicated prominent riverine source inorganic macronutrient molar ratios indicated a potential nitrogen limiting condition smaller phytoplankton size classes contributed predominantly to total phytoplankton biomass irrespective of tides this study highlighted the significance of continuous sampling over the tidal cycle to understand the effect

size fractionated phytoplankton biomass was measured in terms of chlorophyll a chl a following spectrophotometric method strickland and parsons 1972 water samples 1 liter were immediately fixed with lugol s iodine formalin solution soon after collection for analysis of phytoplankton phytoplankton abundance was determined with aid of a compound light microscope make labomed model lx400 zooplankton samples were collected from the surface by horizontally hauling a plankton net mesh size 120 µm equipped with a flow meter and immediately preserved with formaldehyde principal component analysis pca was performed on the normalized physico chemical biological datasets by spss statistical package v 20 following the sequential steps as described in sahoo et al 2017 pca is one of the important multivariate statistical methods useful in tracing out the latent variables from a set of environmental data based on the contrasting salinity regime site specific i e for e1 and e2 pca was carried out to understand the interrelation among the environmental variables varimax rotation method with kaiser normalization was adopted for pca considerable variability was explained by principal components 1 and 2 for both sites and therefore used in the generation of biplots the component loading scores are provided as supplementary fig 1 one way analysis of variance anova which provides statistical indicators defining differences among the groups was computed using the data analysis tool pack of the microsoft office spreadsheet program anova has been shown to be an effective statistical method to understand the variability of hydro biological variables at spatial and temporal scales srichandan et al 2015a baliarsingh et al 2021 the significant spatial and temporal variability of parameters was defined at the significance level of 0 05 denoting 95 confidence levels graphical illustrations were prepared using grapher 8 8 3 results different physico chemical and biological datasets were collected during each high and low tide over a period of seven consecutive days variability of different physico chemical and biological parameters was examined statistically through anova table 1 among all the hydro biological variables salinity variability was significant between tides as well as between sites i e e1 and e2 apart from salinity significant variability was noticed for po 4 3 and ppb between e1 and e2 irrespective of tides variability of do and nitrogenous nutrients between e1 and e2 were prominent during low tide unlike the scenario of low tide significant variability of tsm po 4 3 sio 4 4 chl a ppb and phytoplankton abundance during high tide was observed between e1 and e2 table 1 among the inorganic macronutrients significant variability of nh 4 was observed between high and low tide irrespective of sites i e e1 and e2 a higher number of environmental parameters varied significantly between high and low tide at e2 in comparison to e1 the variability of different parameters in response to the tidal oscillation at e1 and e2 is described in detail in the following sections 3 1 tidal and spatial variability of physical parameters among the environmental variables water temperature wt followed a clear pattern with high maximum 32 84 c and low minimum 30 24 c values during low and high tides respectively at e2 fig 3 during high tide wt ranged between 30 24 and 32 40 c whereas during low tide the variability was observed between 31 58 and 32 84 c the station e1 27 68 36 77 c was noticed with a relatively higher range compared to e2 30 24 32 84 c over the entire tidal cycle at e1 wt ranged from 27 68 to 36 77 c during high tide while it was ranged from 30 96 to 34 41 c during low tide in context to the variability from day 1 to day 7 a prominent diurnal cycle depicting an increase in wt during the daytime was evident at e1 fig 3 salinity variability within a very lower range 0 08 2 71 psu delineated e1 as a freshwater regime fig 3 although marginal the influence of high tide in injecting relatively higher saline water from the adjoining bob was observed at e1 the maximum salinity magnitude of 0 54 psu during low tide increased up to 2 71 psu during high tide in general e1 displayed characteristics of a freshwater regime with less quantum of saline water influx over the tidal cycle day 1 to day 7 on the other hand salinity oscillation at e2 was observed with a steep gradient between rising maximum 20 71 psu and fall minimum 1 49 psu of salinity corresponding to high and low tide respectively as the tidal amplitude progressed to a higher range from day 1 to day 7 the salinity variability range also increased showing a pronounced tidal influence in the lower estuary do variability was very dynamic over the tidal cycle at e1 and e2 do concentrations were higher at e1 in comparison to e2 during low tide during high tide conditions with low tidal amplitude day 1 to day 3 do levels were observed higher at e1 fig 3 however the pattern of variability was similar at both stations during high tide with higher tidal amplitudes day 4 to day 7 during high tide the pattern reversed with higher concentration at e2 and lower at e1 in the context of bod the magnitude was below 4 mg l 1 at both lower and upper estuary which indicated the water quality of the mahanadi estuary in between fairly clean and moderately polluted fig 3 in general bod levels 2 mg l 1 5 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 classify the river water quality as clean moderately polluted and heavily polluted respectively hocking 2005 during low tidal amplitude day 1 to day 3 bod levels were observed higher at e1 in comparison to e2 irrespective of tides however during higher tidal amplitude day 4 to day 7 the pattern of variability was sometimes higher during high and low tide at both upper as well as the lower estuary 3 2 tidal and spatial variability of inorganic macronutrients mahanadi estuary showed a wide range of concentration of dissolved nutrients no 2 no 3 nh 4 po 4 3 sio 4 4 during the present study among nitrogenous nutrients no 2 no 3 nh 4 the average concentration of no 2 was observed as 0 14 0 10 µmol l 1 at e1 and 0 43 0 42 µmol l 1 at e2 fig 4 there was no prominent variability of no 2 in response to daily fluctuation in tidal levels in most instances no 2 concentration was relatively higher at e2 in comparison to e1 irrespective of tides however the average concentration of no 2 was higher during low tide at e2 except for few occasions a marginal increasing pattern in the magnitude of no 2 was observed from day 1 to day 7 at e2 no significant variation of no 2 was observed between high tide 0 0 39 µmol l 1 and low tide 0 01 0 21 µmol l 1 at e1 no 3 one of the most important inorganic nitrogenous macronutrients that promote phytoplankton growth was observed with a pattern of rising in concentration during low tide 3 53 8 12 µmol l 1 and fall 2 19 5 93 µmol l 1 during high tide at e2 fig 4 at lower tidal amplitude during day 1 and day 2 maximum difference between the magnitudes of no 3 was noticed at e2 in contrast to e2 no 3 concentration was comparatively lower during low tide at e1 however the range of variability did not differ greatly between low 2 16 7 27 µmol l 1 and high tide 2 28 8 50 µmol l 1 at e1 nh 4 the preferentially assimilated nitrogenous macronutrients by phytoplankton varied within 0 32 4 45 µmol l 1 and 0 44 5 47 µmol l 1 at e1 and e2 respectively fig 4 tidal influence on the variability of nh 4 concentration was more prominent at e2 in comparison to e1 rise and fall in nh 4 levels were associated with low and high tides respectively excluding a couple of instances at e2 at higher tidal amplitude e1 was observed with higher nh 4 concentration during high tide day 5 to day 7 although similar pattern was noticed from day 1 to day 4 the concentration of nh 4 was relatively lower in comparison to day 5 to day 7 at e1 in addition to nitrogenous nutrients the ambient concentration of po 4 3 and sio 4 4 play an important role in phytoplankton growth the concentration of po 4 3 was higher at e2 in comparison to e1 variability of po 4 3 followed a pattern of rising during low tide 5 63 38 13 µmol l 1 and fall during high tide 2 20 22 78 µmol l 1 at e2 fig 4 po 4 3 concentration was ranged within 0 29 18 30 µmol l 1 during high tide and 0 57 27 76 µmol l 1 during low tide at e1 fig 4 po 4 3 was observed with very lower levels day 1 to day 3 excluding a few high values day 4 to day 7 at e1 and no prominent pattern in response to oscillating tides sio 4 4 an important phytoplankton growth promoting nutrient especially for diatoms was observed with higher concentration 118 145 µmol l 1 at e1 irrespective of tides fig 4 in contrast a significant response of sio 4 4 to oscillating tides were observed with rising maximum 150 µmol l 1 and fall minimum 30 µmol l 1 in concentration during low and high tide respectively at e2 a relative decrease in sio 4 4 was observed from day 4 to day 7 at e2 during high tide 3 3 tidal and spatial variability of suspended and organic matter the variability of tsm revealed no significant trend at both e1 and e2 however higher concentrations were observed many times during low tide at both e1 and e2 fig 3 a prominent rise in tsm concentration was noticed from day 5 to day 7 during low tide at e2 tsm concentration varied within a similar range 2 24 mg l 1 at both e1 and e2 during low tide a higher concentration of tsm was observed at e1 in comparison to e2 indicating a riverine source of tsm in the estuary in regards to the organic matter the values of cdom was higher during low tide and varied within a similar range at both e1 6 70 8 24 ppb and e2 6 97 9 73 ppb fig 5 e2 showed prominent variation in cdom concentration in response to tidal oscillation in comparison to e1 from day 5 to day 7 a significant reduction in the levels of cdom was prominent at e2 during high tides the upstream station e1 with a relatively higher degree of freshwater flux was observed with a higher concentration 7 8 ppb during most of the times except a couple of sharp increases and decreases 3 4 tidal and spatial variability of biological variables the estuarine plankton phyto and zoo assemblages were observed to be greatly influenced by the tidal cycle especially in the upper reaches the average abundance of phytoplankton was marginally higher during high tide 38 16 104 cells l 1 in comparison to low tide 31 16 104 cells l 1 at e1 fig 6 this pattern could be attributed to the addition of resilient phytoplankton species with the species carried away from the lower estuary with high tide in contrast a reverse pattern was found at e2 with higher average phytoplankton abundance during low tide 25 16 104 cells l 1 than high tide 21 17 104 cells l 1 this pattern signified the upper estuarine origin of the phytoplankton assemblages the overall phytoplankton abundance was higher at lower tidal amplitude day 1 to day 2 at both e1 and e2 fig 6 in the context of zooplankton tidal amplitude had considerable effects on the zooplankton with increased density during high tide average 14 102 org m 3 in comparison to low tide average 7 102 org m 3 at e1 fig 5 however tidal variability of zooplankton assemblage at e2 1 12 102 org m 3 was not prominent as higher densities were observed during six occasions of each high and low tide in general a marginal increase in the density was noticed from day 4 to day 6 at e2 fig 5 the phytoplankton biomass i e total chl a concentration was observed with a pattern of rising during low tide and fall during high tide with the exception of some instances at both e1 as well as e2 fig 6 the maximum chl a concentration of 13 67 mg m 3 was noticed during low tide at e1 and 9 49 mg m 3 at e2 fig 6 higher degree of fluctuation in chl a with lower magnitude was observed from day 2 to day 4 at e1 on the other hand very low concentration of chl a was observed from day 6 to day 7 at e2 in the context of phytoplankton size class biomass the average concentration of ppb remained higher at e1 irrespective of tides fig 6 whereas average npb concentration was higher at e2 irrespective of tides although the highest concentration was registered for npb among the phytoplankton size classes at e1 9 82 mg m 3 during low tide the average concentration remained higher for ppb over the tidal period at e1 ppb exhibited higher average concentration over the tidal period high tide 4 93 2 mg m 3 and low tide 5 43 3 mg m 3 in comparison to other size classes at e1 fig 6 a prominent pattern of increase in ppb concentration during low tide and decrease during high tide was noticed at e1 from day 2 to day 4 a similar decrease in ppb concentration was also noticed during high tide at e2 from day 4 to day 7 e2 was observed with dominant contribution from both npb and ppb at different occasions during low tide however npb mostly dominated the average phytoplankton size class biomass during low tide at e2 npb concentration remained 3 mg m 3 from day 4 to day 7 at e2 irrespective of tides except two occasions a negligible variation in concentration of npb with respect to tides was observed at e1 from day 2 to day 4 the mpb biomass remained below 2 mg m 3 irrespective of tides at e2 with a single occurrence of high value during both low tide 2 77 mg m 3 and high tide 2 71 mg m 3 in similar e1 was also observed with mpb biomass below 2 mg m 3 with two occasions of marginal high values associated with low tide fig 6 4 discussion estuaries are complex environments and their inhabitants whether migratory or resident are exposed to daily and seasonal changes in physico chemical parameters eddy 2005 the quantum of fresh and marine water influx during a tidal cycle plays important role in estuarine biogeochemistry monbet 1992 montani et al 1998 thus physico chemical and biological datasets were collected during each high as well as low tide over a period of seven consecutive days in general wt in aquatic ecosystems exhibits strong effects on the physiology of organisms madeira et al 2013 on the other hand wt in an estuary is influenced by the intensity of solar radiation evaporation rate freshwater inflow and tidal mixing with seawater srichandan et al 2015b the contrast between the wt variation pattern between e1 and e2 could be attributed to the degree of tidal mixing at both locations the higher mixing at e2 resulted in a lower range of variation in wt and clearly followed the tidal pattern with low during high tide and high during low tide in general wt at e1 was higher in comparison to e2 during low tide the relatively warm water ingress from e1 to e2 could have elevated wt the influx of seawater with a higher rate of mixing during high tide could have resulted in lower wt at e2 among the estuarine hydrological parameters salinity is primarily influenced by the freshwater influx from the river which reflects the hydrologic budget of the watershed rodriguez 1975 salinity gradient from the upper to lower estuary is a major characteristics feature of the estuaries prandle 2009 in the present study e1 was completely occupied with freshwater where tidal influence was less on the other hand e2 showed significant variation over tidal phases with higher salinity during high tide in comparison to low tide similar higher salinity at high tide than low tide has been reported in many tropical estuarine ecosystems gouda and panigrahy 1989 gajbhiye et al 1984 do is an important constituent of aquatic medium and its magnitude serves as an indicator of water quality adequate concentration of do supports well balanced aquatic life george et al 2012 along the tidal scale a noticeable change in do was observed with a higher value during low tide at e1 than e2 e2 is relatively shallower than e1 and susceptible to low oxygenated conditions of sediment water interface attributed to organic matter remineralization noriega and araujo 2014 further high tide conditions with low tidal amplitude showing higher do levels at e1 could be ascribed to the higher degree of oxygen rich riverine freshwater prevalence at e1 irrespective of tides george et al 2012 manna et al 2013 on the other hand a higher degree of mixing during high tide at higher tidal amplitude could have resulted in a higher concentration of do at e2 low tide conditions with lower tidal amplitude restricted seawater influx and allowed more river influx resulting relatively higher do levels the estuaries are susceptible to receive organic matter mainly from agriculture domestic and industrial wastes bod levels in an aquatic system are related to the quantum of biodegradable organic matter and serves as an indicator of the degree of pollution williams and benson 2010 therefore a low bod is an indicator of good water quality while a high bod indicates polluted water the present study showed increased bod at e1 irrespective of tides during low tidal amplitude which could be attributed to the higher amount of fine organic material being flushed from the river sanderson and taylor 2003 in contrast no noteworthy pattern of bod variation was observed during higher tidal amplitude at both upper and lower estuary over tidal phases in general the distribution and concentration of inorganic macronutrient no 2 no 3 nh 4 po 4 3 sio 4 4 in an estuarine ecosystem depends on tidal conditions freshwater flow from land sources and rivers no 2 is the unstable form of nitrogenous nutrients being the intermediate output resulted from oxidation of nh 4 or reduction of no 3 ariza et al 1992 in estuaries no 2 is introduced either through freshwater discharge or released into the water as an extracellular product of plankton higher concentration of no 2 was noticed at e2 in comparison to e1 irrespective of tides could be cumulatively sourced from the riverine input and dinitrification in bottom sediments montani et al 1998 salahudeen et al 2018 it is important to mention here that e2 is relatively shallower than e1 in terms of the tidal scale no distinct tidal variation pattern for no 3 was observed at e1 however no 3 the final oxidation product of nitrogenous nutrients were prominently higher during low tide in comparison to high tide at e2 the higher concentration of no 3 during low tide might be sourced from industrial discharges and human excrement along with riverine flow davies and ugwumba 2013a on the other hand no 3 concentration could have also possibly decreased with increasing salinity attributed to dilution of no 3 enriched freshwater by tidal seawater page et al 1995 in concomitant to the present observation a higher level of no 3 during low tide have been also reported from other tropical estuarine ecosystems such as the pichavarm mangrove india and okpoka creek nigeria davies and ugwumba 2013a senthilkumar et al 2008 another important nitrogenous nutrient nh 4 is primarily introduced in to the estuarine ecosystems through terrestrial runoff zooplankton excretion and remineralisation of organic matter jawed 1973 correll and ford 1982 nh 4 is preferentially assimilated by phytoplankton assemblages for metabolism pennock 1987 on the other hand nh 4 converts to ammonia at elevated ph posing a threat in terms of toxicity to aquatic life especially fish and therefore considered as one of the aquatic pollution indicators eddy 2005 salama et al 2013 in mahanadi estuary higher and lower level of nh 4 were observed during low and high tides respectively at e2 however at e1 higher nh 4 concentrations were found during the higher tidal amplitude of high tide this pattern of nh 4 distribution in response to tides at e1 and e2 suggests influx production of nh 4 at the lower middle part of the estuary resulting in elevated levels at e2 and e1 during low tide and high tide respectively the nh 4 introduction to e2 could be sourced from water discharge industrial effluents and organic wastes from the nearby fishing harbor das et al 1997 madhu et al 2010a dixit et al 2013 srichandan et al 2019 po 4 3 is one of the important nutrients required for phytoplankton growth and therefore regarded as a limiting nutrient for primary production po 4 3 is introduced to estuaries from domestic sewage discharge agro industrial run off and weathering of rocks that mixes with river water in its course liu et al 2009 the higher values of po 4 3 at e2 more significantly during low tide could be attributed to the input of po 4 3 rich industrial effluents to the estuary through river influx srichandan et al 2019 major fertilizer industries discharge effluents to mahanadi estuary and these untreated acidic effluents are mainly responsible for increasing po 4 3 concentration panda et al 2006 the industrial effluents are discharged into the middle part of the estuary i e between e1 and e2 as a result po 4 3 concentration was observed higher during low tide at e2 due to the flow of po 4 3 rich river water towards the mouth the lower values of po 4 3 during high tide at e2 might be attributed to the dilution of seawater leading to the decrease in po 4 3 concentration senthilkumar et al 2008 e1 was observed with a lower concentration of po 4 3 except for some spikes during high tide which signified possible upstream ward flux of po 4 3 rich water from lower to the upper estuary sio 4 4 concentration e1 118 145 µmol l 1 e2 30 150 µmol l 1 observed in the present study is in corroboration to the previous studies that also reported higher levels towards end of south west monsoon period mishra et al 2018 further the above pattern of sio 4 4 variability signified prominent riverine sources at both upper and lower estuary montani et al 1998 at e2 the fall in sio 4 4 levels during high tide could be attributed to the dilution of this region with marine water influx and possible dissolved silica removal by adsorption onto the suspended sediments with increasing salinity panda et al 2006 in general the inorganic macronutrient concentration plays a pivotal role in phytoplankton ecology on the other hand differential rise fall in individual nutrient concentration also results in estuarine water pollution such as eutrophication thus nutrient stoichiometry serves as an important indicator of water quality carpenter et al 1998 phytoplankton species composition changes with the ambient molar ratios of nutrients jickells 1998 the molar ratio of sio 4 4 si nitrogen n no 2 no 3 nh 4 and po 4 3 p is often used to track the nutrient dynamics in an estuarine ecosystem xu et al 2008 srichandan et al 2015c si n p molar ratio of 16 16 1 in an aquatic ecosystem indicates the availability of sufficient nutrients required for phytoplankton growth and deviation from this ratio indicates potential nutrient limitation redfield 1958 brzezinski 1985 justic et al 1995a in general nitrogen limitation occurs in the condition of n p 16 and n si 1 phosphate limitation in the condition of n p 16 and si p 16 and silicate limitation when n si 1 and si p 16 justic et al 1995b xu et al 2008 in the present study n p and n si molar ratio remained 16 except one occasion at e1 and 1 respectively over the tidal period at both stations suggesting nitrogen limiting condition in the mahanadi estuary fig 5 the molar ratio conditions for po 4 3 and sio 4 4 limitation was not satisfied for both stations nitrogen has traditionally been considered as the nutrient that limits phytoplankton growth ryther and dunstan 1971 oviatt et al 1995 in concomitant other estuarine and coastal ecosystems along the east coast of india has been also reported with nitrogen limiting condition thangaradjou et al 2014 srichandan et al 2015c the lower value of n p molar ratio in the mahanadi estuary indicated the predominant contribution of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved inorganic phosphate from urbanized and or industrial watersheds in comparison to agricultural runoff to the estuary dey et al 2013 tsm in the estuarine waters may be organic phytoplankton cells marine detritus land plant fragments fecal pellets zooplankton eggs etc or inorganic various mineral grains colloidal aggregates in origin many factors affect the distribution of tsm in estuaries such as input sources stream discharge basin geology tidal circulation bathymetry water stability flocculation particle size organic productivity and wind d anglejan and smith 1973 in the present study higher tsm concentrations at low salinity conditions at e2 signified cumulative source from river discharge and re suspension of bottom sediment park 2007 furthermore tsm versus salinity plot also proved the prominent influence of freshwater discharge on the tsm loading at the low saline regime of e1 fig 7 cdom is an important component of dissolved organic matter pool in aquatic systems and used as a proxy for dissolved organic carbon in aquatic environments coble 1996 siegel et al 2002 the cdom in aquatic systems is generally of autochthonous and allochthonous origin liang et al 2015 a number of processes such as estuarine discharge local production by phytoplankton act as sources and sinks of cdom moran and zepp 1997 the cdom serves as a good indicator of environmental pollution in estuarine environments zhou et al 2016 a higher concentration of cdom was noticed during low tide at both e1 and e2 the riverine source of cdom having continental origin could be the reason for higher concentration during low tide bucci et al 2012 phytoplankton play a pivotal role in the estuarine oxygen cycle element cycling water quality and food supply to heterotrophs cloern 1996 therefore phytoplankton abundance and biomass are considered as key indicators for the health assessment of estuarine ecosystems however understanding the dynamics of phytoplankton in estuaries is particularly complex due to the interplay of biological chemical processes including growth respiration nutrient uptake remineralization grazing and physical transport processes driven by tides river runoff and vertical mixing cloern et al 2014 the response of the phytoplankton community to environmental change depends on phytoplankton cell size and species composition especially when the inputs are anthropogenic gobler et al 2006 lassen et al 2004 nayar et al 2005 totti et al 2005 the overall phytoplankton abundance gradually decreased with an increase in tidal amplitude this could be attributed to the increased rate of relative low productive marine influx at the lower estuary and further importation towards upper estuary with higher tidal amplitude in estuarine ecosystems the short term phytoplankton fluctuations appear to be tightly controlled by tidal amplitude cloern 1991 in terms of tidal scale chl a was observed to be higher during low tide at both e1 and e2 the upper estuarine region provides a stable environment for comparative better growth of phytoplankton assemblages in comparison to the lower estuary possible export of phytoplankton enriched water during low tide from upper to lower estuary could have elevated the concentration of total chl a in corroboration higher chl a concentration during low tide has been reported in other tropical estuaries bhargava 1973 davies and ugwumba 2013b in the context of phytoplankton size classes micro nano and picophytoplankton contribute proportionately to the concentration of total chl a srichandan et al 2019 the relative contribution of the different size classes to the total planktonic community influences the functioning of the ecosystem due to the effects of cell size on growth rates trophic interactions sinking and resuspension rates cermeno et al 2006 in general large sized phytoplankton have greater potential to export organic matter through a short classical food chain while the small sized phytoplankton are utilized by complex microbial food webs that favor the recycling of organic matter cermeno et al 2006 madhu et al 2010b the phytoplankton size classes respond quickly to the variability in the abiotic and biotic environmental variables lancelot and muylaert 2011 mohan et al 2016 the small sized phytoplankton size class i e picophytoplankton grow faster than large cells attributed to their high surface to volume ratio enabling the assimilation of ambient nutrients during tidal propagation hein et al 1995 picophytoplankton form an important component of phytoplankton size classes in marine and freshwater systems salinity plays an important role in the spatial distribution of picophytoplankton rajaneesh and mitbavkar 2013 synechococcus one of the major representatives of picophytoplankton proliferates in nutrient rich coastal ecosystems jochem 1988 the phycocyanin rich synechococcus dominates in lower saline waters and could have formed the assemblages at e1 resulting in higher biomass murrell and lores 2004 in another scenario picophytoplankton proliferation at e1 might be due to the lower predation pressure from heterotrophic nanophytoplankton as these are largely concentrated at lower estuary sooria et al 2015 in general the significant contribution of nanophytoplankton to the total chl a in nutrient rich estuarine waters is well accepted jyothibabu et al 2013 nanophytoplankton efficiently utilize nutrients in comparison to larger phytoplankton madhu et al 2010b the prevalence of nanophytoplankton in river mouth regions has been observed in estuaries under high saline conditions pan et al 2007 the major phytoplankton grazer zooplankton play important role in estuarine food web and nutrient recycling madhupratap 1987 sterner et al 1992 zooplankton occupy a key position in the plankton food web by transferring organic carbon from phytoplankton and bacteria to higher trophic levels azam et al 1983 in general estuarine zooplankton are enabled with several adaptive mechanisms zooplankton distribution in estuarine ecosystems are controlled by downstream drift and large fluctuations in salinity induced by tidal incursion and river runoff speirs and gurney 2001 vineetha et al 2015 in similar the higher zooplankton density observed at e1 during the high tide could be attributed to the inflow of seawater containing marine zooplankton srichandan et al 2013 on the other hand no prominent tidal pattern of zooplankton density at e2 could be related to the retention of high tide driven zooplankton resulting in cumulative population rise during low tide davies and ugwumba 2013a in general marine zooplankton assemblages migrate to the estuary during high tide and a considerable volume is flushed out during low tide 4 1 interrelation among physico chemical and biological variables the interrelation among the physico chemical and biological variables was studied through pca fig 8 the pca biplot for e1 showed opposite grouping of zooplankton density and phytoplankton signifying grazing pressure of the former on the later calbet and landry 2004 in general sio 4 4 is considered as a controlling factor of phytoplankton production in estuaries dominated by bacillariophyta srichandan et al 2015c in the present study the opposite grouping of sio 4 4 and no 3 with phytoplankton abundance npb and ppb signified efficient assimilation of the siliceous nutrients by the primary producers in concomitant inverse relation between phytoplankton and sio 4 4 has been observed in many other tropical estuarine ecosystems jacquet et al 2006 pednekar et al 2014 srichandan et al 2015c in general bacillariophyta growth can be sio 4 4 limited in the condition of n si molar ratio greater than 1 roberts et al 2003 in the present study the n si molar ratio was 1 which suggested that the system with relatively lower levels of no 3 and very higher levels of sio 4 4 can be less favourable for bacillariophyta proliferation significant control of phytoplankton assemblages on the oxygen dynamics of the estuarine water was observed from the close grouping of do and bod with autotrophic variables in addition simultaneous phytoplankton production and degradation could be the reason behind the association of do bod and autotrophic parameters the distant grouping of salinity and do in the pca biplot could be ascribed to riverine freshwater as source of oxygen sahoo et al 2017 the close association of tsm with no 3 and sio 4 4 suggested source of these inorganic macronutrients from the former sahoo et al 2017 on the other hand nh 4 and po 4 3 was observed in close association with salinity this pattern of component loading indicated lower degree of contribution of riverine freshwater for these inorganic macronutrients the influx of higher saline marine water during high tide acted as the loading factor for the above nutrients at e1 as like the scenario in e1 zooplankton grazing on the phytoplankton community was also evident from the opposite grouping of the former with later along with npb at e2 fig 8 it s important to mention here that nanophytoplankton was the dominant contributor to total phytoplankton biomass at e2 pca biplot also discerned low saline water preferably during low tide enhanced the phytoplankton assemblage especially nanophytoplankton a similar higher phytoplankton assemblages in association with low tide attributed to advection of phytoplankton rich water masses from the upper estuary has been reported in many estuarine systems trigueros and orive 2000 wetz et al 2006 domingues et al 2010 pca biplot showed that in the lower estuarine zone of mahanadi low saline water preferably during low tide elevated do levels as a result of more freshwater influx mitra and zaman 2016 pca biplot also depicted that high production followed by bacterial degradation resulting an increase in bod levels as evident from the distant grouping of bod with do and autotrophic parameters in addition the influx of organic matter sourced from the dumping of fishery waste from the nearby fishing jetty and the fish market could also have played a major role in the increment of bod levels close association of po 4 3 and sio 4 4 with autotrophic variables suggested non limitation of these nutrients for phytoplankton growth a close association of ppb with po 4 3 and nh 4 was evident from the biplot of e2 fig 8 in general the picophytoplankton populations are predominantly represented by cyanobacterial forms that preferentially grow well with higher po 4 3 levels jyothibabu et al 2013 the influence of a low n p molar ratio resulting in higher abundances of cyanobacteria has been reported earlier in the mahanadi estuary dey et al 2013 in addition a close association of ppb with wt signified the role of higher wt for the growth of this smallest phytoplankton size class quinlan and phlips 2007 pca biplot of e2 also explained the possible source of nh 4 and po 4 3 from cdom the photo degradation of cdom releases nh 4 and po 4 3 in estuarine ecosystems francko and heath 1982 bushaw et al 1996 madhu et al 2010a 5 conclusion tidally influenced water movements in an estuary serve as a vehicle for fluxes of particulate and dissolved organic as well as inorganic matter into the adjoining coastal system the present study provides a snapshot of physical chemical and biological parameter dynamics in response to semi diurnal tides in mahanadi estuary all the environmental parameters varied in response to the tidal oscillations and a schematic representation of the variability is illustrated as fig 9 however significant variability was noticed for salinity po 4 3 and ppb between upper and lower estuary irrespective of tides between high and low tide salinity and nh 4 varied significantly irrespective of sites a higher number of environmental parameters varied prominently between high and low tide at the lower estuary in comparison to the upper estuary multivariate statistical ordination also substantiated the pivotal role of tidal forcing on the estuarine water quality the higher mixing at lower estuary resulted in a lower range of variation in water temperature following the tidal pattern with low during high tide and high during low tide salinity distribution signified the upper estuary as a freshwater regime in contrast the steep gradient between rising and fall of salinity corresponding to high and low tide respectively showed prominent tidal influence in the lower estuary riverine source of tsm and cdom into the estuary was denoted from higher concentration during low tide the photo degradation of cdom could have released nh 4 and po 4 3 in the upper estuary do levels responded quickly to tidal amplitude the higher degree of oxygen rich riverine freshwater elevated do concentration at the upper estuary while mixing played a pivotal role in the lower estuary during high tide at higher tidal amplitude bod levels below 4 mg l 1 at both lower and upper estuary signified the water quality in the category between fairly clean and moderately polluted autotrophic production followed by bacterial degradation and possible decomposition of anthropogenic organic matter controlled bod dynamics in the lower estuary spatial variability of no 3 in response to tides discerned possible source from the influx of industrial discharges and human excrement along with the riverine flow nh 4 distribution in response to tides at upper and lower estuary suggested influx production of nh 4 at the lower middle part of the estuary resulting in elevated levels at lower and upper estuary during low and high tide respectively higher concentration of po 4 3 at lower estuary during low tide could be attributed to the importation of po 4 3 rich industrial effluents fluxed from the middle part of the estuary towards the mouth higher concentration of sio 4 4 at upper estuary irrespective of tides signified prominent riverine source inorganic macronutrient stoichiometry suggested potential nitrogen limiting conditions in the estuary the advection of phytoplankton rich water masses from the upper estuary possibly resulted in higher abundances during low tide at the lower estuary pico and nanophytoplankton were emerged as the dominant contributor to total phytoplankton biomass at the upper and lower estuary respectively irrespective of tides lower n p molar ratio possibly stimulated picophytoplankton prevalence in the lower estuary the tidal amplitude had considerable effects on the zooplankton with rising in density during high tide attributed to the inflow of seawater containing marine zooplankton the present study is the first attempt to investigate the water quality parameters over a tidal cycle at upper and lower mahanadi estuary further studies including numerical modeling are very much essential to understand the seasonality of water quality parameters in response to the tidal regime water quality budget and to decipher the influence of mahanadi estuary on coastal waters of the bay of bengal declaration of competing interest
