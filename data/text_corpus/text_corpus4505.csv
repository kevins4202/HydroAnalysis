22525,to describe stochastic properties of waves near atolls we arranged in situ measurements near an atoll in the south china sea analysis of the measured data shows that there exist four basic forms of wave spectra in the area they are unimodal characterized by single peak with occurrence probability around 50 bimodal characterized by two peaks with occurrence probability around 10 platykurtic characterized by a wide flat peak with occurrence probability around 20 and uniform describing white noise like small waves atoll waves are characterized by the presence of breaking waves producing high frequency waves swells concentrated at low frequency and storm waves creating complicated spectral form this makes widely used wave spectra like pierson moskowitz and jonswap spectra cannot capture well the energy distribution properties around peak frequency high and low frequency ends to be able to better describe the complex forms we introduce rational function wave spectrum rfws form in this paper based on 236 groups of data 20 among which are presented here we demonstrate the applicability of rfws to describe atoll waves keywords wave spectrum rational function wave spectrum high low frequency platykurtic bimodal 1 introduction protection of precious atolls requires a better understanding of wave properties inside outside the atoll although shallow water theory is applicable to atoll waves breaking waves and swells around the atoll are really much more frequent than in an ordinary coast breaking waves produce high frequency wave components and swells are usually composed of very low frequency waves one of the most powerful tool for describing stochastic properties of water wave is wave spectrum newman 1977 we argue that an atoll wave spectrum should be different from that employed for deep water waves one more factor to be considered is that atolls are heavily populated in the pacific ocean where they are more frequently exposed to storms fully developed wave power spectra like jonswap may not cover all the cases to be encountered therefore there is a need to study the wave spectrum forms around atolls worldwide efforts over several decades led to well studied wave spectrum forms for deep water among which are single peaked spectrum neumann and pierson moskowitz spectrum p m in short pierson and moskowitz 1964 in early 1960s ittc ittc 1966 and jonswap spectra hasselmann 1973 slightly later they are applicable to fully developed water wave fields composed of waves of various wave lengths the dispersion relation predicts that waves with longer wave length propagate faster than those with short length in deep water thus long and short waves are well separated in deep waters once away from where they are produced therefore the above mentioned spectra are characterized by being single peaked and narrow banded and much research has been performed on the statistical distribution of nonlinear random waves with regard to the shapes of wave components alkhalidi and tayfun 2013 izadparast and niedzwecki 2013 akpınar at al 2016 modifications based on these wave spectrum forms have been proposed by some authors so that these wave spectra may be applied to more cases chang wen and zhang 1990 generalized the jonswap spectrum applicable to the wind wave growth phase liu discussed the relationship between parameters in the spectrum and characteristic wave heights liu et al 2016 the latter is well exemplified by ochi hubble model and torsethaugen model ochi and hubble 1976 guedes soares 1984 torsethaugen 1993 moon and oh 1998 violante carvalho et al 2004 torsethaugen and haver 2004 mackay 2011 panahi et al 2015 mackay introduced additional parameters besides the wave height and period to tune the separate contributions of swell and wind sea components in the spectrum mackay 2016 to include shallow water effects liu et al 2004 zhai et al 2013 xie et al 2013 liao et al 2014 which increases nonlinearity and weakens dispersion a tma spectral form kitaigordskii et al 1975 bouws et al 1985 is often employed the method is characterized by multiplying a deep water wave spectrum jonswap spectrum to say by a finite depth function the form is obtained by multiplying the deep water jonswap spectrum with a depth dependent function as waves travel from deep to shallow waters dispersion effects become weaker and nonlinearity increases therefore long and short waves tend to travel at nearly equal phase speeds often their amplitudes are increased to such extent that breaking may appear this is more prominent as waves evolve near a coral atoll it is important to describe stochastic behaviour of water waves inside or outside an atoll because waves are decisive factor to influence atoll protection a literature search shows that there are large numbers of on site wave observations near islands reefs and atolls but there remains a lack of well established wave spectrum form to describe waves inside or outside atolls in this paper we report our one and half year in situ measurements around an island in an atoll in the south china sea during the period both storms and hurricanes were observed the data show that jonswap and p m spectra did not fit the data very well this led us to realize that spectral form of waves around atolls might be somewhat different from those in the open sea or along coast so we try to find the wave spectrum capable to describe the properties of atoll waves in this paper 2 in situ measurements the in situ measurements were initiated from 2014 through arranging wave buoys around an atoll in the south china sea the measurement locations were located at the southeast of the atoll 2 km away from the coast and local water is 100 m deep as shown in fig 1 wave rider ii buoy also called mkii is used for the measurements the measurement data stored in wave rider ii consist of three different types displacement data spectral data and wave data the significant wave height hs measured by wave rider buoy is the average in every 3 min no filtering is applied to the data to remove outliers the data used herein had been recorded from june 26th 2014 to january 14th 2015 a wave train is a stochastic process which is usually regarded as stationary narrow banded one within half to three hours if we took 3 h records as a stationary process we totally obtained 236 effective observational data in august 2014 here we take this month as an example simple analysis shows that these data can be described by four categories of wave spectra they are unimodal bimodal platykurtic and uniform spectra respectively 1 unimodal spectrum it has similar shape of the often used ocean wave spectrum for deep water waves as shown in fig 2 a it occurs most frequently occupying 50 within one month as demonstrated in table 1 a slight difference observable here is that more energy is distributed at high frequency end this is probably due to wave breaking 2 bimodal spectrum two peaks can be observed as shown in fig 2 b its occurrence probability is about 10 given in table 1 in this case more wave energy is distributed around the two peaks it is believed that two peaked spectrum arises from swells 3 platykurtic spectrum it is characterized by a flat peak within a certain frequency range unimodal spectrum features one sharp peak while platykurtic spectrum has a much wider peak as shown in fig 2 c what is surprising is that such spectrum has a higher occurrence probability up to 20 as given in table 1 platykurtic spectrum features storm waves their high occurrence probability corresponds to frequent occurrences of storms in august in the south china sea 4 uniform spectrum the energy is uniformly distributed throughout the frequency range as shown in fig 2 d there does not exist typical frequency around which energy is localized their occurrence probability is 22 even so a careful examination of fig 2 d shows that the vertical axis of the wave power spectrum that is energy density is very low compared with the rest three comparing the power spectra in fig 2 we observe that the vertical coordinate values of uniform spectrum are of the order of 0 007 against 1 implying that uniform spectrum represents white noise like small waves although their occurrence probability is high 22 they will not be considered here for their negligible energy we will restrict ourselves to the rest three spectra in the following to explore the generation mechanisms of the above spectra we take typhoon kalmaegi for instance typhoon kalmaegi was the 22nd depression and the 15th named storm of the 2014 typhoon season it formed on september 11 2014 on the west pacific ocean and dissipated on september 18 2014 its path is shown in fig 3 and the date and time corresponding to position numbers in fig 3 are given in table 2 fig 4 shows the spectral evolution at the measurement location corresponding to the date and time indicated in fig 3 and table 2 as the typhoon was located around positions numbered 1 3 shown in fig 3 swells were stronger than wind waves such that the wave spectra exhibit double peaks as shown in fig 4 no 5 was the nearest location during the passage of the typhoon and the wave spectrum is dominated by single peak from wind waves as the typhoon travelled away swell became stronger again and around some locations no 10 11 flat topped platykurtic spectra appeared from the fine balance between swells and wind waves as the typhoon went away further no 12 swells dominated the spectrum again the above brief description explains how double peaked and flat topped spectra are produced 3 rational function wave spectrum rfws deepwater waves exhibit strong dispersion and therefore waves of nearly same wavelengths dominate a wave packet in most cases the wave spectrum of such wave packet is characterized by fast decaying tails on both ends take p m spectrum of deep water waves for instance which reads 1 s ω a ω n exp a ω d where s ω represents power spectral density and ω is frequency at low frequency end as ω 0 s ω exp 1 ω 4 shows exponential decay as ω is large s ω 1 ω 5 shows fast attenuation therefore the deep water wave energy is concentrated within a certain frequency range as waves travel to an atoll water depth changes weaken dispersion effects in very shallow water phase speeds of waves tend to be g h where g is the gravity acceleration and h is the water depth that is the waves are hardly dispersive from this analysis wave spectrum near an atoll should be a wide banded one and energy should be distributed within a larger frequency range as water depth becomes shallower waves near atolls show stronger and stronger nonlinear effects remarkable characteristics of nonlinear waves are the existences of frequency doubling and beat frequency that is some waves of frequency ω produce waves of 2 ω ω 2 waves neumann 1952 as a result the correlations of different frequencies of a nonlinear wave spectrum becomes strong for the energy density at frequency ω is related to those at frequencies 2 ω ω 2 this is the well studied self similarity phenomenon in nonlinearity science this simple analysis leads us to the conclusion that there exists the following self similarity relation of the form 2 s ω s λ ω 1 λ n where λ is proportional constant n is a real number this equation shows that if frequency is enlarged or reduced λ times the power density is proportionally enlarged or reduced λ times the above simple arguments necessitate proposal of new forms of wave spectrum for waves around an atoll eq 2 shows the wave spectrum near atoll shouldn t be of the form of eq 1 for their fast decays at two ends of high and low frequencies it has two characteristics to be taken into account 1 at the high frequency end the wave spectrum decay like ω n ω is frequency n is real number around two 2 at the low frequency the wave spectrum have the way to zero like ω m m is another real number around two so we discuss the common solitary waves in shallow water to find the wave spectrum form the solitary wave zong et al 2011 form like this 3 η x t h sech 2 3 h 4 h 3 x c t h sech 2 β x c t using fourier transform it is easy to show that 4 s ω ω as ω 0 s ω 1 ω 2 as ω through this analysis above we propose the rational function wave spectrum rfws near the atoll form like this 5 s ω a ω α ω β c where s ω represents power spectral density ω is frequency the other parameters are to be determined by measurements as ω 0 the denominator in eq 5 tends to constant c so s ω ω α as ω is large the denominator in eq 5 can be ignored and spectrum form behaves in the way of s ω ω α β in both cases the rational function spectrum 5 possesses self similarity in order to determine the unknown parameters a α β c we used 236 sets of data collected from august 1st 2014 to august 31st 2014 using eq 5 to numerically fit these data we obtained estimations of these unknown parameters given in table 3 in the table estimated values of the parameters in neumann and pierson moskowitz spectra are also given for comparison as shown in fig 5 in the figure three estimated spectra rfws neumann and pierson moskowitz are compared with in situ measurements on september 17th 2014 from 9 00 12 00 in fig 5 neumann spectrum denoted with dot dashed line is better than pierson moskowitz spectrum in terms of data fitting it decays slower than pierson moskowitz spectrum at low frequency end close to the measured data among the three spectra rfws fits the measured data best with a reliability index r2 0 955 it well captures the properties at high and low frequency tails besides the peak much larger high frequency tail represents small waves are present in the wave system they may arise from the constant occurrence of breaking waves which are able to produce high frequency waves while at low frequency end higher low frequency energy implies long waves propagate into the atoll note that r2 of rfws in these comparisons is greater than 0 90 this example shows that rfws well captures the properties around peak high and low frequencies for unimodal distributions more examples will be given section 5 of the paper 4 rational function wave spectrum for bimodel and platykurtic distributions in our measured data about 51 of the waves are not unimodal as shown in table 1 bimodal and platykurtic spectra are also characteristic of waves near atolls caused by the superposition of swells and typhoons rational function form 5 is only applicable to unimodal spectrum in order to express the bimodal and platykurtic spectra we instead write formula 5 in the following form 6 s ω a ω α ω γ b ω β e ω γ β c ω β d c e b d c 2 there are 7 unknown parameters in eq 6 they are a b c d α β and γ set b 0 c 0 e 0 γ 0 and eq 6 is reduced to eq 5 using the measured data we may estimate the unknown parameters in rfws pierson moskowitz and neumann spectra respectively with their values given in table 4 the best estimates of the spectra for bimodal are given in fig 6 and for platykurtic in fig 7 it is clear that both pierson moskowitz and neumann spectra cannot capture the complicated behaviors around the peaks from the figures the rfws proposed here is capable of describing the complicated shapes for bimodal and platykurtic spectra it well describe the behavior around the peak high and low frequency tails this is very attractive for detailed descriptions of the wave properties around atolls 5 more examples on rational function wave spectrum in this section we present more analysis using rfws to fit the data obtained from august 1st to 31st 2014 to demonstrate the applicability of the spectral form there were three typhoons halong nakri genevieve occurred in the pacific ocean in the august in fig 8 the change of significant wave height is given in one month in total we collected 11246 sets of observational data suppose that wave height in every 3 h is a stationary stochastic process and we obtain 236 groups of data for wave spectrum descriptions among them 20 groups as examples are given here as shown in fig 9 with estimated parameter values given in table 5 6 conclusions waves near atolls are affected by terrains exhibiting nonlinearity and week dispersion so wave spectra near atolls are characterized by 1 self similarity arising from nonlinearity 2 long tails arising from breaking waves and swells 3 bimodal arising from swells and wind waves and 4 flat and wide peaks arising from balance between swells and wind waves therefore the well known wave spectra may not accurately describe waves around atolls in this paper we proposed a new form of wave spectrum rational function wave spectrum to describe waves around the atoll rfws has self similarity and long tail able to accurately capturing the properties of wave spectra around peak frequency high and low frequency ends examples are given based on 236 groups of measured data in the south china sea only 20 among which are presented here to show the applicability of the new form wave spectra acknowledgement the current research is financially

no 10 11 flat topped platykurtic spectra appeared from the fine balance between swells and wind waves as the typhoon went away further no 12 swells dominated the spectrum again the above brief description explains how double peaked and flat topped spectra are produced 3 rational function wave spectrum rfws deepwater waves exhibit strong dispersion and therefore waves of nearly same wavelengths dominate a wave packet in most cases the wave spectrum of such wave packet is characterized by fast decaying tails on both ends take p m spectrum of deep water waves for instance which reads 1 s ω a ω n exp a ω d where s ω represents power spectral density and ω is frequency at low frequency end as ω 0 s ω exp 1 ω 4 shows exponential decay as ω is large s ω 1 ω 5 shows fast attenuation therefore the deep water wave energy is concentrated within a certain frequency range as waves travel to an atoll water depth changes weaken dispersion effects in very shallow water phase speeds of waves tend to be g h where g is the gravity acceleration and h is the water depth that is the waves are hardly dispersive from this analysis wave spectrum near an atoll should be a wide

nonlinearity science this simple analysis leads us to the conclusion that there exists the following self similarity relation of the form 2 s ω s λ ω 1 λ n where λ is proportional constant n is a real number this equation shows that if frequency is enlarged or reduced λ times the power density is proportionally enlarged or reduced λ times the above simple arguments necessitate proposal of new forms of wave spectrum for waves around an atoll eq 2 shows the wave spectrum near atoll shouldn t be of the form of eq 1 for their fast decays at two ends of high and low frequencies it has two characteristics to be taken into account 1 at the high frequency end the wave spectrum decay like ω n ω is frequency n is real number around two 2 at the low frequency the wave spectrum have the way to zero like ω m m is another real number around two so we discuss the common solitary waves in shallow water to find the wave spectrum form the solitary wave zong et al 2011 form like this 3 η x t h

22526,extensive laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the statistical characteristics of wave heights on steep submerged platform reefs compared with the situation on a gently sloping beach the extraordinary wave breaking induced by abrupt depth reduction over a steep fore reef slope makes the wave height distribution on the reef flat to differ substantially existing models of wave height distributions on shallow beaches such as by battjes and groenendijk 2000 thus come out to be less reliable to resolve this a new composite weibull distribution model has been proposed and formulated based on 540 measured wave records at various locations across the reef flat the model is generally composed out of three weibull parts and collapses to a two weibull distribution in a situation of low relative wave energy the newly proposed model shows good predictive capacity on most common characteristic wave heights in comparison with the present and several existing laboratory datasets keywords wave height distribution weibull platform reefs reef flat wave breaking 1 introduction wave height distributions in shallow coastal water are essential for determining design wave heights and subsequently design wave forcing on coastal structures likewise the distribution of wave heights on offshore submerged platform reefs is also needed for example to resolve design impact loads induced by wave breaking on structures located on the reef flat tops deep water wave heights are theoretically shown to obey the rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 in shallow water shoaling nonlinear interactions and most importantly depth induced wave breaking make the wave height distribution to differ significantly from the theoretical rayleigh form in this context it is common to address wave breaking to occur on a gentle beach say slope less than 1 20 with gradual depth variation however in the case on a submerged reef considered herein waves also break as the water depth suddenly reduces to a breaking limit on the reef flat the abrupt depth transition over a steep reef the fore reef slope is typically between 1 15 and 1 5 results in unordinary breaking conditions wave transformation and consequently the distribution of wave heights on the reef flat therefore might noticeably deviate from those ordinary on a shallow beach for clarity characteristics of wave breaking and wave hydrodynamics on steep reefs are briefly reviewed in the following nelson 1994 noted that the maximum individual wave height to water depth ratio at locations behind the reef edge surfzone on a horizontal reef flat should not exceed 0 55 far below the commonly accepted value of 0 80 in a laboratory investigation on regular wave transformation on a fringing reef gourlay 1994 noticed that wave breaking conditions on the reef edge are substantially different from those on a plane beach the wave transmission regime is classified according to a non linearity parameter representing wave conditions at the reef edge the maximum wave height to depth ratio on the reef flat is found to depend on this non linearity parameter and turns out to be consistent with the finding by nelson 1994 for a horizontal bed yao et al 2013 experimentally examined characteristics of breaking of monochromatic waves on fringing reefs with various fore reef slopes the results reveal that most of the wave breaking features over the reef such as breaker types and breaker indices are mainly characterized by the relative reef flat submergence i e the ratio of the water depth over the reef flat d to the offshore incident wave height h m0 0 d h m0 0 but not by the surf similarity like on plane beaches battjes 1974 besides wave breaking a vast number of field and laboratory studies exist in the literature on the reef wave dynamics see e g nakaza and hino 1991 lowe et al 2005 demirbilek et al 2007 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 buckley et al 2015 becker et al 2016 buckley et al 2018 collectively these describe the two important hydrodynamic features on reefs that are low frequency motions or infra gravity waves frequencies f 0 04 hz in field scales henceforth designated as ig waves and the super elevated water level wave setup in steep reef environments their magnitudes can potentially be enhanced compared to those on open gentle beaches wave setup and low frequency motions can be major components of wave run up at a reef fringed shoreline wave setup on steep reefs can be very significant due to large gradients of the cross shore radiation stress as the result of abrupt depth reduction induced wave breaking around the reef edge buckley et al 2015 and thus is primarily influenced by the water depth over the reef wave setup generally increases with a decrease in the relative reef flat submergence see e g gourlay 1996a 1996b higher bottom roughness also tends to increase setup through its effects on the bottom stress in the across shore momentum balance the influence of higher roughness on setup however can partially be cancelled out by the effect of reduced wave heights due to increased frictional wave dissipation buckley et al 2016 wave setup is also affected by the reef profile features setup on a platform reef considered in this study where water is able to escape leeward is considerably less than that on a fringing reef see e g gourlay 1996a 1996b nevertheless the effect of wave setup on wave heights can straightforwardly be incorporated through including setup in the mean water level allowing for larger wave heights to exist on the reef flat in this study the effect of wave setup on the wave height distribution is implicit in the measured wave heights across the reef ig waves on a steep reef are predominantly generated by breaking processes of short period waves around the reef edge i e oscillation of the breakpoint mechanism see e g pomeroy et al 2012 becker et al 2016 buckley et al 2018 as short period waves dissipate due to breaking the relative importance of ig waves start to increase toward the shore and can even dominate near the shoreline or inside the lagoon behind reefs also resonant amplification of standing ig waves can potentially occur leading to a notable increase in wave run up nakaza and hino 1991 péquignet et al 2009 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 pomeroy et al 2012 buckley et al 2018 yao et al 2019 eventual effects of ig waves on the wave height statistics are not straightforward and further discussed in section 5 despite the noticeable difference in wave hydrodynamics published research has not been available yet for the wave height distribution on submerged reefs in terms of explicitness and ease of application models for the wave height distribution with the effect of wave breaking can be split into two groups first is those largely rely on theoretical approximations tayfun 1981 or purely algorithmic manipulations see e g mase and iwagaki 1982 dally and dean 1986 and therefore are either impractical or implicit for use in engineering applications in the second and most popular group empirical distributions such as weibull are adopted whereby model parameters can straightforwardly be formulated with experimental data see e g glukhovskiy 1966 klopman 1996 battjes and groenendijk 2000 rattanapitikon 2010 wu et al 2016 in the present study we also advocate the second approach and a review on most relevant studies with consideration of wave breaking effects is given in the following glukhovskiy 1966 see bouws 1979 extended the rayleigh distribution for wave heights in finite water depth through explicit inclusion of the wave height to water depth ratio h s d as the model breaker parameter klopman 1996 further modified the glukhovskiy distribution to a more consistent weibull distribution with two distinct parameters however at hinted at by the fact that the distribution by klopman 1996 still overestimates extreme wave heights while underestimates lower ones battjes and groenendijk 2000 arrived at a composite rayleigh weibull distribution henceforth referred to as the bg2000 the two parts of the bg2000 distribution are joined at a transitional wave height the upper distribution i e above the transitional wave height is particularly for high waves affected by depth limited conditions laboratory data of wave heights on various beach slopes ranging from 1 20 to 1 250 were used to formulate the model parameters as functions of local spectral wave energy m 0 water depth and bottom slope also the breaker parameter known as the relative wave intensity or wave saturation degree represented by m 0 d is used instead of h s d in the model the approach of composite distributions by battjes and groenendijk 2000 is considered most suitable for wave heights in shallow water and thus has been pursued in numerous laboratory and field studies on the model verification and validation herein without loss of generality more attention is therefore paid to the bg2000 model mai et al 2010 showed a consistent underestimation of high waves by the bg2000 model compared with field data along the german coast recommending amendments of both the transitional wave height and the exponent of the upper distribution in a situation of low relative wave intensity caires and van gent 2012 also reported that estimates of h 0 1 by the bg2000 model are as much as 15 lower than laboratory broken waves and field data lake waves of wave heights on flat bottoms on the contrary christou et al 2011 spotted that both the bg2000 and glukhovskiy 1966 models largely over predict their measurements collected at duck field experiment site north carolina usa comparisons of the bg2000 model with laboratory measurements also report the same discrepancies vasiliki and swan 2011 found the model largely over estimates their largest wave heights on mild beach slopes at shallowest locations while vledder 2013 showed the opposite when comparing with data of wave heights on a barred beach by boers 1996 rattanapitikon 2010 attempted to verify seventeen conversion formulas for several representative wave heights derived from existing and modified distributions against large existing laboratory and field datasets covering a wide range of wave conditions from deep to shallow water since the study mainly focused on the overall predictive performances of the formulations but not on detailed agreements of the considered distributions themselves no insight into the existing models with regards to the effect of wave breaking was given the contradicting results amongst the aforementioned model comparisons might be attributed to factors that are inadequately addressed by the existing models such as bottom topographic conditions the local spectral shape influenced by the foreshore shallowness see hofland et al 2017 or even the number of waves considered it generally follows that the existing distributions including that by battjes and groenendijk 2000 work reasonably well in intermediate water while in shallower depths discrepancy arises for highest waves i e at the tail also it is noticed that the trend of measured data and the shape of the distribution at the tail of the weibull part are largely dissimilar overall agreement of the bg2000 model therefore cannot be achieved simply through tuning the model parameters wu et al 2016 argued that wave heights in shallow water are limited by the breaking criteria so that the weibull tail without an upper limit seems inappropriate the authors therefore proposed a new composite weibull generalised pareto distribution in which the transitional wave height between the two parts is set at the significant wave height h s and the breaking criteria by miche 1944 is used as the upper limit though the limit is rather theoretical the model was claimed to perform well for the wave height distribution as a whole under various wave conditions from deep to shallow water however as the study did not particularly aim at depth induced breaking waves and only a few datasets of breaking waves were available the model performance for the tail in cases with wave breaking was not evidenced in this regard the distribution by glukhovskiy 1966 was found the best it is emphasized that all of the considered existing distributions were not fitted with individual wave heights from measured records but with datasets of representative wave heights only i e at h 1 3 h m h 1 h 0 1 etc in the present study context it appears that both in terms of adaptability and of simplicity the model approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 is most attractive the study goal is therefore to extend the model approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 to better describe the wave height distribution on submerged reefs to this end laboratory experiments of wave transformation across submerged reefs are conducted whereby the proposed model can be parameterized with all individual wave heights 2 laboratory experiments the scale model experiments were conducted in the 45 m long and 1 0 m wide wave flume of thuy loi university hanoi vietnam formerly water resources university the piston type wave generator is equipped with an active reflection compensation system aukepc arc deltares and capable of making irregular wave height up to 0 30 m and 3 0s in peak period submerged platform or island reefs off the coast of vietnam are a few hundred meters to several kilometres wide at the flat top level note that the morphology of a platform reef considered herein is distinguished from that of a fringing reef in that the reef flat is always submerged and surrounded by the sea without a shoreline see gourlay 1996a 1996b the water depth is often more than 100 m at the reef foot section and in the range of 5 20 m on the reef flat this reef flat submerged depth is substantially larger than that of typical australian fringing reefs reported in previous studies e g lowe et al 2005 pomeroy et al 2012 huang et al 2012 etc the transitional section from the deep water part to the shallow reef flat typically consists of a steep deep foot slope 1 1 1 2 and a milder flank slope 1 5 1 15 because of space constraints it was not possible to scale down the full reef cross section in the wave flume only part of submerged reefs which are most relevant to the problem of wave transformation considered was modelled with further consideration of the test wave conditions the model length scale of 1 40 was eventually selected the reef surface in prototype is often very rough with a variety of reef organisms as a result wave height attenuation due to bottom friction can be significant in case of small water depths on the reef flat lowe et al 2005 pomeroy et al 2012 huang et al 2012 because of relatively large reef flat water depths and high incoming waves under storm conditions considered in this study see also table 1 effects of bottom friction on across reef wave transformation would be overwhelmingly dominated by depth induced breaking together with other nonlinear wave processes on the other hand albeit effects of bottom friction on wave heights can be considerable its effects on wave nonlinearities which eventually influence the wave height distribution have never been reported in the literature and are difficult to reproduce in small scale experiments with the aim to investigate the wave height distribution on which effects of depth induced wave breaking are most important the effect of the reef roughness is therefore disregarded in the present experiments fig 1 illustrates the experimental layout in which the model reef is 50 cm high above the flume bottom to assure the generation of incoming deep water waves the reef surface was made of smooth and impermeable wooden materials for the effect of the transitional slope on wave breaking and thus on the wave height distribution two typical fore reef slopes of 1 5 and 1 10 are considered respectively the flat top width b is 5 0 m 200 m in prototype sufficiently wide to accommodate both the reef edge surfzone and the inner reef flat region behind the surfzone for observation of the entire progress of wave transformation over the reef under field conditions water is able to escape behind a platform reef without the shoreline and thus wave setup and wave reflection are minimal gourlay 1996a 1996b in flume experiments however the landward boundary always exists and therefore these boundary conditions are never fully satisfied in this study these laboratory effects were minimized with the introduction of a relative wide basin 12 m behind the reef and a very gentle riprap slope slope of 1 6 as a passive wave absorber at the end of the flume capacitance wave gauges are distributed in three regions across the reef i e deep water reef edge surfzone and behind the surfzone in which positions of those on the reef flat can be variable depending on test scenarios so that various across reef wave conditions can be captured see fig 1 for a standard arrangement of gauges the sampling rate was set at 50 hz for all wave gauges the experimental program as outlined in matrices of table 1 consists of 120 test cases which are combinations of six submerged depths two fore reef slopes and ten test waves characterizing various sea states during storms the test waves were jonswap spectra with the peak enhancement factor γ 1 25 as found most suitable for storm waves at the deep sea region off the coast of vietnam note that the wave parameters as shown in table 1 are nominal steering at the wave board boundary only in which the peak wave periods are derived according to two typical storm wave steepness s 0p of 0 03 and 0 04 respectively amongst these test combinations test cases with notable super elevated water levels behind the reef or with largest wave heights in excess of the flume height were excluded in total only 108 out of 120 experiments were carried out each of which lasted approximately 1000 waves to sufficiently cover the main frequency domain of desired wave spectra and allow for stable statistical properties of wave heights these extensive experiments are considered sufficient to cover wide ranges of variations and combinations of the major independent variables involved i e reef flat water depth fore reef slope wave height and wave period wave reflection was analyzed with measured records from a three gauge array at the deep offshore section according to the approach by zelt and skjelbreia 1992 to avoid problem of singularities in the determination of wave reflection the spacing of wave gauges was carefully selected and optimized for all test conditions see wl 2004 the measured data include individual wave heights statistical and spectral wave parameters e g h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 h 0 1 h rms h m0 t p t m 1 0 at all stations typical spectral and statistical wave parameters are defined according to 1 m n f l f

respectively s f is the variance spectral density m n is the n th order spectral moment t m 1 0 is the characteristic spectral period h rms is the root mean square wave height h 1 3 is the statistical significant wave height h m0 is the spectral significant wave height n is the number of waves in a record h i represents the individual wave heights sorted in descending order 3 distribution of wave heights on the reef flat 3 1 influencing parameters and wave height distribution characteristics in this section we inspect the measured data of individual wave heights from several systematic test series to gain qualitative understanding of the wave height distribution and influences of reef geometrical and hydraulic parameters first it concerns the effect of the reef flat shallowness expressed via the ratio of the incoming deep water wave to the local water depth over the flat d on the wave height distribution see e g hofland et al 2017 for the definition of beach shallowness a test series of three different water depths d 0 15 m 0 30 m and 0 40 m under the same typical moderate incoming deep water wave h m0 0 15 m t p 1 55s and fore reef slope tanα 1 10 are considered so a smaller depth means a shallower reef flat fig 2 plots the probability exceedance graph of the measured individual wave heights around the reef edge at wg2 in comparison with the rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 the distribution by battjes and groenendijk 2000 and the modified glukhovskiy klopman 1996 in this figure the probability of exceedance of a specific wave height is the probability that the wave height shall be reached or exceeded see also subsection 3 2 it is shown that the predictive performances of these models are very sensitive to the shallowness of the reef flat the bg2000 model generally agrees well with the measurements of small waves in the lower part of the distribution while seriously overestimates those of high waves in the upper part the tail of the distribution the discrepancy with the data markedly extends toward the lower part of the distribution as the shallowness increases corresponding to the decrease in water depth d from 0 40 m in fig 2c to 0 15m in fig 2a particularly the bg2000 distribution is much steeper than the data trend at the tail which explains the model overestimation of extreme representative wave heights as noted in section 1 in contrast to the bg2000 model the klopman distribution largely underestimates the measurements except for very small wave heights however in the case of very shallow reef flat the distribution approaches closer to the data points at the tail i e better agreement is found for largest waves fig 2a the tail of the klopman distribution and the data trend are generally similar in shape as expected the original rayleigh distribution by longuet higgins 1952 is inappropriate for distribution of wave heights in finite depth second regarding the influence of the wave height to water depth ratio known as the relative wave energy fig 3 shows the distributions of measured wave heights at various locations across the reef obtained from the same test case h m0 0 15 m t p 1 55s d 0 25 m and tanα 1 10 it can be seen that in the surfzone with high relative wave energy wg2 wg4 the distribution shape curvature particularly at the middle part is most complex and evolves considerably in the inner reef flat zone behind the surfzone with low relative wave energy wg5 wg6 the shape becomes rather simple and stable but seems not revert to a rayleigh one at all locations on the reef flat the tail of the distribution is generally straight and gentle third for the effect of the fore reef slope test cases also under the same incident wave h m0 0 15 m t p 1 55s and water depth d 0 30 m but with two different fore reef slopes tanα 1 5 and 1 10 are considered fig 4 shows the distributions at the reef edge wg2 inside the surfzone wg3 and behind the surfzone wg5 respectively the fore reef slope appears to have significant effects on the distribution within the reef edge surfzone only fig 4a and b under the same incoming deep water waves a steeper slope results in a greater fore reef depth and thus the incoming waves at the reef edge are higher fig 4a however this increase is not of the same proportionality for all wave heights especially the lowest waves are almost not affected moving further inside the surfzone the largest waves start to break due to depth limited conditions as a result the slope effect is seen to exhibit in the intermediate wave heights only see fig 4b because most high waves break within the surf zone wave heights behind the surfzone are mainly related to the local water depth blurring out the fore reef slope effect as seen in fig 4c overall it is apparent that to better describe the wave height distribution its three distinct parts as noted above i e lower intermediate and upper should be realized 3 2 formulations of a new composite weibull distribution the above analysis reveals some important characteristics of the distribution of wave heights on the reef flat which are hints for the development of a new model in terms of complexity one would distinguish between the distribution for locations inside the surfzone and that behind the surfzone in the surfzone the distribution is more complex than that can be described by a single or even a two weibull distribution i e a combination of two weibull distributions can be used at the expense of sacrificing the overall agreement it is therefore suggested that a composite distribution consisting of three distinct segments for small intermediate and largest wave heights should be used instead smallest waves below a certain limit are a little affected by the shallow water depth and thus still fit with a rayleigh distribution the tail with largest waves breaking and near breaking waves shows a simple trend of gently sloping line i e small curvature implying that a weibull with a large exponent for the upper part would be appropriate whereas because of depth induced breaking and nonlinear effects the mid part with intermediate wave heights shoaling waves and broken waves evolves considerably which contradicts with that in the case of shallow beaches see battjes and groenendijk 2000 this evolving part eventually affects the overall model predictive performances via its connections to lower and upper ones behind the surfzone the distribution collapses to a simpler one which can well be described with a rayleigh weibull distribution the concept of three weibull distribution henceforth referred to as 3wd is illustrated in fig 5 following the same approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 the general expressions of the distribution in case all three weibull segments exist are as follows 3 pr h h f 0 h 1 exp h h 2 h h t r 0 0 35 d f 1 h 1 exp h h 1 k 1 h t r 0 h h t r f 2 h 1 exp h h 2 k 2 h h t r h t r h max in which h h 1 and h 2 are scale wave heights of the corresponding weibull functions exponents k1 and k2 are shape factors d is the water depth on the reef flat pr h h is the probability of non exceedance of wave height or pr h h is the probability of exceedance note that the 3wd in general has two distinct transitional wave heights h tr 0 and h tr as argued above the first lower transitional height h tr 0 is treated like a threshold below which waves are negligibly affected by shallow water and thus a rayleigh distribution is valid in this sense h tr 0 must be a small fraction of the water depth d only through fitting a rayleigh distribution for the lower part we found that h tr 0 0 35d gives the best overall agreement with the experimental data as noticed earlier the second upper transitional height h tr would vary with not only on the bottom topography but also with wave breaking intensity or the reef flat shallowness in case the 3wd shrinks to a two weibull distribution the third expression in eq 3 is omitted and only the first transitional wave height h tr 0 remains similar to the bg2000 model the criterion for this is discussed in section 3 3 4 the 3wd model as a whole must satisfy the continuity conditions at the two transitional wave heights and the expression for the root mean square rms wave height h rms respectively 4 f 0 h t r 0 f 1 h t r 0 5 f 1 h t r f 2 h t r 6 h m r s 0 h t r 0 h 2 f 0 h d h h t r 0 h t r h 2 f 1 h d h h t r h 2 f 2 h d h after some algebraic manipulations eqs 4 6 can respectively be rewritten in dimensionless forms as follows see e g groenendijk and van gent 1998 7 h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 2 h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 1 k 1 8 h ˆ t r h ˆ 1 k 1 h ˆ t r h ˆ 2 k 2 9 1 h ˆ 2 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 2 2 h ˆ 1 2 γ h ˆ t r h ˆ 1 k 1 2 k 1 1 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 1 k 1 2 k 1 1 h ˆ 2 2 γ h ˆ t r h ˆ 2 k 2 2 k 2 1 where h ˆ x is a normalized height of h x with respective to h rms h ˆ x h x h r m s γ and γ are upper and lower incomplete gamma functions respectively when only first two weibull distributions exist eq 9 becomes 10 1 h ˆ 2 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 2 2 h ˆ 1 2 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 1 k 1 2 k 1 1 for the determination of the 3wd a system of three equations eqs 7 9 with three unknowns h h 1 and h 2 needs to be solved numerically the model parameters h tr k 1 and k 2 h tr 0 is already determined h tr 0 0 35d are known because as shown in the following section they are related to the input parameters such as bottom slope water depth and wave spectral parameters 3 3 parameterization of model parameters the existing point models incorporating wave breaking effects discussed so far assume a slow wave evolution so that the model parameters can well be related to the local conditions only e g the bottom slope water depth and wave spectral energy at a considered location regardless of the wave propagation history from deep water as shown in battjes and groenendijk 2000 this assumption is generally valid for cases of relatively simple bottom topography such as gently sloping beaches herein as discussed earlier fig 4a and b the influence of the fore reef slope which somewhat reflects the wave propagation history clearly exhibits in the wave height distributions in the surf zone this means that in addition to the local wave spectral energy and the local water depth the fore reef slope rather than the local bed slope of the reef flat should be used for the model parameterization at least for locations inside the reef edge surfzone nevertheless this slope dependency seems relatively weak as it in part implicitly reflects through the fore reef water depth in scaling wave heights on the reef flat behind the surfzone the fore reef slope influence becomes negligibly small and thus the local bed slope should be used instead in the following we shall relate the three model parameters i e h tr k 1 and k 2 to the external input parameters the values of these are first experimentally determined though least squares fitting the 3wd fig 5 with all individual wave heights from each of 540 measured records from five stations across the reef flat 3 3 1 upper transitional wave height h tr for the composite type of distributions proper transitions are very essential for the model reliability as shown earlier the bg2000 model consistently over estimates the transitional wave height which in combination with a steep weibull tail aggravates the model over prediction of highest wave heights this is in part due to the fact that the transitional wave height h tr in the bg2000 model was formulated with the datasets of a few representative wave heights only not all individual wave heights by definition the upper transitional wave height h tr of the 3wd lies between the mid part of broken and shoaling waves and the upper one of breaking and near breaking waves when h tr becomes too large i e exceeding the maximum wave height the third weibull part does not exist as hinted at above the wave height distribution depends on the shallowness of the reef flat in this study we propose a new parameter χ 11 χ cos α d l 0 m in which α is the fore reef slope for locations inside the surfzone and α 0 cosα 1 behind the surfzone l 0m g 2 π t m 1 0 2 is the deep water wave length based on the local characteristic wave period t m 1 0 the parameter χ is a measure of the local shallowness on the reef flat a larger value of χ means a relatively shallower condition and vice versa the use of cosα in eq 11 is due to the weak dependency of the fore reef slope noticed earlier note also that behind the surfzone where the relative wave intensity is sufficiently small see sections 3 3 3 and 3 3 4 the slope effect becomes negligible and thus cosα 1 can be used in eq 11 similar to the situation on a shallow foreshore because of severe wave breaking wave spectra across the shallow reef flat tend to flatten out or exhibit multiple peaks moreover compared to open gentle beaches ig waves are enhanced on steep reefs and can account for a significant proportion in the total wave energy on the reef flat see also section 5 in such a case the use of a mean spectral period having emphasis on longer period waves in shallow water like t m 1 0 rather than the peak spectral period is therefore preferable in describing the wave structure interaction see e g van gent 2001 tuan et al 2016 moreover the local wave period t m 1 0 is indeed related to the beach shallowness represented by the ratio of deep water wave height to local water depth see e g hofland et al 2017 in this study we also advocate the use of t m 1 0 as the input wave period to the model this characteristic period t m 1 0 is a common output from wave models and can also be estimated using empirical formulas see eurotop 2018 the relative transitional wave height h t r m 0 is plotted against χ for various locations in fig 6 it appears from comparison between the number of data points associated with locations within the surfzone wg2 wg4 and those behind the surfzone wg5 wg6 that the 3wd always exists with complete three parts within the surfzone and often collapses to contain only the first two weibull ones behind the surfzone a data point is missing once h tr is undetermined or the third weibull does not exist the following formulation of the transitional wave height h tr is found by a least square fit of all the experimental data shown in fig 6 with satisfactory agreement r 2 0 70 12a h t r m 0 3 96 tanh 0 30 χ 12b h t r h m 0 tanh 0 30 χ where 3 96 3 82 4 10 and 0 30 0 28 0 32 are regression coefficients and their corresponding 95 confident bands note from fig 6 and eq 12 that the ratio h t r m 0 approaches the lower limit of 3 96 or h tr 3 96 m0 h m0 when χ is sufficiently large i e in very shallow water χ 7 0 tanh 0 3 χ 1 0 in relatively deeper locations the transitional height h tr rapidly increases as χ declines when χ is too small h tr becomes in excess of the maximum wave height omitting the third weibull part see also section 3 3 4 3 3 2 exponents k 1 and k 2 it follows from the analysis in section 3 1 that the exponent k 1 curvature of the middle part varies considerably with the local parameters while the variation of k 2 is rather mild therefore the use of a fixed exponent for the weibull distribution like in the bg2000 model for a variety of wave conditions seems inappropriate see also e g christou et al 2011 caires and van gent 2012 in the following we explore the effect of the local conditions on the determination of these exponents in terms of both the local relative wave intensity ϕ and the local shallowness χ fig 7 plots the variation of k 1 with the relative wave intensity ϕ m 0 d similar to the finding by battjes and groenendijk 2000 large scattering in k 1 values is observed for locations with small relative wave density particularly behind the surfzone wg4 wg6 however if the effect of the local shallowness χ is also accounted for in formulating k 1 expressed as k 1 χ a reasonably good agreement in the data representation can be obtained see fig 8 accordingly the expression for k 1 can be discriminated into two cases of low and high ϕ values respectively 13 k 1 χ 0 86 ϕ 0 10 k 1 χ 0 86 4 13 ϕ 0 10 0 10 ϕ 0 31 note that the boundary at ϕ 0 10 between the low and high relative wave intensity regions somewhat coincides with that noted in battjes and groenendijk 2000 it is emphasized that as shown in the following this boundary is consistently found in formulating all other model parameters and turns out to be essential for the parameterization of the 3wd the k 2 data plotted against each of ϕ and χ are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively again large scattering is seen for the region of low ϕ values ϕ 0 10 mostly broken waves behind the surfzone or with small χ values χ 3 5 in the region of high ϕ values ϕ 0 10 or relatively shallow water χ 3 5 the scattering is considerably reduced and k 2 tends to vary about a constant mean value 4 70 intuitively the number of k 2 data points are much less than those of k 1 due to the collapse of the 3wd in the area of low relative wave intensity as noticed earlier a closer inspection of the data also reveals that cases without k 2 all fall within the range of low ϕ values out of all the cases considered in this range corresponding with number of k 1 data points in fig 7 a vast number of cases 151 out of 253 cases are with k 2 undetermined in the range of low ϕ values k 2 values though determined are very close to those of k 1 implying that the third weibull part might not be necessary these arguments on the exponent k 2 suggest that the two weibull distribution is most appropriate i e k 2 is absent when ϕ 0 10 the exponent k 2 is thus determined as a constant for locations with high ϕ values only 14 k 2 4 70 ϕ 0 10 3 3 3 root mean square wave height h rms to fully determine the 3wd apart from the model parameters addressed so far the rms wave height h rms needs to be quantified in connection with the local spectral wave energy m 0 for this the ratio h rms m 0 plots against the relative wave intensity ϕ in fig 10 it is well known that due to wave nonlinearities in shallow water this ratio becomes higher than that of rayleigh waves in deep water see also discussions on effects of ig waves in section 5 this was also reported in battjes and groenendijk 2000 though a linearly proportional relation of h rms m 0 with ϕ starting from the lower boundary h rms m 0 2 69 stipulated by finite bandwidth waves in deep water herein the increase of h rms m 0 in shallow water on the reef flat is reaffirmed but a somewhat different trend is observed for low ϕ values ϕ 0 10 the ratio h rms m 0 varies about the same lower boundary of 2 69 for high ϕ values ϕ 0 10 it gradually increases with the increase of ϕ and approaches an upper limit of approximately 3 10 a least square fit of the experimental data results in the following formulations of h rms for low and high ϕ regions respectively 15 h r m s m 0 2 69 ϕ 0 10 h r m s m 0 2 69 0 37 tanh 34 2 ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 10 3 3 4 collapse of the 3wd and the practical upper limit of wave heights as shown in previous sections the model parameters k 1 k 2 and h mrs all switch their behaviours at almost the same critical value of the relative wave intensity ϕ particularly the exponent k 2 is undetermined at large for ϕ 0 10 these observations lend support to the assumption important for the model reliability that the 3wd collapses from a full three weibull distribution to a two weibull one when ϕ becomes sufficiently small overall the critical value of ϕ between the two regions of low and high ϕ values herein has been set at ϕ cr 0 10 as evidenced by the experimental data locations of low ϕ values on the reef flat are often well behind the surfzone where only broken and small non breaking waves remain it is possible to theoretically verify the chosen critical value ϕ cr since the third weibull of the 3wd co exists with the upper transitional wave height h tr the critical ϕ value can be derived in accordance with the criterion for the existence of h tr by definition the third weibull exists only if the largest wave height is not exceeded by h tr i e h tr h max see also fig 5 from eq 11 together with eq 12b this criterion can be worked out as follows 16 χ χ 3 33 a tanh 1 β or in terms of ϕ 17 ϕ m 0 d χ 2 4 cos α 2 s 0 m in which β h max h m0 χ is a critical value of χ s 0m 2 π h m 0 g t m 1 0 2 is the fictitious wave steepness in deep water the ratio h max h m0 is approximately equal to 1 80 based on the rayleigh distribution by longuet higgins 1952 in shallow water this ratio declines with the increase of wave breaking intensity in this study the relation between β and the shallowness factor χ obtained from the measurements on the reef flat is presented in fig 11 showing that from very shallow to relatively deeper water conditions the value of β on average varies from 1 50 to 2 0 typically β 1 50 is found representative for a wide range of shallow conditions χ 3 0 and is thus used for consideration herein the experimental data also show that s 0m is in the range between 0 030 and 0 055 at high ϕ values with β 1 50 χ 2 70 from eq 14 and the value range of s 0m substituted the criterion for the existence of the third weibull of the 3wd can eventually be deduced from eq 17 ϕ 0 06 0 10 this asserts that the critical value ϕ cr 0 10 is in fact appropriate as addressed in section 1 to improve the model predictive performance on largest wave heights the tail of the distribution should realistically be intercepted by an upper limit for wave heights in shallow water this upper limit is implicit in the 3wd but can be evaluated through assessing the maximum wave height predicted by the model largest wave heights in case the 3wd collapses are generally smaller than those when all three weibull parts exist it is therefore sufficient to consider the maximum wave height in the latter case it follows from the third weibull in eq 3 18 h max h 2 ln n 1 k 2 1 54 where h max is the maximum wave height in n considered waves for the evaluation of h max n is often taken as 1000 waves under laboratory conditions h max h 0 1 though sometime can be up to several thousands of waves however owing to the large exponent k 2 the ratio h max h 2 is relatively insensitive to n i e h max h 2 1 51 1 54 with n 1000 2000 herein for considering the practical upper limit n 2000 is taken on the conservative side giving the value of 1 54 on the right hand side of eq 18 it appears from the relation h 2 h m0 ϕ shown in fig 12 that the ratio h 2 h m0 is approximately unity with a maximum deviation of about 0 20 at ϕ 0 13 i e h 2 h m0 1 0 0 2 hence the practical upper limit of wave heights h ul expressed in terms of h m0 can be derived from eq 18 19 h max h u l 1 3 1 9 h m 0 the upper limit of wave heights h ul specified in eq 19 lies within the range of maximum wave height in shallow water see also fig 11 whereby largest wave heights predicted by the 3wd are realistically intercepted 3 3 5 summary of calculation steps given all necessary local inputs i e m 0 t m 1 0 d and tanα the following steps are taken for establishing the 3wd and then determining characteristic wave heights at a considered location on the reef flat 1 calculation of the relative wave intensity ϕ and checking the collapse of the 3wd if ϕ 0 10 only two weibull parts exist continue with step 3 if ϕ 0 10 all three weibull parts exists continue with step 2 2 calculation of transitional wave heights h tr 0 and h tr the lower transitional wave height h tr 0 0 35 d the upper transitional wave height h tr the shallowness parameter χ is calculated according to eq 11 the upper transitional wave height h tr is determined according to eq 12 3 determination of the exponents k 1 k 2 the exponent k 1 is calculated according to eq 13 the exponent k 2 is determined only if ϕ 0 10 k 2 4 70 eq 14 4 establishment of the 3wd the rms wave height h rms is calculated according to eq 15 it then follows by the determination of scale wave heights h h 1 and h 2 if ϕ 0 10 eqs 7 and 10 are numerically solved for h and h 1 if ϕ 0 10 eqs 7 9 are numerically solved for h h 1 and h 2 the 3wd is fully established through the system of equation 3 whereby any arbitrary characteristic wave heights such as h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 h 0 1 etc can be calculated 4 model comparison and validation 4 1 model comparison with data of characteristic wave heights the model parameters of the 3wd have been formulated based on overall agreements with all individual wave heights from the measured wave records still it is necessary to examine the model predictive performance on most common characteristic wave heights for this comparisons of wave heights h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 and h 0 1 between the data from all 540 measured records and those predicted by the 3wd and the bg2000 model are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively as hinted at in subsection 3 1 on the bed slope effect see also fig 4 the local bed slope as input to the bg2000 model is specified as the fore reef slope for locations within the reef edge surfzone and as 1 250 for those behind this boundary bg2000 is not valid for flat bottoms the goodness of the model predictions is evaluated through the relative mean square error ε 20 ε i 1 n p 1 h mod e l i h l a b i 2 n p in which h model and h lab denote wave heights predicted by the model and from the measurements respectively n p is the number of data points overall all characteristic wave heights are well predicted by the 3wd small errors ε 6 11 in particular the estimates of average based wave heights h 1 3 and h 1 10 are slightly better than those of extreme exceedance probabilities h 1 and h 0 1 as expected the bg2000 generally overestimates all considered characteristic wave heights i e data points largely stay above the straight line denoting the equivalence between model predictions and measurements in which the predictions of extreme wave heights h 1 and h 0 1 are particularly worse ε 18 3 and 29 0 respectively 4 2 model validation the 3wd are validated against two existing laboratory datasets as outlined in table 2 which include wave transmission across wide crested sandbanks by tuan and san 2018 and wave propagation on a shallow mangrove foreshore by anh 2018 the aims of these experiments were originally different however these are considered suitable for model validations herein because of the resemblance in wave breaking conditions induced by the abrupt depth transition in the first case the model sandbank of 0 25 m in height and 5 0 m in crest width b was placed on a foreshore as illustrated in fig 15 a the seaward slope of the bank was 1 5 initially and became on average 1 8 to 1 20 after testing each of the test cases lasted for approximately 3000 waves the deformation of the bank profile was mainly observed on the seaward slope and quickly evolved toward an equilibrium state just after the first 1000 waves herein wave parameters are therefore based on the last 1000 waves only over which the bank profile change is negligibly small to further suppress the effect of local bed changes only the station wg5 at the middle of the bank is selected for consideration the measured individual wave heights together with the corresponding distribution graphs by both the 3wd and the bg2000 model for four different test cases are shown in fig 16 it follows that the 3wd agrees well with the measurements in all test cases with the fore reef slope ranging from steep to relatively gentle which also affirms that the 3wd is rather insensitive to the change of the fore reef slope on the contrary the predictions by the bg2000 model appears rather sensitive to the change of the local bed slope and are satisfactory in the case of gentle fore reef slope only tanα 1 15 and 1 20 fig 16b and d in a similar setting but without the sandbank anh 2018 carried out a series of experiments on wave transmission across a mangrove forest to create wave breaking on a relatively flat foreshore the same foreshore as used in the previous case a transitional slope of 1 25 was introduced see fig 15b in fact the bed topography turns out to resemble that of a shallow fringing reef herein only the measurements at the location wg4 close to the reef edge to minimize possible effects of wave setup in the case without mangroves are considered the predictions of common characteristic wave heights h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 and h n as n 1000 the largest wave height in n waves h n is considered instead of h 0 1 by both the 3wd and the bg2000 model in comparison with the measured data are shown in fig 17 the relative mean square errors by both models are also given ε 3wd and ε bg correspond to the errors by 3wd and the bg 2000 respectively there is general agreement by both models but in detail the 3wd under predicts and the bg2000 model over predicts the measured wave heights systematically these discrepancies in part can be attributed to the different wave hydrodynamics on the fringing reef with the enhancement of wave setup and particularly potential resonant amplification of standing ig waves see also section 5 overall the predictive performance by the bg2000 model is slightly better say about 6 more accurate in this case this is logical since the fore reef slope of 1 25 is sufficiently mild as a beach slope on which the bg2000 model but not the 3wd is most appropriate 5 discussion ig waves have been realized as one of the important hydrodynamic features on steep reef environments as they are considerably enhanced relative to open gentle beaches as a result the presence of ig waves may play a role in altering the statistical properties of wave heights on the reef flat suggesting the need for a more appropriate wave height distribution model as proposed in the present study in this section we look at the relevant characteristics of ig wave dynamics on platform reefs as observed from the experiments and subsequently address its possible effects on the distribution of wave heights for this it is also concerned with wave reflection because of its important connection with reef wave heights in general and with the dynamics of ig waves in particular it is worth mentioning that reflection and ig waves are inherent to steep reefs and their effects have implicitly been incorporated in the formulations of wave height distribution model addressed in the previous sections 5 1 effects of wave reflection in addition to modifying total wave heights reflection of out going ig waves at the seaward reef edge can entrap wave energy leading to potential resonant amplification of standing ig waves on the reef flat nwogu and demirbilek 2010 pomeroy et al 2012 buckley et al 2018 in the present experiments wave reflection can occur at the fore reef slope as well as at the riprap slope behind the reef with reference to a platform reef in the field reflection due to the fore reef slope is an intrinsic manner whilst that due to the riprap slope is considered as laboratory effects though without the back reef slope waves are still reflected due to a rapid change in wave celerity when leaving from the reef flat to a deeper region for the evaluation of the effect of wave reflection on wave heights it is presumed that linear wave theory is still adequate for describing the across shore energy flux of progressive waves over the reef flat see e g pomeroy et al 2012 yao et al 2013 buckley et al 2018 also because the reef surface in this study is smooth the effect of bottom friction can be ignored the conservation equation of wave energy within a cell between an offshore point and a point on the reef flat is according to 21 e 0 1 k r 0 2 c g 0 e i 1 k r i 2 c g i d b where e 1 8ρgh 2 rsm is the wave energy density c g is the group velocity ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity d b is the time averaged wave energy dissipation due to breaking within the considered section k r is the bulk reflection coefficient the subscripts 0 and i denote quantities evaluated at locations offshore and on the reef flat respectively note that reflection measured at a location on the reef flat k r i is mainly from the back reef slope whilst that measured at the offshore location k r 0 is from both the back reef and the fore reef slopes the energy dissipated by breaking d b can be expressed in terms of local parameters wave and water depth according to a random wave breaking model such as by battjes and janssen 1978 or thornton guza 1983 hence eq 18 is further worked out with the expressions of e and d b substituted 22 1 8 ρ g h r m s 0 2 1 k r 0 2 c g 0 1 8 ρ g h r m s i 2 1 k r i 2 c g i 1 8 ρ g a b f p q b h r m s i 2 where f p is a representative peak wave frequency q b is the breaking fraction and a b is an intermediate model parameter subsequently the rms wave height incorporating the effect of wave reflection for a location on the reef flat reads 23 h r m s i 1 k r 0 2 c g 0 1 k r i 2 c g i a b f p q b h r m s 0 the effect of wave reflection is further clarified through the ratio of the rms wave height according to eq 20 to the one determined without reflection effects i e k r 0 0 k r i 0 24 δ r 1 k r 0 2 c g i a b f p q b 1 k r i 2 c g i a b f p q b 25 δ r max 1 k r 0 2 where δ r 1 0 is the wave height reduction factor due to reflection the reduction is largest i e δ r δ r max when either reflection from the back reef slope is minimal k 2 r i 0 or the contributing effect from reflection is negligibly small compared to that from wave breaking i e k r i 2 c g i a b f p q b wave reflection at a location on the reef flat can be evaluated with the incoming and outgoing shore normal energy fluxes determined from co located spectra measured at that location sheremet et al 2002 unfortunately synchronous velocity measurements at the wave gauge locations were not available therefore reflection analysis is possible herein with the three gauge array at the horizontal deep section only reflection coefficients at frequencies of interest are determined according to zelt and skjelbreia 1992 a generalised least squares method of mansard and funke 1980 for an arbitrary number of wave gauges see also section 2 wave spectra were split at half of the peak spectral frequency in each of the wave cases f p 2 see table 1 for the determination of short period sea swell waves ss f f p 2 and ig waves 0 025 f f p 2 note that eq 18 and subsequently eqs 20 and 21 are valid for total wave heights with bulk reflection coefficients only integrated over the full relevant frequency range including both ss and ig bands their use solely for either ss waves or ig waves may induce significant errors because of possible nonlinear energy transfers amongst different frequencies see e g henderson et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2012 herein bulk reflection coefficients are used in eqs 21 and 22 for assessing the overall effect of wave reflection on the rms wave height and thus on the wave height distribution reflection of ig waves is more relevant for addressing the dynamics of ig waves and its subsequent influences see section 5 2 fig 18 presents variations of the reflection coefficient measured at the offshore location with the relative reef flat submergence d h m0 0 with h m0 0 being the incoming offshore wave height for the total waves bulk coefficient k r short period waves k r ss and ig waves k r ig respectively it appears that both the bulk reflection coefficient and the reflection coefficient of ss waves are relatively small k r k r ss 0 07 0 19 and both clearly increase with decreasing relative reef flat submergence reflection from the riprap slope can be examined when the relative reef flat submergence d h m0 0 is sufficiently large such that the effect of the fore reef slope is minimal it can be seen from fig 18 that when d h m0 0 2 70 the bulk reflection coefficient becomes very small k r 0 07 which is largely due to the riprap slope alone conversely highest reflection occurs at low water levels i e k r 0 19 when d h m0 0 1 5 and is mostly generated on the fore reef slope as expected highest reflection is observed for ig waves with k r ig varying in the range from 0 40 to 0 70 no clear dependence of ig waves reflection on the relative reef flat submergence is observed with the highest reflection coefficient measured at the offshore boundary k r 0 0 19 fig 18 and given a minimal reflection from the back reef slope k r i 0 the largest reduction of the rms wave height can be estimated according to eq 22 which is only about 2 0 δ r max 0 98 this is within the measurement error for wave heights therefore the effect of wave reflection on the rms wave height and consequently on the distribution of wave heights in the present study is negligible 5 2 effects of infra gravity waves at first wave reflection is also important to the dynamics of ig waves at the deep offshore section the incoming ig wave height is very small since ig waves are mostly generated inside the surfzone whilst the outgoing ig wave height is relatively large hence the reflection coefficient of ig waves at this location is highest over the entire reef flat see also buckley et al 2018 in other words the reflection coefficients of ig waves at a specific location on the reef flat would not exceed 0 70 or k r ig 2 0 50 see also fig 18 implying that ig waves are predominantly shoreward progressive throughout the reef flat as a consequence partial standing or standing ig waves could not exist and resonant amplification of ig waves on the reef flat did not occur without loss of generality fig 19 presents variations of the spectral wave height of ss h m0 ss and ig h m0 ig waves at various locations across the reef for two representative cases of lowest and highest water depths on the reef flat under the same high offshore incident wave fore reef slope tanα 1 5 water depth d 0 15 m and 0 40 m offshore wave h m0 0 0 20 m and t p 1 80s in both cases the ss wave height h m0 ss substantially reduces due to depth induced breaking around the reef edge and gradually decreases behind the surfzone however ss waves are still the major component in the total wave energy across the reef flat because of moderate breaking conditions associated with a relative large reef flat submerged depth considered in this study d h m0 0 0 67 3 46 see also table 1 the ig wave height h m0 ig initially peaks in the surfzone around the reef edge and subsequently decays over the remaining part of the reef at a much slower rate than ss waves for example due to ig energy transfer back to higher frequencies see also henderson et al 2006 although with a very small proportion in the total wave height in deep water the relative importance of ig waves becomes more significant as waves propagates over the reef flat particularly for the case of low water level for the case of small water depth in fig 19a the ratio h m0 ig h m0 ss increases from 0 12 in deep water to 0 31 around the reef edge and reaches the maximum value of 0 34 at a location on the inner reef flat these corresponding values are 0 12 0 14 and 0 18 for the case of large water depth in fig 19b overall the characteristics of ig waves transformation over the reef as observed from the present experiments agree well with the preceding laboratory works such as by nwogu and demirbilek 2010 and buckley et al 2018 however herein the ig wave height is considerably smaller than the ss wave height and the wave hydrodynamics across the reef also because of no potential ig wave resonance is overwhelmingly dominated by ss waves the existing models of the wave height distribution on shallow beaches glukhovskiy 1966 klopman 1996 battjes and groenendijk 2000 mainly focus on the deviation of extreme highest waves in the tail of the distribution ascribed to effects of depth induced wave breaking possible departure of the statistical properties of lower wave heights however is unclear or ignored albeit these waves are most related to effects that are enhanced in shallow water such as nonlinearities and finite spectral bandwidth as shown earlier the proportion of ig waves in the total wave energy becomes more significant on the reef flat implying that wave nonlinearities may cause the distribution of lower waves to differ significantly from the rayleigh one the evidence can be seen from the analysis in section 3 figss 2 4 that the middle part of the distribution with intermediate wave heights including ig waves evolves markedly with the local conditions effects of ig waves are therefore most exhibited in the mid part of the distribution i e the second weibull part in the present study as noted in subsection 3 3 that the ratio h rms m 0 gets higher as waves become more nonlinear in shallow water herein effects of ig waves can therefore be interpreted via their nonlinearities causing the increase of the ratio h rms m 0 with increasing relative wave intensity ϕ on the reef flat eq 13 and fig 10 which consequently tends to increase the heights of intermediate waves in the middle part of the distribution see fig 2a c overall the effect of ig waves has also been accounted for in the 3wd through the use of the characteristic spectral period t m 1 0 in the model parameterization see subsection 3 3 finally it is worthwhile to mention about the applicability range of the 3wd presented in this study the derived model parameters are valid for hydraulic conditions satisfying the range of tested conditions as follows m 0 d 0 06 0 26 d l 0m 0 01 0 19 d h m0 0 0 67 3 46 also albeit the model parameterization is based on tested cases with two steep fore reef slopes only tanα 1 5 and 1 10 it is evidenced from the above model validations that the validity of the 3wd goes beyond this slope limit and is still reliable for fore reef slopes as mild as 1 20 the 3wd has been formulated with the laboratory wave data on platform reefs with the dominance of sea swell short period waves to what extent the new distribution model can be applied to fringing reefs particularly at locations with the dominance of ig waves due to resonant amplification has not been investigated 6 conclusions the present paper is concerned with a laboratory study on the distribution of wave heights on steep platform reefs it is experimentally shown that existing models incorporating the effect of wave breaking on a shallow beach fail to reliably describe the wave height distribution on the shallow reef flat this is due to the fact that wave breaking and nonlinearity induced by sudden depth reduction over a steep fore reef slope might differ substantially from those induced by gradual depth variation on a gently sloping shallow beach in addition to the local relative wave intensity the wave height distribution is found to complexly depend on the reef flat shallowness and on the fore reef slope a new composite distribution which extends the approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 is therefore proposed the new model is generally composed out of three weibull parts and collapses to a two weibull one when the relative wave intensity drops below a critical level the model parameters are formulated as functions of the local input parameters through least square fitting all individual wave heights from 540 measured wave records at various locations across the reef flat the experimental data on most common characteristics wave heights and the model predictions are found in very good agreement the model is validated against two existing laboratory datasets of wave heights on reefs with various fore reef slopes showing that good model predictive capacity is found for fore reef slopes steeper than 1 20 further studies on model validations against field datasets and on effects of various reef morphology are recommended 
22526,extensive laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the statistical characteristics of wave heights on steep submerged platform reefs compared with the situation on a gently sloping beach the extraordinary wave breaking induced by abrupt depth reduction over a steep fore reef slope makes the wave height distribution on the reef flat to differ substantially existing models of wave height distributions on shallow beaches such as by battjes and groenendijk 2000 thus come out to be less reliable to resolve this a new composite weibull distribution model has been proposed and formulated based on 540 measured wave records at various locations across the reef flat the model is generally composed out of three weibull parts and collapses to a two weibull distribution in a situation of low relative wave energy the newly proposed model shows good predictive capacity on most common characteristic wave heights in comparison with the present and several existing laboratory datasets keywords wave height distribution weibull platform reefs reef flat wave breaking 1 introduction wave height distributions in shallow coastal water are essential for determining design wave heights and subsequently design wave forcing on coastal structures likewise the distribution of wave heights on offshore submerged platform reefs is also needed for example to resolve design impact loads induced by wave breaking on structures located on the reef flat tops deep water wave heights are theoretically shown to obey the rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 in shallow water shoaling nonlinear interactions and most importantly depth induced wave breaking make the wave height distribution to differ significantly from the theoretical rayleigh form in this context it is common to address wave breaking to occur on a gentle beach say slope less than 1 20 with gradual depth variation however in the case on a submerged reef considered herein waves also break as the water depth suddenly reduces to a breaking limit on the reef flat the abrupt depth transition over a steep reef the fore reef slope is typically between 1 15 and 1 5 results in unordinary breaking conditions wave transformation and consequently the distribution of wave heights on the reef flat therefore might noticeably deviate from those ordinary on a shallow beach for clarity characteristics of wave breaking and wave hydrodynamics on steep reefs are briefly reviewed in the following nelson 1994 noted that the maximum individual wave height to water depth ratio at locations behind the reef edge surfzone on a horizontal reef flat should not exceed 0 55 far below the commonly accepted value of 0 80 in a laboratory investigation on regular wave transformation on a fringing reef gourlay 1994 noticed that wave breaking conditions on the reef edge are substantially different from those on a plane beach the wave transmission regime is classified according to a non linearity parameter representing wave conditions at the reef edge the maximum wave height to depth ratio on the reef flat is found to depend on this non linearity parameter and turns out to be consistent with the finding by nelson 1994 for a horizontal bed yao et al 2013 experimentally examined characteristics of breaking of monochromatic waves on fringing reefs with various fore reef slopes the results reveal that most of the wave breaking features over the reef such as breaker types and breaker indices are mainly characterized by the relative reef flat submergence i e the ratio of the water depth over the reef flat d to the offshore incident wave height h m0 0 d h m0 0 but not by the surf similarity like on plane beaches battjes 1974 besides wave breaking a vast number of field and laboratory studies exist in the literature on the reef wave dynamics see e g nakaza and hino 1991 lowe et al 2005 demirbilek et al 2007 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 buckley et al 2015 becker et al 2016 buckley et al 2018 collectively these describe the two important hydrodynamic features on reefs that are low frequency motions or infra gravity waves frequencies f 0 04 hz in field scales henceforth designated as ig waves and the super elevated water level wave setup in steep reef environments their magnitudes can potentially be enhanced compared to those on open gentle beaches wave setup and low frequency motions can be major components of wave run up at a reef fringed shoreline wave setup on steep reefs can be very significant due to large gradients of the cross shore radiation stress as the result of abrupt depth reduction induced wave breaking around the reef edge buckley et al 2015 and thus is primarily influenced by the water depth over the reef wave setup generally increases with a decrease in the relative reef flat submergence see e g gourlay 1996a 1996b higher bottom roughness also tends to increase setup through its effects on the bottom stress in the across shore momentum balance the influence of higher roughness on setup however can partially be cancelled out by the effect of reduced wave heights due to increased frictional wave dissipation buckley et al 2016 wave setup is also affected by the reef profile features setup on a platform reef considered in this study where water is able to escape leeward is considerably less than that on a fringing reef see e g gourlay 1996a 1996b nevertheless the effect of wave setup on wave heights can straightforwardly be incorporated through including setup in the mean water level allowing for larger wave heights to exist on the reef flat in this study the effect of wave setup on the wave height distribution is implicit in the measured wave heights across the reef ig waves on a steep reef are predominantly generated by breaking processes of short period waves around the reef edge i e oscillation of the breakpoint mechanism see e g pomeroy et al 2012 becker et al 2016 buckley et al 2018 as short period waves dissipate due to breaking the relative importance of ig waves start to increase toward the shore and can even dominate near the shoreline or inside the lagoon behind reefs also resonant amplification of standing ig waves can potentially occur leading to a notable increase in wave run up nakaza and hino 1991 péquignet et al 2009 nwogu and demirbilek 2010 pomeroy et al 2012 buckley et al 2018 yao et al 2019 eventual effects of ig waves on the wave height statistics are not straightforward and further discussed in section 5 despite the noticeable difference in wave hydrodynamics published research has not been available yet for the wave height distribution on submerged reefs in terms of explicitness and ease of application models for the wave height distribution with the effect of wave breaking can be split into two groups first is those largely rely on theoretical approximations tayfun 1981 or purely algorithmic manipulations see e g mase and iwagaki 1982 dally and dean 1986 and therefore are either impractical or implicit for use in engineering applications in the second and most popular group empirical distributions such as weibull are adopted whereby model parameters can straightforwardly be formulated with experimental data see e g glukhovskiy 1966 klopman 1996 battjes and groenendijk 2000 rattanapitikon 2010 wu et al 2016 in the present study we also advocate the second approach and a review on most relevant studies with consideration of wave breaking effects is given in the following glukhovskiy 1966 see bouws 1979 extended the rayleigh distribution for wave heights in finite water depth through explicit inclusion of the wave height to water depth ratio h s d as the model breaker parameter klopman 1996 further modified the glukhovskiy distribution to a more consistent weibull distribution with two distinct parameters however at hinted at by the fact that the distribution by klopman 1996 still overestimates extreme wave heights while underestimates lower ones battjes and groenendijk 2000 arrived at a composite rayleigh weibull distribution henceforth referred to as the bg2000 the two parts of the bg2000 distribution are joined at a transitional wave height the upper distribution i e above the transitional wave height is particularly for high waves affected by depth limited conditions laboratory data of wave heights on various beach slopes ranging from 1 20 to 1 250 were used to formulate the model parameters as functions of local spectral wave energy m 0 water depth and bottom slope also the breaker parameter known as the relative wave intensity or wave saturation degree represented by m 0 d is used instead of h s d in the model the approach of composite distributions by battjes and groenendijk 2000 is considered most suitable for wave heights in shallow water and thus has been pursued in numerous laboratory and field studies on the model verification and validation herein without loss of generality more attention is therefore paid to the bg2000 model mai et al 2010 showed a consistent underestimation of high waves by the bg2000 model compared with field data along the german coast recommending amendments of both the transitional wave height and the exponent of the upper distribution in a situation of low relative wave intensity caires and van gent 2012 also reported that estimates of h 0 1 by the bg2000 model are as much as 15 lower than laboratory broken waves and field data lake waves of wave heights on flat bottoms on the contrary christou et al 2011 spotted that both the bg2000 and glukhovskiy 1966 models largely over predict their measurements collected at duck field experiment site north carolina usa comparisons of the bg2000 model with laboratory measurements also report the same discrepancies vasiliki and swan 2011 found the model largely over estimates their largest wave heights on mild beach slopes at shallowest locations while vledder 2013 showed the opposite when comparing with data of wave heights on a barred beach by boers 1996 rattanapitikon 2010 attempted to verify seventeen conversion formulas for several representative wave heights derived from existing and modified distributions against large existing laboratory and field datasets covering a wide range of wave conditions from deep to shallow water since the study mainly focused on the overall predictive performances of the formulations but not on detailed agreements of the considered distributions themselves no insight into the existing models with regards to the effect of wave breaking was given the contradicting results amongst the aforementioned model comparisons might be attributed to factors that are inadequately addressed by the existing models such as bottom topographic conditions the local spectral shape influenced by the foreshore shallowness see hofland et al 2017 or even the number of waves considered it generally follows that the existing distributions including that by battjes and groenendijk 2000 work reasonably well in intermediate water while in shallower depths discrepancy arises for highest waves i e at the tail also it is noticed that the trend of measured data and the shape of the distribution at the tail of the weibull part are largely dissimilar overall agreement of the bg2000 model therefore cannot be achieved simply through tuning the model parameters wu et al 2016 argued that wave heights in shallow water are limited by the breaking criteria so that the weibull tail without an upper limit seems inappropriate the authors therefore proposed a new composite weibull generalised pareto distribution in which the transitional wave height between the two parts is set at the significant wave height h s and the breaking criteria by miche 1944 is used as the upper limit though the limit is rather theoretical the model was claimed to perform well for the wave height distribution as a whole under various wave conditions from deep to shallow water however as the study did not particularly aim at depth induced breaking waves and only a few datasets of breaking waves were available the model performance for the tail in cases with wave breaking was not evidenced in this regard the distribution by glukhovskiy 1966 was found the best it is emphasized that all of the considered existing distributions were not fitted with individual wave heights from measured records but with datasets of representative wave heights only i e at h 1 3 h m h 1 h 0 1 etc in the present study context it appears that both in terms of adaptability and of simplicity the model approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 is most attractive the study goal is therefore to extend the model approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 to better describe the wave height distribution on submerged reefs to this end laboratory experiments of wave transformation across submerged reefs are conducted whereby the proposed model can be parameterized with all individual wave heights 2 laboratory experiments the scale model experiments were conducted in the 45 m long and 1 0 m wide wave flume of thuy loi university hanoi vietnam formerly water resources university the piston type wave generator is equipped with an active reflection compensation system aukepc arc deltares and capable of making irregular wave height up to 0 30 m and 3 0s in peak period submerged platform or island reefs off the coast of vietnam are a few hundred meters to several kilometres wide at the flat top level note that the morphology of a platform reef considered herein is distinguished from that of a fringing reef in that the reef flat is always submerged and surrounded by the sea without a shoreline see gourlay 1996a 1996b the water depth is often more than 100 m at the reef foot section and in the range of 5 20 m on the reef flat this reef flat submerged depth is substantially larger than that of typical australian fringing reefs reported in previous studies e g lowe et al 2005 pomeroy et al 2012 huang et al 2012 etc the transitional section from the deep water part to the shallow reef flat typically consists of a steep deep foot slope 1 1 1 2 and a milder flank slope 1 5 1 15 because of space constraints it was not possible to scale down the full reef cross section in the wave flume only part of submerged reefs which are most relevant to the problem of wave transformation considered was modelled with further consideration of the test wave conditions the model length scale of 1 40 was eventually selected the reef surface in prototype is often very rough with a variety of reef organisms as a result wave height attenuation due to bottom friction can be significant in case of small water depths on the reef flat lowe et al 2005 pomeroy et al 2012 huang et al 2012 because of relatively large reef flat water depths and high incoming waves under storm conditions considered in this study see also table 1 effects of bottom friction on across reef wave transformation would be overwhelmingly dominated by depth induced breaking together with other nonlinear wave processes on the other hand albeit effects of bottom friction on wave heights can be considerable its effects on wave nonlinearities which eventually influence the wave height distribution have never been reported in the literature and are difficult to reproduce in small scale experiments with the aim to investigate the wave height distribution on which effects of depth induced wave breaking are most important the effect of the reef roughness is therefore disregarded in the present experiments fig 1 illustrates the experimental layout in which the model reef is 50 cm high above the flume bottom to assure the generation of incoming deep water waves the reef surface was made of smooth and impermeable wooden materials for the effect of the transitional slope on wave breaking and thus on the wave height distribution two typical fore reef slopes of 1 5 and 1 10 are considered respectively the flat top width b is 5 0 m 200 m in prototype sufficiently wide to accommodate both the reef edge surfzone and the inner reef flat region behind the surfzone for observation of the entire progress of wave transformation over the reef under field conditions water is able to escape behind a platform reef without the shoreline and thus wave setup and wave reflection are minimal gourlay 1996a 1996b in flume experiments however the landward boundary always exists and therefore these boundary conditions are never fully satisfied in this study these laboratory effects were minimized with the introduction of a relative wide basin 12 m behind the reef and a very gentle riprap slope slope of 1 6 as a passive wave absorber at the end of the flume capacitance wave gauges are distributed in three regions across the reef i e deep water reef edge surfzone and behind the surfzone in which positions of those on the reef flat can be variable depending on test scenarios so that various across reef wave conditions can be captured see fig 1 for a standard arrangement of gauges the sampling rate was set at 50 hz for all wave gauges the experimental program as outlined in matrices of table 1 consists of 120 test cases which are combinations of six submerged depths two fore reef slopes and ten test waves characterizing various sea states during storms the test waves were jonswap spectra with the peak enhancement factor γ 1 25 as found most suitable for storm waves at the deep sea region off the coast of vietnam note that the wave parameters as shown in table 1 are nominal steering at the wave board boundary only in which the peak wave periods are derived according to two typical storm wave steepness s 0p of 0 03 and 0 04 respectively amongst these test combinations test cases with notable super elevated water levels behind the reef or with largest wave heights in excess of the flume height were excluded in total only 108 out of 120 experiments were carried out each of which lasted approximately 1000 waves to sufficiently cover the main frequency domain of desired wave spectra and allow for stable statistical properties of wave heights these extensive experiments are considered sufficient to cover wide ranges of variations and combinations of the major independent variables involved i e reef flat water depth fore reef slope wave height and wave period wave reflection was analyzed with measured records from a three gauge array at the deep offshore section according to the approach by zelt and skjelbreia 1992 to avoid problem of singularities in the determination of wave reflection the spacing of wave gauges was carefully selected and optimized for all test conditions see wl 2004 the measured data include individual wave heights statistical and spectral wave parameters e g h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 h 0 1 h rms h m0 t p t m 1 0 at all stations typical spectral and statistical wave parameters are defined according to 1 m n f l f

respectively s f is the variance spectral density m n is the n th order spectral moment t m 1 0 is the characteristic spectral period h rms is the root mean square wave height h 1 3 is the statistical significant wave height h m0 is the spectral significant wave height n is the number of waves in a record h i represents the individual wave heights sorted in descending order 3 distribution of wave heights on the reef flat 3 1 influencing parameters and wave height distribution characteristics in this section we inspect the measured data of individual wave heights from several systematic test series to gain qualitative understanding of the wave height distribution and influences of reef geometrical and hydraulic parameters first it concerns the effect of the reef flat shallowness expressed via the ratio of the incoming deep water wave to the local water depth over the flat d on the wave height distribution see e g hofland et al 2017 for the definition of beach shallowness a test series of three different water depths d 0 15 m 0 30 m and 0 40 m under the same typical moderate incoming deep water wave h m0 0 15 m t p 1 55s and fore reef slope tanα 1 10 are considered so a smaller depth means a shallower reef flat fig 2 plots the probability exceedance graph of the measured individual wave heights around the reef edge at wg2 in comparison with the rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 the distribution by battjes and groenendijk 2000 and the modified glukhovskiy klopman 1996 in this figure the probability of exceedance of a specific wave height is the probability that the wave height shall be reached or exceeded see also subsection 3 2 it is shown that the predictive performances of these models are very sensitive to the shallowness of the reef flat the bg2000 model generally agrees well with the measurements of small waves in the lower part of the distribution while seriously overestimates those of high waves in the upper part the tail of the distribution the discrepancy with the data markedly extends toward the lower part of the distribution as the shallowness increases corresponding to the decrease in water depth d from 0 40 m in fig 2c to 0 15m in fig 2a particularly the bg2000 distribution is much steeper than the data trend at the tail which explains the model overestimation of extreme representative wave heights as noted in section 1 in contrast to the bg2000 model the klopman distribution largely underestimates the measurements except for very small wave heights however in the case of very shallow reef flat the distribution approaches closer to the data points at the tail i e better agreement is found for largest waves fig 2a the tail of the klopman distribution and the data trend are generally similar in shape as expected the original rayleigh distribution by longuet higgins 1952 is inappropriate for distribution of wave heights in finite depth second regarding the influence of the wave height to water depth ratio known as the relative wave energy fig 3 shows the distributions of measured wave heights at various locations across the reef obtained from the same test case h m0 0 15 m t p 1 55s d 0 25 m and tanα 1 10 it can be seen that in the surfzone with high relative wave energy wg2 wg4 the distribution shape curvature particularly at the middle part is most complex and evolves considerably in the inner reef flat zone behind the surfzone with low relative wave energy wg5 wg6 the shape becomes rather simple and stable but seems not revert to a rayleigh one at all locations on the reef flat the tail of the distribution is generally straight and gentle third for the effect of the fore reef slope test cases also under the same incident wave h m0 0 15 m t p 1 55s and water depth d 0 30 m but with two different fore reef slopes tanα 1 5 and 1 10 are considered fig 4 shows the distributions at the reef edge wg2 inside the surfzone wg3 and behind the surfzone wg5 respectively the fore reef slope appears to have significant effects on the distribution within the reef edge surfzone only fig 4a and b under the same incoming deep water waves a steeper slope results in a greater fore reef depth and thus the incoming waves at the reef edge are higher fig 4a however this increase is not of the same proportionality for all wave heights especially the lowest waves are almost not affected moving further inside the surfzone the largest waves start to break due to depth limited conditions as a result the slope effect is seen to exhibit in the intermediate wave heights only see fig 4b because most high waves break within the surf zone wave heights behind the surfzone are mainly related to the local water depth blurring out the fore reef slope effect as seen in fig 4c overall it is apparent that to better describe the wave height distribution its three distinct parts as noted above i e lower intermediate and upper should be realized 3 2 formulations of a new composite weibull distribution the above analysis reveals some important characteristics of the distribution of wave heights on the reef flat which are hints for the development of a new model in terms of complexity one would distinguish between the distribution for locations inside the surfzone and that behind the surfzone in the surfzone the distribution is more complex than that can be described by a single or even a two weibull distribution i e a combination of two weibull distributions can be used at the expense of sacrificing the overall agreement it is therefore suggested that a composite distribution consisting of three distinct segments for small intermediate and largest wave heights should be used instead smallest waves below a certain limit are a little affected by the shallow water depth and thus still fit with a rayleigh distribution the tail with largest waves breaking and near breaking waves shows a simple trend of gently sloping line i e small curvature implying that a weibull with a large exponent for the upper part would be appropriate whereas because of depth induced breaking and nonlinear effects the mid part with intermediate wave heights shoaling waves and broken waves evolves considerably which contradicts with that in the case of shallow beaches see battjes and groenendijk 2000 this evolving part eventually affects the overall model predictive performances via its connections to lower and upper ones behind the surfzone the distribution collapses to a simpler one which can well be described with a rayleigh weibull distribution the concept of three weibull distribution henceforth referred to as 3wd is illustrated in fig 5 following the same approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 the general expressions of the distribution in case all three weibull segments exist are as follows 3 pr h h f 0 h 1 exp h h 2 h h t r 0 0 35 d f 1 h 1 exp h h 1 k 1 h t r 0 h h t r f 2 h 1 exp h h 2 k 2 h h t r h t r h max in which h h 1 and h 2 are scale wave heights of the corresponding weibull functions exponents k1 and k2 are shape factors d is the water depth on the reef flat pr h h is the probability of non exceedance of wave height or pr h h is the probability of exceedance note that the 3wd in general has two distinct transitional wave heights h tr 0 and h tr as argued above the first lower transitional height h tr 0 is treated like a threshold below which waves are negligibly affected by shallow water and thus a rayleigh distribution is valid in this sense h tr 0 must be a small fraction of the water depth d only through fitting a rayleigh distribution for the lower part we found that h tr 0 0 35d gives the best overall agreement with the experimental data as noticed earlier the second upper transitional height h tr would vary with not only on the bottom topography but also with wave breaking intensity or the reef flat shallowness in case the 3wd shrinks to a two weibull distribution the third expression in eq 3 is omitted and only the first transitional wave height h tr 0 remains similar to the bg2000 model the criterion for this is discussed in section 3 3 4 the 3wd model as a whole must satisfy the continuity conditions at the two transitional wave heights and the expression for the root mean square rms wave height h rms respectively 4 f 0 h t r 0 f 1 h t r 0 5 f 1 h t r f 2 h t r 6 h m r s 0 h t r 0 h 2 f 0 h d h h t r 0 h t r h 2 f 1 h d h h t r h 2 f 2 h d h after some algebraic manipulations eqs 4 6 can respectively be rewritten in dimensionless forms as follows see e g groenendijk and van gent 1998 7 h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 2 h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 1 k 1 8 h ˆ t r h ˆ 1 k 1 h ˆ t r h ˆ 2 k 2 9 1 h ˆ 2 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 2 2 h ˆ 1 2 γ h ˆ t r h ˆ 1 k 1 2 k 1 1 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 1 k 1 2 k 1 1 h ˆ 2 2 γ h ˆ t r h ˆ 2 k 2 2 k 2 1 where h ˆ x is a normalized height of h x with respective to h rms h ˆ x h x h r m s γ and γ are upper and lower incomplete gamma functions respectively when only first two weibull distributions exist eq 9 becomes 10 1 h ˆ 2 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 2 2 h ˆ 1 2 γ h ˆ t r 0 h ˆ 1 k 1 2 k 1 1 for the determination of the 3wd a system of three equations eqs 7 9 with three unknowns h h 1 and h 2 needs to be solved numerically the model parameters h tr k 1 and k 2 h tr 0 is already determined h tr 0 0 35d are known because as shown in the following section they are related to the input parameters such as bottom slope water depth and wave spectral parameters 3 3 parameterization of model parameters the existing point models incorporating wave breaking effects discussed so far assume a slow wave evolution so that the model parameters can well be related to the local conditions only e g the bottom slope water depth and wave spectral energy at a considered location regardless of the wave propagation history from deep water as shown in battjes and groenendijk 2000 this assumption is generally valid for cases of relatively simple bottom topography such as gently sloping beaches herein as discussed earlier fig 4a and b the influence of the fore reef slope which somewhat reflects the wave propagation history clearly exhibits in the wave height distributions in the surf zone this means that in addition to the local wave spectral energy and the local water depth the fore reef slope rather than the local bed slope of the reef flat should be used for the model parameterization at least for locations inside the reef edge surfzone nevertheless this slope dependency seems relatively weak as it in part implicitly reflects through the fore reef water depth in scaling wave heights on the reef flat behind the surfzone the fore reef slope influence becomes negligibly small and thus the local bed slope should be used instead in the following we shall relate the three model parameters i e h tr k 1 and k 2 to the external input parameters the values of these are first experimentally determined though least squares fitting the 3wd fig 5 with all individual wave heights from each of 540 measured records from five stations across the reef flat 3 3 1 upper transitional wave height h tr for the composite type of distributions proper transitions are very essential for the model reliability as shown earlier the bg2000 model consistently over estimates the transitional wave height which in combination with a steep weibull tail aggravates the model over prediction of highest wave heights this is in part due to the fact that the transitional wave height h tr in the bg2000 model was formulated with the datasets of a few representative wave heights only not all individual wave heights by definition the upper transitional wave height h tr of the 3wd lies between the mid part of broken and shoaling waves and the upper one of breaking and near breaking waves when h tr becomes too large i e exceeding the maximum wave height the third weibull part does not exist as hinted at above the wave height distribution depends on the shallowness of the reef flat in this study we propose a new parameter χ 11 χ cos α d l 0 m in which α is the fore reef slope for locations inside the surfzone and α 0 cosα 1 behind the surfzone l 0m g 2 π t m 1 0 2 is the deep water wave length based on the local characteristic wave period t m 1 0 the parameter χ is a measure of the local shallowness on the reef flat a larger value of χ means a relatively shallower condition and vice versa the use of cosα in eq 11 is due to the weak dependency of the fore reef slope noticed earlier note also that behind the surfzone where the relative wave intensity is sufficiently small see sections 3 3 3 and 3 3 4 the slope effect becomes negligible and thus cosα 1 can be used in eq 11 similar to the situation on a shallow foreshore because of severe wave breaking wave spectra across the shallow reef flat tend to flatten out or exhibit multiple peaks moreover compared to open gentle beaches ig waves are enhanced on steep reefs and can account for a significant proportion in the total wave energy on the reef flat see also section 5 in such a case the use of a mean spectral period having emphasis on longer period waves in shallow water like t m 1 0 rather than the peak spectral period is therefore preferable in describing the wave structure interaction see e g van gent 2001 tuan et al 2016 moreover the local wave period t m 1 0 is indeed related to the beach shallowness represented by the ratio of deep water wave height to local water depth see e g hofland et al 2017 in this study we also advocate the use of t m 1 0 as the input wave period to the model this characteristic period t m 1 0 is a common output from wave models and can also be estimated using empirical formulas see eurotop 2018 the relative transitional wave height h t r m 0 is plotted against χ for various locations in fig 6 it appears from comparison between the number of data points associated with locations within the surfzone wg2 wg4 and those behind the surfzone wg5 wg6 that the 3wd always exists with complete three parts within the surfzone and often collapses to contain only the first two weibull ones behind the surfzone a data point is missing once h tr is undetermined or the third weibull does not exist the following formulation of the transitional wave height h tr is found by a least square fit of all the experimental data shown in fig 6 with satisfactory agreement r 2 0 70 12a h t r m 0 3 96 tanh 0 30 χ 12b h t r h m 0 tanh 0 30 χ where 3 96 3 82 4 10 and 0 30 0 28 0 32 are regression coefficients and their corresponding 95 confident bands note from fig 6 and eq 12 that the ratio h t r m 0 approaches the lower limit of 3 96 or h tr 3 96 m0 h m0 when χ is sufficiently large i e in very shallow water χ 7 0 tanh 0 3 χ 1 0 in relatively deeper locations the transitional height h tr rapidly increases as χ declines when χ is too small h tr becomes in excess of the maximum wave height omitting the third weibull part see also section 3 3 4 3 3 2 exponents k 1 and k 2 it follows from the analysis in section 3 1 that the exponent k 1 curvature of the middle part varies considerably with the local parameters while the variation of k 2 is rather mild therefore the use of a fixed exponent for the weibull distribution like in the bg2000 model for a variety of wave conditions seems inappropriate see also e g christou et al 2011 caires and van gent 2012 in the following we explore the effect of the local conditions on the determination of these exponents in terms of both the local relative wave intensity ϕ and the local shallowness χ fig 7 plots the variation of k 1 with the relative wave intensity ϕ m 0 d similar to the finding by battjes and groenendijk 2000 large scattering in k 1 values is observed for locations with small relative wave density particularly behind the surfzone wg4 wg6 however if the effect of the local shallowness χ is also accounted for in formulating k 1 expressed as k 1 χ a reasonably good agreement in the data representation can be obtained see fig 8 accordingly the expression for k 1 can be discriminated into two cases of low and high ϕ values respectively 13 k 1 χ 0 86 ϕ 0 10 k 1 χ 0 86 4 13 ϕ 0 10 0 10 ϕ 0 31 note that the boundary at ϕ 0 10 between the low and high relative wave intensity regions somewhat coincides with that noted in battjes and groenendijk 2000 it is emphasized that as shown in the following this boundary is consistently found in formulating all other model parameters and turns out to be essential for the parameterization of the 3wd the k 2 data plotted against each of ϕ and χ are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively again large scattering is seen for the region of low ϕ values ϕ 0 10 mostly broken waves behind the surfzone or with small χ values χ 3 5 in the region of high ϕ values ϕ 0 10 or relatively shallow water χ 3 5 the scattering is considerably reduced and k 2 tends to vary about a constant mean value 4 70 intuitively the number of k 2 data points are much less than those of k 1 due to the collapse of the 3wd in the area of low relative wave intensity as noticed earlier a closer inspection of the data also reveals that cases without k 2 all fall within the range of low ϕ values out of all the cases considered in this range corresponding with number of k 1 data points in fig 7 a vast number of cases 151 out of 253 cases are with k 2 undetermined in the range of low ϕ values k 2 values though determined are very close to those of k 1 implying that the third weibull part might not be necessary these arguments on the exponent k 2 suggest that the two weibull distribution is most appropriate i e k 2 is absent when ϕ 0 10 the exponent k 2 is thus determined as a constant for locations with high ϕ values only 14 k 2 4 70 ϕ 0 10 3 3 3 root mean square wave height h rms to fully determine the 3wd apart from the model parameters addressed so far the rms wave height h rms needs to be quantified in connection with the local spectral wave energy m 0 for this the ratio h rms m 0 plots against the relative wave intensity ϕ in fig 10 it is well known that due to wave nonlinearities in shallow water this ratio becomes higher than that of rayleigh waves in deep water see also discussions on effects of ig waves in section 5 this was also reported in battjes and groenendijk 2000 though a linearly proportional relation of h rms m 0 with ϕ starting from the lower boundary h rms m 0 2 69 stipulated by finite bandwidth waves in deep water herein the increase of h rms m 0 in shallow water on the reef flat is reaffirmed but a somewhat different trend is observed for low ϕ values ϕ 0 10 the ratio h rms m 0 varies about the same lower boundary of 2 69 for high ϕ values ϕ 0 10 it gradually increases with the increase of ϕ and approaches an upper limit of approximately 3 10 a least square fit of the experimental data results in the following formulations of h rms for low and high ϕ regions respectively 15 h r m s m 0 2 69 ϕ 0 10 h r m s m 0 2 69 0 37 tanh 34 2 ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 10 3 3 4 collapse of the 3wd and the practical upper limit of wave heights as shown in previous sections the model parameters k 1 k 2 and h mrs all switch their behaviours at almost the same critical value of the relative wave intensity ϕ particularly the exponent k 2 is undetermined at large for ϕ 0 10 these observations lend support to the assumption important for the model reliability that the 3wd collapses from a full three weibull distribution to a two weibull one when ϕ becomes sufficiently small overall the critical value of ϕ between the two regions of low and high ϕ values herein has been set at ϕ cr 0 10 as evidenced by the experimental data locations of low ϕ values on the reef flat are often well behind the surfzone where only broken and small non breaking waves remain it is possible to theoretically verify the chosen critical value ϕ cr since the third weibull of the 3wd co exists with the upper transitional wave height h tr the critical ϕ value can be derived in accordance with the criterion for the existence of h tr by definition the third weibull exists only if the largest wave height is not exceeded by h tr i e h tr h max see also fig 5 from eq 11 together with eq 12b this criterion can be worked out as follows 16 χ χ 3 33 a tanh 1 β or in terms of ϕ 17 ϕ m 0 d χ 2 4 cos α 2 s 0 m in which β h max h m0 χ is a critical value of χ s 0m 2 π h m 0 g t m 1 0 2 is the fictitious wave steepness in deep water the ratio h max h m0 is approximately equal to 1 80 based on the rayleigh distribution by longuet higgins 1952 in shallow water this ratio declines with the increase of wave breaking intensity in this study the relation between β and the shallowness factor χ obtained from the measurements on the reef flat is presented in fig 11 showing that from very shallow to relatively deeper water conditions the value of β on average varies from 1 50 to 2 0 typically β 1 50 is found representative for a wide range of shallow conditions χ 3 0 and is thus used for consideration herein the experimental data also show that s 0m is in the range between 0 030 and 0 055 at high ϕ values with β 1 50 χ 2 70 from eq 14 and the value range of s 0m substituted the criterion for the existence of the third weibull of the 3wd can eventually be deduced from eq 17 ϕ 0 06 0 10 this asserts that the critical value ϕ cr 0 10 is in fact appropriate as addressed in section 1 to improve the model predictive performance on largest wave heights the tail of the distribution should realistically be intercepted by an upper limit for wave heights in shallow water this upper limit is implicit in the 3wd but can be evaluated through assessing the maximum wave height predicted by the model largest wave heights in case the 3wd collapses are generally smaller than those when all three weibull parts exist it is therefore sufficient to consider the maximum wave height in the latter case it follows from the third weibull in eq 3 18 h max h 2 ln n 1 k 2 1 54 where h max is the maximum wave height in n considered waves for the evaluation of h max n is often taken as 1000 waves under laboratory conditions h max h 0 1 though sometime can be up to several thousands of waves however owing to the large exponent k 2 the ratio h max h 2 is relatively insensitive to n i e h max h 2 1 51 1 54 with n 1000 2000 herein for considering the practical upper limit n 2000 is taken on the conservative side giving the value of 1 54 on the right hand side of eq 18 it appears from the relation h 2 h m0 ϕ shown in fig 12 that the ratio h 2 h m0 is approximately unity with a maximum deviation of about 0 20 at ϕ 0 13 i e h 2 h m0 1 0 0 2 hence the practical upper limit of wave heights h ul expressed in terms of h m0 can be derived from eq 18 19 h max h u l 1 3 1 9 h m 0 the upper limit of wave heights h ul specified in eq 19 lies within the range of maximum wave height in shallow water see also fig 11 whereby largest wave heights predicted by the 3wd are realistically intercepted 3 3 5 summary of calculation steps given all necessary local inputs i e m 0 t m 1 0 d and tanα the following steps are taken for establishing the 3wd and then determining characteristic wave heights at a considered location on the reef flat 1 calculation of the relative wave intensity ϕ and checking the collapse of the 3wd if ϕ 0 10 only two weibull parts exist continue with step 3 if ϕ 0 10 all three weibull parts exists continue with step 2 2 calculation of transitional wave heights h tr 0 and h tr the lower transitional wave height h tr 0 0 35 d the upper transitional wave height h tr the shallowness parameter χ is calculated according to eq 11 the upper transitional wave height h tr is determined according to eq 12 3 determination of the exponents k 1 k 2 the exponent k 1 is calculated according to eq 13 the exponent k 2 is determined only if ϕ 0 10 k 2 4 70 eq 14 4 establishment of the 3wd the rms wave height h rms is calculated according to eq 15 it then follows by the determination of scale wave heights h h 1 and h 2 if ϕ 0 10 eqs 7 and 10 are numerically solved for h and h 1 if ϕ 0 10 eqs 7 9 are numerically solved for h h 1 and h 2 the 3wd is fully established through the system of equation 3 whereby any arbitrary characteristic wave heights such as h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 h 0 1 etc can be calculated 4 model comparison and validation 4 1 model comparison with data of characteristic wave heights the model parameters of the 3wd have been formulated based on overall agreements with all individual wave heights from the measured wave records still it is necessary to examine the model predictive performance on most common characteristic wave heights for this comparisons of wave heights h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 and h 0 1 between the data from all 540 measured records and those predicted by the 3wd and the bg2000 model are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively as hinted at in subsection 3 1 on the bed slope effect see also fig 4 the local bed slope as input to the bg2000 model is specified as the fore reef slope for locations within the reef edge surfzone and as 1 250 for those behind this boundary bg2000 is not valid for flat bottoms the goodness of the model predictions is evaluated through the relative mean square error ε 20 ε i 1 n p 1 h mod e l i h l a b i 2 n p in which h model and h lab denote wave heights predicted by the model and from the measurements respectively n p is the number of data points overall all characteristic wave heights are well predicted by the 3wd small errors ε 6 11 in particular the estimates of average based wave heights h 1 3 and h 1 10 are slightly better than those of extreme exceedance probabilities h 1 and h 0 1 as expected the bg2000 generally overestimates all considered characteristic wave heights i e data points largely stay above the straight line denoting the equivalence between model predictions and measurements in which the predictions of extreme wave heights h 1 and h 0 1 are particularly worse ε 18 3 and 29 0 respectively 4 2 model validation the 3wd are validated against two existing laboratory datasets as outlined in table 2 which include wave transmission across wide crested sandbanks by tuan and san 2018 and wave propagation on a shallow mangrove foreshore by anh 2018 the aims of these experiments were originally different however these are considered suitable for model validations herein because of the resemblance in wave breaking conditions induced by the abrupt depth transition in the first case the model sandbank of 0 25 m in height and 5 0 m in crest width b was placed on a foreshore as illustrated in fig 15 a the seaward slope of the bank was 1 5 initially and became on average 1 8 to 1 20 after testing each of the test cases lasted for approximately 3000 waves the deformation of the bank profile was mainly observed on the seaward slope and quickly evolved toward an equilibrium state just after the first 1000 waves herein wave parameters are therefore based on the last 1000 waves only over which the bank profile change is negligibly small to further suppress the effect of local bed changes only the station wg5 at the middle of the bank is selected for consideration the measured individual wave heights together with the corresponding distribution graphs by both the 3wd and the bg2000 model for four different test cases are shown in fig 16 it follows that the 3wd agrees well with the measurements in all test cases with the fore reef slope ranging from steep to relatively gentle which also affirms that the 3wd is rather insensitive to the change of the fore reef slope on the contrary the predictions by the bg2000 model appears rather sensitive to the change of the local bed slope and are satisfactory in the case of gentle fore reef slope only tanα 1 15 and 1 20 fig 16b and d in a similar setting but without the sandbank anh 2018 carried out a series of experiments on wave transmission across a mangrove forest to create wave breaking on a relatively flat foreshore the same foreshore as used in the previous case a transitional slope of 1 25 was introduced see fig 15b in fact the bed topography turns out to resemble that of a shallow fringing reef herein only the measurements at the location wg4 close to the reef edge to minimize possible effects of wave setup in the case without mangroves are considered the predictions of common characteristic wave heights h 1 3 h 1 10 h 1 and h n as n 1000 the largest wave height in n waves h n is considered instead of h 0 1 by both the 3wd and the bg2000 model in comparison with the measured data are shown in fig 17 the relative mean square errors by both models are also given ε 3wd and ε bg correspond to the errors by 3wd and the bg 2000 respectively there is general agreement by both models but in detail the 3wd under predicts and the bg2000 model over predicts the measured wave heights systematically these discrepancies in part can be attributed to the different wave hydrodynamics on the fringing reef with the enhancement of wave setup and particularly potential resonant amplification of standing ig waves see also section 5 overall the predictive performance by the bg2000 model is slightly better say about 6 more accurate in this case this is logical since the fore reef slope of 1 25 is sufficiently mild as a beach slope on which the bg2000 model but not the 3wd is most appropriate 5 discussion ig waves have been realized as one of the important hydrodynamic features on steep reef environments as they are considerably enhanced relative to open gentle beaches as a result the presence of ig waves may play a role in altering the statistical properties of wave heights on the reef flat suggesting the need for a more appropriate wave height distribution model as proposed in the present study in this section we look at the relevant characteristics of ig wave dynamics on platform reefs as observed from the experiments and subsequently address its possible effects on the distribution of wave heights for this it is also concerned with wave reflection because of its important connection with reef wave heights in general and with the dynamics of ig waves in particular it is worth mentioning that reflection and ig waves are inherent to steep reefs and their effects have implicitly been incorporated in the formulations of wave height distribution model addressed in the previous sections 5 1 effects of wave reflection in addition to modifying total wave heights reflection of out going ig waves at the seaward reef edge can entrap wave energy leading to potential resonant amplification of standing ig waves on the reef flat nwogu and demirbilek 2010 pomeroy et al 2012 buckley et al 2018 in the present experiments wave reflection can occur at the fore reef slope as well as at the riprap slope behind the reef with reference to a platform reef in the field reflection due to the fore reef slope is an intrinsic manner whilst that due to the riprap slope is considered as laboratory effects though without the back reef slope waves are still reflected due to a rapid change in wave celerity when leaving from the reef flat to a deeper region for the evaluation of the effect of wave reflection on wave heights it is presumed that linear wave theory is still adequate for describing the across shore energy flux of progressive waves over the reef flat see e g pomeroy et al 2012 yao et al 2013 buckley et al 2018 also because the reef surface in this study is smooth the effect of bottom friction can be ignored the conservation equation of wave energy within a cell between an offshore point and a point on the reef flat is according to 21 e 0 1 k r 0 2 c g 0 e i 1 k r i 2 c g i d b where e 1 8ρgh 2 rsm is the wave energy density c g is the group velocity ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity d b is the time averaged wave energy dissipation due to breaking within the considered section k r is the bulk reflection coefficient the subscripts 0 and i denote quantities evaluated at locations offshore and on the reef flat respectively note that reflection measured at a location on the reef flat k r i is mainly from the back reef slope whilst that measured at the offshore location k r 0 is from both the back reef and the fore reef slopes the energy dissipated by breaking d b can be expressed in terms of local parameters wave and water depth according to a random wave breaking model such as by battjes and janssen 1978 or thornton guza 1983 hence eq 18 is further worked out with the expressions of e and d b substituted 22 1 8 ρ g h r m s 0 2 1 k r 0 2 c g 0 1 8 ρ g h r m s i 2 1 k r i 2 c g i 1 8 ρ g a b f p q b h r m s i 2 where f p is a representative peak wave frequency q b is the breaking fraction and a b is an intermediate model parameter subsequently the rms wave height incorporating the effect of wave reflection for a location on the reef flat reads 23 h r m s i 1 k r 0 2 c g 0 1 k r i 2 c g i a b f p q b h r m s 0 the effect of wave reflection is further clarified through the ratio of the rms wave height according to eq 20 to the one determined without reflection effects i e k r 0 0 k r i 0 24 δ r 1 k r 0 2 c g i a b f p q b 1 k r i 2 c g i a b f p q b 25 δ r max 1 k r 0 2 where δ r 1 0 is the wave height reduction factor due to reflection the reduction is largest i e δ r δ r max when either reflection from the back reef slope is minimal k 2 r i 0 or the contributing effect from reflection is negligibly small compared to that from wave breaking i e k r i 2 c g i a b f p q b wave reflection at a location on the reef flat can be evaluated with the incoming and outgoing shore normal energy fluxes determined from co located spectra measured at that location sheremet et al 2002 unfortunately synchronous velocity measurements at the wave gauge locations were not available therefore reflection analysis is possible herein with the three gauge array at the horizontal deep section only reflection coefficients at frequencies of interest are determined according to zelt and skjelbreia 1992 a generalised least squares method of mansard and funke 1980 for an arbitrary number of wave gauges see also section 2 wave spectra were split at half of the peak spectral frequency in each of the wave cases f p 2 see table 1 for the determination of short period sea swell waves ss f f p 2 and ig waves 0 025 f f p 2 note that eq 18 and subsequently eqs 20 and 21 are valid for total wave heights with bulk reflection coefficients only integrated over the full relevant frequency range including both ss and ig bands their use solely for either ss waves or ig waves may induce significant errors because of possible nonlinear energy transfers amongst different frequencies see e g henderson et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2012 herein bulk reflection coefficients are used in eqs 21 and 22 for assessing the overall effect of wave reflection on the rms wave height and thus on the wave height distribution reflection of ig waves is more relevant for addressing the dynamics of ig waves and its subsequent influences see section 5 2 fig 18 presents variations of the reflection coefficient measured at the offshore location with the relative reef flat submergence d h m0 0 with h m0 0 being the incoming offshore wave height for the total waves bulk coefficient k r short period waves k r ss and ig waves k r ig respectively it appears that both the bulk reflection coefficient and the reflection coefficient of ss waves are relatively small k r k r ss 0 07 0 19 and both clearly increase with decreasing relative reef flat submergence reflection from the riprap slope can be examined when the relative reef flat submergence d h m0 0 is sufficiently large such that the effect of the fore reef slope is minimal it can be seen from fig 18 that when d h m0 0 2 70 the bulk reflection coefficient becomes very small k r 0 07 which is largely due to the riprap slope alone conversely highest reflection occurs at low water levels i e k r 0 19 when d h m0 0 1 5 and is mostly generated on the fore reef slope as expected highest reflection is observed for ig waves with k r ig varying in the range from 0 40 to 0 70 no clear dependence of ig waves reflection on the relative reef flat submergence is observed with the highest reflection coefficient measured at the offshore boundary k r 0 0 19 fig 18 and given a minimal reflection from the back reef slope k r i 0 the largest reduction of the rms wave height can be estimated according to eq 22 which is only about 2 0 δ r max 0 98 this is within the measurement error for wave heights therefore the effect of wave reflection on the rms wave height and consequently on the distribution of wave heights in the present study is negligible 5 2 effects of infra gravity waves at first wave reflection is also important to the dynamics of ig waves at the deep offshore section the incoming ig wave height is very small since ig waves are mostly generated inside the surfzone whilst the outgoing ig wave height is relatively large hence the reflection coefficient of ig waves at this location is highest over the entire reef flat see also buckley et al 2018 in other words the reflection coefficients of ig waves at a specific location on the reef flat would not exceed 0 70 or k r ig 2 0 50 see also fig 18 implying that ig waves are predominantly shoreward progressive throughout the reef flat as a consequence partial standing or standing ig waves could not exist and resonant amplification of ig waves on the reef flat did not occur without loss of generality fig 19 presents variations of the spectral wave height of ss h m0 ss and ig h m0 ig waves at various locations across the reef for two representative cases of lowest and highest water depths on the reef flat under the same high offshore incident wave fore reef slope tanα 1 5 water depth d 0 15 m and 0 40 m offshore wave h m0 0 0 20 m and t p 1 80s in both cases the ss wave height h m0 ss substantially reduces due to depth induced breaking around the reef edge and gradually decreases behind the surfzone however ss waves are still the major component in the total wave energy across the reef flat because of moderate breaking conditions associated with a relative large reef flat submerged depth considered in this study d h m0 0 0 67 3 46 see also table 1 the ig wave height h m0 ig initially peaks in the surfzone around the reef edge and subsequently decays over the remaining part of the reef at a much slower rate than ss waves for example due to ig energy transfer back to higher frequencies see also henderson et al 2006 although with a very small proportion in the total wave height in deep water the relative importance of ig waves becomes more significant as waves propagates over the reef flat particularly for the case of low water level for the case of small water depth in fig 19a the ratio h m0 ig h m0 ss increases from 0 12 in deep water to 0 31 around the reef edge and reaches the maximum value of 0 34 at a location on the inner reef flat these corresponding values are 0 12 0 14 and 0 18 for the case of large water depth in fig 19b overall the characteristics of ig waves transformation over the reef as observed from the present experiments agree well with the preceding laboratory works such as by nwogu and demirbilek 2010 and buckley et al 2018 however herein the ig wave height is considerably smaller than the ss wave height and the wave hydrodynamics across the reef also because of no potential ig wave resonance is overwhelmingly dominated by ss waves the existing models of the wave height distribution on shallow beaches glukhovskiy 1966 klopman 1996 battjes and groenendijk 2000 mainly focus on the deviation of extreme highest waves in the tail of the distribution ascribed to effects of depth induced wave breaking possible departure of the statistical properties of lower wave heights however is unclear or ignored albeit these waves are most related to effects that are enhanced in shallow water such as nonlinearities and finite spectral bandwidth as shown earlier the proportion of ig waves in the total wave energy becomes more significant on the reef flat implying that wave nonlinearities may cause the distribution of lower waves to differ significantly from the rayleigh one the evidence can be seen from the analysis in section 3 figss 2 4 that the middle part of the distribution with intermediate wave heights including ig waves evolves markedly with the local conditions effects of ig waves are therefore most exhibited in the mid part of the distribution i e the second weibull part in the present study as noted in subsection 3 3 that the ratio h rms m 0 gets higher as waves become more nonlinear in shallow water herein effects of ig waves can therefore be interpreted via their nonlinearities causing the increase of the ratio h rms m 0 with increasing relative wave intensity ϕ on the reef flat eq 13 and fig 10 which consequently tends to increase the heights of intermediate waves in the middle part of the distribution see fig 2a c overall the effect of ig waves has also been accounted for in the 3wd through the use of the characteristic spectral period t m 1 0 in the model parameterization see subsection 3 3 finally it is worthwhile to mention about the applicability range of the 3wd presented in this study the derived model parameters are valid for hydraulic conditions satisfying the range of tested conditions as follows m 0 d 0 06 0 26 d l 0m 0 01 0 19 d h m0 0 0 67 3 46 also albeit the model parameterization is based on tested cases with two steep fore reef slopes only tanα 1 5 and 1 10 it is evidenced from the above model validations that the validity of the 3wd goes beyond this slope limit and is still reliable for fore reef slopes as mild as 1 20 the 3wd has been formulated with the laboratory wave data on platform reefs with the dominance of sea swell short period waves to what extent the new distribution model can be applied to fringing reefs particularly at locations with the dominance of ig waves due to resonant amplification has not been investigated 6 conclusions the present paper is concerned with a laboratory study on the distribution of wave heights on steep platform reefs it is experimentally shown that existing models incorporating the effect of wave breaking on a shallow beach fail to reliably describe the wave height distribution on the shallow reef flat this is due to the fact that wave breaking and nonlinearity induced by sudden depth reduction over a steep fore reef slope might differ substantially from those induced by gradual depth variation on a gently sloping shallow beach in addition to the local relative wave intensity the wave height distribution is found to complexly depend on the reef flat shallowness and on the fore reef slope a new composite distribution which extends the approach by battjes and groenendijk 2000 is therefore proposed the new model is generally composed out of three weibull parts and collapses to a two weibull one when the relative wave intensity drops below a critical level the model parameters are formulated as functions of the local input parameters through least square fitting all individual wave heights from 540 measured wave records at various locations across the reef flat the experimental data on most common characteristics wave heights and the model predictions are found in very good agreement the model is validated against two existing laboratory datasets of wave heights on reefs with various fore reef slopes showing that good model predictive capacity is found for fore reef slopes steeper than 1 20 further studies on model validations against field datasets and on effects of various reef morphology are recommended 
22527,a two dimensional simulation of the laminar flow past a circular cylinder is investigated in this study to control the boundary layer growth a pair of moving surfaces with streamwise positive motion is mounted on different locations of the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder the effects of the surface locations on the power and drag coefficients and the vortex shedding state are

equations using a pressure velocity coupling method to integrate the momentum equations a four stage runge kutta scheme with second order accuracy in time and space is used some results are compared with previous experimental and numerical data the results from this study indicate that the moving surfaces can eliminate the vortex shedding so that the flow achieves a steady state for the above

applications also it is able to reveal some aspects of fluid dynamics such as fluid physics and flow patterns in such a simple geometry numerical simulations are widely used to simulate the flow around the cylinder due to their capabilities that provide the details of the flow characteristics many numerical studies have been done on the flow around the circular on the other hand control of flow around bodies has been focused due to its importance to optimize the power requirements of system motion and minimize the costs vortex shedding elimination is one of the applications of the flow control which can lead to the reduction of hydro aerodynamic forces and vibrations of bluff bodies this issue has various applications such as offshore and coastal pipelines piers and bridges control of vortex shedding has been studied in numerous research studies with different approaches such as co flow jet vortex generator synthetic jet actuator blowing surface roughness and moving surface mittal 2001 one of the earliest experiments on flow control by a moving wall for boundary layer control was carried out by favre 1938 he used an airfoil with the upper surface formed by a belt moving over two rollers and succeeded to delay separation until the angle of attack reached 55 zdravkovich 1981 compared the effects of some flow control means such as surface protrusions shrouds and near wake stabilizers modi et al 1981 1991 1992 established a wind tunnel test program involving a family of airfoils such as naca 63 218 and joukowsky with rotating cylinders as the moving surfaces their investigations indicated that the leading edge rotating cylinder with positive motion could increase the maximum lift force and led to a delay in the stall angle of attack by 2 73 and 48 respectively strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 studied the flow around a circular cylinder by the proper placement of a control cylinder close to the main cylinder and could control its vortex shedding at a range of reynolds number between 40 and 100 furthermore al garni et al 2000 used a leading edge rotating cylinder with positive motion as a moving surface on a naca 0024 airfoil and could increase the lift coefficient from 0 85 to 1 63 and delay the stall angle of attack by about 160 moreover the flow past a cylinder with two rotating control cylinders was numerically studied by mittal 2001 he investigated the effect of the gap between the main and control cylinders and found that the gap is an important parameter in obtaining the optimal performance of the flow control system modi 1997 also presented a review article about moving surface boundary layer control msbc on the airfoils and compared the effects of the different positions of the rotating elements used to inject the momentum the flow control issue involves optimization with either flow tracking or drag minimization as its objective functions however the solution of a constrained minimization problem when the unsteady navier stokes equations are being solved is not computationally possible therefore a number of optimal flow control techniques were developed gad el hak 1996 abergel and temam 1990 medjo et al 2008 homescu et al 2002 patnaik and wei 2002 studied on the vortex shedding suppression behind a d shaped cylinder with an angular momentum injection scheme to synchronize the vertical velocity field a research about the suppression of the circular cylinder wakes by two simple rotary type mechanical actuators was also performed by muddada and patnaik 2010 for re 100 300 jahanmiri 2010 presented a review article about modern active flow control methods which are used extremely to achieve transition delay drag reduction lift enhancement turbulence management separation postponement and noise suppression sahu and patnaik 2011 used a rotating element embedded at the leading edge of naca 0012 airfoil to inject the momentum into the wake region two different techniques to control and suppress the laminar vortex shedding around bluff bodies were presented by chan 2012 1 a passive control using a thin splitter plate positioned downstream of the bluff body 2 an active control by way of counter rotating a cylinder pair shukla and arakeri 2013 reduced the drag force acting on the cylinder by minimizing the net power consumption using a combination of theoretical and numerical techniques for a range of reynolds number from 1 to 300 reddy et al 2013 analytically investigated the flow past a circular cylinder in the presence of two counter rotating control cylinders they obtained an appropriate position and optimal circulation strength for the control cylinders moreover an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control scheme was applied by hasheminejad et al 2015 to suppress the two dimensional vortex induced vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder at low reynolds numbers hsu et al 2013 suppressed the vortex shedding of a circular cylinder by a small control rod in low reynolds numbers saha and shrivastava 2015 studied the flow past a square cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 and suppressed the vortex shedding using a blowing mechanism chen et al 2014 also used a traveling wave wall to suppress the unsteady vortex shedding from a circular cylinder salimipour 2019 investigated the mixed convection effects on the flow and heat transfer characteristics from a horizontal cylinder he found that the buoyancy effects could eliminate the vortex shedding with lowest drag coefficient and energy consumption in the present paper laminar flow control around a circular cylinder using moving surfaces is numerically studied for 60 re 180 none of the previous research studies have obtained the optimum location of the moving surfaces which causes the minimization of the power requirement of the cylinder motion for a moving surface the relative motion between the surface and the free stream is minimized thus the growth of the boundary layer is prevented in addition the surface motion injects additional momentum into the boundary layer gad el hak and bushnell 1991 the present study focuses on the following objectives numerical simulation and validation of the flow past a circular cylinder use of msbc concept to control the flow around the cylinder investigation of the effects of the surface locations on the drag and power coefficients and the vortex shedding state at various surface speeds minimization of the power requirement for the cylinder translation obtaining the optimum location and speed of the surfaces corresponding to the minimum power coefficient elimination of the vortex shedding in the wake of the cylinder at the minimum surface speed to mount the moving surfaces on the cylinder two symmetric belt like surfaces with downstream motion performed by a pulley drive system can be used as shown in fig 1 u s ϕ and θ s represent the moving surface speed surface angle and location angle of the moving surface respectively to achieve the above mentioned objectives the navier stokes equations are solved on a two dimensional unsteady incompressible and laminar flow using an in house computer program several code validation studies are first presented including some cases of average values and also time histories of the drag coefficient 2 mathematical and numerical formulation in this section the numerical procedure used to compute the unsteady viscous and incompressible flow is briefly described the two dimensional differential formulations for mass and momentum conservation in non dimensional form are expressed as follows 1 ρ u x ρ v y 0 2 ρ u τ j u x x j u y y s u p x 3 ρ v τ j v x x j v y y s v p y where ρ is the fluid density s u and s v are the source terms p denotes the static pressure and j u x j u y j v x and j v y are the sum of convection and diffusion fluxes defined as follows 4 j u x ρ u u 1 r e u x j u y ρ u v 1 r e u y j v x ρ u v 1 r e v x j v y ρ v v 1 r e v y the lengths of the above mentioned equations are normalized with the cylinder diameter d flow velocities with the free stream velocity u physical time τ with d u and pressure p with ρu 2 the governing equations 1 and 2 are solved in a general curvilinear coordinate system using a cell vertex control volume scheme presented in fig 2 in order to solve the flow equations 1 3 numerically a pressure based method is utilized which is called rk simpler and developed by rajagopalan and lestari 2016 a four stage explicit runge kutta procedure with second order temporal accuracy using the crank nicholson scheme is utilized for integrating the momentum equations 2 and 3 this new scheme provides an exact equation for the pressure field which is the only nonlinear equation solved iteratively in the procedure moreover no corrections are needed for the velocity or the pressure field therefore the approximate pressure correction equation does not need to be solved more descriptions of the method are presented in ref rajagopalan and lestari 2016 in the present study the implicit pressure equation is solved by the strongly implicit procedure sip proposed by stone 1968 this iterative method is a more advanced version of the incomplete lower upper lu scheme but it is only applicable to the equations resulting from a finite volume discretization for the system of linear equations ax b the approximate lower upper decomposition of the coefficients matrix a is expressed as follow 5 m l u a n where n denotes the error between the approximate and exact factorizations matrix a is five diagonal for a two dimensional flow the system of equations a x b can be solved iteratively for each iteration k which is written as follows 6 r k 1 b a x k 1 7 l y r k 1 u z y 8 x k x k 1 z the iterative procedure continues until the error matrix n be set such that nx 0 the sip scheme is much faster than the incomplete lower upper ilu and incomplete cholesky ic methods stone 1968 to discretize the convective terms of the momentum equations a second order upwind scheme is used and the viscous terms are discretized by use of the central scheme the step by step levels for the present numerical simulations is expressed as follows specify an initial guess for flow velocity solve the pressure equation using equation 6 8 solve the momentum equations by use of the four stage runge kutta algorithm advance to the next time level by solving the above mentioned equations the required flow parameters such as pressure and velocity components are computed and then the streamlines and the drag power and skin friction coefficients can be obtained these coefficients are defined as follows 9 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 d 10 c d m s f d m s 1 2 ρ u 2 d 11 c p f d u f d m s u s 1 2 ρ u 3 d c d k c d m s 12 c f τ s 1 2 ρ u 2 where c d c d m s c p and c f represents the cylinder drag pressure and frictional moving surface drag frictional total power and skin friction coefficients respectively f d and f d m s denotes the drag force of cylinder and moving surface respectively k u s u defines the ratio of the surface speed to free stream velocity and τ s represents the shear stress of the moving surface f d m s is computed by integration of τ s on the surface 3 grid generation and boundary conditions to numerically solve the above equations a computational domain is required depending on the geometry different meshing schemes may be used in the present study a combined o c mesh is used to simulate the flow characteristics which was also used in ref teymourtash and salimipour 2017 fig 3 depicts a view of the above mentioned grid the o region leads to generating an orthogonal mesh near the wall boundary the thickness of this region is about equal to the cylinder diameter the c region is appropriate for capturing the vortex shedding behind the cylinder according to the grid a velocity inlet boundary a pressure outlet boundary and an inner solid boundary cylinder surface are needed as shown in fig 4 on the solid boundary the velocity components are equal to the components of the cylinder speed according to the no slip flow condition the contravariant velocity v is set to zero moreover the normal gradient of the pressure is equal to zero 4 results and discussions 4 1 grid resolution study to implement the numerical procedure of the above mentioned formulations a study on the independence of the computational grid must be performed in the current study the effects of vortex shedding may be transferred to a large distance toward the flow downstream thus an appropriate computational domain is required in this regard several grids with various lengths to diameter ratios l d see fig 4 and different cell numbers n are investigated the ratio of n and l d is adjusted so that the grid resolution remains constant the ratio of height to length is constant as h l 0 5 fig 5 shows the variations of the average drag coefficient and strouhal number s t f d u with values at the peak mean and bottom of the oscillation curve for 20 l d 90 corresponded to 6000 n 36000 at re 180 θ s 70 ϕ 10 and the ratio of the surface speed to free stream velocity k u s u 1 it can be seen that for l d 50 corresponding to n 25000 the results have not changed a comparison between the results at l d 50 and n 32000 as shown in fig 5 also indicates that as the cell numbers increases the results remain unchanged the normal distance of the near wall cells is equal to 0 0025 times the diameter of the cylinder according to salimipour and anbarsooz 2019 they used this distance for the simulation of the laminar flow past a rotating cylinder for a reynolds number range from 40 to 200 eventually a grid with l d 50 and n 32000 is selected to implement the calculations of the current study 4 2 code validation study before using the present solver for analysis of the viscous flow past the cylinder with moving surfaces the validity of the solver has been examined first the flow past a circular cylinder with re 60 100 140 and 180 is simulated and compared with the previous studies table 1 presents the average drag coefficients of the cylinder and its excellent agreement with previous numerical results from henderson 1995 marella et al 2005 and mittal et al 2008 for averaging each unsteady quantity eight cycles of the vortex shedding region is used furthermore the variation of the drag coefficient of a cylinder with respect to the non dimensional time τ tu d at re 300 is shown in fig 6 the result from the computations of mittal et al 2008 is shown in the same plot again the two results are in a good agreement it is necessary to mention that at this reynolds number the flow is intrinsically three dimensional mittal et al 2008 hence this case is studied just to validate the present solver in order to investigate the present code validity for the moving surface problems the average drag coefficients c d on the rotating cylinder is obtained and compared with numerical results from mittal and kumar 2003 fig 7 shows these comparisons for 0 k 4 and re 200 the results show excellent agreement this figure has also been presented in ref teymourtash and salimipour 2017 the above comparisons confirm the accuracy of the present solver therefore it can be reliable for simulations of the present research study 4 3 effects of moving surface on the flow field as previously stated the moving surface can prevent the growth of the boundary layer to address this issue the flow past a circular cylinder with two symmetric moving surfaces with the surface angle of ϕ 10 and the location angle of θ s 70 is studied fig 8 shows the variations of the instantaneous velocity magnitude v u 2 v 2 against the non dimensional radial distance from the cylinder surface r d in a near wall section at surface angle of θ 82 in front of the moving surface k 0 and 1 and re 60 and 140 it is seen that the moving surface decreases the boundary layer thickness this figure also indicates that the changes for re 140 are less than for re 60 because by increasing the reynolds number the momentum effects are reinforced against the viscous effects moreover fig 8 depicts the thickness of the near wall cells which is very smaller than the boundary layer thickness the shrinkage of the wake region due to the moving surface can be observed in the contours of the instantaneous velocity magnitude as shown in fig 9 this says that the size of the vortices behind the cylinder is reduced a moving surface controls the boundary layer growth by affecting the shear stress which depends on the reynolds number the effects of the surface speed on the skin friction coefficient of the moving surface c f are shown in fig 10 as a contract the shear stress toward the flow downstream is assumed to be positive and vice versa it can be seen that by increasing the speed ratio the skin friction is increased this figure also indicates that the shear stresses and accordingly the frictional drag forces on the moving surfaces are decreased with increasing the reynolds number in order to illustrate the effect of moving surface on the flow oscillation due to the vortex shedding the time history of the lift coefficient on the cylinder can be useful fig 11 compares it between k 0 and 1 and re 60 and 140 at θ s 70 as can be seen the moving surface reduces the amplitude of the lift oscillations compared to the baseline cylinder k 0 it is also observed that at re 140 the vortex shedding has begun in less time than that of re 60 because the flow at higher reynolds numbers accompanies with the higher fluctuations 4 4 effects of moving surface on separation angle one of the important characteristics of the flow past a cylinder is the flow separation angle due to the effect of the moving surface on the boundary layer this angle can be a function of the location and speed of the surface to study this issue the variations of the separation angle α with respect to the location angle and speed ratio of the moving surfaces for re 60 and 140 are shown in fig 12 a b respectively at re 60 fig 12a except for θ s 30 by increasing the location angle θ s the separation angle is increased because the proper space for separation behind the cylinder and in the downstream of the moving surface is increased while increase in the speed ratio causes the decrease in the separation angle due to the more momentum injection this additional momentum confronts the adverse pressure gradient and causes the separation point to move downstream at θ s 30 a different behavior is observed at this location in the low speed ratios the separation angle is greater than the other cases because the flow is separated at the upper region of the cylinder and upstream of the moving surface as shown in fig 13 a while at θ s 40 fig 13b the separation occurs in the downstream of the moving surface at re 140 fig 12b for two cases of θ s 30 and 40 the separation angle is high and almost independent of the speed ratio because the separation occurs in the upstream of the moving surface however the moving surface is unable to control its upstream separation therefore the speed ratio does not affect the separation angle for θ s 30 and 40 the other cases are similar to the results for re 60 4 5 effects of moving surface on drag and power coefficients one of the aims of this study is to minimize the power requirement of the cylinder which causes the drag reduction therefore it is necessary to investigate the locations and speeds of the surfaces to study the effects of the moving surface on the drag and power coefficients the flows with the reynolds numbers from 60 to 180 cross over a cylinder with various moving surface speeds then the values and the trend of variations of the drag and power coefficients on the cylinder are discussed a constant moving surface angle ϕ 10 is used for these investigations fig 14 a 14d show the total average power coefficients c p with respect to the speed ratio for re 60 100 140 and 180 respectively in all the cases θ s 70 is the best location of the moving surface which cause the power coefficient to be minimized it should be emphasized that this conclusion is just valid based on the six calucated cases θ 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 it can also be seen in all the curves that by increasing the speed ratio the power coefficient is reduced because the boundary layer and wake region are shrunk however the excessive increase in the speed ratio causes the increase in the power coefficient because of the increase in frictional force of the surfaces so for each reynolds number there is an optimum speed ratio and a location angle which leads to minimizing the power coefficient table 2 presents the location angles speed ratios and average drag coefficients c d corresponding to the minimum average power coefficients c p m i n for re 60 180 it is observed that as the reynolds number increases the minimum average power coefficient is obtained at the higher speed ratios however its value is decreased with increase in the speed ratio and reynolds number in fact at the higher reynolds numbers the less power coefficient is consumed fig 15 shows the comparison of the baseline without moving surface and optimum average drag coefficients with respect to the reynolds number good drag reductions are obtained these amount to around 10 20 22 and 28 under the optimum conditions against the baseline cylinder for re 60 100 140 and 180 respectively in fact the moving surfaces shrink the separated flow region behind the cylinder causing the decrease in the pressure difference between the front side and back side of the cylinder as a result the drag force is reduces moreover it can be seen that by increasing the reynolds number the average drag coefficient is reduced and its percentage improvement is increased because with increase in the reynolds number the shear stresses and consequently the frictional drag on the surfaces are reduced the instantaneous streamlines presented in fig 16 show the effect of the moving surfaces on the vortex shedding behind the cylinder at re 180 under the optimum conditions as reported in table 2 as can be expected the vortex shedding regions and the amplitude of the flow oscillations have become smaller than that of the baseline cylinder furthermore fig 17 compares the contours of vorticity at re 180 between the optimum conditions and the baseline cylinder a smoother and smaller wake is observed at the optimum state 4 6 vortex shedding elimination using moving surface as previously observed the moving surfaces can control the wake growth behind the cylinder however the question is whether these surfaces can eliminate the vortex shedding by increasing the size of the vortices behind the cylinder their stability may decreases as a result the vortices start to shed individually the moving surfaces can prevent the vortex growth by injecting the additional momentum into the boundary layer consequently the moving surfaces can eliminate the vortex shedding to clarify this issue the parameters are set in a way that they lead to a steady state flow some moving surfaces with the different speed ratios may cause the elimination of the vortex shedding however the aim is to reach the steady flow with minimum power consumption table 3 presents the optimum parameters which lead to eliminating the vortex shedding for re 60 180 it can be observed that the location angle θ s is unchanged and the speed ratio k increases as the reynolds number increases because by the smaller values of k the steady flow could not be achieved in fact the larger reynolds numbers need the faster moving surfaces the comparison of the power coefficients with the minimum power coefficients presented in table 2 indicates that the vortex shedding elimination needs the more power requirement the non oscillatory behavior of the lift coefficients shown in fig 18 indicate that the flow reaches the steady and without vortex shedding conditions the streamlines past the cylinder with the above mentioned conditions are also shown in fig 19 for re 60 180 two symmetric vortices are fixed behind the cylinder in each reynolds number as the reynolds number increases the vortices become smaller 5 conclusions in the present study the unsteady viscous and incompressible flow around a circular cylinder was simulated some moving surfaces were used to control the wake and boundary layer growth and to suppress the vortex shedding on the cylinder a pressure velocity coupling method was used to solve the flow equations the results showed that the moving surfaces could decrease the boundary layer thickness and shrink the wake region behind the cylinder increase in the reynolds number caused the decrease in the surfaces effects in addition by increasing the speed ratio the skin friction was increased moreover as the location angle increased the separation angle was increased while increase in the speed ratio caused the decrease in the separation angle furthermore it is found that by increasing the speed ratio the power coefficient was reduced because the boundary layer and wake region were shrunk however the excessive increase in the speed ratio caused the increase in the power coefficient because of the increase in frictional force of the moving surfaces for each reynolds number there was an optimum speed ratio and a location angle which led to minimizing the power coefficient a good drag reduction was also obtained under the optimum conditions against the baseline cylinder for re 60 180 as the reynolds number increased the average drag coefficient was decreased and its percentage improvement was increased the results also indicated that the moving surfaces decreased the vortex shedding region and the amplitude of the flow

separation angle mean value superscript free stream subscript 1 introduction one of important subject in engineering is the flow past circular cylinders because it is utilized in many engineering applications also it is able to reveal some aspects of fluid dynamics such as fluid physics and flow patterns in such a simple geometry numerical simulations are widely used to simulate the flow around the cylinder due to their capabilities that provide the details of the flow characteristics many numerical studies have been done on the flow around the circular on the other hand control of flow around bodies has been focused due to its importance to optimize the power requirements of system motion and minimize the costs vortex shedding elimination is one of the applications of the flow control which can lead to the reduction of hydro aerodynamic forces and vibrations of bluff bodies this issue has various applications such as offshore and coastal pipelines piers and bridges control of vortex shedding has been studied in numerous research studies with different approaches such as co flow jet vortex generator synthetic jet actuator blowing surface roughness and moving surface mittal 2001 one of the earliest experiments on flow control by a moving wall for boundary layer control was carried out by favre 1938 he used an airfoil with the upper surface formed by a belt moving over two rollers and succeeded to delay separation until the angle of attack reached 55 zdravkovich 1981 compared the effects of some flow control means such as surface protrusions shrouds and near wake stabilizers modi et al 1981 1991 1992 established a wind tunnel test program involving a family of airfoils such as naca 63 218 and joukowsky with rotating cylinders as the moving surfaces their investigations indicated that the leading edge rotating cylinder with positive motion could increase the maximum lift force and led to a delay in the stall angle of attack by 2 73 and 48 respectively strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 studied the flow around a circular cylinder by the proper placement of a control cylinder close to the main cylinder and could control its vortex shedding at a range of reynolds number between 40 and 100 furthermore al garni et al 2000 used a leading edge rotating cylinder with positive motion as a moving surface on a naca 0024 airfoil and could increase the lift coefficient from 0 85 to 1 63 and delay the stall angle of attack by about 160 moreover the flow past a cylinder with two rotating control cylinders was numerically studied by mittal 2001 he investigated the effect of the gap between the main and control cylinders and found that the gap is an important parameter in obtaining the optimal performance of the flow control system modi 1997 also presented a review article about moving surface boundary layer control msbc on the airfoils and compared the effects of the different positions of the rotating elements used to inject the momentum the flow control issue involves optimization with either flow tracking or drag minimization as its objective functions however the solution of a constrained minimization problem when the unsteady navier stokes equations are being solved is not computationally possible therefore a number of optimal flow control techniques were developed gad el hak 1996 abergel and temam 1990 medjo et al 2008 homescu et al 2002 patnaik and wei 2002 studied on the vortex shedding suppression behind a d shaped cylinder with an angular momentum injection scheme to synchronize the vertical velocity field a research about the suppression of the circular cylinder wakes by two simple rotary type mechanical actuators was also performed by muddada and patnaik 2010 for re 100 300 jahanmiri 2010 presented a review article about modern active flow control methods which are used extremely to achieve transition delay drag reduction lift enhancement turbulence management separation postponement and noise suppression sahu and patnaik 2011 used a rotating element embedded at the leading edge of naca 0012 airfoil to inject the momentum into the wake region two different techniques to control and suppress the laminar vortex shedding around bluff bodies were presented by chan 2012 1 a passive control using a thin splitter plate positioned downstream of the bluff body 2 an active control by way of counter rotating a cylinder pair shukla and arakeri 2013 reduced the drag force acting on the cylinder by minimizing the net power consumption using a combination of theoretical and numerical techniques for a range of reynolds number from 1 to 300 reddy et al 2013 analytically investigated the flow past a circular cylinder in the presence of two counter rotating control cylinders they obtained an appropriate position and optimal circulation strength for the control cylinders moreover an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control scheme was applied by hasheminejad et al 2015 to suppress the two dimensional vortex induced vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder at low reynolds numbers hsu et al 2013 suppressed the vortex shedding of a circular cylinder by a small control rod in low reynolds numbers saha and shrivastava 2015 studied the flow past a square cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 and suppressed the vortex shedding using a blowing mechanism chen et al 2014 also used a traveling wave wall to suppress the unsteady vortex shedding from a circular cylinder salimipour 2019 investigated the mixed convection effects on the flow and heat transfer characteristics from a horizontal cylinder he found that the buoyancy effects could eliminate the vortex shedding with lowest drag coefficient and energy consumption in the present paper laminar flow control around a circular cylinder using moving surfaces is numerically studied for 60 re 180 none of the previous research studies have obtained the optimum location of the moving surfaces which causes the minimization of the power requirement of the cylinder motion for a moving surface the relative motion between the surface and the free stream is minimized thus the growth of the boundary layer is prevented in addition the surface motion injects additional momentum into the boundary layer gad el hak and bushnell 1991 the present study focuses on the following objectives numerical simulation and validation of the flow past a circular cylinder use of msbc concept to control the flow around the cylinder investigation of the effects of the surface locations on the drag and power coefficients and the vortex shedding state at various surface speeds minimization of the power requirement for the cylinder translation obtaining the optimum location and speed of the surfaces corresponding to the minimum power coefficient elimination of the vortex shedding in the wake of the cylinder at the minimum surface speed to mount the moving surfaces on the cylinder two symmetric belt like surfaces with downstream motion performed by a pulley drive system can be used as shown in fig 1 u s ϕ and θ s represent the moving surface speed surface angle and location angle of the moving surface respectively to achieve the above mentioned objectives the navier stokes equations are solved on a two dimensional unsteady incompressible and laminar flow using an in house computer program several code validation studies are first presented including some cases of average values and also time histories of the drag coefficient 2 mathematical and numerical formulation in this section the numerical procedure used to compute the unsteady viscous and incompressible flow is briefly described the two dimensional differential formulations for mass and momentum conservation in non dimensional form are expressed as follows 1 ρ u x ρ v y 0 2 ρ u τ j u x x j u y y s u p x 3 ρ v τ j v x x j v y y s v p y where ρ is the fluid density s u and s v are the source terms p denotes the static pressure and j u x j u y j v x and j v y are the sum of convection and diffusion fluxes defined as follows 4 j u x ρ u u 1 r e u x j u y ρ u v 1 r e u y j v x ρ u v 1 r e v x j v y ρ v v 1 r e v y the lengths of the above mentioned equations are normalized with the cylinder diameter d flow velocities with the free stream velocity u physical time τ with d u and pressure p with ρu 2 the governing equations 1 and 2 are solved in a general curvilinear coordinate system using a cell vertex control volume scheme presented in fig 2 in order to solve the flow equations 1 3 numerically a pressure based method is utilized which is called rk simpler and developed by rajagopalan and lestari 2016 a four stage explicit runge kutta procedure with second order temporal accuracy using the crank nicholson scheme is utilized for integrating the momentum equations 2 and 3 this new scheme provides an exact equation for the pressure field which is the only nonlinear equation solved iteratively in the procedure moreover no corrections are needed for the velocity or the pressure field therefore the approximate pressure correction equation does not need to be solved more descriptions of the method are presented in ref rajagopalan and lestari 2016 in the present study the implicit pressure equation is solved by the strongly implicit procedure sip proposed by stone 1968 this iterative method is a more advanced version of the incomplete lower upper lu scheme but it is only applicable to the equations resulting from a finite volume discretization for the system of linear equations ax b the approximate lower upper decomposition of the coefficients matrix a is expressed as follow 5 m l u a n where n denotes the error between the approximate and exact factorizations matrix a is five diagonal for a two dimensional flow the system of equations a x b can be solved iteratively for each iteration k which is written as follows 6 r k 1 b a x k 1 7 l y r k 1 u z y 8 x k x k 1 z the iterative procedure continues until the error matrix n be set such that nx 0 the sip scheme is much faster than the incomplete lower upper ilu and incomplete cholesky ic methods stone 1968 to discretize the convective terms of the momentum equations a second order upwind scheme is used and the viscous terms are discretized by use of the central scheme the step by step levels for the present numerical simulations is expressed as follows specify an initial guess for flow velocity solve the pressure equation using equation 6 8 solve the momentum equations by use of the four stage runge kutta algorithm advance to the next time level by solving the above mentioned equations the required flow parameters such as pressure and velocity components are computed and then the streamlines and the drag power and skin friction coefficients can be obtained these coefficients are defined as follows 9 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 d 10 c d m s f d m s 1 2 ρ u 2 d 11 c p f d u f d m s u s 1 2 ρ u 3 d c d k c d m s 12 c f τ s 1 2 ρ u 2 where c d c d m s c p and c f represents the cylinder drag pressure and frictional moving surface drag frictional total power and skin friction coefficients respectively f d and f d m s denotes the drag force of cylinder and moving surface respectively k u s u defines the ratio of the surface speed to free stream velocity and τ s represents the shear stress of the moving surface f d m s is computed by integration of τ s on the surface 3 grid generation and boundary conditions to numerically solve the above equations a computational domain is required depending on the geometry different meshing schemes may be used in the present study a combined o c mesh is used to simulate the flow characteristics which was also used in ref teymourtash and salimipour 2017 fig 3 depicts a view of the above mentioned grid the o region leads to generating an orthogonal mesh near the wall boundary the thickness of this region is about equal to the cylinder diameter the c region is appropriate for capturing the vortex shedding behind the cylinder according to the grid a velocity inlet boundary a pressure outlet boundary and an inner solid boundary cylinder surface are needed as shown in fig 4 on the solid boundary the velocity components are equal to the components of the cylinder speed according to the no slip flow condition the contravariant velocity v is set to zero moreover the normal gradient of the pressure is equal to zero 4 results and discussions 4 1 grid resolution study to implement the numerical procedure of the above mentioned formulations a study on the independence of the computational grid must be performed in the current study the effects of vortex shedding may be transferred to a large distance toward the flow downstream thus an appropriate computational domain is required in this regard several grids with various lengths to diameter ratios l d see fig 4 and different cell numbers n are investigated the ratio of n and l d is adjusted so that the grid resolution remains constant the ratio of height to length is constant as h l 0 5 fig 5 shows the variations of the average drag coefficient and strouhal number s t f d u with values at the peak mean and bottom of the oscillation curve for 20 l d 90 corresponded to 6000 n 36000 at re 180 θ s 70 ϕ 10 and the ratio of the surface speed to free stream velocity k u s u 1 it can be seen that for l d 50 corresponding to n 25000 the results have not changed a comparison between the results at l d 50 and n 32000 as shown in fig 5 also indicates that as the cell numbers increases the results remain unchanged the normal distance of the near wall cells is equal to 0 0025 times the diameter of the cylinder according to salimipour and anbarsooz 2019 they used this distance for the simulation of the laminar flow past a rotating cylinder for a reynolds number range from 40 to 200 eventually a grid with l d 50 and n 32000 is selected to implement the calculations of the current study 4 2 code validation study before using the present solver for analysis of the viscous flow past the cylinder with moving surfaces the validity of the solver has been examined first the flow past a circular cylinder with re 60 100 140 and 180 is simulated and compared with the previous studies table 1 presents the average drag coefficients of the cylinder and its excellent agreement with previous numerical results from henderson 1995 marella et al 2005 and mittal et al 2008 for averaging each unsteady quantity eight cycles of the vortex shedding region is used furthermore the variation of the drag coefficient of a cylinder with respect to the non dimensional time τ tu d at re 300 is shown in fig 6 the result from the computations of mittal et al 2008 is shown in the same plot again the two results are in a good agreement it is necessary to mention that at this reynolds number the flow is intrinsically three dimensional mittal et al 2008 hence this case is studied just to validate the present solver in order to investigate the present code validity for the moving surface problems the average drag

to minimizing the power coefficient a good drag reduction was also obtained under the optimum conditions against the baseline cylinder for re 60 180 as the reynolds number increased the average drag coefficient was decreased and its percentage improvement was increased the results also indicated that the moving surfaces decreased the vortex shedding region and the amplitude of the flow oscillations behind the cylinder moreover the vortex shedding could be eliminated using the moving surfaces the larger reynolds numbers needed the faster moving surfaces appendix a supplementary data

thus it has been greatly significant to focus into the corrosion problems of materials applied for the deep sea so far there have been two general approaches to study the deep sea corrosion behaviors

this work a near bottom suspension deep sea environment experimental installation was autonomously designed and developed to apply to the natural deep sea experiments in south china sea with three

environment experimental installations were autonomously designed and developed to apply to the natural deep sea deploy experiments in south china sea with three staying depths of 1200 m 2000 m and

release transponder and so on and nylon spacers were used between two specimens to separate specimens the distance between the frames and the seabed was about 40m the deep sea field exposure period is one year then three sets of installations were retrieved from the deep sea and corrosion data at three depths were obtained the field operation and frame photo are shown in fig 1 b c after one year deep sea field exposure 316l stainless steel specimens were retrieved rust removal treatment was carried out referencing the china national standard gb t 16545 1996 rust removal solution was obtained through adding 500 ml concentrated hcl ρ 1 19 g ml and 3 5 g hexamethylene tetramine into 1000 ml distilled water then 316l specimens with rust were immersed into the rust removal solution for about 10 min the temperature was kept at 23 25 c finally 316l specimens were washed by distilled water and alcohol respectively specimen pitting depths were measured according to the method proposed by iso 11463 1995 briefly micrometer depth gause was used to measure the pitting depth of about twenty pitting holes for each piece of specimen and the average pitting depth was derived from the average value of three independent specimens while the maximum pitting depth was the greatest value the corrosion rate r can be calculated by measuring the specimen mass before and after immersion following equation 1 1 r m 0 m t s t where m 0 and m t are the mass before and after corrosion s is the area of corroded surface and t is the corrosion duration chen et al 2019 digital camera canon eos 80d japan was used to record the macroscopic features of 316l specimen before and after rust removal 3d digital video microscope kh 8700 hirox japan and scanning electron microscope sem ultra55 germany were used to characterize the micro morphologies on the representative regions of 316l specimens and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo escalab 250 usa was used to analyze the chemcial states of corrosion products which were scraped from the substrate open circuit potential tests for initial stage were conducted in situ and the deep sea electrochemical test equipments with data loggers cr1000 campbell company usa were fixed on the specimen frames in 1200m 2000m and 3000m specimens were cut into circles ϕ50 mm 3 mm thickness and the back of specimen was connected out with electrical wire then specimens were encapsulated into pvc tubes using epoxy resin specimens and reference electrode solid ag agcl electrode were placed as shown in fig 2 finally after the field exposure experiment data were analyzed and converted into open circuit potential versus saturated calomel electrode the conversion equation was shown as below 2 e s c e e a g a g c l 3 02 10 5 t 0 019 where t k was the deep sea temperature e ag agcl v was obtained from the in situ deep sea electrochemical tests and e sce v was the potential vs saturated calomel electrode after the field exposure specimens were taken out from the deep sea and electrochemical experiments were performed in the lab through an electrochemical workstation par2273 usa with a three electrode cell 316l specimen before rust removal served as the working electrode test area 3 14 cm2 and platinum wire electrode and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode respectively the supporting electrolyte was 3 5 wt nacl solution before every electrochemical experiment the open circuit potential was confirmed to stay in a relatively stable condition electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements were conducted at the stable open circuit potential and the frequency ranged from 105 hz to 0 1 hz with an amplitude signal of 10 mv polarization curves were measured with a potential range of 600mv 600 mv vs open circuit potential in a sweeping speed of 10 mv min 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 corrosion morphology and products analysis fig 3 shows the macroscopic morphologies of 316l specimen at various sea depths after one year deep sea field exposure observing from fig 3 a c 316l specimens present smooth metal luster surfaces except the nylon fixing position and few positions on the surfaces present slight pitting corrosion indicating good anti corrosion performance around the nylon fixing position obvious crevice corrosion occurs and some brown corrosion products are concentrated after rust removal deeper corrosion pits are detectable at the nylon fixing position while few slight corrosion dots are detectable around the edge of 316l specimens which is shown as fig 3 d f the macroscopic corrosion morphologies of specimens exposed in various depths display a similar result indicating that major corrosion types of 316l stainless steel are pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion in the deep sea condition severe pitting corrosion positions of specimens were investigated and the results of corrosion micro morphologies of 316 l stainless steel after one year deep sea field exposure were shown in figs 4 and 5 before rust removal as shown infig 4 a c with field exposure depth increasing the corrosion conditions of specimens are deteriorated only slight corrosion products exist on the specimen surface when the field exposure depth is 1200 m and with the depth reaching 2000 m corrosion products show a significant increase on the surface while a great amount of small pitting points are densely distributed on the surface of specimen exposed in 3000 m fig 4 d f show the optical corrosion micro morphologies of specimens after rust removal and indicate that the number of pitting points and the diameter of pitting points gradually increase with field exposure deepening fig 5 shows the sem images of 316l specimens after rust removal the results show that the pitting points display irregular shallow corrosion holes and with the field exposure deepening the diameters of pitting points gradually increase from 80 μm to around 300 μm to obtain the composition and chemical states of corrosion products x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the element compositions and surface chemical states of specimen exposed in 3000 m depth for one year and results are shown in fig 6 and listed in table 2 observing from fig 6a corrosion products of 316l specimen contain si s cl mo c n o cr fe na mg k and ni the elements of cl na mg and k are derived from seawater and the presence of c 1s and n 1s can be ascribed to the organic carbon and nitrogen contamination the spectra were calibrated with respect to the signal of contamination carbon 284 77 ev as internal reference and element contents in the corrosion products were calculated according to the xps peak areas the contents of fe mo cr ni and o are 17 66 0 63 4 37 0 81 and 49 88 respectively and this result indicates that deep sea corrosion products of 316l specimen mainly exist as the oxidation state to further analyze the valence and existence state of main elements the xps core level spectra of o fe cr ni and mo were fitted and analyzed using a xps peak processing program with a lorentzian gaussian peak shape after a background subtraction fig 6b shows the core level spectrum of o which can be deconvoluted into three peaks located at 530 1 ev 531 7 ev and 532 9 ev respectively the main contribution in corrosion products is the oxygen present in the forms of oxide o2 and hydroxide oh and the third peak corresponds to h2o the ratio of oxide to hydroxide was calculated according to the corresponding peak areas and the result is 1 5 as shown in fig 6c the spin orbit of fe 2p3 2 ground state and the fe 2p1 2 excited state are around 711 1 ev and 724 5 ev respectively some researches of passivation film and corrosion products for stainless steels report that the binding energies of fe 2 and fe 3 are around 709 5 ev and 710 4 ev while that of fe 0 is around 707 0 ev kocijan et al 2007 thus it can be concluded that the fe element of corrosion products exists mainly as the state of fe 3 after 316l specimen was exposed in 3000 m deep sea for one year which is different from a co existence state of bi and tri valent iron derived from short term tests bhargava et al 2007 wang 2004 the xps peak of fe 2p3 2 was split into three peaks located at 710 71 ev 712 63 ev and 718 69 ev respectively the xps peak at high binding energy corresponds to fe 3 satellites the xps peak at 710 71 ev can be attributed to fe2o3 and the xps peak at 712 63 ev can be ascribed to α feooh β feooh and γ feooh the calculated result for the ratio of feooh and fe2o3 is 1 05 xps peak splitting results of cr 2p are shown in fig 6d and present three peaks located at 576 03 ev 577 07 ev and 578 58 ev respectively which can correspond to cr2o3 cr oh 3 and cro3 respectively calculated results indicate that the cr element of corrosion products exists mainly as the state of trivalent cr the ni 2p3 2 xps peak located at 855 80 ev corresponds to the composition of ni oh 2 while the mo 3d5 2 peak is split into two peaks at 232 36ev and 233 36 ev which can correspond to molybdate and other high valent molybdenum oxides some literatures reported that addition of mo can enhance the anticorrosion ability of stainless steel and that molybdate in corrosion products can efficiently promote the substrate passivation process especially a combination of cr and mo benefits to inhibit the localized corrosion tendency beccaria et al 1995 zhang et al 2009 2016 shintani et al 2008 hryniewicz et al 2008 jung et al 2012 3 2 electrochemical behaviors fig 7 shows the open circuit potential variations of 316l specimens during the initial field exposure stage the starting open circuit potentials of 316l specimens exposed in 1200 m 2000 m and 3000 m are 160 8 mv vs sce 193 5 mv vs sce and 231 7 mv vs sce respectively and this result demonstrates that open circuit potential shifts negatively with the exposure depth increasing and open circuit potential variations display a little difference the open circuit potential of 1200 m specimen gradually change from 160 8 mv to 175 0 mv vs sce showing a negative shift with the field exposure proceeding while the open circuit potentials of 2000 m and 3000 m specimens remain about the same after one year exposure experiment specimens were withdrawn and disposed and electrochemical measurements of specimens were conducted in the laboratory as observing from the polarization plots of 316l specimens after exposing in different water depths shown in fig 8 the corrosion potentials show a negative shift with the water depth increasing the corrosion potentials with exposure depths of 1200 m and 2000 m are 0 166 v vs sce and 0 202 v vs sce respectively when the water depth reaches 3000 m the corrosion potential decreases to 0 240 v vs sce the anodic polarization plots display passivation dissolution characteristics with the potential sweeping proceeding positively the anodic potential increases and reaches the passive region and fe cr mo and so on are oxidized to form the passivation film with the potential further increasing the 316l substrate is dissolved the passivation film is broken and some metal hydroxides such as cr oh 3 feooh and so on are obtained as corrosion products generally the more positive the pitting potential is the better pitting resistance the stainless steel has the 1200 m specimen has a most positive pitting potential of 0 612 v vs sce with a minimum maintaining passivity current density of around 7 76 10 6 a cm 2 demonstrating a most outstanding performance of pitting resistance with the exposure water depth increasing to 2000 m the pitting potential decreases to 0 327 v vs sce and the pitting potential even is only 0 201 v vs sce it was obtained based on the intersection of tangent lines for two different slope anodic curves with a maximum water depth of 3000 m meanwhile with the exposure water depth increasing the maintaining passivity current density grows up from 1 03 10 5 a cm 2 to 1 98 10 5 a cm 2 these results prove that the pitting resistance of 316l gradually fails with the exposure depth increasing some reports about the stainless steel corrosion show that 316l possesses a pitting potential range from 0 63 v to 0 76 v vs sce in the conventional seawater environment yi et al 2013 saadi et al 2016 demonstrating that the deep sea environment plays a prominent role on 316l pitting in comparison to the conventional seawater environment fig 9 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of 316l specimens exposed for one year electrochemical impedance spectra were analyzed and fitted using the software zsimpwin the fitting of eis gives a good result using the two time constant model as shown in fig 9d and fitted results are listed in table 3 all nyquist plots show impedance capacitive resistance characteristics and an impedance reduction tendency with the depth increasing indicating a reduction of corrosion resistance ability observing from bode plots shown in fig 9b two overlapped time constants are suggested the high frequency time constant represents the fast response of resistance characteristics for the passivation film and the low frequency one is the slow response for the electric double layer process the faraday process and so on li et al 2013 after 316l specimens are exposed in the deep sea environment a compact passivation film forms however different sea environments at various depths cause a difference among passivation films and then bring about a change of corrosion electrochemical behaviors in the equivalent circuit model r s is the solution resistance r f and q f represent the resistance and the capacitance of passivation film respectively r ct is the charge transfer resistance occurring on the metal solution interface and q dl for the double layer capacitance on the metal solution interface n f and n dl mean the deviation degree of the measured capacitance compared with the ideal capacitance the charge transfer resistance of 3000 m specimen is 1 13 104 ω which is lower one magnitude order than the result from 1200 m specimen 1 08 105 ω showing a decrease with the depth increasing n dl also displays a similar tendency to the charge transfer resistance this result indicates a decrease of anti corrosion ability with the depth increasing and agrees with the results of polarization plots and micro morphology observations 3 3 corrosion behaviors fig 10 shows the field exposure corrosion data the average corrosion rates of 316l specimens are 0 85 μm y 1 for 1200 m 0 75 μm y 1 for 2000 m and 0 96 μm y 1 for 3000 m respectively comparing to the corrosion rate of 0 30 μm y 1 obtained in the shallow sea environment with an immersion depth of 2 m the data was obtained from our other natural field experiments and a publication is under preparation the corrosion rates in the deep sea significantly increase to at least 2 5 times these data are as lower two orders of magnitude as q235 corrosion data from our previous report ding et al 2018 as the situation that corrosion weight loss of 316l is mainly derived from the localized corrosion this result implies a significant effect of the deep sea environment on the corrosion resistance ability of 316l fig 10b shows the comparison results of pitting corrosion depths comparing with the shallow sea the pitting depth for 1200 m shows a slight decrease for the deep sea condition from 1200 m depth to 3000m depth with the depth increasing average pitting depths and maximum pitting depths gradually grow up when the exposure depth is 3000 m and the period is one year the average and maximum pitting depths even reach 12 7 μm and 18 4 μm respectively the result of corrosion data with the depth increasing is consistent with electrochemical results and corrosion micro morphology analysis in our studies about the deep sea corrosion of metal materials the stainless steels have exhibited much severer crevice corrosion in the deep sea than that in the shallow sea and this result can be observed in fig 3 and figs s1 s2 before specimen treatment the specimen exposed in the shallow sea is completely covered with amounts of marine plants and calcium magnesium deposits and shows only a slight corrosion at the specimen fixing position the deep sea exposed specimen shows much severer crevice corrosion and displays significant crevice corrosion hole at the fixing position both the specimens after rust removal show pitting but the deep sea specimen show much severer corrosion at the fixing position for the low mass loss and corrosion rates it is deemed that crevice corrosion occurring in the deep sea may make greater contribution to the mass loss and the average corrosion rate this phenomenon is also reported in our previous work peng et al 2019 and even severe tunnel corrosion occurs on the surface of deep sea specimens 4 conclusions the long term deep sea field exposure of 316l stainless steels was made employing the autonomously developed near bottom suspension deep sea environment experimental installation analysis results show that pitting and crevice corrosion are two of main corrosion modes for 316l in the deep sea environment electrochemical results show that corrosion potential pitting potential and charge transfer resistance present a decrease trend with the field exposure depth increasing while the corrosion rate and the pitting depth are accelerated with the depth increasing the corrosion rates in the deep sea condition are more than 2 5 times of that in the shallow sea condition appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

removal and indicate that the number of pitting points and the diameter of pitting points gradually increase with field exposure deepening fig 5 shows the sem images of 316l specimens after rust removal the results show that the pitting points display irregular shallow corrosion holes and with the field exposure deepening the diameters of pitting points gradually increase from 80 μm to around 300 μm to obtain the composition and chemical states of corrosion products x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the element compositions and surface chemical states of specimen exposed in 3000 m depth for one year and results are shown in fig 6 and listed in table 2 observing from fig 6a corrosion products of 316l specimen contain si s cl mo c n o cr fe na mg k and ni the elements of cl na mg and k are derived from seawater and the presence of c 1s and n 1s can be ascribed to the organic carbon and nitrogen contamination the spectra were calibrated with respect to the signal of contamination carbon 284 77 ev as internal reference and element contents in the corrosion products were calculated according to the xps peak areas the contents of fe mo cr ni and o are 17 66 0 63 4 37 0 81 and 49 88 respectively and this result indicates that deep sea corrosion products of 316l specimen mainly exist as the oxidation state to further analyze the valence and existence state of main elements the xps core level spectra of o fe cr ni and mo were fitted and analyzed using a xps peak processing program with a lorentzian gaussian peak shape after a background subtraction fig 6b shows the core level spectrum of o which can be deconvoluted into three peaks located at 530 1 ev 531 7 ev and 532 9 ev respectively the main contribution in corrosion products is the oxygen present in the forms of oxide o2 and hydroxide oh and the third peak corresponds to h2o the ratio of oxide to hydroxide was calculated according to the corresponding peak areas and the result is 1 5 as shown in fig 6c the spin orbit of fe 2p3 2 ground state and the fe 2p1 2 excited state are around 711 1 ev and 724 5 ev respectively some researches of passivation film and corrosion products for stainless steels report that the binding energies of fe 2 and fe 3 are around 709 5 ev and 710 4 ev while that of fe 0 is around 707 0 ev kocijan et al 2007 thus it can be concluded that the fe element of corrosion products exists mainly as the state of fe 3 after 316l specimen was exposed in 3000 m deep sea for one year which is different from a co existence state of bi and tri valent iron derived from short term tests bhargava et al 2007 wang 2004 the xps peak of fe 2p3 2 was split into three peaks located at 710 71 ev 712 63 ev and 718 69 ev respectively the xps peak at high binding energy corresponds to fe 3 satellites the xps peak at 710 71 ev can be attributed to fe2o3 and the xps peak at 712 63 ev can be ascribed to α feooh β feooh and γ feooh the calculated result for the ratio of feooh and fe2o3 is 1 05 xps peak splitting results of cr 2p are shown in fig 6d and present three peaks located at 576 03 ev 577 07 ev and 578 58 ev respectively which can correspond to cr2o3 cr oh 3 and cro3 respectively calculated results indicate that the cr element of corrosion products exists mainly as the state of trivalent cr the ni 2p3 2 xps peak located at 855 80 ev corresponds to the composition of ni oh 2 while the mo 3d5 2 peak is split into two peaks at 232 36ev and 233 36 ev which can correspond to molybdate and other high valent molybdenum oxides some literatures reported that addition of mo can enhance the anticorrosion ability of stainless steel and that molybdate in corrosion products can efficiently promote the substrate passivation process especially a combination of cr and mo benefits to inhibit the localized corrosion tendency beccaria et al 1995 zhang et al 2009 2016 shintani et al 2008 hryniewicz et al 2008 jung et al 2012 3 2 electrochemical behaviors fig 7 shows the open circuit potential variations of 316l specimens during the initial field exposure stage the starting open circuit potentials of 316l specimens exposed in 1200 m 2000 m and 3000 m are 160 8 mv vs sce 193 5 mv vs sce and 231 7 mv vs sce respectively and this result demonstrates that open circuit potential shifts negatively with the exposure depth increasing and open circuit potential variations display a little difference the open circuit potential of 1200 m specimen gradually change from 160 8 mv to 175 0 mv vs sce showing a negative shift with the field exposure proceeding while the open circuit potentials of 2000 m and 3000 m specimens remain about the same after one year exposure experiment specimens were withdrawn and disposed and electrochemical measurements of specimens were conducted in the laboratory as observing from the polarization plots of 316l specimens after exposing in different water depths shown in fig 8 the corrosion potentials show a negative shift with the water depth increasing the corrosion potentials with exposure depths of 1200 m and 2000 m are 0 166 v vs sce and 0 202 v vs sce respectively when the water depth reaches 3000 m the corrosion potential decreases to 0 240 v vs sce the anodic polarization plots display passivation dissolution characteristics with the potential sweeping proceeding positively the anodic potential increases and reaches the passive region and fe cr mo and so on are oxidized to form the passivation film with the potential further increasing the 316l substrate is dissolved the passivation film is broken and some metal hydroxides such as cr oh 3 feooh and so on are obtained as corrosion products generally the more positive the pitting potential is the better pitting resistance the stainless steel has the 1200 m specimen has a most positive pitting potential of 0 612 v vs sce with a minimum maintaining passivity current density of around 7 76 10 6 a cm 2 demonstrating a most outstanding performance of pitting resistance with the exposure water depth increasing to 2000 m the pitting potential decreases to 0 327 v vs sce and the pitting potential even is only 0 201 v vs sce it was obtained based on the intersection of tangent lines for two different slope anodic curves with a maximum water depth of 3000 m meanwhile with the exposure water depth increasing the maintaining passivity current density grows up from 1 03 10 5 a cm 2 to 1 98 10 5 a cm 2 these results prove that the pitting resistance of 316l gradually fails with the exposure depth increasing some reports about the stainless steel corrosion show that 316l possesses a pitting potential range from 0 63 v to 0 76 v vs sce in the conventional seawater environment yi et al 2013 saadi et al 2016 demonstrating that the deep sea environment plays a prominent role on 316l pitting in comparison to the conventional seawater environment fig 9 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of 316l specimens exposed for one year electrochemical impedance spectra were analyzed and fitted using the software zsimpwin the fitting of eis gives a good result using the two time constant model as shown in fig 9d and fitted results are listed in table 3 all nyquist plots show impedance capacitive resistance characteristics and an impedance reduction tendency with the depth increasing indicating a reduction of corrosion resistance ability observing from bode plots shown in fig 9b two overlapped time constants are suggested the high frequency time constant represents the fast response of resistance characteristics for the passivation film and the low frequency one is the slow response for the electric double layer process the faraday process and so on li et al 2013 after 316l specimens are exposed in the deep sea environment a compact passivation film forms however different sea environments at various depths cause a difference among passivation films and then bring about a change of corrosion electrochemical behaviors in the equivalent circuit model r s is the solution resistance r f and q f represent the resistance and the capacitance of passivation film respectively r ct is the charge transfer resistance occurring on the metal solution interface and q dl for the double layer capacitance on the metal solution interface n f and n dl mean the deviation degree of the measured capacitance compared with the ideal capacitance the charge transfer resistance of 3000 m specimen is 1 13 104 ω which is lower one magnitude order than the result from 1200 m specimen 1 08 105 ω showing a decrease with the depth increasing n dl also displays a similar tendency to the charge transfer resistance this result indicates a decrease of anti corrosion ability with the depth increasing and agrees with the results of polarization plots and micro morphology observations 3 3 corrosion behaviors fig 10 shows the field exposure corrosion data the average corrosion rates of 316l specimens are 0 85 μm y 1 for 1200 m 0 75 μm y 1 for 2000 m and 0 96 μm y 1 for 3000 m respectively comparing to the corrosion rate of 0 30 μm y 1 obtained in the shallow sea environment with an immersion depth of 2 m the data was obtained from our other natural field experiments and a publication is under preparation the corrosion rates in the deep sea significantly increase to at least 2 5 times these data are as lower two orders of magnitude as q235 corrosion data from our previous report ding et al 2018 as the situation that corrosion weight loss of 316l is mainly derived from the localized corrosion this result implies a significant effect of the deep sea environment on the corrosion resistance ability of 316l fig 10b shows the comparison results of pitting corrosion depths comparing with the shallow sea the pitting depth for 1200 m shows a slight decrease for the deep sea condition from 1200 m depth to 3000m depth with the depth increasing average pitting depths and maximum pitting depths gradually grow up when the exposure depth is 3000 m and the period is one year the average and maximum pitting depths even reach 12 7 μm and 18 4 μm respectively the result of corrosion data with the depth increasing is consistent with electrochemical results and corrosion micro morphology analysis in our studies about the deep sea corrosion of metal materials the stainless steels have exhibited much severer crevice corrosion in the deep sea than that in the shallow sea and this result can be observed in fig 3 and figs s1 s2 before specimen treatment the specimen exposed in the shallow sea is completely covered with amounts of marine plants and calcium magnesium deposits and shows only a slight corrosion at the specimen fixing position the deep sea exposed specimen shows much severer crevice corrosion and displays significant crevice corrosion hole at the fixing position both the specimens after rust removal show pitting but the deep sea specimen show much severer corrosion at the fixing position for the low mass loss and corrosion rates it is deemed that crevice corrosion occurring in the deep sea may make greater contribution to the mass loss and the average corrosion rate this phenomenon is also reported in our previous work peng et al 2019 and even severe tunnel corrosion occurs on the surface of deep sea specimens 4 conclusions the long term deep sea field exposure of 316l stainless steels was made employing the autonomously developed near bottom suspension deep sea environment experimental installation analysis results show that pitting and crevice corrosion are two of main corrosion modes for 316l in the deep sea environment electrochemical results show that corrosion potential pitting potential and charge transfer resistance present a decrease trend with the field exposure depth increasing while the corrosion rate and the pitting depth are accelerated with the depth increasing the corrosion rates in the deep sea condition are more than 2 5 times of that in the shallow sea condition appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

22529,there are many researches on exciting forces of propellers however most of them have not studied their transmission characteristics the influence of elastic blades flexible shafts and bearings on forces during their transmission to the hull therefore in this study the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force of propellers are studied based on a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system which is established by coupled bem and fem the research results show that elastic blades and the flexible shaft have an important effect on axial exciting force during its transmission to the hull first there are two kinds of vibration modes for blade bending vibration one is jellyfish mode and the other is non jellyfish mode the axial exciting force has resonance peak only in the jellyfish mode second the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has large effect on the jellyfish mode and has small influence on the non jellyfish mode finally all these results are validated with analytical solution by simplifying the propeller shaft bearing system into a series of mass spring models this study can provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of propeller shaft bearing system and minimize the excitation force transmitted to the hull keywords exciting forces of propeller fluid structure interaction boundary element method bem finite element method fem jellyfish mode 1 introduction acoustic stealth is an important index to evaluate the combat performance of warships in many noise sources of warships the noise generated by propeller exciting force is the most important this is because the propeller excitation forces are transmitted to the hull through elastic propeller flexible shaft and bearings causing the hull to vibrate and radiating low frequency noise zou et al 2015 2016 as we all know the low frequency noise has some characteristics such as the slow attenuation the long propagation distance and large difficulty for control besides these common features the low frequency noise caused by the propeller exciting force has its unique characteristics some studies have pointed out that this low frequency noise contains obvious line spectrum and narrow band spectrum which are mainly caused by the blade frequency and its multiples merz et al 2010 2013 therefore it is more likely to be detected by the underwater sonar and has become a key issue for further improvements of the noise stealth performance of warships zou 2017 at present some scholars have taken some measures to control the vibration of shafts to reduce the excitation forces transmitted to the hull as much as possible dylejko et al 2007 merz et al 2010 because this kind of low frequency noise is caused by the propeller exciting force which causes the coupling vibration of the propeller shaft hull system the study on the characteristics of the propeller exciting force has important theoretical and practical application value 1 1 previous work the exciting forces of propellers are caused by the propeller working in nonuniform flow field these exciting forces are transmitted through the bearings to the hull so they are also called propeller bearing forces carlton 2012 at present although a large number of publications have studied the characteristics of exciting forces of propellers there are still some shortcomings summarizing all these studies they could be categorized mainly into two types in the first type the propeller is assumed to be perfectly rigid and the effect of the blade elasticity on propeller exciting forces during their transmission to the hull is ignored most studies could be grouped into this class for example liefvendahl and troeng 2011 studied the propeller exciting forces for a submarine hull propeller configuration dubbioso et al 2014 analyzed the characteristics of exciting forces for the propeller operating in oblique flow ortolani et al muscari et al 2017 ortolani et al 2015 investigated the propeller exciting forces characteristics while the ship was experiencing complex motions kinnas et al 2012 also predicted the exciting forces when the propeller made rigid body motions wei and wang 2013 studied the propeller exciting forces of a scale submarine model the above researches are all based on the assumption that the propeller blade is completely rigid so the effect of elastic blade vibration on exciting forces of propellers could not be captured when the propeller stiffness is large enough this assumption can meet engineering requirements however with the wide use of the highly skewed or composite material propellers propellers are more and more flexible and it becomes increasingly important to consider the blade elasticity in such cases large blade distortions and resonant vibration of blade may occur more easily which has important effect on propeller exciting forces during their transmission to the hull so the rigid assumption is inadequate to analyze the exciting forces characteristics and they should be clarified from the viewpoint of fluid solid interactions between propellers and fluid in the second type a small number of studies have taken into account the elastic effect of blades for example kapuria and das das and kapuria 2016 kapuria and das 2018 analyzed and optimized the hydrodynamic performance of the composite propeller using fluid solid coupling method based on the finite element method fem coupled with computational fluid dynamics cfd in their studies the geometric nonlinearity of blades is also included similarly he et al 2012 analyzed and optimized the exciting forces of the composite propeller using fem cfd young young 2007 2008 studied the hydro elastic performance of marine propellers based on a bem fem coupled fsi algorithm and the propeller exciting forces were also analyzed simply li et al 2017 did the similar work chen et al 2017 analyzed the longitudinal exciting force of propellers under the inflow turbulence in which the blade elasticity was also considered although these studies involve the elasticity of blades the study on the influence of elastic effect on exciting forces of propellers is relatively simple for example there is no explanation of what kind of vibration modes of blades can magnify the exciting forces during their transmission to the hull generally speaking the current researches either focus on rigid propellers or do not consider the influence of flexible shaft some studies chen et al 2019 xiong et al 2016 xiuchang et al 2017 established the elastic propeller and flexible shaft models but these studies focused on the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the propeller shaft hull system they did not use the fluid solid coupling method to study the generation of excitation force and the influence of blade elasticity and the coupling effect between the blade and the shaft on its transmission characteristics merz and kessissoglou established a propeller shaft hull model in which the propeller was rigid but the shaft and hull were flexible based on this model they studied using active or passive methods such as resonance changer to control the axial excitation force transmitted to the hull thus reducing the hull radiation noise merz 2008 merz et al 2009a 2010 2013 1 2 objective of the present work therefore based on the deficiencies of current studies the purpose of this paper is to establish a complete fsi dynamic model of fluid propeller shaft bearing system and to study the transmission characteristics of propeller excitation forces especially the influence of blade elasticity flexible shafting and elastic coupling effect between blades and shaft on them for example what kind of modes have amplification effects on the excitation forces these studies can provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of the propeller shaft bearing system the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft system is built by coupled boundary element method bem and finite element method fem in section 3 the effect of blade elasticity and the shaft on the transmission characteristics of the propeller exciting force is studied in section 4 the transmission characteristics is studied further by analytical method some important discussions and conclusions are presented in section 5 and section 6 2 mathematical model in order to investigate the effect of blade elasticity and the shaft on propeller s exciting force it needs to establish a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system in which the fluid solid coupling effect between propellers and fluid and the elastic coupling effect between propellers and shafting should be included for fluid solid coupling calculation method of propellers there are two main categories one is based on the theory of viscous flow namely computational fluid dynamics cfd combined with fem lee et al 2017 the other is based on the potential flow theory namely boundary element method bem combined with fem young 2007 2008 for the first class the major disadvantages are that it needs lots of cpu time and memory in calculation even though it could give a more accurate solution therefore at present the second method has been widely used and could obtain good engineering accuracy ghassemi et al 2013 hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 li et al 2017 motley and young 2011a b so in this study the coupled fem bem is also applied to establish the fsi dynamic model of fluid propeller shaft bearing system because the large number of previous studies based on the coupled fem bem only considered the propeller ignoring the influence of the shafting in our previous study we have extended this method so that it can take into account the effect of the shaft zou et al 2017 so in this study in order to save space the modeling method will be briefly introduced and more details on how to use the coupled fem bem to establish a fluid solid coupling dynamic model of fluid propeller shaft bearing system can be seen in reference young 2008 zou 2017 zou et al 2017 however the model in this study is still slightly different from our previous study zou et al 2017 a schematic diagram for a propeller shaft bearings system of ships is illustrated in fig 1 it consists of a shaft propeller back stern bearing front stern bearing middle bearing and thrust bearing the bearings are simplified as spring damping units the structure model is modelled by fem in fem the blade is simulated with 20 node solid elements the shaft is simulated with timoshenko beam elements because the hub is interference fit with the shaft the hub is considered to be part of the shaft and also modelled by beam elements the bearings are modelled by springs and damping elements the dynamic equations of the propeller shaft bearings system can be written as follows it assumes that there is no other loads except the hydrodynamic loads zou 2017 zou et al 2017 1 m u c u k u f φ where u u and u are the nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively m is the structural mass matrix k is the stiffness matrix including the structure stiffness and bearings stiffness c is the damping matrix including the structure damping and bearings damping f φ is the hydrodynamic load since this study is concerned with the transmission characteristics of propeller shaft system to propeller hydrodynamic force in order to simplify the calculation other loads such as the coriolis force centrifugal force are ignored although some publications point out that the influence of gravity should be considered when calculating the propeller bearing force carlton 2012 however gravity only affects the constant component of bearing force but has no effect on its fluctuating component chen 1987 he and wang 1987 since this paper only focuses on the fluctuating bearing force that causes vibration noise the influence of gravity is ignored in the model moreover this paper only studies the transmission characteristics of axial bearing force while gravity only affects the constant component of radial bearing force f φ is solved by bem which is based on the potential flow theory the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and the viscosity is also ignored consider a propeller subjected to an effective inflow wake v 0 as shown in fig 2 to avoid the need for a moving mesh f φ is solved by bem in o x y z which is a rotating blade fixed coordinate system usually fluid solid coupling computation requires a lot of computer resources and it is not easy to converge in order to simplify some scholars have made some assumptions hylarides 1979 kuo 1984 li et al 2017 zou et al 2017 the hypothesis is that if the blade deformations are not large f φ could be decomposed linearly into two parts the first part is f ϕ caused by the vibration displacement of the blade under the non uniform flow field and the second part is f φ generated by the vibration velocity acceleration of the blade in the uniform flow field young s team has done a lot of studies on this simplification and shows that it can achieve very good accuracy enough to meet the engineering needs chae et al 2017 motley and young 2011a young 2007 2008 young and savander 2011 after further derivation the derivation process could see reference zou 2017 zou et al 2017 the blade deformation velocity acceleration dependent hydroelastic force f φ could be expressed as added mass matrix m a and added damping matrix c a then eq 1 can be written as 2 m m a u c c a u k u f ϕ the whole process of modeling and solution is shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 the whole solution process is divided into two parts the first part is the fluid force caused by the vibration displacement of the blade and the solving process is shown in the left part of fig 3 considering that the geometric shape of the blade changes at each time step as shown in the block diagram in the lower left corner of fig 3 the geometric model of the blade needs to be updated at each time step when updating the blade geometry an iterative calculation is required at this time step until the results such as blade deformation thrust coefficient etc between two adjacent iterations have little change that is convergence xing 2016 xing and jin 2005 because of the linearity of equations in this study the convergence is easily achieved the second part is fluid force caused by the vibration velocity acceleration of the blade which can be equivalent to added mass force and added damping force through derivation the solution process is shown in the dashed box on the right in fig 3 when calculating the added mass force and the added damping force it is assumed that the geometric deformation of the blade is very small therefore in each time step the added mass and the added damping are the same and only need to be calculated once in the first time step of course it is also possible to calculate the added mass and added damping at each time step but the calculation time will be greatly increased there are some points to be emphasized in the fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system first the solutions of fluid by bem are obtained in o x y z and the solutions of structure by fem are obtained in o x y z then the results of fluid need to be transformed in o x y z second the structure field modeling by fem and the fluid field modeling by bem have the same nodes so that the results between each other could transfer simply and quickly in fluid structure interaction third the more the number of fe grid elements and be grid elements the higher the solution accuracy but the worse the calculation time the larger the data storage space therefore in this study the principle of determining the number of be grid elements is that the thrust and torque coefficients of the rigid propeller under the uniform flow field vary little and the principle of determining the number of fe grid elements is that the system first fifty natural frequencies vary little in present study fe model be model and their coupling calculation are all programmed and solved in matlab software therefore it is very necessary to prove the correctness of the codes program validation has been completed in our previous researches zou 2017 zou et al 2017 for example bem codes are validated by simulation calculation including the steady state and transient problems compared with ansys software fem codes are also proved to be correct including static analysis and dynamic analysis the coupled bem fem codes are validated by some simulation analysis including fluid solid coupling data transfer between bem and fem and added mass calculation of fluid and so on the fluid solid coupling algorithm in this paper makes some approximate assumptions these approximations will lead to errors and uncertainties these will be mainly analyzed in the discussion in section 5 however due to these approximate assumptions the fluid solid coupling method in this paper is faster than the commercial software method so the method in this study can be used as a preliminary estimation method in engineering and has important value 3 the transmission characteristic of the axial exciting force in this section the transmission characteristics of propeller exciting force for a propeller shaft bearings system will be studied usually the axial exciting force is transmitted to the hull through the thrust bearing base which makes it easier to excite the low order mode vibration of the hull and thus radiate low frequency noise merz et al 2009b pan et al 2002 therefore this study only focuses on the axial exciting force characteristics of propellers the characteristics of exciting forces in other directions can also be studied by using this fsi dynamic model the main parameters of the propeller shaft bearing system studied in this paper come from a real ship the propeller is 4382 which represents typical designs for container ships or single screw destroyer type ships and is widely used in real ships it is a five bladed skewed marine propeller with a maximum skew angle measured in the plane of the propeller disk of 36 and a design advance coefficient of 0 889 the geometric and material parameters are given in table a 1 and table a 4 of appendix a more detailed information such as its design can be found in the reference boswell 1971 the geometric and material parameters of the shaft are given in table a 2 and table a 4 which come from the reference chen 1987 for convenience the shaft is assumed to be a uniform cross section beam the parameters of the bearings are given in table a 3 which also come from the reference chen 1987 3 1 non jellyfish mode and jellyfish mode of propellers in this section we will describe the non jellyfish mode and jellyfish mode of propeller vibration and focus on the influence of the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft on them first the wet mode of the propeller is calculated without considering the influence of the shafting then with consideration of the shafting the wet mode of the propeller shaft bearing system is calculated comparing the two results we can find the effect of elastic coupling between propeller and shaft on the natural frequencies of propeller fig 4 is the calculation results without shafting from this figure it can be seen that the bending vibration mode of propellers can be divided into two types one is non jellyfish mode and the other is jellyfish mode which can also be called the in phase mode or umbrella mode sarkani and szilagyi 1991 xiong et al 2016 for the non jellyfish mode of propellers some blades vibrate largely while some blades hardly vibrate for the jellyfish mode all blades vibrate simultaneously and the mode shape is circumferential symmetry fig 5 is the wet modal result of propeller calculated by ansys without considering the shaft the structure is simulated by a higher order 3 d 10 node tetrahedral element solid 95 element in ansys the fluid is also simulated by a higher order 3 d 10 node tetrahedral element fluid 220 element in ansys in theory it is more realistic to use solid elements to simulate the hub however in matlab if the hub is simulated with solid elements the programming will be more complicated and the calculation time will also increase therefore in order to simplify the beam element is used to simulate the hub this may cause large errors therefore in ansys we intentionally simulate the hub with solid elements to verify that this simplification will not cause large errors from the comparison results of figs 4 and 5 it is effective to simulate hub with beam element comparing figs 4 and 5 it can be seen that the wet modal results calculated by ansys are very close to the results in this paper whether it is the modal shape distribution or the natural frequency values thus further proving the correctness of our model the calculation errors mainly come from two aspects one is that the hub in ansys is a solid element in our model the hub is simulated by beam element the other is that in our model the added mass matrix m a established by bem is not a sparse matrix and for the convenience of the solution m a is simplified zou 2017 which also results in errors at the same time this simplification destroys the symmetry therefore in fig 4 the five natural frequency values are slightly different not exactly the same as in fig 5 even if their values are equal they should be classified as different modal types four non jellyfish modes and one jellyfish mode because their modal shapes are completely different fig 6 is the results with consideration of the shaft it can be seen that blade modes can still be divided into non jellyfish modes and jellyfish modes from figs 4 and 6 and table 1 some important conclusions could be obtained first of all some of the non jellyfish modes of the blades are not affected by the boundary conditions of the shafting so the shafting has no influence on its modes as shown in fig 6 a and b second some non jellyfish modes are coupled with bending vibration of shafting as shown in fig 6 c and d however the results in table 1 and a large number of numerical examples in publication zou 2017 all show that this coupling effect has only a small effect on the non jellyfish mode of the blade the effect is less than 6 but has no effect on the jellyfish mode of the blade therefore this coupling effect has little effect on the transmission characteristics of propeller axial excitation force which is the focus of this study third the jellyfish mode of the blade has a coupling effect with the axial vibration of the shafting as shown in fig 6 e this coupling effect has little effect on non jellyfish modes but has a great influence on jellyfish modes for this conclusion we will further explain it through theoretical analysis in section 5 2 for example when the shaft is not considered the first order jellyfish mode is 21 02 hz after considering the influence of shafting it changes to 29 58 hz the relative error reaches up to 28 9 to sum up there are two vibration modes in the blade bending vibration jellyfish mode and non jellyfish mode the elastic coupling effect between propeller and shafting has little influence on the non jellyfish modes of the propeller but has great influence on its jellyfish jellyfish modes in section 4 2 it will be seen that the jellyfish modes have an important effect on the axial exciting force of propellers 3 2 transmission characteristic of the axial exciting force at 120 rpm first the non uniform flow field is introduced because it is the source of the propeller s exciting force in this study the unsteady flow field comes from the experiment data which is measured on a training ship seiun maru ukon et al 1992 for simplification only axial velocity is taken into account and the radial and tangential velocity is ignored the non uniform inflow is shown in fig 7 similar to solving the natural frequencies in section 3 two models are also calculated in this section in order to reveal the influence of the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft on axial exciting force one model considers only the propeller applying a fixed constraint at the hub and ignores the effects of the shafting the other model considers the whole propeller shaft bearings system for the case in which the shaft is ignored axial exciting force of propellers transmitted to the hull is calculated by summing up the support reaction on the hub when the shaft is included the exciting force can be expressed as 3 f x k t u c t u where f x is the axial exciting force transmitted to the hull n k t and c t is the stiffness and damping of thrust bearing see table a 3 u is the vibration displacement at the thrust bearing m the axial exciting force is dimensionless by using the following equation 4 f x f x ρ f 2 d 4 where f x is the dimensionless form ρ is the density of water kgm 3 d is propeller diameter m and f is the rotation frequency of the propeller shaft system hz it is assumed that the rotation frequency f of the propeller shaft system is 2 hz namely the rotational speed is 120 rpm then the inflow velocity v 0 is determined by ensuring that the advance coefficient j is 0 889 v 0 2 f r j since the flow field model in this study is linear based on the potential flow theory and the fluid solid coupling calculation process is also linearized the whole model is linear therefore under the periodic excitation of non uniform flow field the fluid solid coupling calculation results such as exciting force blade vibration displacement etc should be periodic the steady state in this study is defined as the state when the fluid solid coupling calculation results are periodic at a given rotational speed the steady state can be achieved by calculating approximately 20 h the transient results are removed and only the steady state results are analyzed fig 8 is a comparison of the time domain results of dimensionless axial exciting force with and without considering the shaft at the same time the axial excitation force of the rigid propeller without considering the shaft and the thrust coefficient are also given it can be seen that compared with the rigid propeller elastic blades and flexible shafting have an important influence on the axial exciting force of propellers at 120 rpm the axial exciting force is amplified by blade elastic effect and axial vibration of the shaft in order to further study the influence of blade elasticity and shafting on propeller axial exciting force at different frequencies the time domain results of fig 8 are changed into frequency domain results by using fft fast fourier transform in fft the sampling frequency is 1440 hz and the frequency resolution is 0 2 hz the axial exciting force of the first six blade frequencies in fft is extracted and compared the histogram is shown in fig 9 the axial exciting force is dimensionless by eq 4 the ordinate of fig 9 is the magnitude of the fourier coefficients from this figure it is known that after considering the blade elasticity and the flexible shaft the axial exciting force is much larger at certain frequencies which indicates that the shaft and the blade elasticity could amplify the axial exciting force when it is transmitted to the hull for example at the first order blade frequency 10 hz compared with the rigid propeller the axial exciting force has increased by about 19 after considering only the blade elasticity and has increased by about 44 after considering both the elastic blade and the shaft however in some frequencies such as the fifth order blade frequency 50 hz on the contrary the axial exciting force of the rigid propeller is the largest for example the axial exciting force has decreased by about 95 after considering both the blade elasticity and the shaft and has decreased by about 35 after considering only the elastic blade therefore the amplification effect of the shafting on the axial exciting force is closely related to the excitation frequency and it requires a more in depth analysis fig 10 is the vibration displacement of two points r r 0 95 s c 0 5 r r 0 5 s c 0 5 on the pressure surface of a blade it should be noted that only the dynamic components are displayed from this figure it is known that there are some differences between the case with shaft and the case without shaft this is because the coupling effect between the shafting and the blades changes the dynamic characteristics of the propeller e g changing the jellyfish mode of the blades at the same time the propeller is attached at the shaft and also vibrates with the shaft as a rigid body and this is also the reason why the blade vibration displacement is larger after considering the shaft 3 3 transmission characteristic at different speeds further in order to reveal the relationship between the excitation frequency and the amplification effect a series of rotation frequencies are calculated and then the axial exciting force of propellers at each frequency is obtained assume that the rotation frequency f changes continuously from 0 hz to 4 hz with an interval of 0 05 hz therefore a total of 81 frequencies are solved at each frequency the inflow velocity v 0 also changes to ensure that the advance coefficient j is always 0 889 this study defines the amplification factor of the axial exciting force which indicates the ratio between the excitation force transmitted to the hull through the propeller shaft bearing system and the initial excitation force generated on the rigid blade therefore this variable can reflect the influence of the blade elasticity and the flexible shafting on axial exciting force in the process of the transmission it can be expressed as 5 a f f x f r i g i d 100 where f r i g i d is the axial excitation force of the rigid propeller regardless of the influence of the shaft and f x is the axial excitation force of the elastic propeller including the case considering the shaft and the case without the shaft fig 11 shows the amplification factor of axial exciting force at different rotational frequencies which can be obtained by the following steps 1 select a rotational frequency calculate the axial exciting force and obtain stable time domain results like fig 8 2 the time domain results are transformed by the fft into the frequency domain results as shown in fig 9 3 extract and save the second order blade frequency and its exciting force amplitude from the frequency domain results and then the amplification factor is obtained by eq 5 4 change the rotational frequency repeat steps 1 to 3 until all the rotational frequencies are solved 5 the results saved in step 3 are plotted as curves where the abscissa is the second order blade frequency and the ordinate is the amplification percentage at each frequency because the first order jellyfish mode of the blade is 29 58 hz in order to study whether the axial exciting force has resonance peak at the first order jellyfish mode the frequency of the axial exciting force must be greater than 29 58 hz the highest rotational frequency of the propulsion shafting in this study is 4 hz so the corresponding first order blade frequency is 20 hz and is less than 29 58 hz while the second order blade frequency is 40 hz therefore this study extracts the excitation force of the second order blade frequency for analysis from fig 11 some conclusions could be drawn 1 the axial exciting force has resonance peak at the blade jellyfish mode and there is no resonance peak at the blade non jellyfish mode for this conclusion we will further explain it through theoretical analysis in section 4 3 2 when the shafting is not considered only one resonance peak exists in the jellyfish mode of blades after considering the shafting there are a second resonance peak at the axial mode of the shafting 3 the jellyfish mode of the blade is increased when the shaft is considered see section 3 for a more detailed explanation therefore the blade elasticity has an important influence on the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force and the main manifestation is that the jellyfish mode of blades has significant amplification effect on it meanwhile the shafting will also greatly change the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force and its effect is mainly manifested in two aspects one is to change the amplification range of the axial exciting force by affecting the amplitude of the jellyfish mode of blades and the other is to increase the new amplification interval by introducing the axial mode of the shaft further with consideration of the shaft the vibration displacement of two points r r 0 95 s c 0 5 r r 0 5 s c 0 5 on the pressure surface of a blade is studied fig 12 is the frequency domain displacement response of these two points in the x direction at all rotational speeds for the case of considering the shaft it is seen that besides the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shaft there is another resonance peak at the non jellyfish mode of the blade therefore in the non jellyfish mode of the blade the blade displacement can resonate while the axial exciting force does not resonate 4 further theoretical study in section 3 the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force of propellers have been studied with numerical method and some important conclusions are obtained in this section it will be studied further by analytical method thus proving the correctness of the conclusions obtained the propeller shaft bearing system is simplified as a multi degree of freedom lumped mass dynamics model because the analytical solution can be obtained for this simple model and then the system s natural frequencies modal shapes distribution and the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force are obtained by this model the details are described as follows 4 1 spring mass model with multiple degrees of freedom each propeller blade is assumed to be a mass spring system it is assumed that each blade has a mass m and an equivalent bending stiffness k the axial vibration of the shaft is also simplified as a mass spring system with a mass m and an axial equivalent supporting stiffness k for a propeller shaft system with z blades the simplified model is shown in fig 13 in this simplified model damping is neglected once the damping is taken into account it is difficult to obtain the analytical solution of the system parameters in the mass spring model can be selected as follows the unit axial force is applied at the end of the shaft to obtain the axial displacement at the thrust bearing and then the equivalent stiffness is obtained this stiffness can be used as an estimate of k similarly k can be determined as the following steps firstly a point r r 0 98 s c 0 5 on the pressure surface of the blade is select and the displacement of this point is calculated by applying the unit force along the axial direction thus obtaining the axial stiffness of this point secondly the axial stiffness of the other two points r r 0 95 s c 0 5 r r 0 9 s c 0 5 is calculated according to the same method finally the average value of these three stiffnesses is taken as the value of k after k and k are determined m and m can be determined according to the following formula 6 m k ω m 2 m k ω m 2 where ω m is the axial natural frequency of the shaft when the propeller is ignored ω m is the bending natural frequency when the shaft is ignored namely the blade root is fixed a large number of numerical calculations show that this method of determining parameters is effective and the calculation accuracy completely meets the engineering requirements zou 2017 4 2 calculation of natural frequencies and mode shapes the natural frequencies of the system can be expressed as 7 ω 1 2 ω m 2 2 1 z μ λ λ z μ 1 2 λ 2 1 2 λ 2 z μ λ ω i 2 ω m 2 i 2 z ω z 1 2 ω m 2 2 1 z μ λ λ z μ 1 2 λ 2 1 2 λ 2 z μ λ where in ω 1 and ω z 1 one is the natural frequency of the axial vibration of the shafting and the other is the jellyfish mode of blades whether the jellyfish mode is ω 1 or ω z 1 depends on the actual parameters between the propeller and the shaft ω i is the non jellyfish mode of the blades μ m m is the mass ratio ω m k m ω m k m λ ω m 2 ω m 2 is the square ratio of frequency from eq 7 some conclusions can be obtained first for a propeller with z blades there are z 1 non jellyfish modes and one jellyfish mode theoretically second the shaft has no effect on the non jellyfish mode of blades but only affects the jellyfish mode of blades therefore the conclusion in section 3 is explained theoretically that is the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has only effect on the jellyfish mode of blades if k it means that λ μ 0 from eq 7 it can be known that ω 1 ω m and ω z 1 ω m this shows that when the shafting stiffness is very large the values of jellyfish mode and non jellyfish mode are equal similar to those in fig 4 and in fig 5 at this time the elastic coupling effect between propeller and shaft can be neglected so the influence of shafting can be ignored that is the blade root can be fixed and restrained by substituting the relevant parameters of the propulsion shafting into eq 7 the natural frequencies of the system can be obtained as follows 8 ω 1 18 69 hz ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 ω 5 21 56 hz ω 6 29 82 hz compared with the first column of table 1 the differences of natural frequencies between the spring mass model and the propeller shaft bearing system are very small which indicates the effectiveness of this spring mass model the corresponding mode shapes are shown in fig 14 from this figure it is seen that the mode shapes of ω 1 and ω 6 are a type of jellyfish mode which are characterized by the jellyfish vibration of the shaft and blades the mode shapes of ω 2 to ω 5 are a type of non jellyfish mode which shows that some blades vibrate largely while some blades vibrate little meanwhile the shaft is almost no vibration this also explains why the axial exciting force transmitted to the hull via the shaft is not amplified at the non jellyfish mode of the blade in general the mode shape distribution is highly consistent with fig 6 which further verifies the validity of the spring mass model from the above analysis it can be seen that the mass spring model can effectively simulate the first order mode characteristics of the propeller shaft system meanwhile this mass spring model is deeply studied by us zou 2017 and a large number of simulation examples show that the model can simulate the first order longitudinal mode for most of the propeller shaft bearing system in engineering therefore it is feasible to study the characteristics of the axial exciting force 4 3 analysis of the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force in this section the influence of blade elasticity and the shaft on the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force is studied based on this analytical model first the displacement frequency response function frf between any two mass points can be derived h k m ω 2 1 where k is the stiffness matrix of the system m is the mass matrix of the system and ω is the circular frequency of the excitation force through derivation and mathematical simplification the frf of the displacement between each blade and the shaft can be expressed as follows 9 h m 1 m h m 2 m h m z m ω m 2 m ω 2 ω 1 2 ω 2 ω z 1 2 then at blade frequency excitation for blade frequency excitation the load on each blade is equal because there is no phase difference with each other carlton 2012 the displacement of the shaft can be expressed as 10 x s h a f t f e j ω b f t i 1 z h m i m z ω m 2 f e j ω b f t m ω b f 2 ω 1 2 ω b f 2 ω z 1 2 where f is the amplitude of blade frequency excitation force and ω b f is blade frequency circular frequency similar to eq 5 the amplification factor transmission rate can be expressed as 11 a f k x s h a f t z f e j ω b f t k ω m 2 m ω b f 2 ω 1 2 ω b f 2 ω z 1 2 100 from eq 11 it can be seen that the denominator only includes ω 1 and ω z 1 one is the first order bending jellyfish mode of the blade and the other is the first order axial mode of the shafting and ω m the first order non jellyfish mode of the blade does not appear therefore it can be theoretically explained why resonance peaks only appear in the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shaft while there is no resonance peak in the blade non jellyfish mode during the transmission process of axial exciting force after considering the influence of damping the transmission rate of the axial excitation force of the mass spring model can be obtained and compared with the results of fig 11 the comparison results are shown in fig 15 the comparison results show that the mass spring model established in this paper is effective summarizing this section it can be seen that this section has explained theoretically the conclusions of section 3 by analytical solutions for example eq 7 shows that the shafting has almost no effect on the non jellyfish mode of the blade but has a great influence on the jellyfish mode of the blade eq 11 shows that resonance peaks only appear in the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shaft 5 discussions through the research in this study two conclusions can be obtained first the first order jellyfish mode of the blade and the first order axial mode of the shafting have obvious amplification effect resonance peak on the axial excitation force of the propeller second when there is a strong coupling effect between the propeller and the axial vibration of the shafting the first order jellyfish mode of the blade and the first order axial mode of the shafting will be changed for example this coupling effect will increase the jellyfish mode these are two very important conclusions that need to be paid great attention by ship engineers first of all this shows that when we design the propeller shaft system we need to reasonably design the jellyfish mode of the blades and the axial vibration mode of the shafting so that the axial excitation force transmitted to the hull is not significantly amplified within the working speed range and is in an optimal state secondly it also shows that we can make full use of this coupling effect to change and optimize the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial vibration mode of the shafting in our previous research zou 2017 it was shown that the coupling effect strength between the propeller and the shaft was closely related to the parameters of blades such as mass stiffness etc and shafting such as shafting mass thrust bearing stiffness etc this shows that when we design the propeller shaft system we can reasonably match the parameters of the propeller and the shafting to produce a suitable coupling effect and then change the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shafting to meet the expected value therefore this study provides a new idea for the optimal design of the propeller shaft system that is to optimize the dynamic characteristics of the propeller shaft system from the coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft however at present we still cannot fully grasp how the parameter matching between the propeller and the shafting affects the strength of this coupling effect which requires further and more in depth research by scholars in this paper some approximations are made when establishing the propeller fluid structure coupling model which will lead to errors therefore it is necessary to analyze the possible uncertainties caused by this model the model errors in this study mainly come from two aspects the first error source is that the flow field model adopts bem which is based on potential flow theory and ignores the effect of fluid viscosity the 22nd ittc international towing tank conference conference organized a special discussion gindroz et al 1998 the results show that bem is effective to predict the hydrodynamic performance of propeller more importantly ignoring the viscosity will greatly reduce the calculation time which is very helpful for the fluid solid coupling problem when considering the effects of non uniform flow field and shafting vibration however ignoring fluid viscosity makes bem unable to describe finer features of the flow field such as the separation of the top vortex and the leading edge vortex the flow separation phenomenon on the blade surface cavitation phenomenon etc dong et al 2009 therefore when the propeller is at a high angle of attack i e heavy loads the bem will produce large errors however when the propeller works at the design advance coefficient vortex separation and other phenomena are not easy to occur on the blade surface so the bem is more suitable for the propeller working at the design advance coefficient in this study the calculation conditions are all carried out in propeller design advance coefficient in addition some scholars have combined bem with viscous flow theory to improve the accuracy of bem blower et al 2014 the second error source of this model is the approximate assumption in fluid solid coupling calculation in this study the fluid force caused by the vibration displacement of the blade and the fluid force caused by the vibration velocity acceleration of the blade are calculated separately ignoring the possible coupling effect between them when the blade deformation is not large many publications claim that it can be handled in this way and the error caused is not large ghassemi et al 2013 hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 li et al 2017 maljaars et al 2018a maljaars et al 2018b motley and young 2011a b therefore the fluid solid coupling algorithm in this study is only suitable for small deformation blades as to how much deformation the algorithm is effective further in depth research is needed in the future however this approximation greatly simplifies the fluid solid coupling calculation and saves computer resources and calculation time therefore this fluid solid coupling algorithm is to sacrifice the accuracy for the calculation efficiency which can be used as a preliminary estimation method in engineering and is of great significance although the approximations in the mathematical model of this paper will cause calculation errors these approximations will not affect the qualitative conclusions presented in section 6 which are the core findings and innovations of this study 6 conclusions at present there are many studies on the propeller exciting forces however most of them have not analyzed the variation law when the excitation forces generated on the blade are transmitted to the hull through the elastic blades flexible shafts and bearings the characteristics of the excitation force transmitted to the hull are the most concerned in engineering because they directly cause the hull to vibrate and radiate low frequency noise so in this study by establishing a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force are studied in depth by numerical method and analytical solutions the main conclusions are as follows the bending vibration mode of the blade can be divided into two types one is the non jellyfish mode and the other is the jellyfish mode the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has little effect on the non jellyfish mode but it has an important influence on the jellyfish mode during the transmission of the axial exciting force to the hull resonance occurs only at the blade jellyfish mode and the axial mode of the shaft and does not occur at the blade non jellyfish mode in the design of propeller shaft system if the designer only proceeds from reducing the propellers axial exciting force transmitted to the hull then the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial vibration mode of the shaft should be paid

22529,there are many researches on exciting forces of propellers however most of them have not studied their transmission characteristics the influence of elastic blades flexible shafts and bearings on forces during their transmission to the hull therefore in this study the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force of propellers are studied based on a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system which is established by coupled bem and fem the research results show that elastic blades and the flexible shaft have an important effect on axial exciting force during its transmission to the hull first there are two kinds of vibration modes for blade bending vibration one is jellyfish mode and the other is non jellyfish mode the axial exciting force has resonance peak only in the jellyfish mode second the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has large effect on the jellyfish mode and has small influence on the non jellyfish mode finally all these results are validated with analytical solution by simplifying the propeller shaft bearing system into a series of mass spring models this study can provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of propeller shaft bearing system and minimize the excitation force transmitted to the hull keywords exciting forces of propeller fluid structure interaction boundary element method bem finite element method fem jellyfish mode 1 introduction acoustic stealth is an important index to evaluate the combat performance of warships in many noise sources of warships the noise generated by propeller exciting force is the most important this is because the propeller excitation forces are transmitted to the hull through elastic propeller flexible shaft and bearings causing the hull to vibrate and radiating low frequency noise zou et al 2015 2016 as we all know the low frequency noise has some characteristics such as the slow attenuation the long propagation distance and large difficulty for control besides these common features the low frequency noise caused by the propeller exciting force has its unique characteristics some studies have pointed out that this low frequency noise contains obvious line spectrum and narrow band spectrum which are mainly caused by the blade frequency and its multiples merz et al 2010 2013 therefore it is more likely to be detected by the underwater sonar and has become a key issue for further improvements of the noise stealth performance of warships zou 2017 at present some scholars have taken some measures to control the vibration of shafts to reduce the excitation forces transmitted to the hull as much as possible dylejko et al 2007 merz et al 2010 because this kind of low frequency noise is caused by the propeller exciting force which causes the coupling vibration of the propeller shaft hull system the study on the characteristics of the propeller exciting force has important theoretical and practical application value 1 1 previous work the exciting forces of propellers are caused by the propeller working in nonuniform flow field these exciting forces are transmitted through the bearings to the hull so they are also called propeller bearing forces carlton 2012 at present although a large number of publications have studied the characteristics of exciting forces of propellers there are still some shortcomings summarizing all these studies they could be categorized mainly into two types in the first type the propeller is assumed to be perfectly rigid and the effect of the blade elasticity on propeller exciting forces during their transmission to the hull is ignored most studies could be grouped into this class for example liefvendahl and troeng 2011 studied the propeller exciting forces for a submarine hull propeller configuration dubbioso et al 2014 analyzed the characteristics of exciting forces for the propeller operating in oblique flow ortolani et al muscari et al 2017 ortolani et al 2015 investigated the propeller exciting forces characteristics while the ship was experiencing complex motions kinnas et al 2012 also predicted the exciting forces when the propeller made rigid body motions wei and wang 2013 studied the propeller exciting forces of a scale submarine model the above researches are all based on the assumption that the propeller blade is completely rigid so the effect of elastic blade vibration on exciting forces of propellers could not be captured when the propeller stiffness is large enough this assumption can meet engineering requirements however with the wide use of the highly skewed or composite material propellers propellers are more and more flexible and it becomes increasingly important to consider the blade elasticity in such cases large blade distortions and resonant vibration of blade may occur more easily which has important effect on propeller exciting forces during their transmission to the hull so the rigid assumption is inadequate to analyze the exciting forces characteristics and they should be clarified from the viewpoint of fluid solid interactions between propellers and fluid in the second type a small number of studies have taken into account the elastic effect of blades for example kapuria and das das and kapuria 2016 kapuria and das 2018 analyzed and optimized the hydrodynamic performance of the composite propeller using fluid solid coupling method based on the finite element method fem coupled with computational fluid dynamics cfd in their studies the geometric nonlinearity of blades is also included similarly he et al 2012 analyzed and optimized the exciting forces of the composite propeller using fem cfd young young 2007 2008 studied the hydro elastic performance of marine propellers based on a bem fem coupled fsi algorithm and the propeller exciting forces were also analyzed simply li et al 2017 did the similar work chen et al 2017 analyzed the longitudinal exciting force of propellers under the inflow turbulence in which the blade elasticity was also considered although these studies involve the elasticity of blades the study on the influence of elastic effect on exciting forces of propellers is relatively simple for example there is no explanation of what kind of vibration modes of blades can magnify the exciting forces during their transmission to the hull generally speaking the current researches either focus on rigid propellers or do not consider the influence of flexible shaft some studies chen et al 2019 xiong et al 2016 xiuchang et al 2017 established the elastic propeller and flexible shaft models but these studies focused on the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the propeller shaft hull system they did not use the fluid solid coupling method to study the generation of excitation force and the influence of blade elasticity and the coupling effect between the blade and the shaft on its transmission characteristics merz and kessissoglou established a propeller shaft hull model in which the propeller was rigid but the shaft and hull were flexible based on this model they studied using active or passive methods such as resonance changer to control the axial excitation force transmitted to the hull thus reducing the hull radiation noise merz 2008 merz et al 2009a 2010 2013 1 2 objective of the present work therefore based on the deficiencies of current studies the purpose of this paper is to establish a complete fsi dynamic model of fluid propeller shaft bearing system and to study the transmission characteristics of propeller excitation forces especially the influence of blade elasticity flexible shafting and elastic coupling effect between blades and shaft on them for example what kind of modes have amplification effects on the excitation forces these studies can provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of the propeller shaft bearing system the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft system is built by coupled boundary element method bem and finite element method fem in section 3 the effect of blade elasticity and the shaft on the transmission characteristics of the propeller exciting force is studied in section 4 the transmission characteristics is studied further by analytical method some important discussions and conclusions are presented in section 5 and section 6 2 mathematical model in order to investigate the effect of blade elasticity and the shaft on propeller s exciting force it needs to establish a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system in which the fluid solid coupling effect between propellers and fluid and the elastic coupling effect between propellers and shafting should be included for fluid solid coupling calculation method of propellers there are two main categories one is based on the theory of viscous flow namely computational fluid dynamics cfd combined with fem lee et al 2017 the other is based on the potential flow theory namely boundary element method bem combined with fem young 2007 2008 for the first class the major disadvantages are that it needs lots of cpu time and memory in calculation even though it could give a more accurate solution therefore at present the second method has been widely used and could obtain good engineering accuracy ghassemi et al 2013 hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 li et al 2017 motley and young 2011a b so in this study the coupled fem bem is also applied to establish the fsi dynamic model of fluid propeller shaft bearing system because the large number of previous studies based on the coupled fem bem only considered the propeller ignoring the influence of the shafting in our previous study we have extended this method so that it can take into account the effect of the shaft zou et al 2017 so in this study in order to save space the modeling method will be briefly introduced and more details on how to use the coupled fem bem to establish a fluid solid coupling dynamic model of fluid propeller shaft bearing system can be seen in reference young 2008 zou 2017 zou et al 2017 however the model in this study is still slightly different from our previous study zou et al 2017 a schematic diagram for a propeller shaft bearings system of ships is illustrated in fig 1 it consists of a shaft propeller back stern bearing front stern bearing middle bearing and thrust bearing the bearings are simplified as spring damping units the structure model is modelled by fem in fem the blade is simulated with 20 node solid elements the shaft is simulated with timoshenko beam elements because the hub is interference fit with the shaft the hub is considered to be part of the shaft and also modelled by beam elements the bearings are modelled by springs and damping elements the dynamic equations of the propeller shaft bearings system can be written as follows it assumes that there is no other loads except the hydrodynamic loads zou 2017 zou et al 2017 1 m u c u k u f φ where u u and u are the nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively m is the structural mass matrix k is the stiffness matrix including the structure stiffness and bearings stiffness c is the damping matrix including the structure damping and bearings damping f φ is the hydrodynamic load since this study is concerned with the transmission characteristics of propeller shaft system to propeller hydrodynamic force in order to simplify the calculation other loads such as the coriolis force centrifugal force are ignored although some publications point out that the influence of gravity should be considered when calculating the propeller bearing force carlton 2012 however gravity only affects the constant component of bearing force but has no effect on its fluctuating component chen 1987 he and wang 1987 since this paper only focuses on the fluctuating bearing force that causes vibration noise the influence of gravity is ignored in the model moreover this paper only studies the transmission characteristics of axial bearing force while gravity only affects the constant component of radial bearing force f φ is solved by bem which is based on the potential flow theory the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and the viscosity is also ignored consider a propeller subjected to an effective inflow wake v 0 as shown in fig 2 to avoid the need for a moving mesh f φ is solved by bem in o x y z which is a rotating blade fixed coordinate system usually fluid solid coupling computation requires a lot of computer resources and it is not easy to converge in order to simplify some scholars have made some assumptions hylarides 1979 kuo 1984 li et al 2017 zou et al 2017 the hypothesis is that if the blade deformations are not large f φ could be decomposed linearly into two parts the first part is f ϕ caused by the vibration displacement of the blade under the non uniform flow field and the second part is f φ generated by the vibration velocity acceleration of the blade in the uniform flow field young s team has done a lot of studies on this simplification and shows that it can achieve very good accuracy enough to meet the engineering needs chae et al 2017 motley and young 2011a young 2007 2008 young and savander 2011 after further derivation the derivation process could see reference zou 2017 zou et al 2017 the blade deformation velocity acceleration dependent hydroelastic force f φ could be expressed as added mass matrix m a and added damping matrix c a then eq 1 can be written as 2 m m a u c c a u k u f ϕ the whole process of modeling and solution is shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 the whole solution process is divided into two parts the first part is the fluid force caused by the vibration displacement of the blade and the solving process is shown in the left part of fig 3 considering that the geometric shape of the blade changes at each time step as shown in the block diagram in the lower left corner of fig 3 the geometric model of the blade needs to be updated at each time step when updating the blade geometry an iterative calculation is required at this time step until the results such as blade deformation thrust coefficient etc between two adjacent iterations have little change that is convergence xing 2016 xing and jin 2005 because of the linearity of equations in this study the convergence is easily achieved the second part is fluid force caused by the vibration velocity acceleration of the blade which can be equivalent to added mass force and added damping force through derivation the solution process is shown in the dashed box on the right in fig 3 when calculating the added mass force and the added damping force it is assumed that the geometric deformation of the blade is very small therefore in each time step the added mass and the added damping are the same and only need to be calculated once in the first time step of course it is also possible to calculate the added mass and added damping at each time step but the calculation time will be greatly increased there are some points to be emphasized in the fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system first the solutions of fluid by bem are obtained in o x y z and the solutions of structure by fem are obtained in o x y z then the results of fluid need to be transformed in o x y z second the structure field modeling by fem and the fluid field modeling by bem have the same nodes so that the results between each other could transfer simply and quickly in fluid structure interaction third the more the number of fe grid elements and be grid elements the higher the solution accuracy but the worse the calculation time the larger the data storage space therefore in this study the principle of determining the number of be grid elements is that the thrust and torque coefficients of the rigid propeller under the uniform flow field vary little and the principle of determining the number of fe grid elements is that the system first fifty natural frequencies vary little in present study fe model be model and their coupling calculation are all programmed and solved in matlab software therefore it is very necessary to prove the correctness of the codes program validation has been completed in our previous researches zou 2017 zou et al 2017 for example bem codes are validated by simulation calculation including the steady state and transient problems compared with ansys software fem codes are also proved to be correct including static analysis and dynamic analysis the coupled bem fem codes are validated by some simulation analysis including fluid solid coupling data transfer between bem and fem and added mass calculation of fluid and so on the fluid solid coupling algorithm in this paper makes some approximate assumptions these approximations will lead to errors and uncertainties these will be mainly analyzed in the discussion in section 5 however due to these approximate assumptions the fluid solid coupling method in this paper is faster than the commercial software method so the method in this study can be used as a preliminary estimation method in engineering and has important value 3 the transmission characteristic of the axial exciting force in this section the transmission characteristics of propeller exciting force for a propeller shaft bearings system will be studied usually the axial exciting force is transmitted to the hull through the thrust bearing base which makes it easier to excite the low order mode vibration of the hull and thus radiate low frequency noise merz et al 2009b pan et al 2002 therefore this study only focuses on the axial exciting force characteristics of propellers the characteristics of exciting forces in other directions can also be studied by using this fsi dynamic model the main parameters of the propeller shaft bearing system studied in this paper come from a real ship the propeller is 4382 which represents typical designs for container ships or single screw destroyer type ships and is widely used in real ships it is a five bladed skewed marine propeller with a maximum skew angle measured in the plane of the propeller disk of 36 and a design advance coefficient of 0 889 the geometric and material parameters are given in table a 1 and table a 4 of appendix a more detailed information such as its design can be found in the reference boswell 1971 the geometric and material parameters of the shaft are given in table a 2 and table a 4 which come from the reference chen 1987 for convenience the shaft is assumed to be a uniform cross section beam the parameters of the bearings are given in table a 3 which also come from the reference chen 1987 3 1 non jellyfish mode and jellyfish mode of propellers in this section we will describe the non jellyfish mode and jellyfish mode of propeller vibration and focus on the influence of the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft on them first the wet mode of the propeller is calculated without considering the influence of the shafting then with consideration of the shafting the wet mode of the propeller shaft bearing system is calculated comparing the two results we can find the effect of elastic coupling between propeller and shaft on the natural frequencies of propeller fig 4 is the calculation results without shafting from this figure it can be seen that the bending vibration mode of propellers can be divided into two types one is non jellyfish mode and the other is jellyfish mode which can also be called the in phase mode or umbrella mode sarkani and szilagyi 1991 xiong et al 2016 for the non jellyfish mode of propellers some blades vibrate largely while some blades hardly vibrate for the jellyfish mode all blades vibrate simultaneously and the mode shape is circumferential symmetry fig 5 is the wet modal result of propeller calculated by ansys without considering the shaft the structure is simulated by a higher order 3 d 10 node tetrahedral element solid 95 element in ansys the fluid is also simulated by a higher order 3 d 10 node tetrahedral element fluid 220 element in ansys in theory it is more realistic to use solid elements to simulate the hub however in matlab if the hub is simulated with solid elements the programming will be more complicated and the calculation time will also increase therefore in order to simplify the beam element is used to simulate the hub this may cause large errors therefore in ansys we intentionally simulate the hub with solid elements to verify that this simplification will not cause large errors from the comparison results of figs 4 and 5 it is effective to simulate hub with beam element comparing figs 4 and 5 it can be seen that the wet modal results calculated by ansys are very close to the results in this paper whether it is the modal shape distribution or the natural frequency values thus further proving the correctness of our model the calculation errors mainly come from two aspects one is that the hub in ansys is a solid element in our model the hub is simulated by beam element the other is that in our model the added mass matrix m a established by bem is not a sparse matrix and for the convenience of the solution m a is simplified zou 2017 which also results in errors at the same time this simplification destroys the symmetry therefore in fig 4 the five natural frequency values are slightly different not exactly the same as in fig 5 even if their values are equal they should be classified as different modal types four non jellyfish modes and one jellyfish mode because their modal shapes are completely different fig 6 is the results with consideration of the shaft it can be seen that blade modes can still be divided into non jellyfish modes and jellyfish modes from figs 4 and 6 and table 1 some important conclusions could be obtained first of all some of the non jellyfish modes of the blades are not affected by the boundary conditions of the shafting so the shafting has no influence on its modes as shown in fig 6 a and b second some non jellyfish modes are coupled with bending vibration of shafting as shown in fig 6 c and d however the results in table 1 and a large number of numerical examples in publication zou 2017 all show that this coupling effect has only a small effect on the non jellyfish mode of the blade the effect is less than 6 but has no effect on the jellyfish mode of the blade therefore this coupling effect has little effect on the transmission characteristics of propeller axial excitation force which is the focus of this study third the jellyfish mode of the blade has a coupling effect with the axial vibration of the shafting as shown in fig 6 e this coupling effect has little effect on non jellyfish modes but has a great influence on jellyfish modes for this conclusion we will further explain it through theoretical analysis in section 5 2 for example when the shaft is not considered the first order jellyfish mode is 21 02 hz after considering the influence of shafting it changes to 29 58 hz the relative error reaches up to 28 9 to sum up there are two vibration modes in the blade bending vibration jellyfish mode and non jellyfish mode the elastic coupling effect between propeller and shafting has little influence on the non jellyfish modes of the propeller but has great influence on its jellyfish jellyfish modes in section 4 2 it will be seen that the jellyfish modes have an important effect on the axial exciting force of propellers 3 2 transmission characteristic of the axial exciting force at 120 rpm first the non uniform flow field is introduced because it is the source of the propeller s exciting force in this study the unsteady flow field comes from the experiment data which is measured on a training ship seiun maru ukon et al 1992 for simplification only axial velocity is taken into account and the radial and tangential velocity is ignored the non uniform inflow is shown in fig 7 similar to solving the natural frequencies in section 3 two models are also calculated in this section in order to reveal the influence of the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft on axial exciting force one model considers only the propeller applying a fixed constraint at the hub and ignores the effects of the shafting the other model considers the whole propeller shaft bearings system for the case in which the shaft is ignored axial exciting force of propellers transmitted to the hull is calculated by summing up the support reaction on the hub when the shaft is included the exciting force can be expressed as 3 f x k t u c t u where f x is the axial exciting force transmitted to the hull n k t and c t is the stiffness and damping of thrust bearing see table a 3 u is the vibration displacement at the thrust bearing m the axial exciting force is dimensionless by using the following equation 4 f x f x ρ f 2 d 4 where f x is the dimensionless form ρ is the density of water kgm 3 d is propeller diameter m and f is the rotation frequency of the propeller shaft system hz it is assumed that the rotation frequency f of the propeller shaft system is 2 hz namely the rotational speed is 120 rpm then the inflow velocity v 0 is determined by ensuring that the advance coefficient j is 0 889 v 0 2 f r j since the flow field model in this study is linear based on the potential flow theory and the fluid solid coupling calculation process is also linearized the whole model is linear therefore under the periodic excitation of non uniform flow field the fluid solid coupling calculation results such as exciting force blade vibration displacement etc should be periodic the steady state in this study is defined as the state when the fluid solid coupling calculation results are periodic at a given rotational speed the steady state can be achieved by calculating approximately 20 h the transient results are removed and only the steady state results are analyzed fig 8 is a comparison of the time domain results of dimensionless axial exciting force with and without considering the shaft at the same time the axial excitation force of the rigid propeller without considering the shaft and the thrust coefficient are also given it can be seen that compared with the rigid propeller elastic blades and flexible shafting have an important influence on the axial exciting force of propellers at 120 rpm the axial exciting force is amplified by blade elastic effect and axial vibration of the shaft in order to further study the influence of blade elasticity and shafting on propeller axial exciting force at different frequencies the time domain results of fig 8 are changed into frequency domain results by using fft fast fourier transform in fft the sampling frequency is 1440 hz and the frequency resolution is 0 2 hz the axial exciting force of the first six blade frequencies in fft is extracted and compared the histogram is shown in fig 9 the axial exciting force is dimensionless by eq 4 the ordinate of fig 9 is the magnitude of the fourier coefficients from this figure it is known that after considering the blade elasticity and the flexible shaft the axial exciting force is much larger at certain frequencies which indicates that the shaft and the blade elasticity could amplify the axial exciting force when it is transmitted to the hull for example at the first order blade frequency 10 hz compared with the rigid propeller the axial exciting force has increased by about 19 after considering only the blade elasticity and has increased by about 44 after considering both the elastic blade and the shaft however in some frequencies such as the fifth order blade frequency 50 hz on the contrary the axial exciting force of the rigid propeller is the largest for example the axial exciting force has decreased by about 95 after considering both the blade elasticity and the shaft and has decreased by about 35 after considering only the elastic blade therefore the amplification effect of the shafting on the axial exciting force is closely related to the excitation frequency and it requires a more in depth analysis fig 10 is the vibration displacement of two points r r 0 95 s c 0 5 r r 0 5 s c 0 5 on the pressure surface of a blade it should be noted that only the dynamic components are displayed from this figure it is known that there are some differences between the case with shaft and the case without shaft this is because the coupling effect between the shafting and the blades changes the dynamic characteristics of the propeller e g changing the jellyfish mode of the blades at the same time the propeller is attached at the shaft and also vibrates with the shaft as a rigid body and this is also the reason why the blade vibration displacement is larger after considering the shaft 3 3 transmission characteristic at different speeds further in order to reveal the relationship between the excitation frequency and the amplification effect a series of rotation frequencies are calculated and then the axial exciting force of propellers at each frequency is obtained assume that the rotation frequency f changes continuously from 0 hz to 4 hz with an interval of 0 05 hz therefore a total of 81 frequencies are solved at each frequency the inflow velocity v 0 also changes to ensure that the advance coefficient j is always 0 889 this study defines the amplification factor of the axial exciting force which indicates the ratio between the excitation force transmitted to the hull through the propeller shaft bearing system and the initial excitation force generated on the rigid blade therefore this variable can reflect the influence of the blade elasticity and the flexible shafting on axial exciting force in the process of the transmission it can be expressed as 5 a f f x f r i g i d 100 where f r i g i d is the axial excitation force of the rigid propeller regardless of the influence of the shaft and f x is the axial excitation force of the elastic propeller including the case considering the shaft and the case without the shaft fig 11 shows the amplification factor of axial exciting force at different rotational frequencies which can be obtained by the following steps 1 select a rotational frequency calculate the axial exciting force and obtain stable time domain results like fig 8 2 the time domain results are transformed by the fft into the frequency domain results as shown in fig 9 3 extract and save the second order blade frequency and its exciting force amplitude from the frequency domain results and then the amplification factor is obtained by eq 5 4 change the rotational frequency repeat steps 1 to 3 until all the rotational frequencies are solved 5 the results saved in step 3 are plotted as curves where the abscissa is the second order blade frequency and the ordinate is the amplification percentage at each frequency because the first order jellyfish mode of the blade is 29 58 hz in order to study whether the axial exciting force has resonance peak at the first order jellyfish mode the frequency of the axial exciting force must be greater than 29 58 hz the highest rotational frequency of the propulsion shafting in this study is 4 hz so the corresponding first order blade frequency is 20 hz and is less than 29 58 hz while the second order blade frequency is 40 hz therefore this study extracts the excitation force of the second order blade frequency for analysis from fig 11 some conclusions could be drawn 1 the axial exciting force has resonance peak at the blade jellyfish mode and there is no resonance peak at the blade non jellyfish mode for this conclusion we will further explain it through theoretical analysis in section 4 3 2 when the shafting is not considered only one resonance peak exists in the jellyfish mode of blades after considering the shafting there are a second resonance peak at the axial mode of the shafting 3 the jellyfish mode of the blade is increased when the shaft is considered see section 3 for a more detailed explanation therefore the blade elasticity has an important influence on the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force and the main manifestation is that the jellyfish mode of blades has significant amplification effect on it meanwhile the shafting will also greatly change the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force and its effect is mainly manifested in two aspects one is to change the amplification range of the axial exciting force by affecting the amplitude of the jellyfish mode of blades and the other is to increase the new amplification interval by introducing the axial mode of the shaft further with consideration of the shaft the vibration displacement of two points r r 0 95 s c 0 5 r r 0 5 s c 0 5 on the pressure surface of a blade is studied fig 12 is the frequency domain displacement response of these two points in the x direction at all rotational speeds for the case of considering the shaft it is seen that besides the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shaft there is another resonance peak at the non jellyfish mode of the blade therefore in the non jellyfish mode of the blade the blade displacement can resonate while the axial exciting force does not resonate 4 further theoretical study in section 3 the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force of propellers have been studied with numerical method and some important conclusions are obtained in this section it will be studied further by analytical method thus proving the correctness of the conclusions obtained the propeller shaft bearing system is simplified as a multi degree of freedom lumped mass dynamics model because the analytical solution can be obtained for this simple model and then the system s natural frequencies modal shapes distribution and the transmission characteristics of axial exciting force are obtained by this model the details are described as follows 4 1 spring mass model with multiple degrees of freedom each propeller blade is assumed to be a mass spring system it is assumed that each blade has a mass m and an equivalent bending stiffness k the axial vibration of the shaft is also simplified as a mass spring system with a mass m and an axial equivalent supporting stiffness k for a propeller shaft system with z blades the simplified model is shown in fig 13 in this simplified model damping is neglected once the damping is taken into account it is difficult to obtain the analytical solution of the system parameters in the mass spring model can be selected as follows the unit axial force is applied at the end of the shaft to obtain the axial displacement at the thrust bearing and then the equivalent stiffness is obtained this stiffness can be used as an estimate of k similarly k can be determined as the following steps firstly a point r r 0 98 s c 0 5 on the pressure surface of the blade is select and the displacement of this point is calculated by applying the unit force along the axial direction thus obtaining the axial stiffness of this point secondly the axial stiffness of the other two points r r 0 95 s c 0 5 r r 0 9 s c 0 5 is calculated according to the same method finally the average value of these three stiffnesses is taken as the value of k after k and k are determined m and m can be determined according to the following formula 6 m k ω m 2 m k ω m 2 where ω m is the axial natural frequency of the shaft when the propeller is ignored ω m is the bending natural frequency when the shaft is ignored namely the blade root is fixed a large number of numerical calculations show that this method of determining parameters is effective and the calculation accuracy completely meets the engineering requirements zou 2017 4 2 calculation of natural frequencies and mode shapes the natural frequencies of the system can be expressed as 7 ω 1 2 ω m 2 2 1 z μ λ λ z μ 1 2 λ 2 1 2 λ 2 z μ λ ω i 2 ω m 2 i 2 z ω z 1 2 ω m 2 2 1 z μ λ λ z μ 1 2 λ 2 1 2 λ 2 z μ λ where in ω 1 and ω z 1 one is the natural frequency of the axial vibration of the shafting and the other is the jellyfish mode of blades whether the jellyfish mode is ω 1 or ω z 1 depends on the actual parameters between the propeller and the shaft ω i is the non jellyfish mode of the blades μ m m is the mass ratio ω m k m ω m k m λ ω m 2 ω m 2 is the square ratio of frequency from eq 7 some conclusions can be obtained first for a propeller with z blades there are z 1 non jellyfish modes and one jellyfish mode theoretically second the shaft has no effect on the non jellyfish mode of blades but only affects the jellyfish mode of blades therefore the conclusion in section 3 is explained theoretically that is the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has only effect on the jellyfish mode of blades if k it means that λ μ 0 from eq 7 it can be known that ω 1 ω m and ω z 1 ω m this shows that when the shafting stiffness is very large the values of jellyfish mode and non jellyfish mode are equal similar to those in fig 4 and in fig 5 at this time the elastic coupling effect between propeller and shaft can be neglected so the influence of shafting can be ignored that is the blade root can be fixed and restrained by substituting the relevant parameters of the propulsion shafting into eq 7 the natural frequencies of the system can be obtained as follows 8 ω 1 18 69 hz ω 2 ω 3 ω 4 ω 5 21 56 hz ω 6 29 82 hz compared with the first column of table 1 the differences of natural frequencies between the spring mass model and the propeller shaft bearing system are very small which indicates the effectiveness of this spring mass model the corresponding mode shapes are shown in fig 14 from this figure it is seen that the mode shapes of ω 1 and ω 6 are a type of jellyfish mode which are characterized by the jellyfish vibration of the shaft and blades the mode shapes of ω 2 to ω 5 are a type of non jellyfish mode which shows that some blades vibrate largely while some blades vibrate little meanwhile the shaft is almost no vibration this also explains why the axial exciting force transmitted to the hull via the shaft is not amplified at the non jellyfish mode of the blade in general the mode shape distribution is highly consistent with fig 6 which further verifies the validity of the spring mass model from the above analysis it can be seen that the mass spring model can effectively simulate the first order mode characteristics of the propeller shaft system meanwhile this mass spring model is deeply studied by us zou 2017 and a large number of simulation examples show that the model can simulate the first order longitudinal mode for most of the propeller shaft bearing system in engineering therefore it is feasible to study the characteristics of the axial exciting force 4 3 analysis of the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force in this section the influence of blade elasticity and the shaft on the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force is studied based on this analytical model first the displacement frequency response function frf between any two mass points can be derived h k m ω 2 1 where k is the stiffness matrix of the system m is the mass matrix of the system and ω is the circular frequency of the excitation force through derivation and mathematical simplification the frf of the displacement between each blade and the shaft can be expressed as follows 9 h m 1 m h m 2 m h m z m ω m 2 m ω 2 ω 1 2 ω 2 ω z 1 2 then at blade frequency excitation for blade frequency excitation the load on each blade is equal because there is no phase difference with each other carlton 2012 the displacement of the shaft can be expressed as 10 x s h a f t f e j ω b f t i 1 z h m i m z ω m 2 f e j ω b f t m ω b f 2 ω 1 2 ω b f 2 ω z 1 2 where f is the amplitude of blade frequency excitation force and ω b f is blade frequency circular frequency similar to eq 5 the amplification factor transmission rate can be expressed as 11 a f k x s h a f t z f e j ω b f t k ω m 2 m ω b f 2 ω 1 2 ω b f 2 ω z 1 2 100 from eq 11 it can be seen that the denominator only includes ω 1 and ω z 1 one is the first order bending jellyfish mode of the blade and the other is the first order axial mode of the shafting and ω m the first order non jellyfish mode of the blade does not appear therefore it can be theoretically explained why resonance peaks only appear in the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shaft while there is no resonance peak in the blade non jellyfish mode during the transmission process of axial exciting force after considering the influence of damping the transmission rate of the axial excitation force of the mass spring model can be obtained and compared with the results of fig 11 the comparison results are shown in fig 15 the comparison results show that the mass spring model established in this paper is effective summarizing this section it can be seen that this section has explained theoretically the conclusions of section 3 by analytical solutions for example eq 7 shows that the shafting has almost no effect on the non jellyfish mode of the blade but has a great influence on the jellyfish mode of the blade eq 11 shows that resonance peaks only appear in the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shaft 5 discussions through the research in this study two conclusions can be obtained first the first order jellyfish mode of the blade and the first order axial mode of the shafting have obvious amplification effect resonance peak on the axial excitation force of the propeller second when there is a strong coupling effect between the propeller and the axial vibration of the shafting the first order jellyfish mode of the blade and the first order axial mode of the shafting will be changed for example this coupling effect will increase the jellyfish mode these are two very important conclusions that need to be paid great attention by ship engineers first of all this shows that when we design the propeller shaft system we need to reasonably design the jellyfish mode of the blades and the axial vibration mode of the shafting so that the axial excitation force transmitted to the hull is not significantly amplified within the working speed range and is in an optimal state secondly it also shows that we can make full use of this coupling effect to change and optimize the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial vibration mode of the shafting in our previous research zou 2017 it was shown that the coupling effect strength between the propeller and the shaft was closely related to the parameters of blades such as mass stiffness etc and shafting such as shafting mass thrust bearing stiffness etc this shows that when we design the propeller shaft system we can reasonably match the parameters of the propeller and the shafting to produce a suitable coupling effect and then change the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial mode of the shafting to meet the expected value therefore this study provides a new idea for the optimal design of the propeller shaft system that is to optimize the dynamic characteristics of the propeller shaft system from the coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft however at present we still cannot fully grasp how the parameter matching between the propeller and the shafting affects the strength of this coupling effect which requires further and more in depth research by scholars in this paper some approximations are made when establishing the propeller fluid structure coupling model which will lead to errors therefore it is necessary to analyze the possible uncertainties caused by this model the model errors in this study mainly come from two aspects the first error source is that the flow field model adopts bem which is based on potential flow theory and ignores the effect of fluid viscosity the 22nd ittc international towing tank conference conference organized a special discussion gindroz et al 1998 the results show that bem is effective to predict the hydrodynamic performance of propeller more importantly ignoring the viscosity will greatly reduce the calculation time which is very helpful for the fluid solid coupling problem when considering the effects of non uniform flow field and shafting vibration however ignoring fluid viscosity makes bem unable to describe finer features of the flow field such as the separation of the top vortex and the leading edge vortex the flow separation phenomenon on the blade surface cavitation phenomenon etc dong et al 2009 therefore when the propeller is at a high angle of attack i e heavy loads the bem will produce large errors however when the propeller works at the design advance coefficient vortex separation and other phenomena are not easy to occur on the blade surface so the bem is more suitable for the propeller working at the design advance coefficient in this study the calculation conditions are all carried out in propeller design advance coefficient in addition some scholars have combined bem with viscous flow theory to improve the accuracy of bem blower et al 2014 the second error source of this model is the approximate assumption in fluid solid coupling calculation in this study the fluid force caused by the vibration displacement of the blade and the fluid force caused by the vibration velocity acceleration of the blade are calculated separately ignoring the possible coupling effect between them when the blade deformation is not large many publications claim that it can be handled in this way and the error caused is not large ghassemi et al 2013 hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 li et al 2017 maljaars et al 2018a maljaars et al 2018b motley and young 2011a b therefore the fluid solid coupling algorithm in this study is only suitable for small deformation blades as to how much deformation the algorithm is effective further in depth research is needed in the future however this approximation greatly simplifies the fluid solid coupling calculation and saves computer resources and calculation time therefore this fluid solid coupling algorithm is to sacrifice the accuracy for the calculation efficiency which can be used as a preliminary estimation method in engineering and is of great significance although the approximations in the mathematical model of this paper will cause calculation errors these approximations will not affect the qualitative conclusions presented in section 6 which are the core findings and innovations of this study 6 conclusions at present there are many studies on the propeller exciting forces however most of them have not analyzed the variation law when the excitation forces generated on the blade are transmitted to the hull through the elastic blades flexible shafts and bearings the characteristics of the excitation force transmitted to the hull are the most concerned in engineering because they directly cause the hull to vibrate and radiate low frequency noise so in this study by establishing a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft bearing system the transmission characteristics of the axial exciting force are studied in depth by numerical method and analytical solutions the main conclusions are as follows the bending vibration mode of the blade can be divided into two types one is the non jellyfish mode and the other is the jellyfish mode the elastic coupling effect between the propeller and the shaft has little effect on the non jellyfish mode but it has an important influence on the jellyfish mode during the transmission of the axial exciting force to the hull resonance occurs only at the blade jellyfish mode and the axial mode of the shaft and does not occur at the blade non jellyfish mode in the design of propeller shaft system if the designer only proceeds from reducing the propellers axial exciting force transmitted to the hull then the jellyfish mode of the blade and the axial vibration mode of the shaft should be paid
