23590,a composite bucket foundation cbf with seven compartments arranged in a similar honeycomb structure is a relatively new type of structure for offshore wind turbines field tests were conducted at a natural water pool with a water depth of 0 4 m in saturated silty sand off the coast of jiangsu to estimate the horizontal bearing capacity of the cbf the distribution of soil pressures along the skirt of the cbf with different loading steps helps in explaining the soil bucket interaction due to the deformation of the cbf the results show that an increased load will result in a significant increase in the soil pressure in passive zones outside the bucket skirt whereas the soil pressure on the skirt wall in the corresponding active zone remains largely the same moreover the suction pressure inside the separation between the bucket lid and the soil results in a potential bearing capacity with larger loading application though it will dissipate with further displacement because seepage is observed in the silty sand the load displacement relationships obtained using a fem simulation are almost in same trend with the test results when the elasticity modulus of the soils in the fem model is set approximately four or five times the compression modulus obtained from the laboratory test the rotation center of the cbf obtained from the test and fem results is approximately 0 8 skirt height below the soil surface around the bulkhead along the loading direction under the ultimate horizontal loading keywords composite bucket foundation deformation mechanism rotation center horizontal bearing capacity silty sand 1 introduction wind energy is one of the most fast growing sources of renewable energy because of the many advantages in harnessing energy from the wind china is one of the world leaders in wind power generation although many offshore wind farms are under development or operational the development of offshore wind is relatively slower than that of onshore wind in china in 2016 the cumulative capacity of offshore wind in china reached 1627 mw largely in the intertidal and shallow water regions currently the seabed soils comprise largely soft clay or silty clay and fine sand or sandy silt moreover in potential wind farm sites of china the high rise pile cap foundation mono piles and multi pile jacket foundation have been used to resist the overturning loads largely generated via wind and wave some potential challenges due to harsh sea environment and larger foundation or wind turbine structures have to be resolved to comply with the ambitious plans for offshore wind deployment such as minimizing the construction potential risks associated with further offshore development in intermediate and deep water using a moment resisting foundation type for typical soil types may offer an effective and efficient solution ibsen et al 2014 li et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2011 owing to its installation and removal in a safe and environmentally friendly operation suction bucket foundation has been considered as an economically competitive alternative to driven pile for offshore wind turbines or masts in intermediate water senders 2008 liu et al 2015a b yu et al 2015 a series of field tests on suction caisson were conducted in sand and clay for offshore wind turbine foundation which are conducted based on the following the installation and pullout of the caissons variation in stiffness in the cyclic moment loading under both dynamic and quasi static conditions and cyclic inclined vertical loading zhang et al 2013c yu et al 2014 a new calculation approach of deflection based bearing capacity for the suction caisson was proposed at any allowable angular rotation for offshore wind turbines based on the mechanisms of soil structure interaction and deflection of the caisson in several model tests in sandy silt zhu et al 2014 madsen et al 2013 studied the structural buckling of large diameter suction caissons with geometric imperfections during their installation in deep water the failure mechanisms of suction caissons in response to combined vertical horizontal and moment loading is essential to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction caissons for offshore wind turbine foundations some numerical limit analysis was used to present the undrained bearing capacity for suction caissons with different embedment ratios on normally consolidated clay wang and cheng 2016 the yield envelope in the v h v m h m and v h m vertical horizontal moment loading spaces for wide shallow bucket foundations is different compared to narrow deep bucket foundations liu et al 2014 in typical loading conditions of offshore wind turbines the experimental behavior of bucket foundations in terms of the long term accumulated displacement on sand is evaluated within the macro element approach under planar monotonic and cyclic loading foglia et al 2015 in addition centrifuge load tests were performed to investigate the monotonic and cyclic behaviors of a tripod bucket foundation designed as a supporting system for wind turbines in dense silty sand overlying a sandy silt layer kim et al 2014 a new type of composite bucket foundation cbf was proposed by tianjin university for typical sea environment in shallow and intermittent waters in china ding et al 2013 liu et al 2015b lian et al 2012a 2012b 2014 zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2013d 2014 2015 the 2 5 mw and 3 mw prototype of the cbf were installed to investigate the response of the cbf in the operational condition at the offshore site in nantong of china in 2010 and 2017 respectively see in fig 1 this wide shallow cbf has a diameter of 30 m and a relatively short skirt length of 7 m fig 1 a or 12 m fig 1 b the seven rooms arranged inside the cbf in the form of a honeycomb structure significantly contribute to safety reliability and operability during long distance wet towing produced by adjusting air cushions between the different compartments furthermore the different underpressures inside the rooms can keep the cbf from the out of verticality condition during suction installation by evacuating water inside the bucket the transition piece of the cbf is a variable thin walled cross sectional structure make of arc pre stressed cylinder concrete yellow part in fig 1 whereby the total resulting horizontal force and overturning moment from the upper tower structure are efficiently transmitted at the level of the lid of the cbf technology package of the cbf includes onshore prefabrication self floating towing unit transportation and one step installation with a special vessel in offshore wind farms in this study the main focus is on the bearing capacity of the cbf under horizontal loading the seven subdivision structures cause the deformation mechanism of the cbf more complicated to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity when loaded by the horizontal load and overturning moment demonstrating the bearing mechanism by field tests and fem models is an essential procedure for understanding the response of the cbf due to soil structure interaction and wider application in practical engineering 2 experimental equipment and design 2 1 soil the field tests were performed in a natural water pool with a water depth of 0 4 m along the coast of jiangsu in china table 1 lists the main parameters of the saturated silty sand which represent a typical soil profile grain size shown in fig 2 a of some planned wind farm site off the northeast coast of jiangsu province in the yellow sea of china the maximum and minimum and average values were obtained by several identification tests on samples of the considered soil in addition cone penetration tests cpts were conducted on test sites before the cbf installation fig 2 b and c illustrate the cone resistance q c and sleeve friction f s respectively 2 2 test model for composite bucket foundation in this study the prototype design is a 3 mw cbf with a weight of 2100 t while the weight of the rest of the structure is 710 t the model scale of the cbf is largely 1 10 because the experimental model of the cbf is made of steel instead of the reinforced concrete and steel prototype structure fig 3 shows the test model of the seven room cbf with an outer diameter d of 3 5 m and a clear wall height l of 0 9 m the middle compartment is a hexagonal structure which is slightly larger than the other six compartments a steel tube with an outer diameter of 0 66 m and height of 5 m is used for applying the horizontal loading which is welded to the top lid of the cbf and is reinforced using six ribbed steel plates the thickness of the steel structures such as tube rib lid skirt and bulkhead is the same i e 0 008 m the weight of the entire steel cbf is approximately 2 8 tons the lifting lugs attached to the tube are used to apply a horizontal load at the height of 5 m 2 3 experimental set up to obtain the soil pressure in active and passive zones soil pressure cells were fixed on the cbf see fig 4 fourteen soil pressure sensors sps with a diameter of 0 02 m and a thickness of 0 08 m were embedded in the steel plate with six in the top cover four along the skirt in the active zone and four outside the wall in the passive zone see fig 4 a b and 4 c the distances between the bottom of the cbf and the soil sensors are 0 09 m 0 33 m 0 57 m and 0 81 m along the skirt to measure the tension force and displacement of the cbf a wire tension force sensor wts was linked to the wire rope in addition two horizontal lvdts 1 2 were installed laterally on the tube and two 3 4 vertical lvdts were installed on top of the cbf as shown in fig 5 a the four displacements of the foundation structure obtained by the lvdts can determine the deformation of the cbf during the testing in addition as the structure of composite bucket foundation with 7 rooms is not rotational symmetry the vertical cross section is not same in different angle the selected one load direction is along the middle line of the side compartment mostly because the response of the foundation would remain in the worst situation in this loading direction the corresponding prototype structure is only the cover plate between beams or subdivision plates see fig 5 b 2 4 test procedures the suction installation of the cbf requires a vacuum system which helps in evacuating the air water inside the caisson through seven wired hoses connected to the corresponding rooms to the jet pump the valves connected to the wired hoses would be artificially controlled during the suction assisted installation the levelness of the cbf is adjusted by balancing the air pressure water pressure in the different rooms the cbf would be stabilized for two weeks after soil disturbance due to the suction installation before the bearing capacity tests were performed the horizontal loadings were applied using a chain hoist through the lifting lugs located at a height of 5 m the chain hoist connected to the cbf through the wire ropes were used to control the loads applied in different loading stages using another reaction pile two experiments test i and ii were carried out in silty sand and the main control values are listed in table 2 the incremental load for each step was 4 kn which was approximately 15 of the estimated ultimate loading capacity see fig 5 each load step was sustained for a certain time until the displacement was mostly steady especially in test i and subsequently the next load step was applied with an increasing in the horizontal load the duration of the holding load would be over 0 5 h when applying 37 5 of the maximum load as shown in fig 6 3 finite element model fig 7 shows the three dimensional fem model developed in abaqus which was used to simulate the bearing capacity behavior of the cbf under the load steps applied in the test the cbf made of steel is an ideal elastoplastic model with a young s modulus of 2 1 105 mpa yield strength of 345 mpa and a poison s ratio of 0 3 the soil can be assumed as an elastic plastic material in the fem model combined with the mohr coulomb failure criterion with parameters from the experiments the inside soil is restricted because of the subdivision plates of the cbf thus resulting in difficult formation of seepage the young s modulus e will be much greater than the compressive modulus e s ding et al 2015 consequently the poisson s ratio is ν 0 21 for partially drained condition the young s modulus e is considered 1 5 times the compressive modulus e s 5 mpa in the 3d fem model c3d8r elements were chosen to simulate the soil and cbf the contact pair algorithm in the abaqus with coulombs friction law is employed to estimate the contact frictional resistance of the interface between the cbf and the soil which are tied together and a slip will occur until the shear stress exceeds the ultimate frictional resistance along the contact surface fig 7 shows a typical mesh in fem model with approximately 60000 elements in x y and z directions at the bottom in the numerical model the displacement and rotation were fully fixed while the boundary condition on the circumferential surface of soil constrained the normal displacement 4 results and analysis 4 1 soil pressures the tests on the cbf to evaluate the horizontal bearing capacity were conducted several days after the penetration largely because the soil could recover to some extent from the installation disturbance around the bucket the initial soil pressures on the skirt of the cbf were approximately equal to the static soil pressure in the saturated silty sand the increment of loading steps conducted in test ii are more regular and stable than in test i therefore figs 8 and 9 show the increment decrement of the soil pressure with skirt depth in test ii obtained by using the sensors fixed in the skirt of the cbf while the horizontal loads applied on the lifting lugs at a height of 5 m based on the loading direction fig 8 shows the outside wall of compartment 5 located in the passive zone with variations in the passive soil pressures in contrast the outer wall of compartment 2 in the opposite side was loaded by the active pressure with variations in the active soil pressures as shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 8 a the passive soil pressures obtained using sensors p1 4 on the outer wall of compartment 5 located opposite to the loading direction increase with an increase in the horizontal load particularly in the middle regions along the skirt fig 8 b shows the distributions of the soil pressure increment along the skirt in the passive zone wherein a series of approximately parabolic curves are observed the middle part of the skirt gradually resists more soil pressure with an increase in the loading because of the nonlinear deformation in the soil accordingly the curves in fig 8 b show a considerable increase from linear to nonlinear behavior in the soil pressures in contrast the results obtained using sensor p 1 show a slightly increasing trend when applying 50 of the maximum load while the soil pressures illustrate a slight decrease in the first half of the loading process because of large deformation in the soil with relatively low overburden pressures as shown in fig 9 results obtained using sensor a1 4 in the active region in the outer wall of compartment 2 illustrate a decreasing trend in the soil pressure in the upper part of the skirt after applying 62 5 of the maximum load the soil pressure decreased gradually to the initial soil pressure the change in the soil pressures indicates that the wall of the cbf and surrounding soil may have been separated from each other under a bending moment because of applying a horizontal load at a height of 5 m thereafter the disturbed soil around the skirt collapsed to flow back into the crack in the upper active region of the skirt under much more rotating loading conversely the soil pressure at the bottom of the skirt wall obtained using sensor a 4 increases at the first half of the loading the soil pressure then gradually reduces to the initial value at the latter half of the loading process this behavior indicates a plastically remolded process of the soil wherein the active soil pressure on the outer wall in the loading direction unloads after the applied load is over 62 5 of the maximum load the soil pressures under the cover lid of the cbf as shown in fig 10 exhibit a typical rotation deformation under a bending moment due to applying horizontal load at a height of 5 m above the top cover of the cbf the soil pressures in compartments 2 and 7 considerably increase in the negative direction after each load step largely because cracks appeared between the top lid and the soil resulted in a suction phenomenon however the negative vacuum produced by the cover of the cbf separating from the soil in the enclosed region results in a dissipation process to some extent in the duration of holding load for each step because of the rapidly forming seepage in the silty sand in contrast compartment 5 locates in the passive soil pressure zone which leads to an increasing trend in the soil pressures because the top cover of the cbf moves towards the squeezed soil similarly the soil pressure in compartment 5 exhibits a dissipative process because of the deformation of the cbf during holding load after each loading step in conclusion the lid opposite to the loading direction will separate from the soil with an increase in the applied lateral load and suction will be generated in the separation space although the negative pressure will tend to zero gradually with time it will slightly influence the ultimate value of the bearing capacity to some extent in addition the soil pressure obtained using sensor c 1 in compartment 2 abnormally increases before applying 50 of the maximum load and subsequently decreases again compared to the results of the sensor c 2 in the same compartment the values obtained using sensor c 1 are higher after the duration of holding load until the final load step the main reason is that the soil deformation inside the cbf becomes more complicated because of the divisions by the bulkheads with the increase in the load the soil pressure at the edge of the cover shows a decreasing trend for the separation between the soil and the bucket cover however the compartments divide the soil inside the bucket into seven parts the soil at the edge in the side compartment moved towards the bucket cover instead of exhibiting a separation trend because of the deformation of the side compartment in both tests 4 2 deformation mechanism fig 11 shows the variations in the displacement of the cbf obtained using the four lvdts under different loading heights at the beginning of the loading steps the displacement tends to be stable in the duration of the holding loads in addition the tendency to be in balance between the loading and the soil resistance leads to an increase in the time required with an increase in the load fig 12 shows the load displacement relationship of the cbf under different loading steps obtained in the tests and fem simulation the curves show the inflection and extreme points the soil plastic failure occurs outside the skirt of the cbf in the inflection points however the horizontal restraint of the bulkheads resulted in a continuous increasing trend in the soil pressure in the passive zone under the lid cover of the cbf as shown in fig 10 the horizontal loading at the extreme points can be considered the ultimate bearing capacity of the cbf fig 12 shows the comparison between the tests and numerical results different elastic moduli e ranging from 1es to 5es compressive modulus are used to calculate the load displacement curves the values obtained using fem with e 3 5 es agree well with those obtained from the tests before the displacement is less than 30 mm in particular the result curve obtained using the fem model with e 4es is almost in same trend with the experimental results before the displacement is 20 mm whereas the fem curve with e 5es indicates a better tendency in estimating displacements above 40 mm at the latter loading steps fig 13 a shows the plastic deformations in the soil located outside the wall in the loading direction under ultimate horizontal loading when peeq peeq is a parameter represent the equivalent plastic strain of an element in abaqus is greater than zero it means the material yielded the points at 0 0 1125 0 225 0 3375 0 45 0 5625 0 675 0 7875 and 0 9 m located downward along the bucket skirt are selected to illustrate the peeq developments with an increase in the load in the passive zone as shown in fig 13 b there is largely no plastic strain in the surrounding soil when the horizontal force is less than 15 kn the elastic phase will be transformed in to a rapid growth phase of the plastic strain in soil after the horizontal load exceeds 20 kn thereafter the peeq in the soil around the middle upper part and tip edge of the skirt of the cbf indicates a rapid increase in the succession until the formation of parabolic distribution under the ultimate loading fig 13 shows the equivalent plastic strain of the soil wherein the soil around the middle and bottom of the bucket wall at the loading direction is in the critical plastic state the soil resistance on the right side of the rotation center in the loading direction increases gradually to the ultimate state as it reaches minimum on the left side of the rotation center opposite to the loading direction see fig 14 as shown in fig 6 a force sensor wts is fixed on the wire rope to measure the horizontal force two lateral lvdts 1 2 on the tube and two vertical 3 4 lvdts on the lid of the cbf are fixed for measuring the displacement the displacements obtained using the four lvdts are denoted as x 1 x 2 z 3 and z 4 respectively the positions of the instantaneous rotation centers x 0 z 0 of the cbf subjected to a lateral load can be then determined as follows 1 x 0 rz 4 z 4 z 3 2 z 0 l 1 x 2 l 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 where x 0 is the horizontal distance away from the central line of the cbf r is the radius of the cbf z 0 is the depth from the top lid l 1 is the vertical distance between the horizontal 1 lvdt and the lid and l 2 is the vertical distance between the horizontal 2 lvdt and the lid the tests were conducted twice at a height of 5 m above the top lid of the cbf fig 15 exhibits an instantaneous changing path for the rotation center of the cbf based on results of the test and fem model the position of the instantaneous rotation centers moves from the upper center to the bottom of the bulkhead at the loading direction with an increase in the horizontal load the rotation center under ultimate horizontal load is approximately 0 8 h below the cover surface around the subdivision plate along the loading direction the corresponding coordinate of the rotation center is approximately x 0 0 45 r z 0 0 8 h see fig 15 5 conclusions in this study the horizontal bearing capacity of the composite bucket foundation cbf with seven compartments arranged in a similar honeycomb structure is determined for offshore wind turbines the test results show that an increased load will result in a significant increase in the soil pressure in the passive zone outside the bucket skirt whereas the soil pressure on the skirt wall in the corresponding active zone remains largely the same the position of the instantaneous rotation centers moves from near the center line of the cbf to the bottom of the bulkhead in the loading direction with an increase in the horizontal loads the coordinate of which is approximately 0 45 r from the center line and 0 8 h below the ground surface around the bulkhead in the loading direction under the ultimate horizontal load moreover a potential bearing capacity with larger loads is generated via the suction pressure inside the separation between the bucket lid and the soil though it will dissipate with further displacement because of the formation of seepage in the silty sand acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51779171 51679163 innovation method fund

23590,a composite bucket foundation cbf with seven compartments arranged in a similar honeycomb structure is a relatively new type of structure for offshore wind turbines field tests were conducted at a natural water pool with a water depth of 0 4 m in saturated silty sand off the coast of jiangsu to estimate the horizontal bearing capacity of the cbf the distribution of soil pressures along the skirt of the cbf with different loading steps helps in explaining the soil bucket interaction due to the deformation of the cbf the results show that an increased load will result in a significant increase in the soil pressure in passive zones outside the bucket skirt whereas the soil pressure on the skirt wall in the corresponding active zone remains largely the same moreover the suction pressure inside the separation between the bucket lid and the soil results in a potential bearing capacity with larger loading application though it will dissipate with further displacement because seepage is observed in the silty sand the load displacement relationships obtained using a fem simulation are almost in same trend with the test results when the elasticity modulus of the soils in the fem model is set approximately four or five times the compression modulus obtained from the laboratory test the rotation center of the cbf obtained from the test and fem results is approximately 0 8 skirt height below the soil surface around the bulkhead along the loading direction under the ultimate horizontal loading keywords composite bucket foundation deformation mechanism rotation center horizontal bearing capacity silty sand 1 introduction wind energy is one of the most fast growing sources of renewable energy because of the many advantages in harnessing energy from the wind china is one of the world leaders in wind power generation although many offshore wind farms are under development or operational the development of offshore wind is relatively slower than that of onshore wind in china in 2016 the cumulative capacity of offshore wind in china reached 1627 mw largely in the intertidal and shallow water regions currently the seabed soils comprise largely soft clay or silty clay and fine sand or sandy silt moreover in potential wind farm sites of china the high rise pile cap foundation mono piles and multi pile jacket foundation have been used to resist the overturning loads largely generated via wind and wave some potential challenges due to harsh sea environment and larger foundation or wind turbine structures have to be resolved to comply with the ambitious plans for offshore wind deployment such as minimizing the construction potential risks associated with further offshore development in intermediate and deep water using a moment resisting foundation type for typical soil types may offer an effective and efficient solution ibsen et al 2014 li et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2011 owing to its installation and removal in a safe and environmentally friendly operation suction bucket foundation has been considered as an economically competitive alternative to driven pile for offshore wind turbines or masts in intermediate water senders 2008 liu et al 2015a b yu et al 2015 a series of field tests on suction caisson were conducted in sand and clay for offshore wind turbine foundation which are conducted based on the following the installation and pullout of the caissons variation in stiffness in the cyclic moment loading under both dynamic and quasi static conditions and cyclic inclined vertical loading zhang et al 2013c yu et al 2014 a new calculation approach of deflection based bearing capacity for the suction caisson was proposed at any allowable angular rotation for offshore wind turbines based on the mechanisms of soil structure interaction and deflection of the caisson in several model tests in sandy silt zhu et al 2014 madsen et al 2013 studied the structural buckling of large diameter suction caissons with geometric imperfections during their installation in deep water the failure mechanisms of suction caissons in response to combined vertical horizontal and moment loading is essential to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction caissons for offshore wind turbine foundations some numerical limit analysis was used to present the undrained bearing capacity for suction caissons with different embedment ratios on normally consolidated clay wang and cheng 2016 the yield envelope in the v h v m h m and v h m vertical horizontal moment loading spaces for wide shallow bucket foundations is different compared to narrow deep bucket foundations liu et al 2014 in typical loading conditions of offshore wind turbines the experimental behavior of bucket foundations in terms of the long term accumulated displacement on sand is evaluated within the macro element approach under planar monotonic and cyclic loading foglia et al 2015 in addition centrifuge load tests were performed to investigate the monotonic and cyclic behaviors of a tripod bucket foundation designed as a supporting system for wind turbines in dense silty sand overlying a sandy silt layer kim et al 2014 a new type of composite bucket foundation cbf was proposed by tianjin university for typical sea environment in shallow and intermittent waters in china ding et al 2013 liu et al 2015b lian et al 2012a 2012b 2014 zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2013d 2014 2015 the 2 5 mw and 3 mw prototype of the cbf were installed to investigate the response of the cbf in the operational condition at the offshore site in nantong of china in 2010 and 2017 respectively see in fig 1 this wide shallow cbf has a diameter of 30 m and a relatively short skirt length of 7 m fig 1 a or 12 m fig 1 b the seven rooms arranged inside the cbf in the form of a honeycomb structure significantly contribute to safety reliability and operability during long distance wet towing produced by adjusting air cushions between the different compartments furthermore the different underpressures inside the rooms can keep the cbf from the out of verticality condition during suction installation by evacuating water inside the bucket the transition piece of the cbf is a variable thin walled cross sectional structure make of arc pre stressed cylinder concrete yellow part in fig 1 whereby the total resulting horizontal force and overturning moment from the upper tower structure are efficiently transmitted at the level of the lid of the cbf technology package of the cbf includes onshore prefabrication self floating towing unit transportation and one step installation with a special vessel in offshore wind farms in this study the main focus is on the bearing capacity of the cbf under horizontal loading the seven subdivision structures cause the deformation mechanism of the cbf more complicated to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity when loaded by the horizontal load and overturning moment demonstrating the bearing mechanism by field tests and fem models is an essential procedure for understanding the response of the cbf due to soil structure interaction and wider application in practical engineering 2 experimental equipment and design 2 1 soil the field tests were performed in a natural water pool with a water depth of 0 4 m along the coast of jiangsu in china table 1 lists the main parameters of the saturated silty sand which represent a typical soil profile grain size shown in fig 2 a of some planned wind farm site off the northeast coast of jiangsu province in the yellow sea of china the maximum and minimum and average values were obtained by several identification tests on samples of the considered soil in addition cone penetration tests cpts were conducted on test sites before the cbf installation fig 2 b and c illustrate the cone resistance q c and sleeve friction f s respectively 2 2 test model for composite bucket foundation in this study the prototype design is a 3 mw cbf with a weight of 2100 t while the weight of the rest of the structure is 710 t the model scale of the cbf is largely 1 10 because the experimental model of the cbf is made of steel instead of the reinforced concrete and steel prototype structure fig 3 shows the test model of the seven room cbf with an outer diameter d of 3 5 m and a clear wall height l of 0 9 m the middle compartment is a hexagonal structure which is slightly larger than the other six compartments a steel tube with an outer diameter of 0 66 m and height of 5 m is used for applying the horizontal loading which is welded to the top lid of the cbf and is reinforced using six ribbed steel plates the thickness of the steel structures such as tube rib lid skirt and bulkhead is the same i e 0 008 m the weight of the entire steel cbf is approximately 2 8 tons the lifting lugs attached to the tube are used to apply a horizontal load at the height of 5 m 2 3 experimental set up to obtain the soil pressure in active and passive zones soil pressure cells were fixed on the cbf see fig 4 fourteen soil pressure sensors sps with a diameter of 0 02 m and a thickness of 0 08 m were embedded in the steel plate with six in the top cover four along the skirt in the active zone and four outside the wall in the passive zone see fig 4 a b and 4 c the distances between the bottom of the cbf and the soil sensors are 0 09 m 0 33 m 0 57 m and 0 81 m along the skirt to measure the tension force and displacement of the cbf a wire tension force sensor wts was linked to the wire rope in addition two horizontal lvdts 1 2 were installed laterally on the tube and two 3 4 vertical lvdts were installed on top of the cbf as shown in fig 5 a the four displacements of the foundation structure obtained by the lvdts can determine the deformation of the cbf during the testing in addition as the structure of composite bucket foundation with 7 rooms is not rotational symmetry the vertical cross section is not same in different angle the selected one load direction is along the middle line of the side compartment mostly because the response of the foundation would remain in the worst situation in this loading direction the corresponding prototype structure is only the cover plate between beams or subdivision plates see fig 5 b 2 4 test procedures the suction installation of the cbf requires a vacuum system which helps in evacuating the air water inside the caisson through seven wired hoses connected to the corresponding rooms to the jet pump the valves connected to the wired hoses would be artificially controlled during the suction assisted installation the levelness of the cbf is adjusted by balancing the air pressure water pressure in the different rooms the cbf would be stabilized for two weeks after soil disturbance due to the suction installation before the bearing capacity tests were performed the horizontal loadings were applied using a chain hoist through the lifting lugs located at a height of 5 m the chain hoist connected to the cbf through the wire ropes were used to control the loads applied in different loading stages using another reaction pile two experiments test i and ii were carried out in silty sand and the main control values are listed in table 2 the incremental load for each step was 4 kn which was approximately 15 of the estimated ultimate loading capacity see fig 5 each load step was sustained for a certain time until the displacement was mostly steady especially in test i and subsequently the next load step was applied with an increasing in the horizontal load the duration of the holding load would be over 0 5 h when applying 37 5 of the maximum load as shown in fig 6 3 finite element model fig 7 shows the three dimensional fem model developed in abaqus which was used to simulate the bearing capacity behavior of the cbf under the load steps applied in the test the cbf made of steel is an ideal elastoplastic model with a young s modulus of 2 1 105 mpa yield strength of 345 mpa and a poison s ratio of 0 3 the soil can be assumed as an elastic plastic material in the fem model combined with the mohr coulomb failure criterion with parameters from the experiments the inside soil is restricted because of the subdivision plates of the cbf thus resulting in difficult formation of seepage the young s modulus e will be much greater than the compressive modulus e s ding et al 2015 consequently the poisson s ratio is ν 0 21 for partially drained condition the young s modulus e is considered 1 5 times the compressive modulus e s 5 mpa in the 3d fem model c3d8r elements were chosen to simulate the soil and cbf the contact pair algorithm in the abaqus with coulombs friction law is employed to estimate the contact frictional resistance of the interface between the cbf and the soil which are tied together and a slip will occur until the shear stress exceeds the ultimate frictional resistance along the contact surface fig 7 shows a typical mesh in fem model with approximately 60000 elements in x y and z directions at the bottom in the numerical model the displacement and rotation were fully fixed while the boundary condition on the circumferential surface of soil constrained the normal displacement 4 results and analysis 4 1 soil pressures the tests on the cbf to evaluate the horizontal bearing capacity were conducted several days after the penetration largely because the soil could recover to some extent from the installation disturbance around the bucket the initial soil pressures on the skirt of the cbf were approximately equal to the static soil pressure in the saturated silty sand the increment of loading steps conducted in test ii are more regular and stable than in test i therefore figs 8 and 9 show the increment decrement of the soil pressure with skirt depth in test ii obtained by using the sensors fixed in the skirt of the cbf while the horizontal loads applied on the lifting lugs at a height of 5 m based on the loading direction fig 8 shows the outside wall of compartment 5 located in the passive zone with variations in the passive soil pressures in contrast the outer wall of compartment 2 in the opposite side was loaded by the active pressure with variations in the active soil pressures as shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 8 a the passive soil pressures obtained using sensors p1 4 on the outer wall of compartment 5 located opposite to the loading direction increase with an increase in the horizontal load particularly in the middle regions along the skirt fig 8 b shows the distributions of the soil pressure increment along the skirt in the passive zone wherein a series of approximately parabolic curves are observed the middle part of the skirt gradually resists more soil pressure with an increase in the loading because of the nonlinear deformation in the soil accordingly the curves in fig 8 b show a considerable increase from linear to nonlinear behavior in the soil pressures in contrast the results obtained using sensor p 1 show a slightly increasing trend when applying 50 of the maximum load while the soil pressures illustrate a slight decrease in the first half of the loading process because of large deformation in the soil with relatively low overburden pressures as shown in fig 9 results obtained using sensor a1 4 in the active region in the outer wall of compartment 2 illustrate a decreasing trend in the soil pressure in the upper part of the skirt after applying 62 5 of the maximum load the soil pressure decreased gradually to the initial soil pressure the change in the soil pressures indicates that the wall of the cbf and surrounding soil may have been separated from each other under a bending moment because of applying a horizontal load at a height of 5 m thereafter the disturbed soil around the skirt collapsed to flow back into the crack in the upper active region of the skirt under much more rotating loading conversely the soil pressure at the bottom of the skirt wall obtained using sensor a 4 increases at the first half of the loading the soil pressure then gradually reduces to the initial value at the latter half of the loading process this behavior indicates a plastically remolded process of the soil wherein the active soil pressure on the outer wall in the loading direction unloads after the applied load is over 62 5 of the maximum load the soil pressures under the cover lid of the cbf as shown in fig 10 exhibit a typical rotation deformation under a bending moment due to applying horizontal load at a height of 5 m above the top cover of the cbf the soil pressures in compartments 2 and 7 considerably increase in the negative direction after each load step largely because cracks appeared between the top lid and the soil resulted in a suction phenomenon however the negative vacuum produced by the cover of the cbf separating from the soil in the enclosed region results in a dissipation process to some extent in the duration of holding load for each step because of the rapidly forming seepage in the silty sand in contrast compartment 5 locates in the passive soil pressure zone which leads to an increasing trend in the soil pressures because the top cover of the cbf moves towards the squeezed soil similarly the soil pressure in compartment 5 exhibits a dissipative process because of the deformation of the cbf during holding load after each loading step in conclusion the lid opposite to the loading direction will separate from the soil with an increase in the applied lateral load and suction will be generated in the separation space although the negative pressure will tend to zero gradually with time it will slightly influence the ultimate value of the bearing capacity to some extent in addition the soil pressure obtained using sensor c 1 in compartment 2 abnormally increases before applying 50 of the maximum load and subsequently decreases again compared to the results of the sensor c 2 in the same compartment the values obtained using sensor c 1 are higher after the duration of holding load until the final load step the main reason is that the soil deformation inside the cbf becomes more complicated because of the divisions by the bulkheads with the increase in the load the soil pressure at the edge of the cover shows a decreasing trend for the separation between the soil and the bucket cover however the compartments divide the soil inside the bucket into seven parts the soil at the edge in the side compartment moved towards the bucket cover instead of exhibiting a separation trend because of the deformation of the side compartment in both tests 4 2 deformation mechanism fig 11 shows the variations in the displacement of the cbf obtained using the four lvdts under different loading heights at the beginning of the loading steps the displacement tends to be stable in the duration of the holding loads in addition the tendency to be in balance between the loading and the soil resistance leads to an increase in the time required with an increase in the load fig 12 shows the load displacement relationship of the cbf under different loading steps obtained in the tests and fem simulation the curves show the inflection and extreme points the soil plastic failure occurs outside the skirt of the cbf in the inflection points however the horizontal restraint of the bulkheads resulted in a continuous increasing trend in the soil pressure in the passive zone under the lid cover of the cbf as shown in fig 10 the horizontal loading at the extreme points can be considered the ultimate bearing capacity of the cbf fig 12 shows the comparison between the tests and numerical results different elastic moduli e ranging from 1es to 5es compressive modulus are used to calculate the load displacement curves the values obtained using fem with e 3 5 es agree well with those obtained from the tests before the displacement is less than 30 mm in particular the result curve obtained using the fem model with e 4es is almost in same trend with the experimental results before the displacement is 20 mm whereas the fem curve with e 5es indicates a better tendency in estimating displacements above 40 mm at the latter loading steps fig 13 a shows the plastic deformations in the soil located outside the wall in the loading direction under ultimate horizontal loading when peeq peeq is a parameter represent the equivalent plastic strain of an element in abaqus is greater than zero it means the material yielded the points at 0 0 1125 0 225 0 3375 0 45 0 5625 0 675 0 7875 and 0 9 m located downward along the bucket skirt are selected to illustrate the peeq developments with an increase in the load in the passive zone as shown in fig 13 b there is largely no plastic strain in the surrounding soil when the horizontal force is less than 15 kn the elastic phase will be transformed in to a rapid growth phase of the plastic strain in soil after the horizontal load exceeds 20 kn thereafter the peeq in the soil around the middle upper part and tip edge of the skirt of the cbf indicates a rapid increase in the succession until the formation of parabolic distribution under the ultimate loading fig 13 shows the equivalent plastic strain of the soil wherein the soil around the middle and bottom of the bucket wall at the loading direction is in the critical plastic state the soil resistance on the right side of the rotation center in the loading direction increases gradually to the ultimate state as it reaches minimum on the left side of the rotation center opposite to the loading direction see fig 14 as shown in fig 6 a force sensor wts is fixed on the wire rope to measure the horizontal force two lateral lvdts 1 2 on the tube and two vertical 3 4 lvdts on the lid of the cbf are fixed for measuring the displacement the displacements obtained using the four lvdts are denoted as x 1 x 2 z 3 and z 4 respectively the positions of the instantaneous rotation centers x 0 z 0 of the cbf subjected to a lateral load can be then determined as follows 1 x 0 rz 4 z 4 z 3 2 z 0 l 1 x 2 l 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 where x 0 is the horizontal distance away from the central line of the cbf r is the radius of the cbf z 0 is the depth from the top lid l 1 is the vertical distance between the horizontal 1 lvdt and the lid and l 2 is the vertical distance between the horizontal 2 lvdt and the lid the tests were conducted twice at a height of 5 m above the top lid of the cbf fig 15 exhibits an instantaneous changing path for the rotation center of the cbf based on results of the test and fem model the position of the instantaneous rotation centers moves from the upper center to the bottom of the bulkhead at the loading direction with an increase in the horizontal load the rotation center under ultimate horizontal load is approximately 0 8 h below the cover surface around the subdivision plate along the loading direction the corresponding coordinate of the rotation center is approximately x 0 0 45 r z 0 0 8 h see fig 15 5 conclusions in this study the horizontal bearing capacity of the composite bucket foundation cbf with seven compartments arranged in a similar honeycomb structure is determined for offshore wind turbines the test results show that an increased load will result in a significant increase in the soil pressure in the passive zone outside the bucket skirt whereas the soil pressure on the skirt wall in the corresponding active zone remains largely the same the position of the instantaneous rotation centers moves from near the center line of the cbf to the bottom of the bulkhead in the loading direction with an increase in the horizontal loads the coordinate of which is approximately 0 45 r from the center line and 0 8 h below the ground surface around the bulkhead in the loading direction under the ultimate horizontal load moreover a potential bearing capacity with larger loads is generated via the suction pressure inside the separation between the bucket lid and the soil though it will dissipate with further displacement because of the formation of seepage in the silty sand acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51779171 51679163 innovation method fund

23591,the dynamics of a spark generated bubble oscillating near a circular aperture made in a curved rigid plate is investigated using boundary element method the influences of the standoff distance and the aperture size on the bubble behavior are studied based on the relative value of these parameters four distinct oscillation scenarios would be recognized i two simultaneous inward and outward jets ii an inward jet directing towards the opening iii quasi or fully spherical oscillation without jet and iv an outward jet directing away from the opening in the scenarios with jet the jet can be formed in the first oscillation cycle or in the second expansion phase depending on the standoff distance and opening size a diagram is provided representing four distinctive regions distinguished by the mentioned four different oscillation scenarios the results also indicate that the damage caused by an underwater explosion bubble to discontinuous structures might not be as serious as to non perforated structures since the bubble jet would possibly not be formed or this jet is directed away from the opening the effect of opening on the bubble dynamics might be utilized in the design of the protection tanks on vessel and other practical underwater structures graphical abstract overall view of bubble oscillation near a perforated curved rigid plate i two simultaneous bubble jets ii

oscillation one of the earliest scientific studies was carried out by rayleigh 1917 on the corrosion effects of cavitation bubbles on the ship propellers the vast experimental and numerical studies carried out thus far reveal that the bubble dynamics is affected by the type of the adjacent boundary in the absence of buoyancy forces the direction of bubble liquid jet is away from the free surface

et al 2014 underwater explosion also known as undex has been found to damage the marine machines via two processes i the shock wave emitted by the explosion and ii the subsequent pulsating bubble cole 1948 zhang et al 2011c cui et al 2013 these two processes are often studied separately as they are of different time scales of millisecond and second respectively in a undex about 53 of the total energy is converted into the shock formation and the remaining 47 is for the subsequent bubble oscillation and migration nie et al 2015 researches reveal that when an undex induced bubble oscillates in close proximity to an underwater structure such as a bilge i e the rounded portion of a ship s hull a high speed jet is formed directing towards the structure that causes local damage to the structure surface blake et al 1986 cui et al 2013 naud e and ellis 1961 plesset and chapman 1971 zhang et al 2011b since the undex and the resulting bubble oscillation mechanisms are very complex experimental study is the most desired approach to investigate them cole 1948 due to the experimental cost and menace however an undex induced bubble is often replaced by the spark generated blake and

al 2011 bubbles more details can be found in gong et al 2010 when a ship s hull is attacked by undex bubbles it might be damaged deformed and perforated cui et al 2013 the bubble oscillation near a perforated plate was studied experimentally by wang et al 2013 and numerically by liu et al 2013 using boundary element method bem they found that the dynamic behavior of the bubble oscillating near the solid boundary with a hole is different from that for a bubble adjacent to the solid boundary without a hole in addition dawoodian et al 2015 studied numerically the bubble dynamics near a perforated plate in a vertical cylinder using a combined bem finite difference method the bubble oscillation behavior in the vicinity of a u shape bilge is studied experimentally by zhang et al 2011a they found an oblate collapse and a high speed jet toward the u shape bilge cui et al 2013 investigated experimentally the oscillation of a undex induced bubble in close proximity to a three dimensional bilge with a circular opening they replaced the undex induced bubble by a spark generated bubble and recorded the bubble oscillation process using a high speed camera they found various types of the oscillation scenarios by changing the opening bubble distance and the opening diameter and indicated that the damage caused by undex induced bubble to already deformed structures might not be as serious as to faultless structures since the bubble jet which is considered as a major threat would possibly not be formed the present study aims to numerically reproduce and extend the bubble oscillation scenarios reported by cui et al 2013 for this purpose the oscillation of a spark generated bubble near a circular aperture made in a curved rigid plate a simplified design of the perforated bilge employed in the work by cui et al 2013 is studied using bem the influences of two key parameters namely the opening bubble distance standoff distance and the opening diameter on the bubble behavior are examined based on these two parameters a comprehensive diagram is provided illustrating four distinctive regions distinguished by different oscillation features of the bubble using the current numerical procedure one can readily capture the bubble features and examine the influences of several parameters without needing to conduct the costly experiments it may be noted that the geometry considered in the present work is different from the one used by cui et al 2013 in that the former is axisymmetric with respect to the centerline of the circular aperture while the latter is three dimensional i e it is straight along the direction perpendicular to the image plane consequently the bubble shape in our simulation is always axisymmetric while in the work by cui et al 2013 the bubble is 3d i e it is slightly elongated in the direction perpendicular to the image plane nonetheless as shall be seen in the results section almost all the scenarios of bubble oscillation reported by cui et al 2013 can be reproduced by our simplified geometry the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical modeling is given in section 3 the numerical implementation is presented section 4 deals with the validation of the bem code in section 5 the results are presented and discussed and finally the conclusions are given in section 6 2 mathematical modelling 2 1 geometry of curved rigid plate with a circular opening in this paper the oscillation of a transient bubble near a perforated curved rigid plate placed in an infinite liquid domain is investigated numerically using bem the geometry is symmetric about the z axis see fig 1 it consists of a straight part and a curved part with a circular opening made at the center of the curved section the length of the straight part l is considered about seven times the maximum radius of the bubble r m the curvature radii r i and r o of the curved part as shown in fig 1 are set to 1 84 r m and 2 0r m respectively the bending angle of the curved surface is 90 the diameter of the opening aperture size w and the standoff distance h the distance of the bubble s initial center from the opening center i e point o are demonstrated in fig 1 it may be noted that since there were not sufficient information about the curvature radii of the curved part of the bilge in the work of cui et al 2013 the current geometry is not exactly identical to theirs in addition as also stated by cui et al 2013 due to small bubble size the buoyancy effect is ignored in all the simulations carried out in the present work 2 2 governing equations the present numerical study investigates the oscillation of a transient bubble in close proximity to a perforated curved rigid plate located in an infinite liquid domain see fig 1 the flow is considered incompressible inviscid and irrotational i e potential flow the governing equations consist of two coupled equations one derived from the assumption of irrotational flow and conservation of mass laplace equation and the other from conservation of momentum bernoulli equation in the whole fluid domain both the laplace equation and the bernoulli equation are therefore assumed to be valid these equations can be written as follows laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 and bernoulli equation 2 d φ d t 1 ρ p p 1 2 u 2 g z where φ denotes the velocity potential t is time ρ is the fluid density p and p denote respectively the atmospheric and the instantaneous pressures in the fluid domain u φ is the fluid velocity at a point x r z inside the fluid domain and g stands for the acceleration of gravity it may be noted that in eq 2 d d t is the substantial time derivative which is defined as d d t t u where t is the partial time derivative the moving boundary i e the bubble surface is allowed to deform following the kinematic boundary condition which states that a fluid element on this surface will stay on it 3 d x d t u φ the dynamic boundary condition on the moving boundary can be expressed by the following unsteady bernoulli equation which is used to update the velocity potential at this boundary 4 d φ d t 1 ρ p p l b 1 2 u 2 g z h on the bubble surface where h is the initial distance between the bubble center and circular opening standoff distance in addition p l b is the pressure in the fluid at the bubble surface which is obtained at any time from the following pressure balance equation thanks to the continuity of normal stresses 5 p l b p v p g σ κ b here p g and p v denote the partial pressure of the non condensable and that of the liquid vapor respectively κ b is twice the local mean curvature of the bubble surface and σ is the surface tension coefficient by assuming that the non condensable gas is ideal and its expansion and compression processes are adiabatic the instantaneous pressure of the gas p g can be expressed as 6 p g p 0 v 0 v k where p 0 is the initial pressure inside the bubble due to the non condensable gas k is the ratio of specific heats and v 0 and v are the initial and instantaneous volume of the bubble respectively the mean curvature for an axisymmetric surface of revolution x s t r s z s where s is the arc length r is the radial coordinate and z is the symmetry axis which is defined as nitsche and steen 2004 7 κ 1 2 κ z κ r where κ z and κ r are the principal curvatures in the z and r directions respectively these are defined as 8 κ z r s 2 z s 2 z s 2 r s 2 2 r z 2 1 r z 2 2 3 κ r 1 r z s 1 r 1 r z 2 equations 1 3 and 4 can be normalized using the following scaling factors the maximum radius of bubble r m is used for lengths 1 r m for curvature p ref p p v for pressure t ref r m ρ p ref for time φ ref r m p ref ρ for velocity potential and its normal and tangential derivatives and u ref p ref ρ for velocities therefore the dimensionless forms of the governing equations are given as follows 9 2 φ 0 10 d x d t u φ 11 d φ d t 1 ε v 0 v k 1 2 u 2 δ 2 z h κ b we on the bubble surface where h denotes the normalized standoff distance we r m p ref σ is the weber number δ ρ g r m p ref is a measure of the influence of buoyancy on the bubble and ε p 0 p ref is the strength parameter a measure of the initial excess gas pressure within the bubble 2 3 boundary and initial conditions on the bubble surface the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions i e eqs 10 and 11 are applied on the solid surface the normal derivative of the velocity potential φ n is set to be zero initially the fluid velocity on the bubble boundary is zero therefore the initial velocity potential on this boundary is set equal to zero on the solid surface the normal derivative of the velocity potential is set to be zero the bubble is initially supposed to be spherical with the dimensionless radius of r 0 corresponding to the initial volume v 0 this initial radius is the solution of the rayleigh plesset equation 12 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 ε r 0 r 3 k 2 r we 1 0 the above equation may be integrated analytically by multiplying by 2 r 2 r using r 0 at r r 0 and r 1 then the following relationship can be found between the normalized parameters r 0 k and ε 13 ε r 0 3 k k 1 1 r 0 3 1 k 3 we 1 r 0 2 r 0 3 1 0 in this work k is taken to be 1 25 for different values of ε eq 13 is then solved for r 0 using newton raphson method these parameters characterize the initial conditions of the bubble including the initial volume and pressure which are required for the initiation of the calculations 3 numerical implementation 3 1 boundary element method the boundary element formulation which relates φ and φ n on the domain boundary can be written as 14 γ g x y φ y n φ y g x y n d γ φ x 2 π x γ 4 π x ω where x is the field fixed point and y is the source point varying as an integration variable on the boundary γ of the liquid domain ω g is the green function or kernel function defined as g x y 1 x y n n where n is the outward unit normal and γ comprises the bubble surface and the rigid boundary using the scaling factors given is section 2 2 the boundary integral equation 14 can be written as 15 γ g x y φ y n φ y g x y n d γ φ x 2 π x γ 4 π x ω since the geometry is axisymmetric it can be described by its intersection with the plane θ 0 the intersection is then discretized by linear and cubic spline elements as follows the interface of the liquid domain with the rigid boundary is discretized by linear elements while the bubble boundary is discretized by cubic spline segments each element is parameterized by ς in the range 0 1 following taib 1985 the integrals in eq 15 can be integrated over the discretized bubble surface and rigid boundary to yield 16 i 1 m 0 1 ψ ς ξ 1 r z r 0 z 0 t d ς i 1 m 0 1 φ ς ξ 2 r z r 0 z 0 t d ς φ r 0 z 0 t 2 π x γ 4 π x ω where the velocity potential φ and its normal derivative ψ are approximated with constant function defined by their values at the collocation points which are located at the midpoint of the elements here m is the number of elements on liquid domain boundaries and the kernel functions ξ 1 and ξ 2 are given by ξ 1 r z r 0 z 0 t 4 r a d k η ξ 2 r z r 0 z 0 t 4 r d 3 r r 0 d z d ς z z 0 d r d ς b e η 1 η 2 b k η where a d z d ς 2 d r d ς 2 d r r 0 2 z z 0 2 b 2 r 0 η 2 d z d ς and η 2 r r 0 d in addition k η and e η are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively abramowitz and stegun 1965 k η 0 π 2 1 η 2 sin 2 α 1 2 d α e η 0 π 2 1 η 2 sin 2 α 1 2 d α approximations for these functions are available in hastings 1995 in the form 17 k η p μ q μ ln μ e η r μ s μ ln μ where μ 1 η 2 and p q r and s are tabulated polynomials equation 16 is integrated numerically using 10 point gauss legendre quadrature unless the field point x r 0 z 0 approaches point y r z in which case the integrand is singular and must be treated specially to demonstrate this let consider the singularity at point r s j z s j over segment δ s s j 1 s j to deal with this singularity the logarithms in 17 are split into a singular and a non singular contribution 18 ln μ ln μ s s j δ s 2 2 ln s s j δ s the singular contribution is now contained in the second term on the right hand side of 18 substituting 18 into 17 and subsequently into 16 one is then able to factor out the singular component special gauss integration schemes have been developed for numerical evaluation of this kind of integral stroud and secrest 1966 approximated this type of integral as follows 0 1 f β ln 1 β d β ℓ 1 n w ℓ f β ℓ and produced tables with the integration points β ℓ and the corresponding weights w ℓ it should be noted that in the present work n is taken to be equal to 7 3 2 solution procedure in the present work a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach is used to solve the problem first the field equation eq 16 is solved at a fixed time t eulerian phase and then the solution is advanced to the next time step t δ t lagrangian phase using the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions i e eqs 10 and 11 solution of eq 16 gives the normal derivative of the velocity potential on the moving boundary i e bubble boundary and the velocity potential on the rigid boundary the tangential velocity component on the moving boundary can be obtained from the known values of the velocity potential and the segment arc lengths the values of the velocity potential and the locations of the points on this boundary are then updated using kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions these equations are integrated numerically by employing the fourth order runge kutta scheme with the variable time step δ t which is defined as δ t min c 1 1 2 u 2 ε v 0 v k κ b we for the bubble surface here c is the maximum velocity potential increment on the bubble boundary between two successive time steps equation 16 is a combination of fredholm integral equation of the first and second kind the numerical solution of fredholm integral equation of the first kind is susceptible to instability problems arfken and weber 2001 therefore during the time marching process high frequency saw tooth instability may appear in the profile of the moving boundary which can be removed by using a smoothing technique as the main purpose of smoothing is to damp the relatively large wave numbers while leaving the small wave numbers unchanged in the present work the following five point smoothing formula introduced by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 for equally spaced points is used 19 ξ i ξ i ω ξ i 2 4 ξ i 1 6 ξ i 4 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 where ω 1 16 ξ is the smoothed filtered quantity and ξ is the quantity prior to the smoothing the quantity ξ can be either the coordinates of the endpoints of an element or the velocity potential on that element equation 19 is the second order finite difference approximation of a diffusion like forth order partial differential equation dadvand et al 2012 the second term the parenthesized terms on the right hand side of this equation is called the filter function which acts as an artificial viscosity added to the quantity ξ to damp higher order modes whilst leaving lower modes virtually unchanged using the value of 1 16 for ω often suffices to remove the saw tooth instability for the bubble boundary on the other hand after updating the moving boundary the nodes can become too close to or too far away from each other which may also contribute numerical instabilities in such cases the boundary needs to be re discretized it is worth mentioning that in the present work the updated moving boundary is smoothed and re discretized once in each time step to represent the trace of the computational bubble surface accurately in the absence of any sharp discontinuities for more details on the re discretization procedure the interested reader is referred to shervani tabar et al 2009 4 validation first the accuracy of the current numerical code is substantiated by comparing the present numerical results with the experimental results of cui et al 2013 in both the experimental work and numerical simulation the initial normalized distance between the bubble center and the center of opening the normalized diameter of the opening and the maximum radius of the bubble are set to be h h r m 1 342 w w r m 0 357 and r m 12 6 mm it should be noted that the standoff distance h considered here is sufficiently large in addition the curvature of the plate is relatively small as such the bubble may not much be affected by the curvature shape of the adjacent rigid boundary consequently the bubble is expected to oscillate nearly axisymmetrically with respect to the axis of the circular hole even in the three dimensional work of cui et al 2013 and this comparison is reasonable in the numerical simulation the strength parameter ε is considered equal to 10 and the associated initial normalized radius of the bubble is calculated to be equal to r 0 0 35334 using eq 13 in addition nominally 25 elements were used on the half bubble surface and 173 elements were used on the equivalent portion of the rigid boundary the numerical simulations are conducted with considering the buoyancy effects δ 0 0485 and with ignoring the buoyancy effect δ 0 as depicted by dashed and solid lines respectively seven frames of the bubble oscillation are demonstrated in fig 2 and compared with the experimental work of cui et al 2013 due to small size of the bubble the buoyancy has negligible effect on its behavior the same observation was reported by cui et al 2013 as such the buoyancy effect is ignored δ 0 and the geometry is rotated 45 counterclockwise in all the simulations carried out in the present work in both the experimental and numerical presentations the bubble undergoes spherical expansion as displayed in the first three frames in fig 2 and it reaches its maximum volume in frame 3 then the bubble starts the collapse phase and becomes slightly oblate due to the presence of the perforated plate as can be seen in frame 6 of fig 2 the bubble is in minimum size at the end of the first period of its lifetime and a jet is initiated at far side of the bubble directed towards the opening this may be due to the fact that the diameter of the opening is much smaller than the bubble s maximum size and the bubble behaves as if it oscillates near a rigid boundary without opening subsequently a second expansion of the bubble with developed jet is observed in frame 7 the comparison demonstrates a reasonable agreement between the experiments and numerical results all the important phenomena have been captured quite well by the numerical simulation the main discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are associated with the time so that the numerical times are smaller than those of the experiments the time differences may be attributed to a neglecting the viscosity effects in the simulations b being unable to exactly match link the initial conditions of the experiments and simulations and c dissimilarity of the solid geometry in the simulations and experiments due to insufficient information about the curvature radius of the hole in the experimental work of cui et al 2013 5 results and discussion in this section the results of the current study are demonstrated and discussed the bubble dynamics when oscillating near a perforated curved plate placed in an infinite liquid domain is investigated using bem first the influence of the opening size and then the effect of the standoff distance on the bubble dynamics are considered finally from the overall view of the bubble oscillation near the perforated curved plate a general chart based on the opening size w and standoff distance h is prepared in order to distinguish the conditions under which the perforated plate is prevented from being affected by the bubble jet these conditions are associated with the cases where the bubble either oscillates without any jetting induced or it oscillates with an outward jet directing away from the opening 5 1 effect of the opening size in this section the effect of the opening size w on the bubble dynamics when oscillating near the perforated curved plate is investigated for this purpose five different opening sizes w of 0 595 0 907 1 27 1 627 and 1 905 are considered in the all cases the standoff distance is kept constant at h 0 8 also the strength parameter of the bubble ε is set equal to 10 which is pertinent to the initial normalized radius of the bubble r 0 of 0 35334 obtained from eq 13 furthermore nominally 25 elements were used on the half bubble surface and 173 elements were used on the equivalent portion of the rigid boundary 5 1 1 case a w 0 595 in this case a the bubble is initiated at the standoff distance h 0 8 near a curved plate with an opening having the normalized size w 0 595 the time evolution of the bubble oscillations is depicted in six frames in fig 3 a in the expansion phase due to small size of the opening and small standoff distance the bubble dose not expand spherically but part of the bubble which is adjacent to the opening is bulging and gradually squeezed inside the opening see frames 2 and 3 of fig 3a at the final stages of the expansion phase however part of the bubble adjacent to the opening is returned again and at the maximum size of the bubble t 1 49044 ms an outwards jet directing away from the opening is observed see frame 4 of fig 3a due to the high pressure region between the bubble and the opening this would imply that the bubble would sense the presence of the opening then the collapsing phase of the bubble occurs and the aforesaid jet is developed finally at t 2 36303 ms this jet is fully developed and impacts to the opposite side of the bubble and a toroidal shape bubble is formed 5 1 2 case b w 0 907 in the case b the normalized diameter of the opening is considered larger than that in case a w 0 907 the results are shown in fig 3b it is evident that similar to the case a in expansion phase part of the bubble which is adjacent to the opening is bulging and gradually squeezed inside the opening see frames 2 and 3 of fig 3b but due to larger size of the opening in the case b at the maximum size of the bubble t 1 45743 ms adjacent part of the bubble to opening is still squeezed inside the opening frame 4 of fig 3b it is also apparent that the time period of the expansion phase for case b is shorter than that for case a because in the latter case the bubble s expansion is more constrained by the effective presence of the plate wall then the bubble starts its collapse phase during which an outward jet directing away from the opening is formed on the part of the bubble which is adjacent to opening the jet is developing and at the final stage of the bubble collapse phase t 2 56658 ms the reentrant jet penetrates the opposite side of the bubble and creates a toroidal bubble see frame 7 of fig 3b another important point to note is that by increasing the opening diameter the jet impact to the opposite side of the bubble occurs later 5 1 3 case c w 1 27 in this case c the normalized diameter of the opening is set equal to w 1 27 see fig 3c here due to wider extent of the opening the bubble expands almost spherically comparing to the previous two cases however at the maximum size of the bubble t 1 45606 ms part of the bubble surface close to the opening is slightly protruding see frame 4 of fig 3c again by increasing the opening size and hence decreasing the influence of the plate wall the time period of the bubble expansion phase decreases then the bubble starts its collapse phase to be followed by creation of an outwards jet on part of the bubble surface close to the opening the jet is directing away from the opening comparing with the cases a and b in this case c the width of the reentrant jet impacting on the opposite side of the bubble becomes wider and the penetration depth of this jet is shorter according to frame 7 of fig 3c at the end of the first cycle of the bubble oscillation t 2 88984 ms the jet has not impacted to the opposite side of the bubble afterwards the bubble begins its second oscillation cycle expands and the liquid jet penetrates the opposite side of the bubble again the time period of the first expansion phase decreases as the diameter of the opening is increased 5 1 4 case d w 1 627 in this case d the normalized diameter of the opening is considered to be w 1 627 the time evolution of the bubble is demonstrated in fig 3d since the opening size is larger in comparison with the previous cases the bubble expands rather spherically during the expansion phase and reaches its maximum size earlier at t 1 43544 ms frame 4 of fig 3d furthermore bulge on part of the bubble close to the opening is not observed during the initial stages of the collapse phase a small dimple appears on part of the bubble close to the opening and eventually an outwards wide extent and short depth jet directing away from the opening is observed the first cycle of the bubble oscillation is terminated at t 2 87708 ms frame 7 of fig 3d then the second cycle expansion of the bubble begins due to presence of non condensable gas inside it and the aforesaid jet is developed see frame 8 of fig 3d 5 1 5 case e w 1 905 in the case e shown in fig 3e the opening size is set equal to w 1 905 again spherical expansion of the bubble and its shorter expansion time are clearly evident the bubble achieves its maximum size at t 1 42591 ms see frame 4 of fig 3e in the collapse phase part of the bubble close to the opening is slightly flattened see frames 5 and 6 of fig 3e then at the end of first period frame 7 of fig 3e t 2 86733 ms an outwards short depth jet directing away from the opening is observed which is not impact the opposite side of the bubble according to frame 8 of fig 3e the second expansion of the bubble is started and again the aforementioned reentrant jet is developed in general comparison between all the above cases demonstrates that for a constant standoff distance as the opening size is increased i the bubble reaches its maximum size earlier and its spherical expansion becomes more probable ii the width and penetration depth of the reentrant jet formed on the part of the bubble surface close to the opening become wider and shorter respectively and iii second expansion of the bubble becomes more likely to happen in contrast as the opening size is decreased the formation of toroidal bubble at the first cycle of bubble oscillation becomes more apparent fig 4 illustrates the motion of bubble centroid for the cases considered in fig 3 it is obviously clear that for all the cases except case a the bubble is attracted by the opening at initial stages of the expansion phase this attraction becomes weaker as the opening size increases and hence the effects of solid boundary of the plate on the bubble behavior decrease in the case a the bubble at early stages of the expansion phase is first repelled and then attracted by the opening at later stages of the expansion phase the bubble migrates away from the opening for the all cases this repelling of the bubble by the opening occurs earlier as the opening size is decreased in the all cases the bubble migrates away from the opening during the initial stages of the collapse phase but at final stages of the collapse phase again the bubble moves towards the opening furthermore since the bubble oscillation is more restricted by the solid boundary of the plate for smaller opening sizes the attraction period of time is more prolonged 5 2 effect of the standoff distance in order to study the effect of the standoff distance on the bubble oscillation near a perforated curved plate four different standoff distances h 0 8 1 136 1 436 and 2 0 are considered for all the four cases the opening size strength parameter and initial normalized radius of the bubble are chosen equal to w 0 907 ε 10 and r 0 0 35334 respectively the time history of the bubble evolution for the mentioned four cases is demonstrated in fig 5 again 25 elements were used on the half bubble surface and 173 elements were used on the equivalent portion of the rigid boundary 5 2 1 case a h 0 8 fig 5 a shows the oscillation of the bubble initiated at the standoff distance h 0 8 it can be seen that during the expansion phase of the bubble see frames 1 4 of fig 5a part of the bubble close to the opening is bulging and gradually squeezed inside the opening the bubble attains its maximum size at t 1 45743 ms see frame 4 of fig 5a then the bubble enters its collapse phase during which an outward liquid jet directing away from the opening develops at time t 2 56658 ms the jet becomes fully developed and impacts the opposite side of the bubble see frame 7 of fig 5a the jet tends to pierce the bubble and form a toroidal bubble not shown 5 2 2 case b h 1 136 in this case b the standoff distance h is increased to 1 136 while the opening size w is fixed at 0 907 the time evolution of the bubble is depicted in fig 5b it is clearly obvious that the bubble undergoes almost spherical expansion and part of the bubble close to the opening is slightly bulging and attracted by the opening frames 1 4 in fig 5b according to the frame 4 the maximum size of the bubble occurs at t 1 46574 ms then the collapse phase of the bubble is initiated and a jet with short penetration depth directing away from the opening develops this bubble completes its first oscillation cycle at t 2 92928 ms frame 7 in fig 5b and before the jet touches the opposite side of the bubble the bubble starts the second expansion phase according to frame 8 of fig 5b from the comparison of the case a and case b in fig 5 it is concluded that for a fixed opening size a larger standoff distance would result in a less squeeze of the bubble inside the opening as well as a shorter penetration depth of the jet this may be due to the fact that as the standoff distance increases the pressure of the region located between the bubble and the plate is attenuated 5 2 3 case c h 1 434 in the case c the standoff distance is further increased to h 1 434 the results are given in fig 5c it is observed that the bubble preserves spherical shape during its expansion phase and reaches its maximum size at t 1 46742 ms frame 4 in fig 5c then the bubble initiates its contraction phase without any jetting induced and part of the bubble close to the opening is flattened due to the high pressure region between the bubble and the plate the bubble ends its first oscillation cycle at t 2 92494 ms frame 7 in fig 5c and then starts its second expansion phase see frame 8 in fig 5c 5 2 4 case d h 2 0 fig 5d demonstrates the bubble configurations during its first oscillation cycle and second expansion phase when initiated at the standoff distance h 2 0 it is obvious that the bubble experiences spherical expansion and contraction phases without any jetting induced comparison between all the four cases studied in section 5 2 ascertains that for a fixed opening size as the standoff distance increases the pressure of the region located between the bubble and the plate is attenuated the bubble jet formation become weaker and hence the spherical oscillation of the bubble become more plausible in contrast by decreasing the standoff distance non spherical collapse of the bubble and formation of a toroidal bubble during the first oscillation cycle becomes more appreciable the movement of the bubble centroid associated with all the cases studied in section 5 2 is depicted in fig 6 it is observed that the bubble is first attracted and then repelled by the opening finally the bubble moves back towards the opening the attraction and repelling of the bubble by the opening becomes stronger as the standoff distance is decreased 5 3 overall results of the bubble behavior when oscillating near the perforated curved plate it was shown in previous sections that the bubble behavior is highly dependent on two key parameters namely the normalized opening size w and the standoff distance h in general based on the relative value of these two parameters four distinct oscillation scenarios of the bubble can be recognized see fig 7 these scenarios are i two simultaneous jets inward and outward jets ii inward jet an inward jet directing towards the opening iii quasi or fully spherical oscillation without jet and iv outward jet an outwards jet directing away from the opening in the scenarios with jet the jet can be formed in the first oscillation cycle or in the second expansion phase depending on the standoff distance and opening size in region i there observed two simultaneous inward and outward jets in this region for a certain opening size by increasing the standoff distance the penetration depth of the outward jet is decreased finally this outward jet vanishes and only the inward jet will exist see region ii it is obvious that the regions i and ii are regions where the perforated plate may be damaged due to attack of the inward jet in region ii increment of the standoff distance at a fixed opening size causes the inward jet to become weaker and finally vanish and the bubble oscillates spherically without any jetting induced this scenario of spherical oscillation of the bubble without jet is depicted as region iii in region iii the presence of the curved plate with opening is not felt by the bubble hence the bubble collapses spherically without any jet and the second expansion of the bubble is also spherical fig 7 shows that in region i for a fixed value of standoff distance by increasing the opening size the penetration depth of the inward jet is decreased and eventually the inward jet disappears and only an outward jet is remained which is identified by the region iv the regions iii and iv have not any threat to the curved plate with opening due to absence of the jet and outward direction of the jet respectively actually the regions iii and iv are safe regions for the perforated plate in general there exists no threat in the regions with w 0 95 irrespective of the value of the standoff distance due to the absence of the inward jet it should be noted that these scenarios can happen either in the first cycle of bubble lifetime or in the second expansion phase in addition for smaller standoff distances and smaller opening sizes the possibility of squeezing the bubble inside the opening during the expansion phase in the first period becomes more appreciated see section 5 2 the results also indicate that the damage caused by undex bubble to discontinuous or deformed structures might not be as serious as to non perforated flawless structures since the bubble jet which is a significant menace would possibly not be formed or this jet is directed away from the opening in their recent experimental study cui et al 2013 explained that the effect of the circular opening and possibly other discontinuous boundaries on the bubble dynamics especially bubble jets might be utilized in the design of the protection tanks on vessel and other practical underwater structures the results of current study confirm the statement 6 conclusions the dynamics of a spark generated bubble oscillating near a curved plate with a circular opening is studied numerically using bem the standoff distance and the opening size are two key parameters influencing the bubble behavior based on the relative value of these two parameters four distinct oscillation scenarios of the bubble were recognized i two simultaneous jets inward and outward jets ii inward jet an inward jet directing towards the opening iii quasi or fully spherical oscillation without jet and iv outward jet an outwards

and tong 2008 sankin et al 2010 gonzalez avila et al 2012 rayleigh 1917 corrosion of the ship propellers turbine blades and hydraulic machineries are among the destructive effects of the bubble oscillation one of the earliest scientific studies was carried out by rayleigh 1917 on the corrosion effects of cavitation bubbles on the ship propellers the vast experimental and numerical studies carried out thus far reveal that the bubble dynamics is affected by the type of the adjacent boundary in the absence of buoyancy forces the direction of bubble liquid jet is away from the free surface

et al 2014 underwater explosion also known as undex has been found to damage the marine machines via two processes i the shock wave emitted by the explosion and ii the subsequent pulsating bubble cole 1948 zhang et al 2011c cui et al 2013 these two processes are often studied separately as they are of different time scales of millisecond and second respectively in a undex about 53 of the total energy is converted into the shock formation and the remaining 47 is for the subsequent bubble oscillation and migration nie et al 2015 researches reveal that when an undex induced bubble oscillates in close proximity to an underwater structure such as a bilge i e the rounded portion of a ship s hull a high speed jet is formed directing towards the structure that causes local damage to the

experimental study is the most desired approach to investigate them cole 1948 due to the experimental cost and menace however an undex induced bubble is often replaced by the spark generated blake and

al 2011 bubbles more details can be found in gong et al 2010 when a ship s hull is attacked by undex bubbles it might be damaged deformed and perforated cui et al 2013 the bubble oscillation near a perforated plate was studied experimentally by wang et al 2013 and numerically by liu et al 2013 using boundary element method bem they found that the dynamic behavior of the bubble oscillating near the solid boundary with a hole is different from that for a bubble adjacent to the solid boundary without a hole in addition dawoodian et al 2015 studied numerically the bubble dynamics near a perforated plate in a vertical cylinder using a combined bem finite difference method the bubble oscillation behavior in the vicinity of a u shape bilge is studied experimentally by zhang et al 2011a they found an oblate collapse and a high speed jet toward the u shape bilge cui et al 2013 investigated experimentally the oscillation of a undex induced bubble in close proximity to a three dimensional bilge with a circular opening they replaced the undex induced bubble by a spark generated bubble and recorded the bubble oscillation process using a high speed camera they found various types of the oscillation scenarios by changing the opening bubble distance and the opening diameter and indicated that the damage caused by undex induced bubble to already deformed structures might not be as serious as to faultless structures since the bubble jet which is considered as a major threat would possibly not be formed the present study aims to numerically reproduce and extend the bubble oscillation scenarios reported by cui et al 2013 for this purpose the oscillation of a spark generated bubble near a circular aperture made in a curved rigid plate a simplified design of the perforated bilge employed in the work by cui et al 2013 is studied using bem the influences of two key parameters namely the opening bubble distance standoff distance and the opening diameter on the bubble behavior are examined based on these two parameters a comprehensive diagram is provided illustrating four distinctive regions distinguished by different oscillation features of the bubble using the current numerical procedure one can readily capture the bubble features and examine the influences of several parameters without needing to conduct the costly experiments it may be noted that the geometry considered in the present work is different from the one used by cui et al 2013 in that the former is axisymmetric with respect to the centerline of the circular aperture while the latter is three dimensional i e it is straight along the direction perpendicular to the image plane consequently the bubble shape in our simulation is always axisymmetric while in the work by cui et al 2013 the bubble is 3d i e it is slightly elongated in the direction perpendicular to the image plane nonetheless as shall be seen in the results section almost all the scenarios of bubble oscillation reported by cui et al 2013 can be reproduced by our simplified geometry the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the mathematical modeling is given in section 3 the numerical implementation is presented section 4 deals with the validation of the bem code in section 5 the results are presented and discussed and finally the conclusions are given in section 6 2 mathematical modelling 2 1 geometry of curved rigid plate with a circular opening in this paper the oscillation of a transient bubble near a perforated curved rigid plate placed in an infinite liquid domain is investigated numerically using bem the geometry is symmetric about the z axis see fig 1 it consists of a straight part and a curved part with a circular opening made at the center of the curved section the length of the straight part l is considered about seven times the maximum radius of the bubble r m the curvature radii r i and r o of the curved part as shown in fig 1 are set to 1 84 r m and 2 0r m respectively the bending angle of the curved surface is 90 the diameter of the opening aperture size w and the standoff distance h the distance of the bubble s initial center from the opening center i e point o are demonstrated in fig 1 it may be noted that since there were not sufficient information about the curvature radii of the curved part of the bilge in the work of cui et al 2013 the current geometry is not exactly identical to theirs in addition as also stated by cui et al 2013 due to small bubble size the buoyancy effect is ignored in all the simulations carried out in the present work 2 2 governing equations the present numerical study investigates the oscillation of a transient bubble in close proximity to a perforated curved rigid plate located in an infinite liquid domain see fig 1 the flow is considered incompressible inviscid and irrotational i e potential flow the governing equations consist of two coupled equations one derived from the assumption of irrotational flow and conservation of mass laplace equation and the other from conservation of momentum bernoulli equation in the whole fluid domain both the laplace equation and the bernoulli equation are therefore assumed to be valid these equations can be written as follows laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 and bernoulli equation 2 d φ d t 1 ρ p p 1 2 u 2 g z where φ denotes the velocity potential t is time ρ is the fluid density p and p denote respectively the atmospheric and the instantaneous pressures in the fluid domain u φ is the fluid velocity at a point x r z inside the fluid domain and g stands for the acceleration of gravity it may be noted that in eq 2 d d t is the substantial time derivative which is defined as d d t t u where t is the partial time derivative the moving boundary i e the bubble surface is allowed to deform following the kinematic boundary condition which states that a fluid element on this surface will stay on it 3 d x d t u φ the dynamic boundary condition on the moving boundary can be expressed by the following unsteady bernoulli equation which is used to update the velocity potential at this boundary 4 d φ d t 1 ρ p p l b 1 2 u 2 g z h on the bubble surface where h is the initial distance between the bubble center and circular opening standoff distance in addition p l b is the pressure in the fluid at the bubble surface which is obtained at any time from the following pressure balance equation thanks to the continuity of normal stresses 5 p l b p v p g σ κ b here p g and p v denote the partial pressure of the non condensable and that of the liquid vapor respectively κ b is twice the local mean curvature of the bubble surface and σ is the surface tension coefficient by assuming that the non condensable gas is ideal and its expansion and compression processes are adiabatic the instantaneous pressure of the gas p g can be expressed as 6 p g p 0 v 0 v k where p 0 is the initial pressure inside the bubble due to the non condensable gas k is the ratio of specific heats and v 0 and v are the initial and instantaneous volume of the bubble respectively the mean curvature for an axisymmetric surface of revolution x s t r s z s where s is the arc length r is the radial coordinate and z is the symmetry axis which is defined as nitsche and steen 2004 7 κ 1 2 κ z κ r where κ z and κ r are the principal curvatures in the z and r directions respectively these are defined as 8 κ z r s 2 z s 2 z s 2 r s 2 2 r z 2 1 r z 2 2 3 κ r 1 r z s 1 r 1 r z 2 equations 1 3 and 4 can be normalized using the following scaling factors the maximum radius of bubble r m is used for lengths 1 r m for curvature p ref p p v for pressure t ref r m ρ p ref for time φ ref r m p ref ρ for velocity potential and its normal and tangential derivatives and u ref p ref ρ for velocities therefore the dimensionless forms of the governing equations are given as follows 9 2 φ 0 10 d x d t u φ 11 d φ d t 1 ε v 0 v k 1 2 u 2 δ 2 z h κ b we on the bubble surface where h denotes the normalized standoff distance we r m p ref σ is the weber number δ ρ g r m p ref is a measure of the influence of buoyancy on the bubble and ε p 0 p ref is the strength parameter a measure of the initial excess gas pressure within the bubble 2 3 boundary and initial conditions on the bubble surface the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions i e eqs 10 and 11 are applied on the solid surface the normal derivative of the velocity potential φ n is set to be zero initially the fluid velocity on the bubble boundary is zero therefore the initial velocity potential on this boundary is set equal to zero on the solid surface the normal derivative of the velocity potential is set to be zero the bubble is initially supposed to be spherical with the dimensionless radius of r 0 corresponding to the initial volume v 0 this initial radius is the solution of the rayleigh plesset equation 12 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 ε r 0 r 3 k 2 r we 1 0 the above equation may be integrated analytically by multiplying by 2 r 2 r using r 0 at r r 0 and r 1 then the following relationship can be found between the normalized parameters r 0 k and ε 13 ε r 0 3 k k 1 1 r 0 3 1 k 3 we 1 r 0 2 r 0 3 1 0 in this work k is taken to be 1 25 for different values of ε eq 13 is then solved for r 0 using newton raphson method these parameters characterize the initial conditions of the bubble including the initial volume and pressure which are required for the initiation of the calculations 3 numerical implementation 3 1 boundary element method the boundary element formulation which relates φ and φ n on the domain boundary can be written as 14 γ g x y φ y n φ y g x y n d γ φ x 2 π x γ 4 π x ω where x is the field fixed point and y is the source point varying as an integration variable on the boundary γ of the liquid domain ω g is the green function or kernel function defined as g x y 1 x y n n where n is the outward unit normal and γ comprises the bubble surface and the rigid boundary using the scaling factors given is section 2 2 the boundary integral equation 14 can be written as 15 γ g x y φ y n φ y g x y n d γ φ x 2 π x γ 4 π x ω since the geometry is axisymmetric it can be described by its intersection with the plane θ 0 the intersection is then discretized by linear and cubic spline elements as follows the interface of the liquid domain with the rigid boundary is discretized by linear elements while the bubble boundary is discretized by cubic spline segments each element is parameterized by ς in the range 0 1 following taib 1985 the integrals in eq 15 can be integrated over the discretized bubble surface and rigid boundary to yield 16 i 1 m 0 1 ψ ς ξ 1 r z r 0 z 0 t d ς i 1 m 0 1 φ ς ξ 2 r z r 0 z 0 t d ς φ r 0 z 0 t 2 π x γ 4 π x ω where the velocity potential φ and its normal derivative ψ are approximated with constant function defined by their values at the collocation points which are located at the midpoint of the elements here m is the number of elements on liquid domain boundaries and the kernel functions ξ 1 and ξ 2 are given by ξ 1 r z r 0 z 0 t 4 r a d k η ξ 2 r z r 0 z 0 t 4 r d 3 r r 0 d z d ς z z 0 d r d ς b e η 1 η 2

and stegun 1965 k η 0 π 2 1 η 2 sin 2 α 1 2 d α e η 0 π 2 1 η 2 sin 2 α 1 2 d α approximations for these functions are available in hastings 1995 in the form 17 k η p μ q μ ln μ e η r μ s μ ln μ where μ 1 η 2 and p q r and s are tabulated polynomials equation 16 is integrated numerically using 10 point gauss legendre quadrature unless the field point x r 0 z 0 approaches point y r z in which case the integrand is singular and must be treated specially to demonstrate this let consider the singularity at point r s j z s j over segment δ s s j 1 s j to deal with this singularity the logarithms in 17 are split into a singular and a non singular contribution 18 ln μ ln μ s s j δ s 2 2 ln s s j δ s the singular contribution is now contained in the second term on the right hand side of 18 substituting 18 into 17 and subsequently into 16 one is then able to factor out the singular component special gauss integration schemes have been developed for numerical evaluation of this kind of integral stroud and secrest 1966 approximated this type of integral as follows 0 1 f β ln 1 β d β ℓ 1 n w ℓ f β ℓ and produced tables with the integration points β ℓ and the corresponding weights w ℓ it should be noted that in the present work n is taken to be equal to 7 3 2 solution procedure in the present work a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach is used to solve the problem first the field equation eq 16 is solved at a fixed time t eulerian phase and then the solution is advanced to the next time step t δ t lagrangian phase using the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions i e eqs 10 and 11 solution of eq 16 gives the normal derivative of the velocity potential on the moving boundary i e bubble boundary and the velocity potential on the rigid boundary the tangential velocity component on the moving boundary can be obtained from the known values of the velocity potential and the segment arc lengths the values of the velocity potential and the locations of the points on this boundary are then updated using kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions these equations are integrated numerically by employing the fourth order runge kutta scheme with the variable time step δ t which is defined as δ t min c 1 1 2 u 2 ε v 0 v k κ b we for the bubble surface here c is the maximum velocity potential increment on the bubble boundary between two successive time steps equation 16 is a combination of fredholm integral equation of the first and second kind the numerical solution of fredholm integral equation of the first kind is susceptible to instability problems arfken and weber 2001 therefore during the time marching process high frequency saw tooth instability may appear in the profile of the moving boundary which can be removed by using a smoothing technique as the main purpose of smoothing is to damp the relatively large wave numbers while leaving the small wave numbers unchanged in the present work the following five point smoothing formula introduced by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 for equally spaced points is used 19 ξ i ξ i ω ξ i 2 4 ξ i 1 6 ξ i 4 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 where ω 1 16 ξ is the smoothed filtered quantity and ξ is the quantity prior to the smoothing the quantity ξ can be either the coordinates of the endpoints of an element or the velocity potential on that element equation 19 is the second order finite difference approximation of a diffusion like forth order partial differential equation dadvand et al 2012 the second term the parenthesized terms on the right hand side of this equation is called the filter function which acts as an artificial viscosity added to the quantity ξ to damp higher order modes whilst leaving lower modes virtually unchanged using the value of 1 16 for ω often suffices to remove the saw tooth instability for the bubble boundary on the other hand after updating the moving boundary the nodes can become too close to or too far away from each other which may also contribute numerical instabilities in such cases the boundary needs to be re discretized it is worth mentioning that in the present work the updated moving boundary is smoothed and re discretized once in each time step to represent the trace of the computational bubble surface accurately in the absence of any sharp discontinuities for more details on the re discretization procedure the interested reader is referred to shervani tabar et al 2009 4 validation first the accuracy of the current numerical code is substantiated by comparing the present numerical results with the experimental results of cui et al 2013 in both the experimental work and numerical simulation the initial normalized distance between the bubble center and the center of opening the normalized diameter of the opening and the maximum radius of the bubble are set to be h h r m 1 342 w w r m 0 357 and r m 12 6 mm it should be noted that the standoff distance h considered here is sufficiently large in addition the curvature of the plate is relatively small as such the bubble may not much be affected by the curvature shape of the adjacent rigid boundary consequently the bubble is expected to oscillate nearly axisymmetrically with respect to the axis of the circular hole even in the three dimensional work of cui et al 2013 and this comparison is reasonable in the numerical simulation the strength parameter ε is considered equal to 10 and the associated initial normalized radius of the bubble is calculated to be equal to r 0 0 35334 using eq 13 in addition nominally 25 elements were used on the half bubble surface and 173 elements were used on the equivalent portion of the rigid boundary the numerical simulations are conducted with considering the buoyancy effects δ 0 0485 and with ignoring the buoyancy effect δ 0 as depicted by dashed and solid lines respectively seven frames of the bubble oscillation are demonstrated in fig 2 and compared with the experimental work of cui et al 2013 due to small size of the bubble the buoyancy has negligible effect on its behavior the same observation was reported by cui et al 2013 as such the buoyancy effect is ignored δ 0 and the geometry is rotated 45 counterclockwise in all the simulations carried out in the present work in both the experimental and numerical presentations the bubble undergoes spherical expansion as displayed in the first three frames in fig 2 and it reaches its maximum volume in frame 3 then the bubble starts the collapse phase and becomes slightly oblate due to the presence of the perforated plate as can be seen in frame 6 of fig 2 the bubble is in minimum size at the end of the first period of its lifetime and a jet is initiated at far side of the bubble directed towards the opening this may be due to the fact that the diameter of the opening is much smaller than the bubble s maximum size and the bubble behaves as if it oscillates near a rigid boundary without opening subsequently a second expansion of the bubble with developed jet is observed in frame 7 the comparison demonstrates a reasonable agreement between the experiments and numerical results all the important phenomena have been captured quite well by the numerical simulation the main discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are associated with the time so that the numerical times are smaller than those of the experiments the time differences may be attributed to a neglecting the viscosity effects in the simulations b being unable to exactly match link the initial conditions of the experiments and simulations and c dissimilarity of the solid geometry in the simulations and experiments due to insufficient information about the curvature radius of the hole in the experimental work of cui et al 2013 5 results and discussion in this section the results of the current study are demonstrated and discussed the bubble dynamics when oscillating near a perforated curved plate placed in an infinite liquid domain is investigated using bem first the influence of the opening size and then the effect of the standoff distance on the bubble dynamics are considered finally from the overall view of the bubble oscillation near the perforated curved plate a general chart based on the opening size w and standoff distance h is prepared in order to distinguish the conditions under which the perforated plate is prevented from being affected by the bubble jet these conditions are associated with the cases where the bubble either oscillates without any jetting induced or it oscillates with an outward jet directing away from the opening 5 1 effect of the opening size in this section the effect of the opening size w on the bubble dynamics when oscillating near the perforated curved plate is investigated for this purpose five different opening sizes w of 0 595 0 907 1 27 1 627 and 1 905 are considered in the all cases the standoff distance is kept constant at h 0 8 also the strength parameter of the bubble ε is set equal to 10 which is pertinent to the initial normalized radius of the bubble r 0 of 0 35334 obtained from eq 13 furthermore nominally 25 elements were used on the half bubble surface and 173 elements were used on the equivalent portion of the rigid boundary 5 1 1 case a w 0 595 in this case a the bubble is initiated at the standoff distance h 0 8 near a curved plate with an opening having the normalized size w 0 595 the time evolution of the bubble oscillations is depicted in six frames in fig 3 a in the expansion phase due to small size of the opening and small standoff distance the bubble dose not expand spherically but part of the bubble which is adjacent to the opening is bulging and gradually squeezed inside the opening see frames 2 and 3 of fig 3a at the final stages of the expansion phase however part of the bubble adjacent to the opening is returned again and at the maximum size of the bubble t 1 49044 ms an outwards jet directing away from the opening is observed see frame 4 of fig 3a due to the high pressure region between the bubble and the opening this would imply that the bubble would sense the presence of the opening then the collapsing phase of the bubble occurs and the aforesaid jet is developed finally at t 2 36303 ms this jet is fully developed and impacts to the opposite side of the bubble and a toroidal shape bubble is formed 5 1 2 case b w 0 907 in the case b the normalized diameter of the opening is considered larger than that in case a w 0 907 the results are shown in fig 3b it is evident that similar to the case a in expansion phase part of the bubble which is adjacent to the opening is bulging and gradually squeezed inside the opening see frames 2 and 3 of fig 3b but due to larger size of the opening in the case b at the maximum size of the bubble t 1 45743 ms adjacent part of the bubble to opening is still squeezed inside the opening frame 4 of fig 3b it is also apparent that the time period of the expansion phase for case b is shorter than that for case a because in the latter case the bubble s expansion is more constrained by the effective presence of the plate wall then the bubble starts its collapse phase during which an outward jet directing away from the opening is formed on the part of the bubble which is adjacent to opening the jet is developing and at the final stage of the bubble collapse phase t 2 56658 ms the reentrant jet penetrates the opposite side of the bubble and creates a toroidal bubble see frame 7 of fig 3b another important point to note is that by increasing the opening diameter the jet impact to the opposite side of the bubble occurs later 5 1 3 case c w 1 27 in this case c the normalized diameter of the opening is set equal to w 1 27 see fig 3c here due to wider extent of the opening the bubble expands almost spherically comparing to the previous two cases however at the maximum size of the bubble t 1 45606 ms part of the bubble surface close to the opening is slightly protruding see frame 4 of fig 3c again by increasing the opening size and hence decreasing the influence of the plate wall the time period of the bubble expansion phase decreases then the bubble starts its collapse phase to be followed by creation of an outwards jet on part of the bubble surface close to the opening the jet is directing away from the opening comparing with the cases a and b in this case c the width of the reentrant jet impacting on the opposite side of the bubble becomes wider and the penetration depth of this jet is shorter according to frame 7 of fig 3c at the end of the first cycle of the bubble oscillation t 2 88984 ms the jet has not impacted to the opposite side of the bubble afterwards the bubble begins its second oscillation cycle expands and the liquid jet penetrates the opposite side of the bubble again the time period of the first expansion phase decreases as the diameter of the opening is increased 5 1 4 case d w 1 627 in this case d the normalized diameter of the opening is considered to be w 1 627 the time evolution of the bubble is demonstrated in fig 3d since the opening size is larger in comparison with the previous cases the bubble expands rather spherically during the expansion phase and reaches its maximum size earlier at t 1 43544 ms frame 4 of fig 3d furthermore bulge on part of the bubble close to the opening is not observed during the initial stages of the collapse phase a small dimple appears on part of the bubble close to the opening and eventually an outwards wide extent and short depth jet directing away from the opening is observed the first cycle of the bubble oscillation is terminated at t 2 87708 ms frame 7 of fig 3d then the second cycle expansion of the bubble begins due to presence of non condensable gas inside it and the aforesaid jet is developed see frame 8 of fig 3d 5 1 5 case e w 1 905 in the case e shown in fig 3e the opening size is set equal to w 1 905 again spherical expansion of the bubble and its shorter expansion time are clearly evident the bubble achieves its maximum size at t 1 42591 ms see frame 4 of fig 3e in the collapse phase part of the bubble close to the opening is slightly flattened see frames 5 and 6 of fig 3e then at the end of first period frame 7 of fig 3e t 2 86733 ms an outwards short depth jet directing away from the opening is observed which is not impact the opposite side of the bubble according to frame 8 of fig 3e the second expansion of the bubble is started and again the aforementioned reentrant jet is developed in general comparison between all the above cases demonstrates that for a constant standoff distance as the opening size is increased i the bubble reaches its maximum size earlier and its spherical expansion becomes more probable ii the width and penetration depth of the reentrant jet formed on the part of the bubble surface close to the opening become wider and shorter respectively and iii second expansion of the bubble becomes more likely to happen in contrast as the opening size is decreased the formation of toroidal bubble at the first cycle of bubble oscillation becomes more apparent fig 4 illustrates the motion of bubble centroid for the cases considered in fig 3 it is obviously clear that for all the cases except case a the bubble is attracted by the opening at initial stages of the expansion phase this attraction becomes weaker as the opening size increases and hence the effects of solid boundary of the plate on the bubble behavior decrease in the case a the bubble at early stages of the expansion phase is first repelled and then attracted by the opening at later stages of the expansion phase the bubble migrates away from the opening for the all cases this repelling of the bubble by the opening occurs earlier as the opening size is decreased in the all cases the bubble migrates away from the opening during the initial stages of the collapse phase but at final stages of the collapse phase again the bubble moves towards the opening furthermore since the bubble oscillation is more restricted by the solid boundary of the plate for smaller opening sizes the attraction period of time is more prolonged 5 2 effect of the standoff distance in order to study the effect of the standoff distance on the bubble oscillation near a perforated curved plate four different standoff distances h 0 8 1 136 1 436 and 2 0 are considered for all the four cases the opening size strength parameter and initial normalized radius of the bubble are chosen equal to w 0 907 ε 10 and r 0 0 35334 respectively the time history of the bubble evolution for the mentioned four cases is demonstrated in fig 5 again 25 elements were used on the half bubble surface and 173 elements were used on the equivalent portion of the rigid boundary 5 2 1 case a h 0 8 fig 5 a shows the oscillation of the bubble initiated at the standoff distance h 0 8 it can be seen that during the expansion phase of the bubble see frames 1 4 of fig 5a part of the bubble close to the opening is bulging and gradually squeezed inside the opening the bubble attains its maximum size at t 1 45743 ms see frame 4 of fig 5a then the bubble enters its collapse phase during which an outward liquid jet directing away from the opening develops at time t 2 56658 ms the jet becomes fully developed and impacts the opposite side of the bubble see frame 7 of fig 5a the jet tends to pierce the bubble and form a toroidal bubble not shown 5 2 2 case b h 1 136 in this case b the standoff distance h is increased to 1 136 while the opening size w is fixed at 0 907 the time evolution of the bubble is depicted in fig 5b it is clearly obvious that the bubble undergoes almost spherical expansion and part of the bubble close to the opening is slightly bulging and attracted by the opening frames 1 4 in fig 5b according to the frame 4 the maximum size of the bubble occurs at t 1 46574 ms then the collapse phase of the bubble is initiated and a jet with short penetration depth directing away from the opening develops this bubble completes its first oscillation cycle at t 2 92928 ms frame 7 in fig 5b and before the jet touches the opposite side of the bubble the bubble starts the second expansion phase according to frame 8 of fig 5b from the comparison of the case a and case b in fig 5 it is concluded that for a fixed opening size a larger standoff distance would result in a less squeeze of the bubble inside the opening as well as a shorter penetration depth of the jet this may be due to the fact that as the standoff distance increases the pressure of the region located between the bubble and the plate is attenuated 5 2 3 case c h 1 434 in the case c the standoff distance is further increased to h 1 434 the results are given in fig 5c it is observed that the bubble preserves spherical shape during its expansion phase and reaches its maximum size at t 1 46742 ms frame 4 in fig 5c then the bubble initiates its contraction phase without any jetting induced and part of the bubble close to the opening is flattened due to the high pressure region between the bubble and the plate the bubble ends its first oscillation cycle at t 2 92494 ms frame 7 in fig 5c and then starts its second expansion phase see frame 8 in fig 5c 5 2 4 case d h 2 0 fig 5d demonstrates the bubble configurations during its first oscillation cycle and second expansion phase when initiated at the standoff distance h 2 0 it is obvious that the bubble experiences spherical expansion and contraction phases without any jetting induced comparison between all the four cases studied in section 5 2 ascertains that for a fixed opening size as the standoff distance increases the pressure of the region located between the bubble and the plate is attenuated the bubble jet formation become weaker and hence the spherical oscillation of the bubble become more plausible in contrast by decreasing the standoff distance non spherical collapse of the bubble and formation of a toroidal bubble during the first oscillation cycle becomes more appreciable the movement of the bubble centroid associated with all the cases studied in section 5 2 is depicted in fig 6 it is observed that the bubble is first attracted and then repelled by the opening finally the bubble moves back towards the opening the attraction and repelling of the bubble by the opening becomes stronger as the standoff distance is decreased 5 3 overall results of the bubble behavior when oscillating near the perforated curved plate it was shown in previous sections that the bubble behavior is highly dependent on two key parameters namely the normalized opening size w and the standoff distance h in general based on the relative value of these two parameters four distinct oscillation scenarios of the bubble can be recognized see fig 7 these scenarios are i two simultaneous jets inward and outward jets ii inward jet an inward jet directing towards the opening iii quasi or fully spherical oscillation without jet and iv outward jet an outwards jet directing away from the opening in the scenarios with jet the jet can be formed in the first oscillation cycle or in the second expansion phase depending on the standoff distance and opening size in region i there observed two simultaneous inward and outward jets in this region for a certain opening size by increasing the standoff distance the penetration depth of the outward jet is decreased finally this outward jet vanishes and only the inward jet will exist see region ii it is obvious that the regions i and ii are regions where the perforated plate may be damaged due to attack of the inward jet in region ii increment of the standoff distance at a fixed opening size causes the inward jet to become weaker and finally vanish and the bubble oscillates spherically without any jetting induced this scenario of spherical oscillation of the bubble without jet is depicted as region iii in region iii the presence of the curved plate with opening is not felt by the bubble hence the bubble collapses spherically without any jet and the second expansion of the bubble is also spherical fig 7 shows that in region i for a fixed value of standoff distance by increasing the opening size the penetration depth of the inward jet is decreased and eventually the inward jet disappears and only an outward jet is remained which is identified by the region iv the regions iii and iv have not any threat to the curved plate with opening due to absence of the jet and outward direction of the jet respectively actually the regions iii and iv are safe regions for the perforated plate in general there exists no threat in the regions with w 0 95 irrespective of the value of the standoff distance due to the absence of the inward jet it should be noted that these scenarios can happen either in the first cycle of bubble lifetime or in the second expansion phase in addition for smaller standoff distances and smaller opening sizes the possibility of squeezing the bubble inside the opening during the expansion phase in the first period becomes more appreciated see section 5 2 the results also indicate that the damage caused by undex bubble to discontinuous or deformed structures might not be as serious as to non perforated flawless structures since the bubble jet which is a significant menace would possibly not be formed or this jet is directed away from the opening in their recent experimental study cui et al 2013 explained that the effect of the circular opening and possibly other discontinuous boundaries on the bubble dynamics especially bubble jets might be utilized in the design of the protection tanks on vessel and other practical underwater structures the results of current study confirm the statement 6 conclusions the dynamics of a spark generated bubble oscillating near a curved plate with a circular opening is studied numerically using bem the standoff distance and the opening size are two key parameters influencing the bubble behavior based on the relative value of these two parameters four distinct oscillation scenarios of the bubble were recognized i two simultaneous jets inward and outward jets ii inward jet an inward jet directing towards the opening iii quasi or fully spherical oscillation without jet and iv outward jet an outwards jet directing away from the opening in the scenarios with jet the jet can be formed in the first oscillation cycle or in the second expansion phase depending on the standoff distance and opening size a diagram was provided representing four distinctive regions distinguished by the mentioned four different oscillation scenarios the results also indicated that the damage caused by an underwater explosion undex bubble to discontinuous structures might not be as serious as to non perforated flawless structures since the bubble jet which is a significant menace would possibly not be formed or this jet is directed away from the opening the effect of circular opening and possibly other discontinuous boundaries on the bubble dynamics especially bubble jets might be utilized in the design of the protection tanks on vessel and other practical underwater structures 
23592,this paper described a procedure for predicting the ice loads acting on a hull of an icebreaker that employs a six degrees of freedom 6 dof inertial measurement system method ice loads were calculated using the data measured in full scale ice sea trials of the korean ice breaking research vessel ibrv araon during her arctic ocean voyage in 2015 in the measured data it was found that the sway roll and yaw motions were larger than other motions because the ship usually met with pack ice during her voyage to calculate the maximum ice loads the center of gravity cog approach and the point of impact poi approach were used ice loads ranged from 1 41 to 4 87 mn when estimated using the cog approach and from 0 11 to 1 06 mn when estimated using the poi approach the measured ice loads through the cog and poi approaches were compared with the resultant forces measured using strain gauges keywords korean ibrv araon ice load inertial measurement system method pack ice center of gravity cog approach point of impact poi approach 1 introduction when designing icebreakers that operate in the ice seas precise estimation of the ice load is very important this is because ice load determines a number of fundamental design factors including hull structure hull form and thruster type to measure the ice loads acting on the hull of an icebreaker strain gauges were traditionally used in this method the hull of an icebreaker is treated as an elastically deformable body and the ice load is measured based on the deformation of the hull while it interacts with the sea ice although this method has been confirmed to be an effective and a reliable method it involves a high amount of time and cost for installation and operation worse still every time it is applied to a new hull the same financial and time investment is required daley and st john 1984 measured strains with the uscgc polar sea and calculated the ice forces and pressures for thick multiyear ices ghoneim et al 1984 measured strains with the icebreakers canmar kigoriak and robert lemeur during the ramming test to ice ridges and calculated the global ship ice impact force minnick et al 1990 measured strains with the uscgc polar sea during the impacts with ice ridges and estimated the longitudinal bending moment distribution on it ritch et al 2008 measured strains with the ccgs terry fox and calculated the pressures on the hull using the pressure strain correlation lee et al 2014 and kwon et al 2015 measured strains with the araon and predicted the pressure on the hull using the influence coefficient method and the direct method wang et al 2014 installed load panels and measured dynamic ice forces on jacket structures in the bohai sea another method that uses the inertial measurement system called motan motion analysis was later introduced by the canadian hydraulic center chc under the national research council of canada johnston et al 2003 in this method the hull of an icebreaker is treated as a rigid body and the global ice load is measured based on the whole ship motions in six degrees of freedom this method is economical both for installation and operation and is simple to apply to another icebreaker to predict the global ice loads on a hull johnston et al 2008a 2008b calculated the global ice load from motan johnston et al 2003 and compared it with the results obtained with the strain gauges krupina et al 2009 calculated ice impact force on the russian icebreaker kapitan nikolaev based on the motion data and compared the results with the strain gauge data nyseth et al 2013 calculated the global ice load on the norwegian coast guard icebreaker kv svalbard during the ramming test with heavy ice features using an inertial measurement system valkonen 2013 calculated global ice load on the south african research icebreaker s a agulhas ⅱ using the inertial measurement data and estimated its uncertainty lee et al 2016 measured the 6 dof motions and calculated the global ice load when the araon operated in heavy ice conditions the first korean ice breaking research vessel ibrv araon which is shown in fig 1 was built in 2009 it has been used for several full scale tests to predict the ice load ice resistance and properties of sea ice in the antarctic ocean and arctic ocean in this study ice loads on the korean ibrv araon were predicted using the data measured by an inertial measurement system during her arctic ocean voyage in 2015 this arctic ocean voyage allocation was carried out from july 30 to august 23 2015 in the chukchi and east siberian seas and the overall route is shown in fig 2 the motion data in six degrees of freedom were measured using the inertial measurement system motionpak ⅱ developed by systron donner inertial inc which is shown in fig 3 the system consists of three translational accelerometers and three angular rate sensors like the motan sensor each sensor measures the total ship accelerations and the angular rates of the ship in the directions of the x y and z coordinates respectively it was installed on the back plane of an h beam which supports the stairway from the main deck to the engine room more specifically the location is 0 42 m upward and 1 89 m forward from the center of gravity when the lbp lcg and vcg of araon are 95 m 49 61 m and 7 38 m fig 4 shows the installation location and the axes directions of the inertial measurement system this study was conducted as part of a project to develop an integrated system for ice impact load measurement on the korean ibrv araon and the objectives of this paper are to predict the ice loads by using an inertial measurement system method and to verify its availability through a quantitative comparison with the results obtained through other method this paper is organized as follows the data processing is described first and the ice loads follow the results are then presented and discussed finally conclusions are drawn 2 data processes 2 1 data calibration filtering and resampling to calculate the ice loads using the measured raw data from the inertial measurement system a three step data processing procedure is required the first step is data calibration since there is no six degrees of freedom motion before the ice breaker collides with the sea ice all the initial values of the raw data have to be shifted to the base level i e set to zero the second step is data filtering with a low pass filter lpf since the raw data of the inertial measurement system contain motions that are related with modal vibrations and not with sea ice interactions those motions have to be removed through filtering it is well known that whole ship motions commonly occur at frequencies lower than 5 hz and that frequencies higher than 2 hz are related with secondary ship vibrations which are quite separate from global ship accelerations therefore the frequencies higher than 2 hz must be removed chen et al 1990 johnston et al 2004 the final step is data resampling since the low time resolution of the raw data may induce significant numerical error all data have to be resampled with the higher time resolution in the present study all raw data were calibrated and then their initial values were set to zero and for the filtering the 5th order butterworth lpf with the cut off frequency of 2 hz was selected and applied to the raw data the transfer function of the normalized 5th order butterworth lpf with a gain of one can be written as 1 h s 1 s 1 s 2 0 618 s 1 s 2 1 618 s 1 where s is the complex frequency the butterworth filter is the type most widely used as a signal processing filter because it has no ripple i e it has a maximally flat response and has a slower roll off around the cut off frequency than the chebyshev filter or the elliptic filter the order of the butterworth filter affects the signal attenuation rate around the cut off frequency a higher order produces faster attenuation butterworth 1930 and that is why the higher order 5th order was selected finally the cubic spline interpolation was applied to the calibrated and filtered data and the data were resampled from 50 hz to 200 hz lee et al 2016 after the calibration filtering and resampling procedures a comparison of the acceleration in the y direction between the raw and processed data is shown in fig 5 and it was found that the amplitude of the processed data becomes smaller than the raw data because the components of the higher frequencies were removed also the analysis of signal intensity using the fast fourier transform fft shows that the signals of frequencies higher than 2 hz were attenuated rapidly as shown in fig 6 by the effect of the filter 2 2 numerical differentiation and integration the inertial measurement system used in the present study can measure only time series of the six variables such as three translational accelerations and three angular rates to solve the six degrees of freedom equations of motion twelve additional variables are needed three angular accelerations three translational velocities and six translational and angular displacements for convenience subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent the translational components of the x y and z coordinate axes and subscripts 4 5 and 6 represent the rotational components of the x y and z coordinate axes respectively the capital letters a v and d represent the acceleration velocity or rate and displacement respectively thus when the above notations are used the variables measured by the inertial measurement system are a 1 a 2 a 3 v 4 v 5 and v 6 the unknown angular accelerations a 4 a 5 and a 6 were calculated through numerical differentiation using the known angular rates v 4 v 5 and v 6 respectively and the numerical differentiation can be written as 2 f t f t δ t f t δ t where t is time and δt is measuring time step the other unknown variables were calculated through numerical integration i e v1 v2 and v3 were from a1 a2 and a3 the trapezoidal rule was used for the numerical integration atkinson 1993 and it can be written as 3 t o t o δ t f t d t δ t f t o δ t f t o 2 the relations between the variables and numerical differentiation and integration are shown in fig 7 3 ice load calculations 3 1 equations of motion and coefficients the external forces and moments that will be used to calculate the ice loads can be obtained using the equations of motion in six degrees of freedom and the equations of motion can be written as 4 m i j m a i j a j b i j v j c i j d j f i where m ij mass matrix m aij added mass matrix b ij damping coefficient matrix c ij restoring coefficient matrix a j acceleration vector v j velocity vector d j displacement vector f i external force and moment vector the coefficient matrices such as mass added mass and restoring coefficient were calculated using the potential flow based simulation code and the vectors such as acceleration velocity and displacement were processed and calculated in the previous section the coefficient matrices are listed in table 1 for the mass matrix the components m 46 and m 64 are very small and negligible and the components m 15 m 24 m 42 and m 51 have vanished because the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the center of gravity of the ship thus all the off diagonal components of the mass matrix are zero for the added mass matrix all components in which the sum of row and column indices is an odd number are zero for the restoring coefficient matrix because the ship is floating the only non zero linear hydrostatic restoring coefficients are c 33 c 35 c 44 c 53 and c 55 and the value of component c 35 is the same as that of c 53 salvesen et al 1970 for the damping coefficient matrix the damping effects are ignored and all components are set to zero because the wave cannot be generated on the ice covered free surface newman 1977 3 2 ice load calculations the external forces and moments obtained by the equations of motion were generated by the interactions between the ship and the sea ice and they are acting on the center of gravity f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the external forces acting on the center of gravity in the directions of the x y and z coordinate axes i e surge sway and heave forces and f 4 f 5 and f 6 are the external moments acting on the same position in the rotational directions about the x y and z coordinate axes i e roll pitch and yaw moments respectively those external forces and moments are shown in fig 8 to calculate the maximum ice loads two approaches were used the point of impact poi approach which can be used when the location of impact with ices is precisely known and the center of gravity cog approach which can be used when the impact location is not known johnston et al 2008a 2008b for the cog approach the ice load was calculated at the center of gravity and the surge sway and heave forces acting on the center of gravity were used as shown in fig 8 this approach can be used to predict the global ice load acting on the entire hull due to the multiple impacts with ices the resultant ice load is calculated as 5 f c o g f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 where f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the surge sway and heave forces acting on the center of gravity respectively in the poi approach the ice load is calculated at the point of impact and this approach can be used only when the exact ice impact locations are known in this approach the surge force yaw and pitch moments acting on the center of gravity were used and the resultant ice load is calculated as 6 f p o i f 1 2 f 6 x a b 2 f 5 x a b 2 where f 6 and f 5 are the yaw and pitch moments acting on the center of gravity and x ab is the longitudinal distance in the direction of the x coordinate axis from the location where the inertial measurement system is installed to the point of impact assuming that the hull is a rigid body the surge force in the direction of the x coordinate axis is the same at all points on the hull and thus the same surge force f 1 was also used in the poi approach the sway and heave forces acting on the point of impact however have to be converted from the yaw and pitch moments acting on the center of gravity divided by x ab which plays the role of the moment arm the external forces and moments acting on the point of impact are shown in fig 9 in the present study the moment arm x ab was fixed as a constant of 58 5 m and this is the longitudinal distance between the locations where both the inertial measurement system and the strain gauges were installed hence this approach can be used to predict the local ice load acting on the small area where strain gauges were installed under the small pack ice condition this is considered valid as the resultant ice load will be compared with the resultant force of the strain gauges the small changes in the longitudinal distance are negligible and are listed in table 2 when the longitudinal distance was changed from 55 5 m to 61 5 m based on 58 5 m the differences in the reference value were less than 0 11 4 results and discussion 4 1 motion data analysis in time domain the translational accelerations and angular rates measured by the inertial measurement system during the arctic ocean voyage in 2015 are shown in figs 10 and 11 in the general icebreaking process with level ice the surge motions that appear when the ship collides with the ice and the pitch motions that appear in the process of ice breaking in which the ice breaker glides over the ice and crushes it downward with her weight are dominant but in the data from 2015 the sway motions in the translational accelerations and the roll and yaw motions in the angular rates are dominant as shown in figs 10 and 11 this is because the ice conditions during the arctic ocean voyage in 2015 were not level ice but small pack ices as shown in fig 12 for this case the ice concentration was around 75 the ice thickness was less than 1 m and the ship speed was around 3 5 m s thus it seems that the ice breaker was subjected to lateral forces in the process of pushing the ice next to the hull after hitting it rather than the normal ice breaking process 4 2 motion data analysis in frequency domain the translational and rotational motions were calculated from measured data and plotted in the frequency domain by fft as shown in fig 13 the main peaks appeared at frequencies close to 0 hz which is characteristic of the motion of a rigid body and their magnitudes show the same results as the previous section as sway roll and yaw motions are dominant in the figure the three dominant motions sway roll and yaw decreased rapidly as the frequency increases while the other surge heave and pitch motions decreased slowly this is because the amplitudes of their main peaks are very large compared to the others in addition another peak appears after the main peak in the heave and pitch motions which is presumed to be due to the resonance effect looking at the frequency band in which the additional peak appears it appears in the band of about 2 0 2 5 hz in the heave motion and about 1 6 2 0 hz in the pitch motion if the external force continuously received from the small pack ices is considered to be equal to that from the short period waves the general tendency of the resonance phenomenon to appear in the heave and pitch motions and for the one to have a shorter resonance period than the other bergdahl 2008 is consistent with the result of this motion data analysis in the frequency domain 4 3 global and local ice loads ice load calculations were performed for a total of 138 tests in 30 cases to calculate the maximum ice loads the method of dividing the case into a number of tests according to a certain measurement time 900 s and checking the maximum value in each test was used rather than the method of classifying the events because the ice conditions of the arctic ocean in 2015 were small pack ice several of which could collide with the ship at the same time hence the ice load calculated using the cog approach represents the global ice load and it means the sum of the ice loads acting on the hull simultaneously due to the collision with several ices on the other hand the ice load calculated using the poi approach represents the local ice load and it means just the ice load acting on the specific point in this study the specific point is the installation location of the strain gauges the resulting global and local ice loads ranged from 1 41 to 4 87 mn using the cog approach and from 0 11 to 1 06 mn using the poi approach at this time the ship speed corresponding to each test was calculated based on the global positioning system gps device information and the range was from 0 3 to 7 4 m s the maximum deviation between the global and local ice loads was 1794 for official 26 2 i e the second test in the 26th official case and the ice concentration was around 75 the ice thickness was less than 1 m and the ship speed was around 5 8 m s for this case the minimum deviation was 254 for official 28 1 and the ice concentration was around 75 the ice thickness was less than 1 m and the ship speed was around 5 2 m s this is because there were at least two or three collisions with ice with the hull at the same time additionally in the global and local ice loads the peaks appear at the different times because of the same reason the global and local ice loads for the cases of official 26 2 and 28 1 are shown in figs 14 and 15 4 4 comparison with results obtained using strain gauges the resultant global and local ice loads calculated from the inertial measurement system were compared with the forces measured from the strain gauges min et al 2016 totally twenty four strain gauges were installed between 102 and 110 frames of the starboard side each strain gage was installed eight each at the design draft and 0 5 m above and below the design draft the area occupied by each strain gauge is 0 8 m 0 5 m comparison results for the cases of the official 5 12 14 16 19 21 23 and 28 that contain four tests in each case are shown in fig 16 and summarized in table 3 the global ice loads calculated using the cog approach were consistently much higher than those of the strain gauges but the local ice loads from the poi approach were little bit lower or higher than those of the strain gauges but showed good agreement with them this is because the resultant ice loads obtained using the strain gauges also represent the local ice loads acting on the same point of impact 4 5 relationship between the ship speed and local ice loads all resultant local ice loads calculated from the inertial measurement system and strain gauges with respect to the ship speed were plotted in fig 17 the maximum local ice loads tended to increase gradually with increasing ship speed to obtain the relationship between the ship speed and the maximum local ice loads the linear fitting was used with the maximum local ice loads per ship speeds the linear equation is 7 f 0 1889 v m n where v m s is the ship speed during the whole ice sea trials in 2015 the ice condition was small pack ices and the concentration was around 75 when the video taken during the voyage in 2015 was investigated it was estimated that the thickness of the actual sea ice is thinner than the 1 m min et al 2016 5 conclusions in this paper a series of procedures that included calibration filtering resampling numerical differentiation and integration solving the equations of motion and calculating the ice loads was presented ice loads were calculated based on the assumption that the ship hull is a rigid body using the motion data measured by the inertial measurement system during the arctic ocean voyage in 2015 the center of gravity cog approach and the point of impact poi approach were each used to calculate the ice loads in the motion data in the time domain the sway roll and yaw motions were dominant in the collision with the small pack ices because the pack ices were pushed to the side in the motion data in the frequency domain the dominance of the above three motions was also shown and an additional peak appeared in the heave and pitch motions which seemed to be due to the resonance effects like a ship motion in short period wave comparing the ice loads from the inertial measurement system and the strain gauges the global ice loads estimated through the cog approach were determined to be larger than the local ice loads estimated through the poi approach the local ice loads measured from the strain gauges were similar to those estimated through the poi approach when the ship speed is considered there was a linear relationship between the ship speed and the local ice loads and the equation was derived using the linear fitting this linear equation shows the local ice load according to the ship speed when the ice concentration is around 75 and the ice thickness is less than 1 m finally in place of the strain gauge that has been used traditionally the potential of using the inertial measurement system method for predicting the ice loads on the korean ice breaking research vessel araon was confirmed acknowledgement our research was supported by the national research foundation nrf 2015r1c1a1a02037577 and the it r d program of motie keit 10060329 funded

23592,this paper described a procedure for predicting the ice loads acting on a hull of an icebreaker that employs a six degrees of freedom 6 dof inertial measurement system method ice loads were calculated using the data measured in full scale ice sea trials of the korean ice breaking research vessel ibrv araon during her arctic ocean voyage in 2015 in the measured data it was found that the sway roll and yaw motions were larger than other motions because the ship usually met with pack ice during her voyage to calculate the maximum ice loads the center of gravity cog approach and the point of impact poi approach were used ice loads ranged from 1 41 to 4 87 mn when estimated using the cog approach and from 0 11 to 1 06 mn when estimated using the poi approach the measured ice loads through the cog and poi approaches were compared with the resultant forces measured using strain gauges keywords korean ibrv araon ice load inertial measurement system method pack ice center of gravity cog approach point of impact poi approach 1 introduction when designing icebreakers that operate in the ice seas precise estimation of the ice load is very important this is because ice load determines a number of fundamental design factors including hull structure hull form and thruster type to measure the ice loads acting on the hull of an icebreaker strain gauges were traditionally used in this method the hull of an icebreaker is treated as an elastically deformable body and the ice load is measured based on the deformation of the hull while it interacts with the sea ice although this method has been confirmed to be an effective and a reliable method it involves a high amount of time and cost for installation and operation worse still every time it is applied to a new hull the same financial and time investment is required daley and st john 1984 measured strains with the uscgc polar sea and calculated the ice forces and pressures for thick multiyear ices ghoneim et al 1984 measured strains with the icebreakers canmar kigoriak and robert lemeur during the ramming test to ice ridges and calculated the global ship ice impact force minnick et al 1990 measured strains with the uscgc polar sea during the impacts with ice ridges and estimated the longitudinal bending moment distribution on it ritch et al 2008 measured strains with the ccgs terry fox and calculated the pressures on the hull using the pressure strain correlation lee et al 2014 and kwon et al 2015 measured strains with the araon and predicted the pressure on the hull using the influence coefficient method and the direct method wang et al 2014 installed load panels and measured dynamic ice forces on jacket structures in the bohai sea another method that uses the inertial measurement system called motan motion analysis was later introduced by the canadian hydraulic center chc under the national research council of canada johnston et al 2003 in this method the hull of an icebreaker is treated as a rigid body and the global ice load is measured based on the whole ship motions in six degrees of freedom this method is economical both for installation and operation and is simple to apply to another icebreaker to predict the global ice loads on a hull johnston et al 2008a 2008b calculated the global ice load from motan johnston et al 2003 and compared it with the results obtained with the strain gauges krupina et al 2009 calculated ice impact force on the russian icebreaker kapitan nikolaev based on the motion data and compared the results with the strain gauge data nyseth et al 2013 calculated the global ice load on the norwegian coast guard icebreaker kv svalbard during the ramming test with heavy ice features using an inertial measurement system valkonen 2013 calculated global ice load on the south african research icebreaker s a agulhas ⅱ using the inertial measurement data and estimated its uncertainty lee et al 2016 measured the 6 dof motions and calculated the global ice load when the araon operated in heavy ice conditions the first korean ice breaking research vessel ibrv araon which is shown in fig 1 was built in 2009 it has been used for several full scale tests to predict the ice load ice resistance and properties of sea ice in the antarctic ocean and arctic ocean in this study ice loads on the korean ibrv araon were predicted using the data measured by an inertial measurement system during her arctic ocean voyage in 2015 this arctic ocean voyage allocation was carried out from july 30 to august 23 2015 in the chukchi and east siberian seas and the overall route is shown in fig 2 the motion data in six degrees of freedom were measured using the inertial measurement system motionpak ⅱ developed by systron donner inertial inc which is shown in fig 3 the system consists of three translational accelerometers and three angular rate sensors like the motan sensor each sensor measures the total ship accelerations and the angular rates of the ship in the directions of the x y and z coordinates respectively it was installed on the back plane of an h beam which supports the stairway from the main deck to the engine room more specifically the location is 0 42 m upward and 1 89 m forward from the center of gravity when the lbp lcg and vcg of araon are 95 m 49 61 m and 7 38 m fig 4 shows the installation location and the axes directions of the inertial measurement system this study was conducted as part of a project to develop an integrated system for ice impact load measurement on the korean ibrv araon and the objectives of this paper are to predict the ice loads by using an inertial measurement system method and to verify its availability through a quantitative comparison with the results obtained through other method this paper is organized as follows the data processing is described first and the ice loads follow the results are then presented and discussed finally conclusions are drawn 2 data processes 2 1 data calibration filtering and resampling to calculate the ice loads using the measured raw data from the inertial measurement system a three step data processing procedure is required the first step is data calibration since there is no six degrees of freedom motion before the ice breaker collides with the sea ice all the initial values of the raw data have to be shifted to the base level i e set to zero the second step is data filtering with a low pass filter lpf since the raw data of the inertial measurement system contain motions that are related with modal vibrations and not with sea ice interactions those motions have to be removed through filtering it is well known that whole ship motions commonly occur at frequencies lower than 5 hz and that frequencies higher than 2 hz are related with secondary ship vibrations which are quite separate from global ship accelerations therefore the frequencies higher than 2 hz must be removed chen et al 1990 johnston et al 2004 the final step is data resampling since the low time resolution of the raw data may induce significant numerical error all data have to be resampled with the higher time resolution in the present study all raw data were calibrated and then their initial values were set to zero and for the filtering the 5th order butterworth lpf with the cut off frequency of 2 hz was selected and applied to the raw data the transfer function of the normalized 5th order butterworth lpf with a gain of one can be written as 1 h s 1 s 1 s 2 0 618 s 1 s 2 1 618 s 1 where s is the complex frequency the butterworth filter is the type most widely used as a signal processing filter because it has no ripple i e it has a maximally flat response and has a slower roll off around the cut off frequency than the chebyshev filter or the elliptic filter the order of the butterworth filter affects the signal attenuation rate around the cut off frequency a higher order produces faster attenuation butterworth 1930 and that is why the higher order 5th order was selected finally the cubic spline interpolation was applied to the calibrated and filtered data and the data were resampled from 50 hz to 200 hz lee et al 2016 after the calibration filtering and resampling procedures a comparison of the acceleration in the y direction between the raw and processed data is shown in fig 5 and it was found that the amplitude of the processed data becomes smaller than the raw data because the components of the higher frequencies were removed also the analysis of signal intensity using the fast fourier transform fft shows that the signals of frequencies higher than 2 hz were attenuated rapidly as shown in fig 6 by the effect of the filter 2 2 numerical differentiation and integration the inertial measurement system used in the present study can measure only time series of the six variables such as three translational accelerations and three angular rates to solve the six degrees of freedom equations of motion twelve additional variables are needed three angular accelerations three translational velocities and six translational and angular displacements for convenience subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent the translational components of the x y and z coordinate axes and subscripts 4 5 and 6 represent the rotational components of the x y and z coordinate axes respectively the capital letters a v and d represent the acceleration velocity or rate and displacement respectively thus when the above notations are used the variables measured by the inertial measurement system are a 1 a 2 a 3 v 4 v 5 and v 6 the unknown angular accelerations a 4 a 5 and a 6 were calculated through numerical differentiation using the known angular rates v 4 v 5 and v 6 respectively and the numerical differentiation can be written as 2 f t f t δ t f t δ t where t is time and δt is measuring time step the other unknown variables were calculated through numerical integration i e v1 v2 and v3 were from a1 a2 and a3 the trapezoidal rule was used for the numerical integration atkinson 1993 and it can be written as 3 t o t o δ t f t d t δ t f t o δ t f t o 2 the relations between the variables and numerical differentiation and integration are shown in fig 7 3 ice load calculations 3 1 equations of motion and coefficients the external forces and moments that will be used to calculate the ice loads can be obtained using the equations of motion in six degrees of freedom and the equations of motion can be written as 4 m i j m a i j a j b i j v j c i j d j f i where m ij mass matrix m aij added mass matrix b ij damping coefficient matrix c ij restoring coefficient matrix a j acceleration vector v j velocity vector d j displacement vector f i external force and moment vector the coefficient matrices such as mass added mass and restoring coefficient were calculated using the potential flow based simulation code and the vectors such as acceleration velocity and displacement were processed and calculated in the previous section the coefficient matrices are listed in table 1 for the mass matrix the components m 46 and m 64 are very small and negligible and the components m 15 m 24 m 42 and m 51 have vanished because the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the center of gravity of the ship thus all the off diagonal components of the mass matrix are zero for the added mass matrix all components in which the sum of row and column indices is an odd number are zero for the restoring coefficient matrix because the ship is floating the only non zero linear hydrostatic restoring coefficients are c 33 c 35 c 44 c 53 and c 55 and the value of component c 35 is the same as that of c 53 salvesen et al 1970 for the damping coefficient matrix the damping effects are ignored and all components are set to zero because the wave cannot be generated on the ice covered free surface newman 1977 3 2 ice load calculations the external forces and moments obtained by the equations of motion were generated by the interactions between the ship and the sea ice and they are acting on the center of gravity f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the external forces acting on the center of gravity in the directions of the x y and z coordinate axes i e surge sway and heave forces and f 4 f 5 and f 6 are the external moments acting on the same position in the rotational directions about the x y and z coordinate axes i e roll pitch and yaw moments respectively those external forces and moments are shown in fig 8 to calculate the maximum ice loads two approaches were used the point of impact poi approach which can be used when the location of impact with ices is precisely known and the center of gravity cog approach which can be used when the impact location is not known johnston et al 2008a 2008b for the cog approach the ice load was calculated at the center of gravity and the surge sway and heave forces acting on the center of gravity were used as shown in fig 8 this approach can be used to predict the global ice load acting on the entire hull due to the multiple impacts with ices the resultant ice load is calculated as 5 f c o g f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 where f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the surge sway and heave forces acting on the center of gravity respectively in the poi approach the ice load is calculated at the point of impact and this approach can be used only when the exact ice impact locations are known in this approach the surge force yaw and pitch moments acting on the center of gravity were used and the resultant ice load is calculated as 6 f p o i f 1 2 f 6 x a b 2 f 5 x a b 2 where f 6 and f 5 are the yaw and pitch moments acting on the center of gravity and x ab is the longitudinal distance in the direction of the x coordinate axis from the location where the inertial measurement system is installed to the point of impact assuming that the hull is a rigid body the surge force in the direction of the x coordinate axis is the same at all points on the hull and thus the same surge force f 1 was also used in the poi approach the sway and heave forces acting on the point of impact however have to be converted from the yaw and pitch moments acting on the center of gravity divided by x ab which plays the role of the moment arm the external forces and moments acting on the point of impact are shown in fig 9 in the present study the moment arm x ab was fixed as a constant of 58 5 m and this is the longitudinal distance between the locations where both the inertial measurement system and the strain gauges were installed hence this approach can be used to predict the local ice load acting on the small area where strain gauges were installed under the small pack ice condition this is considered valid as the resultant ice load will be compared with the resultant force of the strain gauges the small changes in the longitudinal distance are negligible and are listed in table 2 when the longitudinal distance was changed from 55 5 m to 61 5 m based on 58 5 m the differences in the reference value were less than 0 11 4 results and discussion 4 1 motion data analysis in time domain the translational accelerations and angular rates measured by the inertial measurement system during the arctic ocean voyage in 2015 are shown in figs 10 and 11 in the general icebreaking process with level ice the surge motions that appear when the ship collides with the ice and the pitch motions that appear in the process of ice breaking in which the ice breaker glides over the ice and crushes it downward with her weight are dominant but in the data from 2015 the sway motions in the translational accelerations and the roll and yaw motions in the angular rates are dominant as shown in figs 10 and 11 this is because the ice conditions during the arctic ocean voyage in 2015 were not level ice but small pack ices as shown in fig 12 for this case the ice concentration was around 75 the ice thickness was less than 1 m and the ship speed was around 3 5 m s thus it seems that the ice breaker was subjected to lateral forces in the process of pushing the ice next to the hull after hitting it rather than the normal ice breaking process 4 2 motion data analysis in frequency domain the translational and rotational motions were calculated from measured data and plotted in the frequency domain by fft as shown in fig 13 the main peaks appeared at frequencies close to 0 hz which is characteristic of the motion of a rigid body and their magnitudes show the same results as the previous section as sway roll and yaw motions are dominant in the figure the three dominant motions sway roll and yaw decreased rapidly as the frequency increases while the other surge heave and pitch motions decreased slowly this is because the amplitudes of their main peaks are very large compared to the others in addition another peak appears after the main peak in the heave and pitch motions which is presumed to be due to the resonance effect looking at the frequency band in which the additional peak appears it appears in the band of about 2 0 2 5 hz in the heave motion and about 1 6 2 0 hz in the pitch motion if the external force continuously received from the small pack ices is considered to be equal to that from the short period waves the general tendency of the resonance phenomenon to appear in the heave and pitch motions and for the one to have a shorter resonance period than the other bergdahl 2008 is consistent with the result of this motion data analysis in the frequency domain 4 3 global and local ice loads ice load calculations were performed for a total of 138 tests in 30 cases to calculate the maximum ice loads the method of dividing the case into a number of tests according to a certain measurement time 900 s and checking the maximum value in each test was used rather than the method of classifying the events because the ice conditions of the arctic ocean in 2015 were small pack ice several of which could collide with the ship at the same time hence the ice load calculated using the cog approach represents the global ice load and it means the sum of the ice loads acting on the hull simultaneously due to the collision with several ices on the other hand the ice load calculated using the poi approach represents the local ice load and it means just the ice load acting on the specific point in this study the specific point is the installation location of the strain gauges the resulting global and local ice loads ranged from 1 41 to 4 87 mn using the cog approach and from 0 11 to 1 06 mn using the poi approach at this time the ship speed corresponding to each test was calculated based on the global positioning system gps device information and the range was from 0 3 to 7 4 m s the maximum deviation between the global and local ice loads was 1794 for official 26 2 i e the second test in the 26th official case and the ice concentration was around 75 the ice thickness was less than 1 m and the ship speed was around 5 8 m s for this case the minimum deviation was 254 for official 28 1 and the ice concentration was around 75 the ice thickness was less than 1 m and the ship speed was around 5 2 m s this is because there were at least two or three collisions with ice with the hull at the same time additionally in the global and local ice loads the peaks appear at the different times because of the same reason the global and local ice loads for the cases of official 26 2 and 28 1 are shown in figs 14 and 15 4 4 comparison with results obtained using strain gauges the resultant global and local ice loads calculated from the inertial measurement system were compared with the forces measured from the strain gauges min et al 2016 totally twenty four strain gauges were installed between 102 and 110 frames of the starboard side each strain gage was installed eight each at the design draft and 0 5 m above and below the design draft the area occupied by each strain gauge is 0 8 m 0 5 m comparison results for the cases of the official 5 12 14 16 19 21 23 and 28 that contain four tests in each case are shown in fig 16 and summarized in table 3 the global ice loads calculated using the cog approach were consistently much higher than those of the strain gauges but the local ice loads from the poi approach were little bit lower or higher than those of the strain gauges but showed good agreement with them this is because the resultant ice loads obtained using the strain gauges also represent the local ice loads acting on the same point of impact 4 5 relationship between the ship speed and local ice loads all resultant local ice loads calculated from the inertial measurement system and strain gauges with respect to the ship speed were plotted in fig 17 the maximum local ice loads tended to increase gradually with increasing ship speed to obtain the relationship between the ship speed and the maximum local ice loads the linear fitting was used with the maximum local ice loads per ship speeds the linear equation is 7 f 0 1889 v m n where v m s is the ship speed during the whole ice sea trials in 2015 the ice condition was small pack ices and the concentration was around 75 when the video taken during the voyage in 2015 was investigated it was estimated that the thickness of the actual sea ice is thinner than the 1 m min et al 2016 5 conclusions in this paper a series of procedures that included calibration filtering resampling numerical differentiation and integration solving the equations of motion and calculating the ice loads was presented ice loads were calculated based on the assumption that the ship hull is a rigid body using the motion data measured by the inertial measurement system during the arctic ocean voyage in 2015 the center of gravity cog approach and the point of impact poi approach were each used to calculate the ice loads in the motion data in the time domain the sway roll and yaw motions were dominant in the collision with the small pack ices because the pack ices were pushed to the side in the motion data in the frequency domain the dominance of the above three motions was also shown and an additional peak appeared in the heave and pitch motions which seemed to be due to the resonance effects like a ship motion in short period wave comparing the ice loads from the inertial measurement system and the strain gauges the global ice loads estimated through the cog approach were determined to be larger than the local ice loads estimated through the poi approach the local ice loads measured from the strain gauges were similar to those estimated through the poi approach when the ship speed is considered there was a linear relationship between the ship speed and the local ice loads and the equation was derived using the linear fitting this linear equation shows the local ice load according to the ship speed when the ice concentration is around 75 and the ice thickness is less than 1 m finally in place of the strain gauge that has been used traditionally the potential of using the inertial measurement system method for predicting the ice loads on the korean ice

including cutting hsu et al 2013 conveying xiao et al 2015 long et al 2016 mining liu et al 2016 surface treatment soyama 2007 and etc with the booming ocean industry and the prevalence of large scale exploitation platforms waterjet technology has also been introduced in both the deep sea and offshore exploration for instance kohan et al 2015 investigated a jetting system to move the self elevating mobile jack ups units which is employed for offshore exploration and development purposes however the erosion effect of waterjet reduces drastically due to the high confining pressure and shock excitation underwater as a result advanced waterjet technologies such as pulsed waterjets and cavitation waterjets are introduced to improve the jet performance self resonating cavitation waterjets srcw are an integration of pulsed waterjets and cavitation waterjets srcw not only combine the advantages of both cavitation waterjets and pulsed waterjets but also possesses two unique merits 1 they can produce effective pulsed waterjet without using any moving parts in the supply system 2 they can significantly increase the cavitation inception number chahine and johnson 1985 these two merits guarantee the durability and reliability of srcw in harsh working environments like deep sea mining and clay cleaning as a result srcw have been the subject of relatively intense studies several srcw nozzle design concepts were developed johnson et al 1982 a b and c organ pipe pulser and pulser fed the organ pipe nozzle was the simplest one and used for the deep hole rock cutting and demonstrated its ability to substantially outperform conventional nozzle chahine et al 1983 chahine and courbiere 1986 1995 li et al 2005 2009 further study focusing on the effects of area discontinuity and inner surface on srcw was achieved by li 2016a b stronger jet modulations were achieved in pulser and pulser fed which were consisted of the organ pipe and the helmholtz resonator however the pulser was strictly limited by its structural parameters and the pulser fed suffers from the excessive energy loss johnson et al 1981 these pioneering studies have paved a way for the research on the helmholtz resonator liao and tang 1987 optimized the shape of impinging edge based on equations of disturbance wave and two dimension vortex and found that the conical impinging edge with an angle of 120 fig 1 outperformed other nozzles based on the acoustically tuned mechanism li et al 2000 analogized the srcw nozzle to the electric circuit and calculated the oscillation frequency which was in accordance with some experimental results in the high pressure low flowrate hplf condition in addition to the acoustic modulation liao and tang 1989 also concluded that the vapor around the bulk flow acts as an accumulator due to its compressibility this theory termed the gas spring theory contributes to the low frequency oscillation in the low pressure high flowrate lphf condition the inspiratory srcw was proposed and developed by gao et al 2012 based on the negative pressure zone in the chamber in their field experiments liu 2015 the inspiratory srcw was adopted in clay cleaning in the underwater condition and achieved preferably results the effects of compressible gas on the oscillation frequency were investigated by hu et al 2014 and liu et al 2017 in spite of such rewarding developments there is still a relevant degree of uncertainty in the design stage arising from the lack of reliable methods for predicting the eigen frequency especially for the lphf nozzle and inspiratory nozzle due to the synergism of jet instabilities and the helmholtz resonance the oscillation amplitudes of srcw are typically nonlinear rockwell and naudascher 1978 the cavitation also has effects on the modulating mechanism johnson et al 1981 as well as entrained air as a result the oscillation signals are non linear and non stationary and these non stationary moreover there are several electronic signals which act as noises should be filtered in the experimental situations to the best of our knowledge there is rather limited study which mentioned the signals filtering in order to select the real signals caused by the oscillation it is reasonable to filter and transform properly these nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics with a new method in the present work to have a better understanding of oscillation mechanism of 120 lphf nozzle experiments with three air inspiratory methods were conducted no inspiratory air self inspiratory air driven by negative pressure in the chamber and forced inspiratory air powered by air compressor moreover the various pressure drops 10 bar 20 bar and 25 bar were also considered hilbert huang transform hht combined with empirical mode decomposition emd were used in filtering and analyzing the pressure signals in the chamber for they are capable of transforming non stationary and non linear signals based on the filtered and transformed results the energy fluctuation was investigated and the gas spring theory was verified through experimental methods a modified model consists of fluidic networks and gas spring theory was proposed for the frequency prediction as the shifts in the relative importance of the various frequencies have followed the cleaning efficiency the present study focused on the frequency could serve as a supplement for better and more efficient utilizations of srcw 2 experimental setup and procedures the experiment was conducted using a multifunctional waterjet test bench fig 2 independently developed by our research team the flow was supplied from a high pressure plunger pump with a maximum flow rate of 120 l min the operating pressure can be regulated through the control table from 0 bar to 600 bar continuously a pressure transducer model cy100 was installed immediately next to the nozzle inlet and the inlet pressure of each test could be accurately controlled in this way the other pressure transducer was positioned on the nozzle to measure the pressure fluctuations in the oscillation chamber the height of the transducer thread is the same as the thickness of the nozzle shell to minimize the effects of transducer on the flow field all pressure transducers adopted in experiments were calibrated by the manufacturers and the main uncertainty in this experiment was the accuracy of the pressure transducer which was less than 0 5 fs for the experiments of forced inspiratory air the pressurized air was supplied by an air compressor whose working pressure can be continuously regulated from 0 to 10 bar the helmholtz nozzle used in the experiment is shown in fig 3 and was designed according to the optimal structure with the jmp method by wang 2013 the upstream nozzle had an inlet diameter of d i n 13 mm a convergent angle α 14 and an outlet diameter d 1 5 9 mm the chamber diameter was constant with d c 72 mm and the chamber length l c 36 6 mm a downstream nozzle was used with d 2 10 7 mm there are four suction holes of d s 2 mm with a uniform distribution around the circumference of the chamber according to the simulation results by zhou 2016 set the exit at the upstream nozzle as the origin the dimensionless distance of suction hole is x s l s 0 8 a fitting was used for connecting the jet bench and the nozzle each process of pressure acquisition was carried out over 60 s and the sampling frequency was set as 1200 hz to capture the pressure fluctuations caused by the quasi periodical variation of the two phase flow instead of the real transient evolution of the cavitating flow the minimum pressures p min which contributes to the cavitation inception during this period could be directly read from the computer in terms of the jet oscillation frequency the time domain pressure signals could be converted to frequency domain signals after emd filtering by hht the frequency domain signals which converted by fft were also presented for compassion 3 experimental results 3 1 chamber pressure the time resolved chamber pressure signals of the no inspiratory case at inlet pressure of 20 bar is presented in fig 4 negative pressure oscillations were easily captured by the pressure transducer positioned in the chamber the negative pressure was observed and contributes to the cavitation together with the dynamic pressure since the bubble cluster in the chamber dominate the fundamental frequency the negative pressure of frequency resolved oscillation should be approached the fourier spectrum of chamber pressure is presented in fig 5 which is dominated by the dc term because of the non zero mean pressures the fourier spectrum shows sharp peaks at 50 hz 150 hz and 250 hz the according hilbert huang spectrum is also presented in fig 6 which is an energy frequency time distribution the persistent energy resides along 50 hz horizontally which shows agreement with the dominating 50 hz in the fourier spectrum however the hilbert huang spectrum shows strong intrawave frequency modulation which is presented as variable frequency oscillation between 110 hz and 210 hz detailed information of frequency oscillation is beyond the reach of fft other than the lack of details the fourier spectrum has a wider energy distribution without distinguished peaks in the range of low frequency the hilbert huang spectrum has much better frequency definition and also eliminates the troublesome step of removing the mean values for the large dc term in data with non zero mean the differences between the fourier spectrum and hilbert huang spectrum could be explained through the signal form after performing each transform the pressure signals expanded in fourier representation is 1 p t j 1 a j e i ω j t where a j and ω j are denote the amplitude and instantaneous frequency of each data respectively both a j and ω j are constants the same pressure signals after performing hht can be expressed in the following form 2 p t j 1 a j t exp i ω j t d t with both a j and ω j being functions of time the variable amplitude and the instantaneous frequency in hht enabled the expansion to accommodate non stationary data and the amplitude and the frequency modulations are clearly separated it thus enables us to break through the restriction of the constant amplitude and fixed frequency fourier expansion and to arrive at a variable amplitude and frequency representation huang et al 1999 based on the hht the energy frequency time distribution is obtained noted as h ω t 3 2 inlet pressure the inlet pressure signals fig 7 are presented to identify whether 50 hz is the fundamental frequency caused by oscillation no obvious oscillation was observed in the inlet pressure and the signal shape which was dominated by the motor and plunger pump was different with the chamber signal the fourier spectrum of inlet pressure after removing mean value is presented in fig 8 the reciprocating frequency f r of 16 3 hz was generated by the plunger s reciprocating motion and can be calculated by eq 3 3 f r f i f p n k 60 the control table showed 43 6 hz when the inlet pressure is 20 bar and the according reciprocating frequency is 15 96 hz the error is about 2 caused by the energy loss it was found that fourier based analysis spreads energy to the high frequency range as the harmonics traditionally these harmonics are viewed as a matter of fact but huang et al 1998 had revealed that the fourier expansion is a mathematical approximation to a nonlinear physical process 3 3 signal filtering and construction the coherence analysis was performed to identify the periodic correlation between the inlet pressure and chamber pressure and their correlation degree was measured by the coherent coefficient the higher the coherent coefficient is the stronger the periodic correlation is in fig 9 the coherent coefficients are of high value at 50 hz and its harmonics 150 hz 250 hz and etc the signals of 50 hz come from upstream of the nozzle and are mainly electronic signals caused by motor with 50 hz as a result these electronic signals should be eliminated in this study the signals filter was approached by emd which is a non linear and non stationary time domain decomposition method emd is an adaptive data driven algorithm that decomposes a time series into multiple empirical modes known as intrinsic mode functions imfs wang 2013 each imf represents a narrow band frequency amplitude modulation that is often related to a specific physical process the rule for interpreting the physical significance of the imfs is that the scales should be clearly separated huang et al 1998 imf 1 4 of the chamber pressure are presented in fig 10 the uniform amplitude high frequency component representing the intrinsic frequency of the motor should be eliminated the intermediate frequency component represents the oscillation as a demonstration of the versatility of the hilbert spectral analysis the components without the imf 1 2 noted as the first constructed signals can be selected to construct the hilbert spectrum shown in fig 12 the peaks of negative pressure become more obvious to verify the reliability of filtering results by emd the low pass filter was used to filter the signals above 50 hz the signals before and after filtering are presented in fig 11 a small range of useless signals were observed in the filtered signals the filtered signals by two different methods are put together for comparison the first constructed signals are shown in the red solid line while the signals filtered by low pass filter shown in the black dash in fig 12 to eliminate the useless signals only the signals within 50 s were presented it seems that there is a certain delay between two groups of signals which is attributed to the range of useless signals caused by low pass filter the correlation analysis was performed to identify the translation correlation between the signals filtered by two methods moved by the peak value of the correlation coefficient the two groups of signals show great agreements especially for the oscillations of negative pressure the results showed that the emd serves as a filter to separate the electronic signals and the pressure fluctuations without any ambiguity which shows that the components of the emd are usually physical construction of the special pressure signals with selected imf components is an equivalent of bandpass fostering through emd yet it is different from the fourier bandpass filtering for signals are not restricted by the stationarity requirement as in the fourier analysis moreover there is no useless signals after filtering by the method of emd when the noise signals of high frequency were eliminated the tendency component of low frequency should also be well addressed as mentioned by huang et al 1998 the component representing the trend can easily overwhelm the fluctuating components therefore it should not be included unless specially justified first four components of the first constructed signals are presented in fig 13 and these intermittent components represent the bulk of the turbulent energy in order to study in frequency range of intermittent pressure in detail a special pressure signal for the components imf 1 through imf 8 which collectively are of characteristics of oscillation is constructed as in fig 14 with green solid line we cannot detect any change in the overall energy level but we can certainly see the intermittency as excepted the fluctuating components of the oscillation contain relatively low energy compared with the mean jet or the trend as shown by the red line if the energy of the trend is added to the fluctuation the overall energy is quite leveled but the density is too high to be shown with the fluctuating components because the total energy is dominated by the trend huang et al 1998 recommended its omission in construction of pressure signal the first constructed signals are also plotted in fig 14 as shown by the blue dotted line and it seems that the constructed signals through imf 1 to imf 8 are sufficient to obtain the fundamental frequency with respect to the oscillations of negative pressure thus the final constructed signal was obtained by eliminated both the high frequency noise signals and low frequency trend signals the discussions of various pressure drops and inspiratory methods in the next section are all based on the final constructed signals and the final constructed signals with various condition are presented in fig 15 4 the oscillation mechanism 4 1 fluidics networks focused on the chamber pressure fluidic networks are a combination of hydrodynamic and electrical circuits and are highly beneficial for complicated system design to describe the behavior of fluidic networks using electrical engineering methods we need two quantities analogous to current and voltage mass flow q m as an analog to current i is easily found because mass flow is conserved therefore the node theorem in fluidic circuits will be given by q m 0 the mechanical power p eq 4 is taken because fluidic potential as it is equal to the change of entropy along a streamline 4 p d p ρ u 2 2 p ρ p ρ u 2 2 based on the research conducted by luo 1988 the coupling effect of acoustic vortex could be analogized to a fluidic network consisted of resistance inductance and capacitance as mentioned in the section 2 the helmholtz nozzle consists of upstream nozzle and downstream nozzle the upstream nozzle is a convergent nozzle and is viewed as an analog to fluidic resistance to pressure drop occurred in the upstream nozzle the equivalent circuit for upstream nozzle is presented in fig 16 and the value of resistance is calculated based on the bernoulli law and the equation of continuity the positive resistance is responsible for the pressure decrease and the negative resistance for the pressure increase as the present study focused on the pressure oscillation in the chamber the equivalent circuit of the downstream is aimed at the chamber and the pressure fluctuation beyond outlet of the downstream nozzle is not focused in the present work the chamber is viewed as a lc oscillator and the equivalent circuit is presented in fig 17 the impedance for the whole equivalent circuit fig 18 is obtained resonance occurs when the imaginary part of the impedance equals zero and thus the resonant frequency is calculated as follow 15 ω f l 1 ω f c 0 16 ω f 1 l c 17 f f 2 π ω f 1 2 π l c 1 2 π a 1 e m l 1 v c since the bulk moduli of air and water can differ by orders of magnitude the elastic bulk modulus of elasticity of the mixture is calculated as follow 18 e m e l e g e g 1 α v e l α v e g α v the final equation of resonant frequency is obtained 19 f f 1 2 π a 1 e g l 1 v c α v 4 2 a modified model with gas spring theory in addition to the acoustic vortex coupling effect discussed above the effects of cavitation should also be considered according to the research conducted by long et al 2017 the relation between the cavitation and the vortex can be further investigated based on the simplified vorticity equation 20 d ω z d t ω v z ρ p ρ 2 z the term on the left hand side represents the rate of the vorticity change the first term on the right hand side is the vortex dilatation term and the second term is called the baroclinic torque the corresponding quantities are given as 21 ω z v y x v x y 22 ω z v z ω z v x x v y y 23 ρ p ρ 2 z 1 ρ ρ x p y ρ y p x as expressed in eq 22 the dilatation term is proportional to the velocity divergence meanwhile according to the transport equation of vapor volume fraction eq 24 ji et al 2014 the velocity divergence is directly related to the mass transfer rate the dilatation term is related to the mass transfer rate through its link to velocity divergence 24 d α v d t α v t v α v ρ ρ l ρ v v the mass transfer rate between liquid and vapor can be given as 25 m ρ l ρ v ρ l ρ v v in other words the vorticity dilatation is correlated with the mass transformer rate between liquid and vapor it was found that the cavitation vortex interaction also occurs in the oscillation process for the helmholtz nozzle in hplf condition the high frequencies order of khz involved corresponding to sound wave lengths in water of less than 0 3 m suggest that acoustic oscillator or resonator concepts should be of particular interest johnson et al 1981 for the lphf nozzle the oscillation period is quite long which means the time of phase transition is more than the relaxation time of the jet passing through the cavity wang 2005 and the cavitation vortex interaction should be considered to further investigate on the cavitation vortex interaction the accumulating mechanism of the bubble cluster was investigated by introducing the instantaneous energy density ie 26 i e t ω h 2 ω t d ω where h ω t is the energy frequency time distribution and is obtained from the hht the ω is noted as circular frequency the ie depends on time and it can be used to check the energy fluctuation the ie spectrum of no inspiratory jet with inlet pressure of 20 bar is presented in fig 19 energy fluctuations were observed indicating that the energy in the chamber is discontinuous in accordance with the gas spring theory acknowledged by most scholars though the discontinuous energy is observed the relation between the bubble cluster and the energy variation is still required to verify the gas spring theory in fact the negative pressure oscillations are closely related to the bubble cluster in the chamber and it is reasonable to describe the variation of bubble cluster based on the pressure signals in the chamber the relation between the bubble cluster and the instantaneous energy density was estimated using the bubble color mapped figures fig 20 the data points of oscillation pressure were represented by the bubbles and the color and size of bubbles reflect the value of the instantaneous energy density the instantaneous energy density is of high value when the pressure oscillates and the pressure oscillation is attributed to the expansion and contraction of the bubble cluster the energy was stored in the bubble cluster when the collective bubbles expanded while released when they contacted the gas spring theory was verified experimental results show that the accumulating effects of the bubble cluster plays a major role in the lphf nozzle oscillation moreover though the eq 19 shows good agreement with the srcw in the hplf condition it is much larger when compared with frequency of srcw in the lphf condition this is due to the oscillation mechanism in these two conditions is quite different the large ring vortices are formed in the cavity and discrete water slugs emitted from the hplf nozzle periodically for the lphf nozzle the cycling of loading is achieved by the uneven outputs of the jet energy and impulse at different time segments since the time of phase transition is more than the relaxation time of the jet passing through the cavity the water slugs are not formed in time the effects of bubble cluster should be considered when calculating the resonant frequency the cavitation clouds in the chamber could be analogous to a variable fluidic resistance which can be viewed as a combination of a fluidic resistance and a variable mass flow supply fig 21 since the variable mass flow supply caused by the cavitation clouds is a function of time it affects the frequency of the lc oscillator coupling between the lc oscillator and the variable mass flow supply is rather difficult to achieve and the period of variable mass flow supply is much longer than the period of lc oscillation only a rough range of oscillation frequency of the lphf nozzle was obtained the accumulating time for cavitation clouds τ v which means the period of the cavitation cloud expansion and contraction was introduced to characterize the effects of variable mass flow supply on the oscillation frequency the period for lphf oscillation is within the range determined by both the lc oscillator and the cavitation clouds 27 t l p h f f 1 f f τ v τ v τ v 1 f f 28 f l p h f 1 t l p h f f f 1 τ v f f 1 τ v 4 3 analysis of frequency characteristics the marginal spectrum was used to obtain the fundamental frequency of oscillation as the energy distribution is the function of time and frequency is too diffused to yield any quantitative information marginal spectrum is calculated according to eq 29 and it represents the cumulated amplitude over the entire data span in a probabilistic sense 29 h ω 0 t h ω t d t the frequency in marginal spectrum has a totally different meaning from the fourier spectral analysis in the fourier representation the existence of energy at a frequency ω means a component of a sine or cosine wave persisted through the time span of the data here the existence of energy at the frequency ω means only that in the while time span of the data there is a higher likelihood for such a wave to have appeared locally in fact the hilbert huang spectrum is a weighted non normalized joint amplitude frequency time distribution the weight assigned to each time frequency cell is the local amplitude consequently the frequency in the marginal spectrum indicates only the likelihood that an oscillation with such a frequency exists the constructed signals with various pressure drops are presented in fig 22 as well as the according marginal spectrums with the increasing inlet pressure the absolute values of negative pressure increase due to the intensified turbulent momentum transportation and entrainment between the main jet and the quiescent fluid meanwhile the negative pressure peaks became more intense with higher pressure drop the fundamental frequency for pressure drop of 10 bar is 0 18 hz for 20 bar is 0 45 hz and for 25 bar is 0 67 hz the frequency variation was in accordance with the modified model of frequency prediction the spectrum of instantaneous energy density with various pressure drops was presented in fig 23 it was found that the inlet pressure drop has effects on both the frequency and amplitude of the instantaneous energy density with the increasing pressure drop the intervals between two peak of instantaneous energy density shortened which is attributed to the more energy is accumulated for bubble cluster within a same time range the accumulating time shortens as a result according to the eq 28 the frequency of lphf increases as well the pressure signals and marginal spectrum with various inspiratory methods are presented in fig 24 with connecting with the atmosphere through the suction hole the negative pressures of self inspiratory jet decrease to some degree the absolute peak values of negative pressure drastically decline due to the continual pressurized air supply the fundamental frequency for the no inspiratory and forced inspiratory jet are 0 45 hz and 0 43 hz respectively for the self inspiratory jet the marginal spectrum gives a bimodal distribution from 0 45 hz to 0 62 hz suggesting a typical distribution of a periodic variable the differences in amplitude are much more distinguished than differences in fundamental frequency caused by various inspiratory methods in fact the accumulating time for energy storage is not as important as the condition of no inspiratory when connected to the atmosphere especially when pressurized air continually supplied the volume fraction of air starts to play an important role in the oscillation process the frequency characteristics is attributed to the unsteady motion of the mixture flow in which the water and the bubble cluster appeared alternately liu et al 2017 there are only a few differences in the frequency under various inspiratory method due to the solubility of air in water hu et al 2014 in other words there is no spare room in water for the air when the air is continually introduced and the physical properties of the mixture flow become stable with the increase of entrained air it is also concluded that the inspiratory capacity for the lphf nozzle is quite large as well as the volume fraction of vapor caused by the cavitation the instantaneous energy density declined drastically with the air supply especially for the continual compressed air supply fig 25 the pressure distribution is affected by the atmosphere through the suction hole and the peak values of instantaneous energy density declined to half of the density without air supply the instantaneous energy density reduced by two orders of magnitude since the negative pressure zone in the chamber had been totally destroyed when the compressed air continually injected into the chamber though the energy density is of low value when air is introduced it is acknowledged that the moderate air is good for improving the cleaning efficiency as the energy dissipation decreases as well as avoiding the effects of water wedge the air water jet is widely used in the cleaning industry 5 conclusions pressure oscillations in the chamber are closely related to the fundamental frequency of srcw especially for the lphf jet in the present study the chamber pressures were measured under various inspiratory methods and different pressure drops the hht combined with the emd was used to filter the pressure signals and obtain the fundamental frequency based on the theory analysis and the experimental results following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hht combined with the emd is a feasible method to obtain a better frequency definition of lphf nozzle because the pressure signals are non stationary and non linear this method is capable of filtering the undesired signal without ambiguity and obtaining a better frequency resulting definition 2 the effects of cavitation should be considered for calculating the frequency of lphf nozzle as the cavitation vortex interaction occurs in the oscillation process based on the experimental results the bubble cluster accounts for the energy fluctuation in accordance with the gas spring theory 3 a modified model was proposed based on the combination of fluidic networks and the gas spring theory the modified model was in accordance with the frequency variation under various pressure drops the accumulating time for energy storage shortens with the higher pressure drop and the frequency increases as a result 4 the oscillation mechanism is different with without entrained air when air was entrained the frequency characteristics is attributed to the unsteady motion of the mixture flow in which the water and the bubble cluster appeared alternately in the present study the differences of amplitude are much larger compared to frequency variation under various inspiratory methods due to the physical properties of the mixture flow become stable with the increase of entrained air a modified model for frequency prediction was proposed in this preliminary study however since it is hard to measure the volume fraction of vapor caused by fierce cavitation as well as the accumulating time for each period no specified solution was obtained through the frequency model the volume fraction of air and accumulating time should be achieved with the help of the simulation in a future

including cutting hsu et al 2013 conveying xiao et al 2015 long et al 2016 mining liu et al 2016 surface treatment soyama 2007 and etc with the booming ocean industry and the prevalence of large scale exploitation platforms waterjet technology has also been introduced in both the deep sea and offshore exploration for instance kohan et al 2015 investigated a jetting system to move the self elevating mobile jack ups units which is employed for offshore exploration and development purposes however the erosion effect of waterjet reduces drastically due to the high confining pressure and shock excitation underwater as a result advanced waterjet technologies such as pulsed waterjets and cavitation waterjets are introduced to improve the jet performance self resonating cavitation waterjets srcw are an integration of pulsed waterjets and cavitation waterjets srcw not only combine the advantages of both cavitation waterjets and pulsed waterjets but also possesses two unique merits 1 they can produce effective pulsed waterjet without using any moving parts in the supply system 2 they can significantly increase the cavitation inception number chahine and johnson 1985 these two merits guarantee the durability and reliability of srcw in harsh working environments like deep sea mining and clay cleaning as a result srcw have been the subject of relatively intense studies several srcw nozzle design concepts were developed johnson et al 1982 a b and c organ pipe pulser and pulser fed the organ pipe nozzle was the simplest one and used for the deep hole rock cutting and demonstrated its ability to substantially outperform conventional nozzle chahine et al 1983 chahine and courbiere 1986 1995 li et al 2005 2009 further study focusing on the effects of area discontinuity and inner surface on srcw was achieved by li 2016a b stronger jet modulations were achieved in pulser and pulser fed which were consisted of the organ pipe and the helmholtz resonator however the pulser was strictly limited by its structural parameters and the pulser fed suffers from the excessive energy loss johnson et al 1981 these pioneering studies have paved a way for the research on the helmholtz resonator liao and tang 1987 optimized the shape of impinging edge based on equations of disturbance wave and two dimension vortex and found that the conical impinging edge with an angle of 120 fig 1 outperformed other nozzles based on the acoustically tuned mechanism li et al 2000 analogized the srcw nozzle to the electric circuit and calculated the oscillation frequency which was in accordance with some experimental results in the high pressure low flowrate hplf condition in addition to the acoustic modulation liao and tang 1989 also concluded that the vapor around the bulk flow acts as an accumulator due to its compressibility this theory termed the gas spring theory contributes to the low frequency oscillation in the low pressure high flowrate lphf condition the inspiratory srcw was proposed and developed by gao et al 2012 based on the negative pressure zone in the chamber in their field experiments liu 2015 the inspiratory srcw was adopted in clay cleaning in the underwater condition and achieved preferably results the effects of compressible gas on the oscillation frequency were investigated by hu et al 2014 and liu et al 2017 in spite of such rewarding developments there is still a relevant degree of uncertainty in the design stage arising from the lack of reliable methods for predicting the eigen frequency especially for the lphf nozzle and inspiratory nozzle due to the synergism of jet instabilities and the helmholtz resonance the oscillation amplitudes of srcw are typically nonlinear rockwell and naudascher 1978 the cavitation also has effects on the modulating mechanism johnson et al 1981 as well as entrained air as a result the oscillation signals are non linear and non stationary and these non stationary moreover there are several electronic

developed by our research team the flow was supplied from a high pressure plunger pump with a maximum flow rate of 120 l min the operating pressure can be regulated through the control table from 0

other pressure transducer was positioned on the nozzle to measure the pressure fluctuations in the oscillation chamber the height of the transducer thread is the same as the thickness of the nozzle shell to minimize the effects of transducer on the flow field all pressure transducers adopted in experiments were calibrated by the manufacturers and the main uncertainty in this experiment was the accuracy of the pressure transducer which was less than 0 5 fs for the experiments of forced inspiratory air the pressurized air was supplied by an air compressor whose working pressure can be continuously regulated from 0 to 10 bar the helmholtz nozzle used in the experiment is shown in fig 3 and was designed according to the optimal structure with the jmp method by wang 2013 the upstream nozzle had an inlet diameter of d i n 13 mm a convergent angle α 14 and an outlet diameter d 1 5 9 mm the chamber diameter was constant with d c 72 mm and the chamber length l c 36 6 mm a downstream nozzle was used with d 2 10 7 mm there are four suction holes of d s 2 mm with a uniform distribution around the circumference of the chamber according to the simulation results by zhou 2016 set the exit at the upstream nozzle as the origin the dimensionless distance of suction hole is x s l s 0 8 a fitting was used for connecting the jet bench and the nozzle each process of pressure acquisition was carried out over 60 s and the sampling frequency was set as 1200 hz to capture the pressure fluctuations caused by the quasi periodical variation of the two phase flow instead of the real transient evolution of the cavitating flow the minimum pressures p min which contributes to the cavitation inception during this period could be directly read from the computer in terms of the jet oscillation frequency the time domain pressure signals could be converted to frequency domain signals after emd filtering by hht the frequency domain signals which converted by fft were also presented

beyond the reach of fft other than the lack of details the fourier spectrum has a wider energy distribution without distinguished peaks in the range of low frequency the hilbert huang spectrum has much better frequency definition and also eliminates the troublesome step of removing the mean values for the large dc term in data with non zero mean the differences between the fourier spectrum and hilbert huang spectrum could be explained through the signal form after performing each transform the pressure signals expanded in fourier representation is 1 p t j 1 a j e i ω j t where a j and ω j are denote the amplitude and instantaneous frequency of each data respectively both a j and ω j are constants the same pressure signals after performing hht can be expressed in the following form 2 p t j 1 a j t exp i ω j t d t with both a j and ω j being functions of time the variable amplitude and the instantaneous frequency in hht enabled the expansion to accommodate non stationary data and the amplitude and the frequency modulations are clearly separated it thus enables us to break through the restriction of the constant amplitude and fixed frequency fourier expansion and to arrive at a variable amplitude and frequency representation huang et al 1999 based on the hht the energy frequency time distribution is obtained noted as h ω t 3 2 inlet pressure the inlet pressure signals fig 7 are presented to identify whether 50 hz is the fundamental frequency caused by oscillation no obvious oscillation was observed in the inlet pressure and the signal shape which was dominated by the motor and plunger pump was different with the chamber signal the fourier spectrum of inlet pressure after removing mean value is presented in fig 8 the reciprocating frequency f r of 16 3 hz was generated by the plunger s reciprocating motion and can be calculated by eq 3 3 f r f i f p n k 60 the control table showed 43 6 hz when the inlet pressure is 20 bar and the according reciprocating frequency is 15 96 hz the error is about 2 caused by the energy loss it was found that fourier based analysis spreads energy to the high frequency range as the harmonics traditionally these harmonics are viewed as a matter of fact but huang et al 1998 had revealed that the fourier expansion is a mathematical approximation to a nonlinear physical process 3 3 signal filtering and construction the coherence analysis was performed to identify the periodic correlation between the inlet pressure and chamber pressure and their correlation degree was measured by the coherent coefficient the higher the coherent coefficient is the stronger the periodic correlation is in fig 9 the coherent coefficients are of high value at 50 hz and its harmonics 150 hz 250 hz and etc the signals of 50 hz come from upstream of the nozzle and are mainly electronic signals caused by motor with 50 hz as a result these electronic signals should be eliminated in this study the signals filter was approached by emd which is a non linear and non stationary time domain decomposition method emd is an adaptive data driven algorithm that decomposes a time series into multiple empirical modes known as intrinsic mode functions imfs wang 2013 each imf represents a narrow band frequency amplitude modulation that is often related to a specific physical process the rule for interpreting the physical significance of the imfs is that the scales should be clearly separated huang et al 1998 imf 1 4 of the chamber pressure are presented in fig 10 the uniform amplitude high frequency component representing the intrinsic frequency of the motor should be eliminated the intermediate frequency component represents the oscillation as a demonstration of the versatility of the hilbert spectral analysis the components without the imf 1 2 noted as the first constructed signals can be selected to construct the hilbert spectrum shown in fig 12 the peaks of negative pressure become more obvious to verify the reliability of filtering results by emd the low pass filter was used to filter the signals above 50 hz the signals before and after filtering are presented in fig 11 a small range of useless signals were observed in the filtered signals the filtered signals by two different methods are put together for comparison the first constructed signals are shown in the red solid line while the signals filtered by low pass filter shown in the black dash in fig 12 to eliminate the useless signals only the signals within 50 s were presented it seems that there is a certain delay between two groups of signals which is attributed to the range of useless signals caused by low pass filter the correlation analysis was performed to identify the translation correlation between the signals filtered by two methods moved by the peak value of the correlation coefficient the two groups of signals show great agreements especially for the oscillations of negative pressure the results showed that the emd serves as a filter to separate the electronic signals and the pressure fluctuations without any ambiguity which shows that the components of the emd are usually physical construction of the special pressure signals with selected imf components is an equivalent of bandpass fostering through emd yet it is different from the fourier bandpass filtering for signals are not restricted by the stationarity requirement as in the fourier analysis moreover there is no useless signals after filtering by the method of emd when the noise signals of high frequency were eliminated the tendency component of low frequency should also be well addressed as mentioned by huang et al 1998 the component representing the trend can easily overwhelm the fluctuating components therefore it should not be included unless specially justified first four components of the first constructed signals are presented in fig 13 and these intermittent components represent the bulk of the turbulent energy in order to study in frequency range of intermittent pressure in detail a special pressure signal for the components imf 1 through imf 8 which collectively are of characteristics of oscillation is constructed as in fig 14 with green solid line we cannot detect any change in the overall energy level but we can certainly see the intermittency as excepted the fluctuating components of the oscillation contain relatively low energy compared with the mean jet or the trend as shown by the red line if the energy of the trend is added to the fluctuation the overall energy is quite leveled but the density is too high to be shown with the fluctuating components because the total energy is dominated by the trend huang et al 1998 recommended its omission in construction of pressure signal the first constructed signals are also plotted in fig 14 as shown by the blue dotted line and it seems that the constructed signals through imf 1 to imf 8 are sufficient to obtain the fundamental frequency with respect to the oscillations of negative pressure thus the final constructed signal was obtained by eliminated both the high frequency noise signals and low frequency trend signals the discussions of various pressure drops and inspiratory methods in the next section are all based on the final constructed signals and the final constructed signals with various condition are presented in fig 15 4 the oscillation mechanism 4 1 fluidics networks focused on the chamber pressure fluidic networks are a combination of hydrodynamic and electrical circuits and are highly beneficial for complicated system design to describe the behavior of fluidic networks using electrical engineering methods we need two quantities analogous to current and voltage mass flow q m as an analog to current i is easily found because mass flow is conserved therefore the node theorem in fluidic circuits will be given by q m 0 the mechanical power p eq 4 is taken because fluidic potential as it is equal to the change of entropy along a streamline 4 p d p ρ u 2 2 p ρ p ρ u 2 2 based on the research conducted by luo 1988 the coupling effect of acoustic vortex could be analogized to a fluidic network consisted of resistance inductance and capacitance as mentioned in the section 2 the helmholtz nozzle consists of upstream nozzle and downstream nozzle the upstream nozzle is a convergent nozzle and is viewed as an analog to fluidic resistance to pressure drop occurred in the upstream nozzle the equivalent circuit for upstream nozzle is presented in fig 16 and the value of resistance is calculated based on the bernoulli law and the equation of continuity the positive resistance is responsible for the pressure decrease and the negative resistance for the pressure increase as the present study focused on the pressure oscillation in the chamber the equivalent circuit of the downstream is aimed at the chamber and the pressure fluctuation beyond outlet of the downstream nozzle is not focused in the present work the chamber is viewed as a lc oscillator and the equivalent circuit is presented in fig 17 the impedance for the whole equivalent circuit fig 18 is obtained resonance occurs when the imaginary part of the impedance equals zero and thus the resonant frequency is calculated as follow 15 ω f l 1 ω f c 0 16 ω f 1 l c 17 f f 2 π ω f 1 2 π l c 1 2 π a 1 e m l 1 v c since the bulk moduli of air and water can differ by orders of magnitude the elastic bulk modulus of elasticity of the mixture is calculated as follow 18 e m e l e g e g 1 α v e l α v e g α v the final equation of resonant frequency is obtained 19 f f 1 2 π a 1 e g l 1 v c α v 4 2 a modified model with gas spring theory in addition to the acoustic vortex coupling effect discussed above the effects of cavitation should also be considered according to the research conducted by long et al 2017 the relation between the cavitation and the vortex can be further investigated based on the simplified vorticity equation 20 d ω z d t ω v z ρ p ρ 2 z the term on the left hand side represents the rate of the vorticity change the first term on the right hand side is the vortex dilatation term and the second term is called the baroclinic torque the corresponding quantities are given as 21 ω z v y x v x y 22 ω z v z ω z v x x v y y 23 ρ p ρ 2 z 1 ρ ρ x p y ρ y p x as expressed in eq 22 the dilatation term is proportional to the velocity divergence meanwhile according to the transport equation of vapor volume fraction eq 24 ji et al 2014 the velocity divergence is directly related to the mass transfer rate the dilatation term is related to the mass transfer rate through its link to velocity divergence 24 d α v d t α v t v α v ρ ρ l ρ v v the mass transfer rate between liquid and vapor can be given as 25 m ρ l ρ v ρ l ρ v v in other words the vorticity dilatation is correlated with the mass transformer rate between liquid and vapor it was found that the cavitation vortex interaction also occurs in the oscillation process for the helmholtz nozzle in hplf condition the high frequencies order of khz involved corresponding to sound wave lengths in water of less than 0 3 m suggest that acoustic oscillator or resonator concepts should be of particular interest johnson et al 1981 for the lphf nozzle the oscillation period is quite long which means the time of phase transition is more than the relaxation time of the jet passing through the cavity wang 2005 and the cavitation vortex interaction should be considered to further investigate on the cavitation vortex interaction the accumulating mechanism of the bubble cluster was investigated by introducing the instantaneous energy density ie 26 i e t ω h 2 ω t d ω where h ω t is the energy frequency time distribution and is obtained from the hht the ω is noted as circular frequency the ie depends on time and it can be used to check the energy fluctuation the ie spectrum of no inspiratory jet with inlet pressure of 20 bar is presented in fig 19 energy fluctuations were observed indicating that the energy in the chamber is discontinuous in accordance with the gas spring theory acknowledged by most scholars though the discontinuous energy is observed the relation between the bubble cluster and the energy variation is still required to verify the gas spring theory in fact the negative pressure oscillations are closely related to the bubble cluster in the chamber and it is reasonable to describe the variation of bubble cluster based on the pressure signals in the chamber the relation between the bubble cluster and the instantaneous energy density was estimated using the bubble color mapped figures fig 20 the data points of oscillation pressure were represented by the bubbles and the color and size of bubbles reflect the value of the instantaneous energy density the instantaneous energy density is of high value when the pressure oscillates and the pressure oscillation is attributed to the expansion and contraction of the bubble cluster the energy was stored in the bubble cluster when the collective bubbles expanded while released when they contacted the gas spring theory was verified experimental results show that the accumulating effects of the bubble cluster plays a major role in the lphf nozzle oscillation moreover though the eq 19 shows good agreement with the srcw in the hplf condition it is much larger when compared with frequency of srcw in the lphf condition this is due to the oscillation mechanism in these two conditions is quite different the large ring vortices are formed in the cavity and discrete water slugs emitted from the hplf nozzle periodically for the lphf nozzle the cycling of loading is achieved by the uneven outputs of the jet energy and impulse at different time segments since the time of phase transition is more than the relaxation time of the jet passing through the cavity the water slugs are not formed in time the effects of bubble cluster should be considered when calculating the resonant frequency the cavitation clouds in the chamber could be analogous to a variable fluidic resistance which can be viewed as a combination of a fluidic resistance and a variable mass flow supply fig 21 since the variable mass flow supply caused by the cavitation clouds is a function of time it affects the frequency of the lc oscillator coupling between the lc oscillator and the variable mass flow supply is rather difficult to achieve and the period of variable mass flow supply is much longer than the period of lc oscillation only a rough range of oscillation frequency of the lphf nozzle was obtained the accumulating time for cavitation clouds τ v which means the period of the cavitation cloud expansion and contraction was introduced to characterize the effects of variable mass flow supply on the oscillation frequency the period for lphf oscillation is within the range determined by both the lc oscillator and the cavitation clouds 27 t l p h f f 1 f f τ v τ v τ v 1 f f 28 f l p h f 1 t l p h f f f 1 τ v f f 1 τ v 4 3 analysis of frequency characteristics the marginal spectrum was used to obtain the fundamental frequency of oscillation as the energy distribution is the function of time and frequency is too diffused to yield any quantitative information marginal spectrum is calculated according to eq 29 and it represents the cumulated amplitude over the entire data span in a probabilistic sense 29 h ω 0 t h ω t d t the frequency in marginal spectrum has a totally different meaning from the fourier spectral analysis in the fourier representation the existence of energy at a frequency ω means a component of a sine or cosine wave persisted through the time span of the data here the existence of energy at the frequency ω means only that in the while time span of the data there is a higher likelihood for such a wave to have appeared locally in fact the hilbert huang spectrum is a weighted non normalized joint amplitude frequency time distribution the weight assigned to each time frequency cell is the local amplitude consequently the frequency in the marginal spectrum indicates only the likelihood that an oscillation with such a frequency exists the constructed signals with various pressure drops are presented in fig 22 as well as the according marginal spectrums with the increasing inlet pressure the absolute values of negative pressure increase due to the intensified turbulent momentum transportation and entrainment between the main jet and the quiescent fluid meanwhile the negative pressure peaks became more intense with higher pressure drop the fundamental frequency for pressure drop of 10 bar is 0 18 hz for 20 bar is 0 45 hz and for 25 bar is 0 67 hz the frequency variation was in accordance with the modified model of frequency prediction the spectrum of instantaneous energy density with various pressure drops was presented in fig 23 it was found that the inlet pressure drop has effects on both the frequency and amplitude of the instantaneous energy density with the increasing pressure drop the intervals between two peak of instantaneous energy density shortened which is attributed to the more energy is accumulated for bubble cluster within a same time range the accumulating time shortens as a result according to the eq 28 the frequency of lphf increases as well the pressure signals and marginal spectrum with various inspiratory methods are presented in fig 24 with connecting with the atmosphere through the suction hole the negative pressures of self inspiratory jet decrease to some degree the absolute peak values of negative pressure drastically decline due to the continual pressurized air supply the fundamental frequency for the no inspiratory and forced inspiratory jet are 0 45 hz and 0 43 hz respectively for the self inspiratory jet the marginal spectrum gives a bimodal distribution from 0 45 hz to 0 62 hz suggesting a typical distribution of a periodic variable the differences in amplitude are much more distinguished than differences in fundamental frequency caused by various inspiratory methods in fact the accumulating time for energy storage is not as important as the condition of no inspiratory when connected to the atmosphere especially when pressurized air continually supplied the volume fraction of air starts to play an important role in the oscillation process the frequency characteristics is attributed to the unsteady motion of the mixture flow in which the water and the bubble cluster appeared alternately liu et al 2017 there are only a few differences in the frequency under various inspiratory method due to the solubility of air in water hu et al 2014 in other words there is no spare room in water for the air when the air is continually introduced and the physical properties of the mixture flow become stable with the increase of entrained air it is also concluded that the inspiratory capacity for the lphf nozzle is quite large as well as the volume fraction of vapor caused by the cavitation the instantaneous energy density declined drastically with the air supply especially for the continual compressed air supply fig 25 the pressure distribution is affected by the atmosphere through the suction hole and the peak values of instantaneous energy density declined to half of the density without air supply the instantaneous energy density reduced by two orders of magnitude since the negative pressure zone in the chamber had been totally destroyed when the compressed air continually injected into the chamber though the energy density is of low value when air is introduced it is acknowledged that the moderate air is good for improving the cleaning efficiency as the energy dissipation decreases as well as avoiding the effects of water wedge the air water jet is widely used in the cleaning industry 5 conclusions pressure oscillations in the chamber are closely related to the fundamental frequency of srcw especially for the lphf jet in the present study the chamber pressures were measured under various inspiratory methods and different pressure drops the hht combined with the emd was used to filter the pressure signals and obtain the fundamental frequency based on the theory analysis and the experimental results following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hht combined with the emd is a feasible method to obtain a better frequency definition of lphf nozzle because the pressure signals are non stationary and non linear this method is capable of filtering the undesired signal without ambiguity and obtaining a better frequency resulting definition 2 the effects of cavitation should be considered for calculating the frequency of lphf nozzle as the cavitation vortex interaction occurs in the oscillation process based on the experimental results the bubble cluster accounts for the energy fluctuation in accordance with the gas spring theory 3 a modified model was proposed based on the combination of fluidic networks and the gas spring theory the modified model was in accordance with the frequency variation under various pressure drops the accumulating time for energy storage shortens with the higher pressure drop and the frequency increases as a result 4 the oscillation mechanism is different with without entrained air when air was entrained the frequency characteristics is attributed to the unsteady motion of the mixture flow in which the water and the bubble cluster appeared alternately in the present study the differences of amplitude are much larger compared to frequency variation under various inspiratory methods due to the physical properties of the mixture flow become stable with the increase of entrained air a modified model for frequency prediction was proposed in this preliminary study however since it is hard to measure the volume fraction of vapor caused by fierce cavitation as well as the accumulating time for each period no specified solution was obtained through the frequency model the volume fraction of air and accumulating time should be achieved with the help of the simulation in a future

23594,aiming at fine motion control on a small scale area for unmanned surface vehicle usv an approach for motion planning based on trajectory unit has been proposed by making use of usv s hydrodynamic model and combining corresponding rules the method generates a trajectory unit set which contains different orbit segments through the location and direction that the set of tracks can reach the route searching in research waters can be done finally a practical motion route will be planned for an usv the experimental results show that the planning route can not only avoid obstacles but also meet the movement characteristics of an usv and the approach has realized the fine motion control for an usv in a small range of scenarios keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv motion planning motion modeling trajectory unit 1 introduction with the development and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning unmanned surface vehicles usvs have become an attractive alternative way in a wide variety of marine missions svec et al 2012 such as ocean sampling steimle and hall 2006 search and rescue shafer et al 2008 harbor patrolling simetti et al 2009 and so on to accomplish these tasks it is important for an usv to plan out a safe route under certain circumstances in this field three stages have been developed namely path planning trajectory planning and motion planning path planning as the basic stage treats research object as a particle which has no kinematic and dynamic performance so the problems discussed in this phase are often under a large scale scene the typical one is determining the shortest path kohei 2016 dijkstra algorithm dijkstra 1959 is the classical method to deal with this problem the algorithm searches every direction of node to extend outward iteratively until the end point is reached one drawback is that it costs too much time to search the path to make it more efficient hart hart et al 1968 created a heuristic function to estimate the cost from current point to the final point thus the search direction can be guided as goal oriented and the search time is reduced this approach is now known as a algorithm another problem is finding a collision free path and the representative method is artificial potential field apf khatib 1986 the algorithm simulate an attractive the goal and a repulsive the obstacles potential field in the planning space combining with the two potentials the object can reach the goal without collision in summary the study of path planning has proposed plenty of algorithms and some of them turn out to have good results however there are often differences between planned path and the real trajectory to make the results more realistic the next stage becomes necessary trajectory planning can see as an improvement for path planning instead of regarding research object as a particle trajectory planning takes into account its kinematics parameters such as dimension speed heading and curvatures what this stage tries to do is to make the planned path continuous and smooth lekkas 2014 for instance velocity obstacle approach fiorini and shiller 1998 focuses on the speed and the dimension of research object according to the dimension the dynamic obstacles were expanded firstly then by taking use of relative velocity between research object and obstacle a collision free path can be found among those expanded obstacles dubins path dougherty and woolweaver 1990 put emphasis on heading and curvatures the main idea is that for a particle with unity speed the shortest possible path which meets a maximum curvature bound between a starting pose which contains position and orientation and a finishing pose consists of three pieces and each piece is either a straight line or an arc of a circle apart from the circular curve some other special curves like fermat s spiral dahl 2013 b spline curve hong li et al 2016 clothoid curve yi wang et al 2012 and so on were proposed to replace dubins curves although these methods make planning path closer to the real trajectory trajectory planning in fact is just the adjustment for path planning under part of dynamic constraints it still neglects the interaction among the constraints motion planning is concerned with the control aspect unlike the first two phases it focuses on whether the planning route can be realized via control system thus the mathematical model of the research object will be studied intensively in this stage the research of this field started from unmanned ground vehicles ugv or wheeled mobile robots and the common approach is generally divided into two steps first by making use of traditional path planning algorithm one plans out a collision free path from the start point to the end point then based on the path a controller is designed which contains kinematics and dynamics constraint to drive the robot safely and quickly to the target liang 2010 the key point of this approach is motion control that uses control strategy to reconstruct or approximate the ideal path with different goals the motion control can be classified into point stabilization path tracking and path following hao 2014 another approach is improving traditional path planning method by taking advantage of the robot s mathematical model the most common method is combining nonholonomic constraints of mobile robot with rapidly exploring random tree rrt na et al 2011 mingbo et al 2015 jinze et al 2010 because the state transition in rrt algorithm can be improved by kinetic model and new node generation can be constrained by kinetic equations na et al 2011 apart from making use of rrt some researches combine the mathematical model with state lattice the state lattice pivtoraiko and kelly 2005 is a discretization of the configuration space into a set of states representing configurations and connections between these states where every connection represents a feasible path thus it turns motion planning problems into graph searches bischofberger 2009 for an usv the researches in first two stages usually apply the above mentioned approaches however because of the hydrodynamic force the inertia resistance and response time on waters are larger than those on ground the motion control for usv is more complex and difficult than ugv or wheeled mobile robots and the method of motion planning above can hardly be used for usvs some scholars take advantage of minimax game tree search to select the smallest collision probability trajectory from the possible trajectories pool svec et al 2012 but it is still unclear that how these possible trajectories are generated or what the special properties they are and how to control an usv the specific instruction to achieve the planned path moreover with the increasing density of water traffic the scope of sailing area is decreasing gradually in some special navigation environment small range of autonomous control and fine operation become necessary such as the task of self avoidance and self berthing in harbor areas thus to adapt water environment and achieve fine control this paper presents a method based on trajectory unit as trajectories contain all the dynamic constraints of usv the method first discretizes these trajectories through certain rules and then extracts the position and heading that those discretized trajectories can reach and finally proceeds with route searching under the position and heading constraints 2 hydrodynamic model for usvs trajectories are generated according to the dynamic model of a research object this paper takes advantage of the maneuvering mathematical group mmg method ogawa 1977 to build a hydrodynamic model for an usv the main idea of a mmg model is decomposing fluid forces and moment into several parts which affect hull propeller and rudder shown in fig 1 the external effects on hull are characterized by inertia and viscidity kijima et al 1990 therefore a mmg model consists of an inertia model a viscidity model a propeller model and a rudder model in order to simplify the problem three assumptions are made as follows assumption 1 only planar motions are considered neglecting heaving rolling and pitching for an usv assumption 2 no account of the influence of wind current and waves assumption 3 the rotation direction of the engine is only positive when the usv is steady steaming the rotation speed is considered not change aiming at assumption 3 it is necessary to explain when a ship is sailing on the waters there will be the resistance and the load of propeller will increase which result in the rotation speed n declining at the moment the speed controller will raise the main engine power to offset the increased load of propeller and maintain the rotation speed in the whole process the main engine is working in the closed loop system of the automatic rotation speed control the main engine control model is shown below jia et al 1989 1 t d i e n i e n k p k n 2 π k p k n r 2 π 1 2 π t d q p q p where t d is the time constant i e is the moment of inertia of the whole system k p is the gain of speed controller n r is command rotation speed k is the gain from main driving lever to torque output q p is absorption torque of propeller thus the model is based on three degrees of freedom yawing swaying and surging 2 x x i x h x p x r y y i y h y p y r n n i n h n p n r where i h p r denote the forces or moment of inertia viscidity propeller and rudder respectively 2 1 inertia model in the water the motion of a ship can cause disturbance of surrounding flow field forming fluid medium momentum moment or additional momentum moment calculating differential in the corresponding direction can get the fluid inertia force and moment 3 x i m x u m y v r m y α x r 2 y i m y v m x u r m y α x r n i j z z r m y α x v u r m y m x u v where m x and m y are additional mass along x axis and y axis respectively α x is the coordinate along x axis which the point of action of m y j zz is the additional moment of inertia to z axis u and v are the velocity along x axis and y axis respectively and r is the angular velocity of yawing 2 2 viscidity model the viscidity force and moment that ship effect is related to the geometric features of hull the physical properties of fluid and the motion state of the ship when the first two factors are invariant the viscidity force and moment can be determined by the motion states in particular u v and r in general a second order taylor expansion is used to represent the approximate value of the viscidity force and moment 4 x h x 0 x u δ u y h y v v y r r n h n v v n r r where x 0 is the resistance causing by direct sailing δ u is the velocity change along x axis x u y v y r n v and n r are derivatives for hydrodynamic 2 3 propeller model a propeller provides the main source of marine power apart from producing thrust it can also generate lateral forces and moment whereas comparing with the rudder effect it can be neglected so the model can be expressed as 5 x p 1 t p t y p 0 n p 0 where t p is the thrust deduction coefficient t is the thrust which is related to the propeller s diameter revolving speed water density and the ship s speed of advance 2 4 rudder model a rudder model is the most important part of the model where the main control force and moment is derived it determines a ship s maneuverability and trajectories decomposing the normal force affecting on rudder into longitudinal resistance transverse force and rudder moment 6 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where δ is the rudder angle t r is the resistance deduction coefficient a h is the correction factor x h is the distance between center of gravity and force point from which lateral forces are generated f n is the normal force on the rudder in order to get a desired trajectory it is necessary to establish a control model for the rudder 7 t e δ δ e δ where δ e is the commanding rudder angle and t e is a time constant 3 trajectory unit in general the main idea of a search algorithms is to discretize the continuous space the process first divides the search space into several subspaces then for each subspace it makes use of proper methods to choose the best next subspace and finally it ends when the goal space has been reached for instance the grid map in a algorithm and the step size in apf are the results of discretization however an usv s trajectory is continuous dynamic constraints on the usv are effective along all the points on its trajectory curve this is the discrepancy between search algorithms and actual usv models mending this discrepancy is the key in motion planning in this section we proposed a valid way named trajectory unit to bridge over the gap between search algorithms and usv models 3 1 definition and rules trajectory unit or tu is a series of trajectory segments generated from an usv s hydrodynamic model which are linked with each other by choosing the waypoint that those curves can reach the waters can be searched and the final route is produced by connecting the selected curves to ensure that the final route is continuous and easy to generate tus are restricted by the following rules rule 1 velocities and rudder angles in initial and final state should be identical to discretize continues trajectories but not to change the curvature a possible way is to divide them and make the initial and final states of each segment same because this process guarantees that the start of the next trajectory segment equal to the end of the current one ultimately the linked trajectory will maintain continuity and the curvature will not be changed for an usv the state parameters that should be controlled are its velocity and rudder angle rule 2 trajectory segments should be simple in general a unit is considered as an atomic quantity which cannot be divided so the contents of the unit should be as simple as possible if the trajectory segments were complicated such as changing the rudder and velocity frequently the finial trajectory would have too many inflection points it is neither convenient for control nor necessary in reality thus on the basis of rule 1 the rudder changing should be no more than twice and the velocity should remain the same rule 3 unit should be fit for splicing to generate a complete route splicing is often needed considering route searching is based on a grid map the shapes of tus are a set for squares as the side lengths for square are equal it can make sure that each tu will be matched perfectly in translation and rotation rotating 90 3 2 the model of tu 1 trajectories analysis before modeling tus the usv s trajectory should be analyzed first fig 2 shows the port and the starboard turning circles with maximum rudder angle 35 it can be seen that the turning radius on port and starboard are almost the same thus this paper sets an identical size of unit for port and starboard and on the basis of assumption 3 in section 2 when an usv is in a stable state the velocity does not change so in order to obey rule 1 only rudder angle control is involved 2 tu generation based on the above analysis the process of modeling tus is as follows assume that the initial state of an usv position on x axis y axis heading speed rudder angle is sstart x 0 y 0 ψ 0 v 0 δ 0 and its final state is send x t y t ψ t v t δ t thus tu can be expressed as 8 t u s s t a r t s e n d ψ t ψ 0 0 45 90 s t x t x 0 y t y 0 a v 0 v t δ 0 δ t where a is the side length of the unit it can be seen from eq 7 a tu is a trajectory segments set according to different demands of heading from the start point to the end point the reason behind choosing the heading changes of 0 45 and 90 is that it is convenient for route searching the eight puzzle problem reinefeld 2010 fig 3 shows an example of a tu for which the initial heading is 0 there are three curves for each board and the unit sizes are the same the square with dotted line the curves on starboard for instance have the same start point and end point and the line between these two points constitute a square diagonally following the rule 3 in addition the initial set rudder angles are 0 after one or two rudder shifts following the rule 2 the final rudder angle returns to 0 again the same as the beginning following the rule 1 to be more specific figs 4 and 5 are the changing curves of rudder angle and velocity respectively it can be seen that the initial and finial rudder angle and velocity of the three situations are the same 3 unit splicing splicing is another important part in tu modeling when the final heading change is 0 the process of next tu generating is just translating the current tu see fig 6 a when it is 90 what is needed is to rotate 90 based on the above step see fig 6 b however it cannot rotate 45 directly if the heading change is 45 because the rotated unit will not match with others the bold square in fig 7 a to solve the problem the tu can be made with the following changes 8a t u 45 s s t a r t s e n d ψ 0 45 ψ ψ 0 0 45 that is set the initial heading being 45 and make the heading changes are 0 or 45 thus the revised tu the bold square in fig 7 b fits others smoothly 4 tu operation table therefore based on the discussion above a complete set of tus have been accomplished in order to show how these trajectories are generated the tu operation table in port side is produced in table 1 4 motion planning model for an usv motion planning for an usv can be seen as a process that subject to the usv s dynamic constraints a 1 a 2 a n determines the position x i y i and pose heading ψ i of every waypoint from the start point to the end point in the research waters i e 9 x i y i ψ i f a 1 a 2 a n however the motion of an usv can be a complex process including a variety of different constraints and not all of them can yet be formulated thus it s hard to solve the problem through this way as for an usv s trajectory it contains all the dynamic constraints by taking advantage of the trajectory the dynamic constraints can be converted to geometry constraints chapter 3 discretizes the trajectory to a set of specific trajectory segments tu by analyzing the property of these segments the state of the next node can be determined by the current node 10 x t y t ψ t g x i 1 y i 1 ψ i 1 i 1 2 therefore this paper converts the motion planning problem into the optimal state nodes searching problem 4 1 search strategies in free space this section is focus on search strategies in free space which contains no obstacles the main idea for searching is to determine the waypoints which are as close to the end point as possible in particular there are 8 directions that an usv can choose on the grid map according to the waypoints that a tu can reach those directions can be classified into two types directions of horizontal vertical type1 see fig 8 a 1 4 and diagonal 45 degree type2 see fig 8 b 5 8 for different types there are different search strategies type 1 has three waypoints for candidate so before determining the heading the best waypoints should be selected first type2 has one option thus only heading choice is needed 1 waypoint choice according to fig 5 once the current heading is determined the possible positions of the waypoints are fixed thus the position is related to the heading for type2 there is only one choice 11 x t y t g x x 0 ψ 0 g y y 0 ψ 0 for type1 in order to select the point closest to the goal from the three candidates the distance from waypoint to end point is computed 11a x t y t x i y i limit to x i g x x 0 ψ 0 y i g y y 0 ψ 0 min x i x g 2 y i y g 2 where xg yg is the position of the end point fig 9 is an example of waypoint choice the usv s current heading is 0 and waypoints a b and c are the candidates after comparing the distance sa sb and sc waypoint c is chosen 2 heading choice followed by heading choice it is linked with the position of waypoint and the heading of current point 12 ψ t g ψ x t y t ψ 0 when the middle waypoint in type1 b d f h in fig 8 a is selected the heading does not change when the other two waypoints in type1 and the waypoint in type2 a c e g in fig 8 b are selected three headings become candidates to choose a direction trending towards the goal a variable θ which represents the angle between the line of waypoint and goal and the horizon fig 10 acute angle has been introduced so the best heading can be judged by θ 13 ψ t ψ 0 90 0 θ 30 ψ 0 45 30 θ 60 ψ 0 60 θ 90 fig 10 is an example of heading choice after waypoint c is selected there are three headings 0 45 and 90 as the goal is to be closer to the direction of y axis 60 θ 90 0 is considered the best heading however there is a special case that should be discussed both in type1 and type2 see in fig 11 c has to be chosen for waypoint but it is pointing away from the goal in this situation the proper direction should be 0 fig 11 b however if the method above is used the outcome is as in fig 11 a because θ 30 therefore before choosing directions the relative position between waypoint and the goal should be examined first if it is along the same direction θ can be used to judge otherwise the heading closest to the goal is the best one finally based upon the heading of current node and the position and heading of the next node the chosen waypoint the usv s trajectory can be determined from the set of tu the procedure of the motion planning for usv in free space is shown in fig 12 4 2 strategies for collision avoidance when obstacles are present some waypoints cannot be reached for type1 all three waypoints may be unreachable if one or two points are available we can still use the above strategies to choose a relatively better waypoint or heading but if all the candidates are unreachable the only way to avoid the obstacles is by making judgment in advance take the current position x0 y0 and heading 0 as an example fig 13 a assume that the side length of tu is 1 and point a x0 1 y0 2 b x0 y0 2 and c x0 1 y0 2 cannot be reached obviously point b 1 x0 y0 1 should not serve as a candidate otherwise all possible trajectories would be shown as the dotted curves thus the next waypoint can only be selected from a 1 and c 1 and then choose the best curves from 1 to 6 according to the position of the goal in conclusion the waypoint should be judged in advance for type1 similarly for type2 fig 13 b the current heading is 45 if point c is unavailable the heading of b 1 should not be 45 direction 0 and 90 are the candidates for heading choice namely curve 1 and 2 thus the heading should be considered ahead of time for type2 overall the strategies above consider only one factor waypoint or heading in advance nevertheless in some more complicated cases both of them should be considered for instance the obstacle in fig 14 is continuous and point b1 is not an option according to above for waypoint a1 if heading 0 or 45 is selected curve 2 and 3 the next possible trajectories would be all shown as the dotted curves leading usv to obstacle m similarly for waypoint c1 direction 0 and 45 should not be candidates the valid waypoint and heading in this case should be a1 90 or c1 90 and the corresponding trajectory is curve 1 o a 1 m 1 or curve 2 o c 1 n 1 5 experiments and results this section demonstrates some use of the developed tu and the algorithm in different situations we conducted three types of experiments the first one is contrast experiment a comparison of path planning and motion planning is to show the difference between ideal and real circumstances the second one is simulation test this time obstacles are taken into account the static obstacles experiment will show the whole process of the route searching the strategy for choosing both waypoint and direction and the dynamic obstacle experiment will illustrate the dynamic procedure the last one is field trial this trial is conducted in real environment to verify the validity and practicability of the proposed approach 5 1 contrast experiment as there are eight possible directions for each point all the cases set in one point can be shown in fig 15 and every trajectory segments of all the experiments in this section are included in the set the first experiment is shown in fig 16 the green dot is the start point a blue dot is the goal point b and the initial heading is 225 southwest the dotted line is the result of path planning we can see the route consist of two line segments ac and cb although a c b is the shortest way in theory it does not take into consideration the heading of the usv the solid line is longer than dotted but more realistic besides line segments the route has several curves ad de and ef can regard as a process of posture adjustment from point a with 225 to point d with 180 then porting to point e of heading 90 finally adjusting to point f with 45 after finished the adjustment the next is directed at the goal point b and the whole process a d e f b is exactly motion planning compared with path planning motion planning is closer to reality and it provides a possible way to control the usv 5 2 simulation test while considering obstacles static the process will be much more complicated the second experiment is shown in fig 17 in order to figure out how the algorithm chooses waypoints and directions we analyze the critical process the initial heading from start point a is 90 the next step has three points for candidate c 0 c 1 and c 2 considering c 0 is the closest to goal point b it has been chosen and with the same reason the next direction determined as 45 solid arrow because there is only one point for heading 45 d is the following waypoint there are still three directions to choose from and the route chooses 0 solid arrow the reason is that if the heading is 45 or 90 usv will be blocked by obstacle b or a respectively similarly if the next move from d is to e 1 the vessel will collide with obstacle c or d or e so e 0 is the best choice as to the choice of heading for e 0 the three directions are all feasible but in order to make usv easier to control we prefer 90 solid arrow when usv arrived at waypoint f the rest of the way is purely driven by goal point b if the obstacle is moving the situation will become much more complicated as considerably more factors need to be considered to simplify the problem the following assumptions are made 1 an obstacle s speed is constant in the experiment obstacle moves one tu per unit of time 2 at every moment an obstacle occupies an integral number of tu two tus in this one 3 the heading of the obstacle does not change based on the above assumption the whole process is shown in fig 18 when an usv is in waypoint a the obstacle burst in at position a with heading 180 after a while the vessel reached b and the obstacle in state b if the obstacle does not exist in this moment the usv will go straight to the goal along the direction of 135 the dotted line that means point e is a route node however since both d and e are occupied and c must be the next waypoint type2 what the usv can do is to change the target heading here are two options 90 or 180 considering the obstacle has course of 180 the best choice is 90 thus when the obstacle gets in position d the usv arrives at d point and after that the route was driven by goal 5 3 field trial to validate the algorithm we also conducted the field trial the experimental site was in east lake in wuhan china as can be seen in fig 19 a and the experimental area was a 600 m 600 m square the black box in fig 19 a as for the usv it can be seen in fig 19 b the length was 4 15 m the width was 1 6 m and it was equipped with some sensors like camera wind direction and wind speed sensor millimeter wave radar and rtk gps the communication mode was radio station the first trial was under free waters the planned paths are shown in fig 20 a and c it can be seen that the planned path was simple and effective and both of the whole processes had two steering the results of real path were shown in fig 20 b and d it is obviously that the two real paths were basically following the planned ones despite there being fluctuation in the process the reason of the fluctuation is that on that trial day there was wind influence about 3 4 m s the usv had to fluctuate to maintain the track but in general the fluctuation range can be accepted the second trial was under obstacle waters we put virtual obstacles on the way of the previous paths to see the changes the planned paths are shown in fig 21 a and c as is shown in the figure to avoid the obstacles the two planned paths chose detour to bypass them and when the obstacles were passed the paths were back to what they used to be the results of real path were illustrated in fig 21 b and d we can see that both of them were also basically following the planned ones besides the influence of the wind this time as the number of steering increased the results especially the path near the obstacle were a bit more unstable but after the usv passed it the rest path tended to be stable overall the results of field trail show that the approach is basically able to apply to the practice 6 conclusions in this paper we present a valid approach for motion planning of usvs the approach is based on an usv s mathematic model and trajectory unit the usv model is a hydrodynamic mmg model which demonstrate hydrodynamic characteristic of a vessel through the model any usv trajectories can be produced by controlling its parameters the trajectory unit idea generates trajectories with certain constraints in place trajectory unit is important because it bridges over the gap between the discretization of searching space and the continuity of hydrodynamic model with the above two elements a goal driven algorithm has been proposed the approach has been tested in simulation and field trial and the experimental results indicate that the planned route honors real situations and can be basically applied to practice in addition this approach is not just only applied in usv it can also be used for ground vehicles as long as the mathematical model is changed to corresponding ones and in the future work we will focus on the environment influence to the trajectory unit acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china through grant no

23594,aiming at fine motion control on a small scale area for unmanned surface vehicle usv an approach for motion planning based on trajectory unit has been proposed by making use of usv s hydrodynamic model and combining corresponding rules the method generates a trajectory unit set which contains different orbit segments through the location and direction that the set of tracks can reach the route searching in research waters can be done finally a practical motion route will be planned for an usv the experimental results show that the planning route can not only avoid obstacles but also meet the movement characteristics of an usv and the approach has realized the fine motion control for an usv in a small range of scenarios keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv motion planning motion modeling trajectory unit 1 introduction with the development and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning unmanned surface vehicles usvs have become an attractive alternative way in a wide variety of marine missions svec et al 2012 such as ocean sampling steimle and hall 2006 search and rescue shafer et al 2008 harbor patrolling simetti et al 2009 and so on to accomplish these tasks it is important for an usv to plan out a safe route under certain circumstances in this field three stages have been developed namely path planning trajectory planning and motion planning path planning as the basic stage treats research object as a particle which has no kinematic and dynamic performance so the problems discussed in this phase are often under a large scale scene the typical one is determining the shortest path kohei 2016 dijkstra algorithm dijkstra 1959 is the classical method to deal with this problem the algorithm searches every direction of node to extend outward iteratively until the end point is reached one drawback is that it costs too much time to search the path to make it more efficient hart hart et al 1968 created a heuristic function to estimate the cost from current point to the final point thus the search direction can be guided as goal oriented and the search time is reduced this approach is now known as a algorithm another problem is finding a collision free path and the representative method is artificial potential field apf khatib 1986 the algorithm simulate an attractive the goal and a repulsive the obstacles potential field in the planning space combining with the two potentials the object can reach the goal without collision in summary the study of path planning has proposed plenty of algorithms and some of them turn out to have good results however there are often differences between planned path and the real trajectory to make the results more realistic the next stage becomes necessary trajectory planning can see as an improvement for path planning instead of regarding research object as a particle trajectory planning takes into account its kinematics parameters such as dimension speed heading and curvatures what this stage tries to do is to make the planned path continuous and smooth lekkas 2014 for instance velocity obstacle approach fiorini and shiller 1998 focuses on the speed and the dimension of research object according to the dimension the dynamic obstacles were expanded firstly then by taking use of relative velocity between research object and obstacle a collision free path can be found among those expanded obstacles dubins path dougherty and woolweaver 1990 put emphasis on heading and curvatures the main idea is that for a particle with unity speed the shortest possible path which meets a maximum curvature bound between a starting pose which contains position and orientation and a finishing pose consists of three pieces and each piece is either a straight line or an arc of a circle apart from the circular curve some other special curves like fermat s spiral dahl 2013 b spline curve hong li et al 2016 clothoid curve yi wang et al 2012 and so on were proposed to replace dubins curves although these methods make planning path closer to the real trajectory trajectory planning in fact is just the adjustment for path planning under part of dynamic constraints it still neglects the interaction among the constraints motion planning is concerned with the control aspect unlike the first two phases it focuses on whether the planning route can be realized via control system thus the mathematical model of the research object will be studied intensively in this stage the research of this field started from unmanned ground vehicles ugv or wheeled mobile robots and the common approach is generally divided into two steps first by making use of traditional path planning algorithm one plans out a collision free path from the start point to the end point then based on the path a controller is designed which contains kinematics and dynamics constraint to drive the robot safely and quickly to the target liang 2010 the key point of this approach is motion control that uses control strategy to reconstruct or approximate the ideal path with different goals the motion control can be classified into point stabilization path tracking and path following hao 2014 another approach is improving traditional path planning method by taking advantage of the robot s mathematical model the most common method is combining nonholonomic constraints of mobile robot with rapidly exploring random tree rrt na et al 2011 mingbo et al 2015 jinze et al 2010 because the state transition in rrt algorithm can be improved by kinetic model and new node generation can be constrained by kinetic equations na et al 2011 apart from making use of rrt some researches combine the mathematical model with state lattice the state lattice pivtoraiko and kelly 2005 is a discretization of the configuration space into a set of states representing configurations and connections between these states where every connection represents a feasible path thus it turns motion planning problems into graph searches bischofberger 2009 for an usv the researches in first two stages usually apply the above mentioned approaches however because of the hydrodynamic force the inertia resistance and response time on waters are larger than those on ground the motion control for usv is more complex and difficult than ugv or wheeled mobile robots and the method of motion planning above can hardly be used for usvs some scholars take advantage of minimax game tree search to select the smallest collision probability trajectory from the possible trajectories pool svec et al 2012 but it is still unclear that how these possible trajectories are generated or what the special properties they are and how to control an usv the specific instruction to achieve the planned path moreover with the increasing density of water traffic the scope of sailing area is decreasing gradually in some special navigation environment small range of autonomous control and fine operation become necessary such as the task of self avoidance and self berthing in harbor areas thus to adapt water environment and achieve fine control this paper presents a method based on trajectory unit as trajectories contain all the dynamic constraints of usv the method first discretizes these trajectories through certain rules and then extracts the position and heading that those discretized trajectories can reach and finally proceeds with route searching under the position and heading constraints 2 hydrodynamic model for usvs trajectories are generated according to the dynamic model of a research object this paper takes advantage of the maneuvering mathematical group mmg method ogawa 1977 to build a hydrodynamic model for an usv the main idea of a mmg model is decomposing fluid forces and moment into several parts which affect hull propeller and rudder shown in fig 1 the external effects on hull are characterized by inertia and viscidity kijima et al 1990 therefore a mmg model consists of an inertia model a viscidity model a propeller model and a rudder model in order to simplify the problem three assumptions are made as follows assumption 1 only planar motions are considered neglecting heaving rolling and pitching for an usv assumption 2 no account of the influence of wind current and waves assumption 3 the rotation direction of the engine is only positive when the usv is steady steaming the rotation speed is considered not change aiming at assumption 3 it is necessary to explain when a ship is sailing on the waters there will be the resistance and the load of propeller will increase which result in the rotation speed n declining at the moment the speed controller will raise the main engine power to offset the increased load of propeller and maintain the rotation speed in the whole process the main engine is working in the closed loop system of the automatic rotation speed control the main engine control model is shown below jia et al 1989 1 t d i e n i e n k p k n 2 π k p k n r 2 π 1 2 π t d q p q p where t d is the time constant i e is the moment of inertia of the whole system k p is the gain of speed controller n r is command rotation speed k is the gain from main driving lever to torque output q p is absorption torque of propeller thus the model is based on three degrees of freedom yawing swaying and surging 2 x x i x h x p x r y y i y h y p y r n n i n h n p n r where i h p r denote the forces or moment of inertia viscidity propeller and rudder respectively 2 1 inertia model in the water the motion of a ship can cause disturbance of surrounding flow field forming fluid medium momentum moment or additional momentum moment calculating differential in the corresponding direction can get the fluid inertia force and moment 3 x i m x u m y v r m y α x r 2 y i m y v m x u r m y α x r n i j z z r m y α x v u r m y m x u v where m x and m y are additional mass along x axis and y axis respectively α x is the coordinate along x axis which the point of action of m y j zz is the additional moment of inertia to z axis u and v are the velocity along x axis and y axis respectively and r is the angular velocity of yawing 2 2 viscidity model the viscidity force and moment that ship effect is related to the geometric features of hull the physical properties of fluid and the motion state of the ship when the first two factors are invariant the viscidity force and moment can be determined by the motion states in particular u v and r in general a second order taylor expansion is used to represent the approximate value of the viscidity force and moment 4 x h x 0 x u δ u y h y v v y r r n h n v v n r r where x 0 is the resistance causing by direct sailing δ u is the velocity change along x axis x u y v y r n v and n r are derivatives for hydrodynamic 2 3 propeller model a propeller provides the main source of marine power apart from producing thrust it can also generate lateral forces and moment whereas comparing with the rudder effect it can be neglected so the model can be expressed as 5 x p 1 t p t y p 0 n p 0 where t p is the thrust deduction coefficient t is the thrust which is related to the propeller s diameter revolving speed water density and the ship s speed of advance 2 4 rudder model a rudder model is the most important part of the model where the main control force and moment is derived it determines a ship s maneuverability and trajectories decomposing the normal force affecting on rudder into longitudinal resistance transverse force and rudder moment 6 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where δ is the rudder angle t r is the resistance deduction coefficient a h is the correction factor x h is the distance between center of gravity and force point from which lateral forces are generated f n is the normal force on the rudder in order to get a desired trajectory it is necessary to establish a control model for the rudder 7 t e δ δ e δ where δ e is the commanding rudder angle and t e is a time constant 3 trajectory unit in general the main idea of a search algorithms is to discretize the continuous space the process first divides the search space into several subspaces then for each subspace it makes use of proper methods to choose the best next subspace and finally it ends when the goal space has been reached for instance the grid map in a algorithm and the step size in apf are the results of discretization however an usv s trajectory is continuous dynamic constraints on the usv are effective along all the points on its trajectory curve this is the discrepancy between search algorithms and actual usv models mending this discrepancy is the key in motion planning in this section we proposed a valid way named trajectory unit to bridge over the gap between search algorithms and usv models 3 1 definition and rules trajectory unit or tu is a series of trajectory segments generated from an usv s hydrodynamic model which are linked with each other by choosing the waypoint that those curves can reach the waters can be searched and the final route is produced by connecting the selected curves to ensure that the final route is continuous and easy to generate tus are restricted by the following rules rule 1 velocities and rudder angles in initial and final state should be identical to discretize continues trajectories but not to change the curvature a possible way is to divide them and make the initial and final states of each segment same because this process guarantees that the start of the next trajectory segment equal to the end of the current one ultimately the linked trajectory will maintain continuity and the curvature will not be changed for an usv the state parameters that should be controlled are its velocity and rudder angle rule 2 trajectory segments should be simple in general a unit is considered as an atomic quantity which cannot be divided so the contents of the unit should be as simple as possible if the trajectory segments were complicated such as changing the rudder and velocity frequently the finial trajectory would have too many inflection points it is neither convenient for control nor necessary in reality thus on the basis of rule 1 the rudder changing should be no more than twice and the velocity should remain the same rule 3 unit should be fit for splicing to generate a complete route splicing is often needed considering route searching is based on a grid map the shapes of tus are a set for squares as the side lengths for square are equal it can make sure that each tu will be matched perfectly in translation and rotation rotating 90 3 2 the model of tu 1 trajectories analysis before modeling tus the usv s trajectory should be analyzed first fig 2 shows the port and the starboard turning circles with maximum rudder angle 35 it can be seen that the turning radius on port and starboard are almost the same thus this paper sets an identical size of unit for port and starboard and on the basis of assumption 3 in section 2 when an usv is in a stable state the velocity does not change so in order to obey rule 1 only rudder angle control is involved 2 tu generation based on the above analysis the process of modeling tus is as follows assume that the initial state of an usv position on x axis y axis heading speed rudder angle is sstart x 0 y 0 ψ 0 v 0 δ 0 and its final state is send x t y t ψ t v t δ t thus tu can be expressed as 8 t u s s t a r t s e n d ψ t ψ 0 0 45 90 s t x t x 0 y t y 0 a v 0 v t δ 0 δ t where a is the side length of the unit it can be seen from eq 7 a tu is a trajectory segments set according to different demands of heading from the start point to the end point the reason behind choosing the heading changes of 0 45 and 90 is that it is convenient for route searching the eight puzzle problem reinefeld 2010 fig 3 shows an example of a tu for which the initial heading is 0 there are three curves for each board and the unit sizes are the same the square with dotted line the curves on starboard for instance have the same start point and end point and the line between these two points constitute a square diagonally following the rule 3 in addition the initial set rudder angles are 0 after one or two rudder shifts following the rule 2 the final rudder angle returns to 0 again the same as the beginning following the rule 1 to be more specific figs 4 and 5 are the changing curves of rudder angle and velocity respectively it can be seen that the initial and finial rudder angle and velocity of the three situations are the same 3 unit splicing splicing is another important part in tu modeling when the final heading change is 0 the process of next tu generating is just translating the current tu see fig 6 a when it is 90 what is needed is to rotate 90 based on the above step see fig 6 b however it cannot rotate 45 directly if the heading change is 45 because the rotated unit will not match with others the bold square in fig 7 a to solve the problem the tu can be made with the following changes 8a t u 45 s s t a r t s e n d ψ 0 45 ψ ψ 0 0 45 that is set the initial heading being 45 and make the heading changes are 0 or 45 thus the revised tu the bold square in fig 7 b fits others smoothly 4 tu operation table therefore based on the discussion above a complete set of tus have been accomplished in order to show how these trajectories are generated the tu operation table in port side is produced in table 1 4 motion planning model for an usv motion planning for an usv can be seen as a process that subject to the usv s dynamic constraints a 1 a 2 a n determines the position x i y i and pose heading ψ i of every waypoint from the start point to the end point in the research waters i e 9 x i y i ψ i f a 1 a 2 a n however the motion of an usv can be a complex process including a variety of different constraints and not all of them can yet be formulated thus it s hard to solve the problem through this way as for an usv s trajectory it contains all the dynamic constraints by taking advantage of the trajectory the dynamic constraints can be converted to geometry constraints chapter 3 discretizes the trajectory to a set of specific trajectory segments tu by analyzing the property of these segments the state of the next node can be determined by the current node 10 x t y t ψ t g x i 1 y i 1 ψ i 1 i 1 2 therefore this paper converts the motion planning problem into the optimal state nodes searching problem 4 1 search strategies in free space this section is focus on search strategies in free space which contains no obstacles the main idea for searching is to determine the waypoints which are as close to the end point as possible in particular there are 8 directions that an usv can choose on the grid map according to the waypoints that a tu can reach those directions can be classified into two types directions of horizontal vertical type1 see fig 8 a 1 4 and diagonal 45 degree type2 see fig 8 b 5 8 for different types there are different search strategies type 1 has three waypoints for candidate so before determining the heading the best waypoints should be selected first type2 has one option thus only heading choice is needed 1 waypoint choice according to fig 5 once the current heading is determined the possible positions of the waypoints are fixed thus the position is related to the heading for type2 there is only one choice 11 x t y t g x x 0 ψ 0 g y y 0 ψ 0 for type1 in order to select the point closest to the goal from the three candidates the distance from waypoint to end point is computed 11a x t y t x i y i limit to x i g x x 0 ψ 0 y i g y y 0 ψ 0 min x i x g 2 y i y g 2 where xg yg is the position of the end point fig 9 is an example of waypoint choice the usv s current heading is 0 and waypoints a b and c are the candidates after comparing the distance sa sb and sc waypoint c is chosen 2 heading choice followed by heading choice it is linked with the position of waypoint and the heading of current point 12 ψ t g ψ x t y t ψ 0 when the middle waypoint in type1 b d f h in fig 8 a is selected the heading does not change when the other two waypoints in type1 and the waypoint in type2 a c e g in fig 8 b are selected three headings become candidates to choose a direction trending towards the goal a variable θ which represents the angle between the line of waypoint and goal and the horizon fig 10 acute angle has been introduced so the best heading can be judged by θ 13 ψ t ψ 0 90 0 θ 30 ψ 0 45 30 θ 60 ψ 0 60 θ 90 fig 10 is an example of heading choice after waypoint c is selected there are three headings 0 45 and 90 as the goal is to be closer to the direction of y axis 60 θ 90 0 is considered the best heading however there is a special case that should be discussed both in type1 and type2 see in fig 11 c has to be chosen for waypoint but it is pointing away from the goal in this situation the proper direction should be 0 fig 11 b however if the method above is used the outcome is as in fig 11 a because θ 30 therefore before choosing directions the relative position between waypoint and the goal should be examined first if it is along the same direction θ can be used to judge otherwise the heading closest to the goal is the best one finally based upon the heading of current node and the position and heading of the next node the chosen waypoint the usv s trajectory can be determined from the set of tu the procedure of the motion planning for usv in free space is shown in fig 12 4 2 strategies for collision avoidance when obstacles are present some waypoints cannot be reached for type1 all three waypoints may be unreachable if one or two points are available we can still use the above strategies to choose a relatively better waypoint or heading but if all the candidates are unreachable the only way to avoid the obstacles is by making judgment in advance take the current position x0 y0 and heading 0 as an example fig 13 a assume that the side length of tu is 1 and point a x0 1 y0 2 b x0 y0 2 and c x0 1 y0 2 cannot be reached obviously point b 1 x0 y0 1 should not serve as a candidate otherwise all possible trajectories would be shown as the dotted curves thus the next waypoint can only be selected from a 1 and c 1 and then choose the best curves from 1 to 6 according to the position of the goal in conclusion the waypoint should be judged in advance for type1 similarly for type2 fig 13 b the current heading is 45 if point c is unavailable the heading of b 1 should not be 45 direction 0 and 90 are the candidates for heading choice namely curve 1 and 2 thus the heading should be considered ahead of time for type2 overall the strategies above consider only one factor waypoint or heading in advance nevertheless in some more complicated cases both of them should be considered for instance the obstacle in fig 14 is continuous and point b1 is not an option according to above for waypoint a1 if heading 0 or 45 is selected curve 2 and 3 the next possible trajectories would be all shown as the dotted curves leading usv to obstacle m similarly for waypoint c1 direction 0 and 45 should not be candidates the valid waypoint and heading in this case should be a1 90 or c1 90 and the corresponding trajectory is curve 1 o a 1 m 1 or curve 2 o c 1 n 1 5 experiments and results this section demonstrates some use of the developed tu and the algorithm in different situations we conducted three types of experiments the first one is contrast experiment a comparison of path planning and motion planning is to show the difference between ideal and real circumstances the second one is simulation test this time obstacles are taken into account the static obstacles experiment will show the whole process of the route searching the strategy for choosing both waypoint and direction and the dynamic obstacle experiment will illustrate the dynamic procedure the last one is field trial this trial is conducted in real environment to verify the validity and practicability of the proposed approach 5 1 contrast experiment as there are eight possible directions for each point all the cases set in one point can be shown in fig 15 and every trajectory segments of all the experiments in this section are included in the set the first experiment is shown in fig 16 the green dot is the start point a blue dot is the goal point b and the initial heading is 225 southwest the dotted line is the result of path planning we can see the route consist of two line segments ac and cb although a c b is the shortest way in theory it does not take into consideration the heading of the usv the solid line is longer than dotted but more realistic besides line segments the route has several curves ad de and ef can regard as a process of posture adjustment from point a with 225 to point d with 180 then porting to point e of heading 90 finally adjusting to point f with 45 after finished the adjustment the next is directed at the goal point b and the whole process a d e f b is exactly motion planning compared with path planning motion planning is closer to reality and it provides a possible way to control the usv 5 2 simulation test while considering obstacles static the process will be much more complicated the second experiment is shown in fig 17 in order to figure out how the algorithm chooses waypoints and directions we analyze the critical process the initial heading from start point a is 90 the next step has three points for candidate c 0 c 1 and c 2 considering c 0 is the closest to goal point b it has been chosen and with the same reason the next direction determined as 45 solid arrow because there is only one point for heading 45 d is the following waypoint there are still three directions to choose from and the route chooses 0 solid arrow the reason is that if the heading is 45 or 90 usv will be blocked by obstacle b or a respectively similarly if the next move from d is to e 1 the vessel will collide with obstacle c or d or e so e 0 is the best choice as to the choice of heading for e 0 the three directions are all feasible but in order to make usv easier to control we prefer 90 solid arrow when usv arrived at waypoint f the rest of the way is purely driven by goal point b if the obstacle is moving the situation will become much more complicated as considerably more factors need to be considered to simplify the problem the following assumptions are made 1 an obstacle s speed is constant in the experiment obstacle moves one tu per unit of time 2 at every moment an obstacle occupies an integral number of tu two tus in this one 3 the heading of the obstacle does not change based on the above assumption the whole process is shown in fig 18 when an usv is in waypoint a the obstacle burst in at position a with heading 180 after a while the vessel reached b and the obstacle in state b if the obstacle does not exist in this moment the usv will go straight to the goal along the direction of 135 the dotted line that means point e is a route node however since both d and e are occupied and c must be the next waypoint type2 what the usv can do is to change the target heading here are two options 90 or 180 considering the obstacle has course of 180 the best choice is 90 thus when the obstacle gets in position d the usv arrives at d point and after that the route was driven by goal 5 3 field trial to validate the algorithm we also conducted the field trial the experimental site was in east lake in wuhan china as can be seen in fig 19 a and the experimental area was a 600 m 600 m square the black box in fig 19 a as for the usv it can be seen in fig 19 b the length was 4 15 m the width was 1 6 m and it was equipped with some sensors like camera wind direction and wind speed sensor millimeter wave radar and rtk gps the communication mode was radio station the first trial was under free waters the planned paths are shown in fig 20 a and c it can be seen that the planned path was simple and effective and both of the whole processes had two steering the results of real path were shown in fig 20 b and d it is obviously that the two real paths were basically following the planned ones despite there being fluctuation in the process the reason of the fluctuation is that on that trial day there was wind influence about 3 4 m s the usv had to fluctuate to maintain the track but in general the fluctuation range can be accepted the second trial was under obstacle waters we put virtual obstacles on the way of the previous paths to see the changes the planned paths are shown in fig 21 a and c as is shown in the figure to avoid the obstacles the two planned paths chose detour to bypass them and when the obstacles were passed the paths were back to what they used to be the results of real path were illustrated in fig 21 b and d we can see that both of them were also basically following the planned ones besides the influence of the wind this time as the number of steering increased the results especially the path near the obstacle were a bit more unstable but after the usv passed it the rest path tended to be stable overall the results of field trail show that the approach is basically able to apply to the practice 6 conclusions in this paper we present a valid approach for motion planning of usvs the approach is based on an usv s mathematic model and trajectory unit the usv model is a hydrodynamic mmg model which demonstrate hydrodynamic characteristic of a vessel through the model any usv trajectories can be produced by controlling its parameters the trajectory unit idea generates trajectories with certain constraints in place trajectory unit is important because it bridges over the gap between the discretization of searching space and the continuity of hydrodynamic model with the above two elements a goal driven algorithm has been proposed the approach has been tested in simulation and field trial and the experimental results indicate that the planned route honors real situations and can be basically applied to practice in addition this approach is not just only applied in usv it can also be used for ground vehicles as long as the mathematical model is changed to corresponding ones and in the future work we will focus on the environment influence to the trajectory unit acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china through grant no
