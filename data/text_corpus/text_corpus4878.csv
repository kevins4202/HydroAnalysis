24390,while reliable estimates of species abundance distribution are required for wildlife management and are greatly needed at broad spatial scales such information is scarce in this context the usefulness of spatial modelling as a tool for predicting game species relative abundance and distribution from hunting yield data was studied hunting yield data is affected by several factors related to species management hunting regulations and hunting efficacy and some doubts have been raised about the use or reliability of this data for large scale modelling some years ago acevedo et al 2014 calibrated five spatially explicit models one per bioregion by using hunting yield data for wild boar sus scrofa from hunting seasons 2006 to 2009 for approximately 60 of mainland spain after internal validation the models were extrapolated to produce predictions of species relative abundance for the whole mainland country here we reviewed these previous models to evaluate their predictive performance on new data from hunting seasons 2014 to 2018 in areas where the models had been calibrated interpolation areas and also when projected into new ones extrapolation areas our results showed that the previous models were able to forecast current general patterns of wild boar relative abundance with population growth rates equivalent to those reported by other authors although differences between bioregions were observed performance on interpolation areas was higher than that obtained on extrapolation areas accuracy of model predictions decreased when fine resolution assessment at hunting ground level was carried out our results suggest that spatial models calibrated on hunting yields could be a good option to predict general wild boar relative abundance distribution patterns although critical assessment is needed since models can fail when they are extrapolated to areas for which no information is available and at fine scale resolution these results represent a step forward in the use of hunting yields for describing ranges of species relative abundance at large spatial scales keywords abundance index hunting statistics model transferability sus scrofa 1 introduction the wild boar sus scrofa linnaeus 1758 is a species involved in numerous conflicts affecting human safety species conservation and animal health among others melletti and meijaard 2017 reliable estimates of the abundance distribution of this species are essential for sound decision making the spread of african swine fever asf as an example has highlighted the need for information on the spatial distribution and abundance of this species for risk assessment vicente et al 2019 since 2007 more than 10 european union countries have been affected with germany greece and serbia being the latest to report the disease in 2020 mapa 2021 oie 2020 the availability of reliable spatial information about wild boar abundance is greatly needed today to manage and control their populations and disease spread e g o neill et al 2020 spatial modelling has become almost the only option employed to produce estimates of game species abundance and distribution at large spatial scales with respect to wild boar several models based on both distribution i e occurrences and abundance data i e number of animals per area unit have been developed at regional and continental scales in recent years for a review see enetwild consortium et al 2018 many approaches have already been applied to this species in an effort to exploit the wide range of data sources depending on the data source models can be classified into two main categories those which use occurrence data to predict environmental suitability sometimes interpreted as a proxy for the relative abundance of the species and those that directly model abundance data mainly hunting yields namely the records of the number of animals hunted annually in a given territory a few remarks should be made about these two categories in the case of europe models based on occurrence data have not produced reliable patterns mainly due to the lack of presence records in eastern countries and the lack of reliable absences at continental scale for this ubiquitous species e g alexander et al 2016 enetwild consortium et al 2019 on the other hand hunting yield data has been widely explored for modelling wild boar abundance since it usually performs well as a relative abundance index e g imperio et al 2010 and is available for large spatial scales e g enetwild consortium et al 2020 however there are territories that do not record hunting yields or when recorded the spatial resolution of the data is variable from regional scale to hunting ground levels and hunting pressure may not be comparable between territories e g bosch et al 2012 but see vajas et al 2020 their usefulness for large scale spatial modelling has therefore been questioned but see pittiglio et al 2018 it should be noted at this point that using spatial models to predict wild boar abundance patterns for large territories is not an easy task nor one that has been resolved see alexander et al 2016 studies assessing the predictive capability of hunting yield based models on new territories and time periods are scarce but necessary to assess model performance and improve accuracy in results interpretation our working hypothesis is that given that hunting yields are an approximate abundance index different sources of variability in the data may limit the spatial transferability of hunting yield based models bioregion related factors for example to assess this hypothesis we revisited the models reported by acevedo et al 2014 which were parameterized on data from hunting seasons 2006 to 2009 for approximately 60 of mainland spain and then transferred to the whole mainland country hereafter previous models after testing different modelling approaches they calibrated five independent models in mainland spain one per bioregion to allow for flexibility in predictor effects and contribution see material and methods section and acevedo et al 2014 using new hunting yield data hunting seasons 2014 to 2018 the aim of the present study was to assess the predictive capability of the previous models from acevedo et al 2014 looking for differences in performance between territories where the models were parameterized interpolation area and projected into extrapolation area specifically we tested if model predictions produced by acevedo et al were able i to produce accurate geographic abundance patterns ii to match observed data when a few abundance categories are delimited and iii to produce fine scale relative abundance estimates at hunting ground level these analyses used as a case study would make it possible to assess the generalisability of spatial models parameterised on hunting yields and their transferability to non sampled territories 2 material and methods five bioregions defined in the spanish wildlife disease surveillance scheme internal report to the spanish ministry of agriculture 2008 were used for wild boar relative abundance modelling based on their environmental characteristics and wildlife management practices acevedo et al 2014 considered three approaches to account for potential variation in hunting effort between bioregions i a model fitted with data from all bioregions ii a model fitted using bioregion as a controlling factor in the model iii independent models fitted for each bioregion the authors obtained the best performance from approach iii five independent models one per bioregion see appendix 1 and fig 1 a briefly the previous models were parameterized by using the mean number of wild boar annually hunted per 100 km2 from hunting seasons 2006 2007 to 2009 2010 as response variable and a set of 21 predictor variables related to geography clime and land cover appendix 1 acevedo et al 2014 negative binomial distribution was used for model calibration and a forwards backwards stepwise procedure based on akaike information criteria was used for predictor variables selection hunting yield data covered approximately 60 of mainland spain fig 1a and model predictions were internally validated on a 20 data subset not used in calibration and then extrapolated to predict wild boar relative abundance also in non sampled territories modelling approach selection was conducted by correlations between predicted and observed relative abundance in validation data subset in the present study those previous models were used to predict wild boar relative abundance hunted animals per 100 km2 at hunting ground level in mainland spain n 13 807 fig 1b thus predictions were obtained from the previous models for territories considered for model parameterization hereafter the interpolation area and for those not considered in modelling without data to which the models were extrapolated hereafter the extrapolation area we collected recent hunting yield data at hunting ground level for all areas in mainland spain fig 1c specifically we obtained data for hunting seasons 2014 2015 to 2017 2018 provided by the hunting and fishing services of each autonomous region in spain averaged annual hunting yields hunted animals per 100 km2 hereafter observed relative abundance were used to assess the predictive performance of the previous models model predictions at hunting ground level were performed by solving the model equation see appendix 1 at each hunting ground by using the predict function from the stats r package following rykiel 1996 we used three approaches to evaluate different features of the predictive performance of models i e if model predictions match observed hunting yields first observed and predicted relative abundances were cartographically mapped in order to visually assess if the geographic pattern of observed relative abundance matched model predictions second we compared observed and predicted relative abundances by using calibration plots in which observed and predicted values were plotted with bins of fixed size using the ggplot2 r package wickham 2009 this allow us to determine if model predictions match observed data when a few relative abundance categories are stablished and therefore if they produce accurate general abundance patterns finally pearson correlations were also used to compare observed and predicted relative abundances at fine resolution level hunting ground level calibration plots and pearson correlations were carried out both globally for mainland spain and for each bioregion separately in addition the interpolation and extrapolation areas used for assessments were disaggregated and the results were compared for the whole study area and excluding the region of galicia from bioregon 1 which had been detected as problematic in the previous models see below to avoid misleading p values in correlations due the high size sample for the most regions we conducted a subsample procedure to reduce the number of observation in correlations for each comparison we randomly subsampled 50 observations and conducted pearson correlations we repeated this procedure 10 000 times storing pearson r values and producing histograms to discuss models predictive power and to account for uncertainty in correlations then statistical mode for pearson r was computed for each comparison 3 results in average predicted values were 1 35 times lower than the observed relative abundances geographical patterns of model predictions are shown in fig 1b and the mean of observed hunting yields for hunting seasons 2014 2015 to 2017 2018 are shown in fig 1c although observed hunting yields were higher than predicted ones in general similar geographic abundance patterns were found for mainland spain but see northwest area i e galicia calibration plots for mainland spain and each bioregion are provided in fig 2 model performance strongly depended on bioregion and interpolation extrapolation areas in general r values from the subsample procedure for pearson correlations were normally distributed fig 3 most frequent r values for the subsample procedure ranged from 0 375 extrapolated area of bioregion 1 fig 3 to 0 375 whole area of bioregions 2 and 4 and interpolation area of bioregion 2 fig 3 standard deviations for all subsamples ranged 0 14 0 15 table 1 shows the differences in the strength of the relationship between predicted and observed relative abundances at hunting yield level amongst the bioregions and between interpolation and extrapolation areas in comparison to r values reported by acevedo et al 2014 we found that in general model performance was higher when the assessment was carried out in the interpolation areas nevertheless we found differences between bioregions detecting positive correlations only for bioregions 2 and 4 fig 3 the exclusion of galicia region from the evaluation analysis yielded improved assessments of predictive performance for mainland spain and bioregion 1 fig 2 4 discussion in the short and medium terms modelling wild boar abundance data is the only feasible option to produce large scale distribution data of species abundance which is greatly needed today for population and health management in europe vicente et al 2019 in this study we showed that models based on hunting yield data were able to produce general patterns of wild boar relative abundance over new time periods and also when used to predict for new territories nevertheless we obtained differences in performance between bioregions and a critical assessment should be carried out before interpreting the predicted patterns we also showed that while models performed well at large scale their predictive power decreased at fine scale resolution hunting ground level predictions from previous models underestimated current hunting yields fig 1 which could be explained by the growth in wild boar populations in europe generally and spain in particular massei et al 2015 the observed hunting yields were 1 35 times higher on average than those predicted by models parameterized with data from a decade ago the growth rate obtained in our study is equivalent to 1 5 times the increase per decade that can be derived from the data reported by massei et al 2015 for spain and 1 7 times the increase reported by quirós fernández et al 2017 for northern spain this provides evidence that the current management of the species has not been able to slow down the expansion of wild boar in recent decades in spain and that more effective management strategies based on more accurate data are needed to avoid the consequences caused by excess population at different ecosystem scales carpio et al 2021 in general terms the previous models were able to predict the spatial pattern of wild boar relative abundance at a national scale fig 1b c when the assessment was carried out across the set of bioregions this trend was much clearer in three of the five bioregions bioregions 2 4 and 5 obtaining supports for seven wild boar relative abundance classes as in acevedo et al 2014 pearson correlations at hunting ground level were also stronger for those bioregions 2 4 and 5 fig 3 for bioregion 3 the correlation between observed and predicted hunting yields was fairly lower fig 3 and predicted relative abundance was much lower than observed relative abundance fig 2 this result may have been influenced by hunting management since hunting estates with perimeter fencing and supplementary feeding predominate in this region and these actions are aimed at maintaining populations even above the carrying capacity of the environment e g acevedo et al 2007 environmental models alone are probably not generalizable enough since abundance depends more on management interests that can change over the time than on the environmental potential for the species see also acevedo et al 2014 in the case of bioregion 1 the correlation between predicted and observed relative abundance at hunting ground was negative fig 3 looking for patterns of difference between observed and predicted relative abundance a high discrepancy was observed in galicia which is a region that was not considered for calibrating the previous model i e within the extrapolation area even when the performance of previous models on extrapolation areas was not significantly worse than on interpolation areas the result for galicia suggests that the previous model of bioregion 1 was not able to capture the general response of species in this bioregion and strongly recommends the need to critically assess predictions mainly when they have potential to be used for management e g bosch et al 2017 vicente et al 2019 this is a region where eucalyptus spp is abundant and these plantations can lead to errors in predictions of patterns of wild boar abundance see enetwild consortium et al 2020 since eucalyptus plantations are often mapped to resemble forests although they are not suitable since they are not a favourable habitat for wild boar we found that when galicia was excluded from the analysis the performance of the previous model increased and achieved values comparable to those obtained in the other bioregions fig 2 in line with our results when the models were projected over interpolation areas they predicted the relative abundance of wild boar with some accuracy this result was expected as the models showed good predictive power when compared to the evaluation dataset by acevedo et al 2014 the previous study found that models were able to predict different classes of wild boar relative abundance and a numerical trend in this one we did not find the same relative abundance classes at hunting estate level but we were able to account for the general spatial patterns on the other hand when the predictions of the previous models were compared with observed relative abundance in extrapolation areas there were differences between bioregions but returned generally lower performance than in interpolated areas figs 2 3 in this case we detected a higher positive correlation between predicted and observed relative abundance in bioregions 2 and 4 these correlation coefficients could be attributed to the representability of the areas sampled in each bioregion when the previous models were parameterized possible causes of the lower correlations in extrapolation areas from bioregions 1and 3 have been already mentioned above in bioregion 5 the extrapolation area includes the community of valencia which is a region where there has recently been significant wild boar population growth and expansion as the hunting yields showed lizana et al 2021 this extrapolation area may not therefore be well characterised according to the sampling carried out by acevedo et al 2014 wild boar hunting yields are a potential data source for parameterisation of models explaining and predicting relative abundance patterns at large spatial scales modelling hunting yields is not an easy task and requires further development to integrate data at different spatial resolutions with different levels of reliability which is the case today at european scale e g enetwild consortium et al 2020 pittiglio et al 2018 our results represent a step forward in the use of this kind of data since they support that the models are generalizable and can be used for predicting general abundance patterns over new time periodsand large scales however caution should be taken when fine resolution abundance estimates are obtained from this models due to differences in hunting efforts underreported hunting yields etc further assessment of the predictions is required before they can be applied to policy making especially in the case of wildlife diseases such as asf in which knowledge of the pattern of wild boar abundance is essential to

often obtain densities that cause significant economic harm to grazing operations and agricultural production although numerous studies conducted at the level of individual field sites have examined potential mechanisms contributing to grasshopper population boom and bust cycles there has yet to be a large regional scaled analysis that quantified grasshopper variation across the western us as a whole while taking steps to account for data collection biases mediating effects and variable confounding we assessed the influence of pacific ocean sea surface temperature oscillations on a 40 year record of grasshopper density in the western us central to our analysis was employing spatially varying coefficients to model time and location specific variation in grasshopper response to climate our results quantitatively demonstrated interannual changes in grasshopper density to be indirectly effected by seasonal el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo variability and to exhibit spatial asynchrony and non stationarity such that the relative influence of climate on grasshopper density varied through time and across geographic space our model is the first to incorporate climate indices as spatially varying coefficients for assessment of a terrestrial species and represents a critical step towards understanding causal drivers of regional

ars usda gov grasshopper 1 introduction grasshoppers are the foremost insect grassland herbivores on earth branson and sword 2010 and the most significant rangeland pests in the united states dakhel et al 2020 although grasshoppers are essential components of grassland ecosystems belovsky and slade 2018 their populations frequently reach densities that cause significant economic harm to the grazing industry branson et al 2006 kistner thomas et al 2021 economic harm is especially impactful when outbreaks coincide with drought periods when cattle forage is already scarce due to water limitation and extreme temperature branson et al 2006 grasshoppers annually destroy approximately one fifth of available rangeland forage in the united states us but routinely eliminate up to 100 of forage locally during severe outbreaks resulting in damage to us rangelands measured in the billions of dollars hewitt and onsager 1983 branson et al 2006 localized infestations occur every year in the western us however large scale grasshopper outbreaks have historically occurred about every 8 to 12 years belovsky and slade 2000 branson 2017 leading some to infer that cyclic or recurrent climate patterns like those associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso or the pacific decadal oscillation pdo play a role in shaping grasshopper population dynamics jonas et al 2015 enso is a semi periodic 3 7 years climate mode of variability that describes alternating warm and cool phases in the tropical pacific ocean through teleconnection processes enso warm el niño and cool la niña phases couple with atmospheric variability to disrupt prevailing temperature and precipitation patterns globally noaa 2021a the pdo functions comparably to enso but refers to alternating warm and cool phases that originate in pacific ocean regions north of the tropics and exhibit a longer periodicity of around 10 years viles and goudie 2003 gedalof et al 2002 the enso and pdo broadly affect jet

and grasshopper physiology jonas et al 2015 welti et al 2020 despite several well developed measures of natural climate variability being available few researchers have chosen to harness these indices during analysis of species distributional ecology thorson 2019 zuckerberg et al 2020 because of the intuitive nexus between an ocean s physical condition and the marine organisms that it holds published research describing use of climate indices from a spatial context has been predominately limited to marine environments see farchadi et al 2019 cimino et al 2020 díaz delgado et al 2021 by comparison links from oceans to terrestrial species have been less well studied due to being complicated by the teleconnections that transcribe an ocean s state to the local climate and weather conditions experienced over land and at distance rather than operating through direct effects enso and other climate oceanographic processes influence terrestrial species indirectly through mediating relationships with temperature and precipitation resultantly teleconnections do not affect all locations uniformly instead they variably effect temperature and precipitation by geographic location gershunov and barnett 1998 mccabe et al 2004 sheppard et al 2002 mann et al 2018 haszpra et al 2020 given this it is probable that species response to these mediated processes will also differ by location rather than be stationary or constant across the entire species range that is species will likely exhibit spatial non stationarity and asynchrony spatial non stationarity refers to the changes in species environment relationships that occur as species encounter heterogeneous abiotic conditions and mutable biotic interactions across their geographic range or through time osborne et al 2007 mauricio bini et al 2009 when spatially disjunct populations show correlated abundance changes increasing and decreasing along comparable time frames despite being geographically separated they demonstrate synchrony when abundance changes are temporally mismatched populations are said to display asynchrony mackin rogalska and nabagło 1990 hanski and woiwod 1993 liebhold et al 1996 bjørnstad et al 1999 liebhold et al 2004 if species environment relationships are assumed constant stationary or left unaddressed by statistical modeling spatial non stationarity can confound results interpretation particularly when assessing large study areas zuckerberg et al 2020 rollinson et al 2021 several statistical techniques have been developed to account for spatial non stationarity by providing location specific coefficient estimates rather than an average or global estimate of species environment relationships for a study area in its entirety gelfand et al 2004 finley 2011 often labeled as spatially varying coefficients svc these techniques have been successfully applied to improve estimates for avian community turnover jarzyna et al 2014 snow adapted species distributions sultaire et al 2021 and spatiotemporal variation in zoonotic disease hosts humphreys et al 2021b recently thorson 2019 proposed svc methods for quantifying the influence of climate oceanographic processes on marine species distributions in the eastern bering sea however the current study is the first to employ a comparable approach to appraise climate oceanographic variability on a terrestrial species our central objective was to assess the causal relationship of climate variability on long term grasshopper dynamics in the western united states distinguishing between the explanatory and predictive tasks during scientific research is essential to model based analysis and has major implications for methods selection and results interpretation macnally 2000 shmueli 2010 pescott and jitlal 2020 whereas the aim of statistical prediction is to identify the set of explanatory variables that maximally explain variation in a dependent variable the goal of causal inference is to obtain a minimally biased estimate of a variable s effect size on a dependent variable while in the presence of mediating variables potential confounds and unobserved error wright 1921 rubin 1974 pearl et al 2000 pearl 2010 often misunderstood as procedures reserved solely for experimental research conducted under randomization and controls causal inference is appropriate for observational data and is increasingly applied to ecological studies that incorporate biological field survey and remote sensing data larsen et al 2019 rosenbaum et al 2020 laubach et al 2021 meisner et al 2022 we applied causal analysis to assess the role of the enso and pdo in shaping grasshopper dynamics while in the presence of mediating climate effects confounding environmental variables and unobserved error arising from incomplete field survey spatiotemporal correlation and other unmeasured processes key to our approach was use of svcs to assess time and location specific variation in grasshopper response to climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study domain our study area encompassed the conterminous united states us west of approximately 95 5 west longitude this area exhibited an estimated areal extent of 4 74 million km 2 and included the states of arizona california colorado idaho kansas montana nebraska nevada new mexico north dakota oklahoma oregon south dakota texas utah washington and wyoming major ecoregions occurring in this area include temperate grasslands and savannas deserts and xeric shrublands and temperate coniferous forest olson and dinerstein 2002 for statistical analysis the study domain was divided into a regularized hexagonal grid comprised of 2 345 individual cells each with a 2 125 km 2 areal extent under albers equal area conic geographic projection cell number and size were determined through sensitivity analysis aimed at balancing spatial precision minimum cell resolution with optimal spatial autocorrelation reduction cell center distances between 25 and 200 km intervals were iteratively evaluated in 5 km increments with 65 km distance found to be optimal at a 65 km distance 2 345 individual cells were produced for the study area additional information detailing hexagonal grid sensitivity analysis is provided in the supplemental data fig s1 the study area and hexagonal grid are illustrated in fig 1 2 2 grasshopper data grasshopper density data were acquired from the us department of agriculture animal and plant health inspection service plant protection and quarantine ppq program at fort collins colorado the ppq program collated the data from recent and historic grasshopper orthoptera acrididae surveys conducted across the western us total grasshopper density all species combined survey date and the geographic coordinates for survey locations were documented in the data set for the current study we evaluated the 40 year period between 1982 and 2021 and converted density units from reported measures of grasshoppers yard 2 to grasshoppers m 2 1 gh yard 2 0 84 gh m 2 although grasshopper survey data were available for several years prior to 1982 these observations were limited to the states of montana and wyoming and predated remotely sensed vegetation and climate data incorporated for analysis more than 92 of grasshopper records had been documented during surveys in the months of june 23 2 july 47 8 and august 20 8 therefore we considered the data set as generally representative of grasshopper density during the late summer season given the potential for point level coordinate inaccuracy and a need to reduce the computational resources required by statistical models see section 2 4 we calculated mean grasshopper density in annual time steps for each of the grid cells described in section 2 1 e g 40 separate grids representing grasshopper density for each year 1982 2021 fig 1 b provides an example of the spatial aggregation process by showing mean grasshopper density 1982 2021 and the total number of survey years available for each location as with many ecological data sets davies and gray 2015 our grasshopper density database was presumed to have been subject to collection bias humphreys et al 2022a and to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal correlation welti et al 2021 therefore a major objective was to control for these statistically problematic influences during analysis see section 2 4 2 3 causal model scientific research requires the specification of two distinct models constructed under different analytical frameworks a causal model and a statistical model although statistical models are tools capable of quantifying correlations and associations among variables they are wholly insufficient in themselves to infer causal relationships mcelreath 2020 to infer cause a model that encapsulates information external to the data must be developed this model summarizes researcher understanding of the study system encodes principal hypotheses and outlines analytical assumptions once formulated the causal model guides construction of the statistical model and serves as the crux of subsequent statistical model evaluation and results interpretation the directed acyclic graph dag illustrated in fig 2 diagrams the cause effect relationships we hypothesize between grasshoppers climate variability and other observed and unobserved system elements dag nodes circles show observed and unobserved variables in the climate grasshopper system while arrows indicate the hypothesized causal relationships among them fig 2 our hypothesis is that the enso and pdo exposures of interest directly effect temperature t and precipitation p which in turn directly effect vegetation v drought d soil condition s and grasshopper density gh t r u e which is our outcome variable of interest note that the assertion enso effects temperature is symbolized by an arrow from enso the cause to t the effect clarifying the predominate direction of the cause effect relationship although cyclic relationships interactions and feed backs are assumed to exist between variables and are considered in statistical models they are implicit and not symbolized in the dag to clarify the chief cause effect relationships in our hypothesis during a single time step yuan and shou 2020 importantly grasshoppers are represented twice in our graphical heuristic fig 2 the symbol gh t r u e signifies true grasshopper density as occurs in nature whereas gh o b s stands for grasshopper observations as collected by humans during field survey although gh t r u e is not observed it is what we seek to explain the natural state by comparison gh o b s has been observed and documented but is only a function of gh t r u e and is also effected by unobserved error u unobserved error in gh o b s is due to incomplete sampling preferential sampling and other aspects of data collection that result in biased estimates and measurement error incomplete sampling refers to the issue of grasshopper observations being collected across a limited number of locations and times and therefore potentially not representative of the western us as a whole during the entirety of the grasshopper season the problem of preferential sampling occurs due to non random selection of survey locations diggle et al 2010 pennino et al 2019 in the case of grasshoppers there has been reported preference for survey locations known for historically high grasshopper numbers or having been reported as subject to grasshopper outbreaks humphreys et al 2022a the fundamental distinction between gh t r u e and gh o b s prevents direct adoption of gh o b s as a model response or dependent variable without first adjusting for conditioning on or controlling for unobserved error to make gh o b s a more reliable proxy for gh t r u e as later described for the statistical model this adjustment was accomplished through use of a measurement error model in addition to gh t r u e and observational unobserved error grasshopper intraspecific intra and interspeciifc inter competition are shown as unobserved factors in the dag as is grasshopper predation pred we hypothesized that these biotic variables strongly influence grasshopper density and included them for completeness despite not having reliable proxies for statistical modeling all aspects of soil condition s were likewise not completely observed however data reflecting soil ph ph and soil organic carbon oc were available and included in the statistical analysis nodes signifying the areal proportion of cultivated managed land cover cult and elevation e are displayed due to potential direct effects to grasshopper density the dag encodes the analytical assumptions surrounding our evaluation of grasshopper climate relationships and reveals three statistical models for comparison a total effects model te a minimal adjustment model ma and a full adjustment model fa the te includes the exposures enso and pdo and the outcome without any additional adjustment te exposure effect sizes indicate the total influence of the oni and pdo on grasshopper density through all direct and indirect pathways the ma model includes the exposures and outcome as well as the minimally sufficient adjustment set required to detect direct effects if they exist the minimal sufficient adjustment set includes temperature precipitation and elevation by conditioning on temperature and precipitation pathways from the exposures through these variables and to grasshopper density are blocked although the enso and pdo are not hypothesized to exert a causal influence on elevation elevation acts as a confounding common cause to temperature and precipitation and must be blocked to prevent information flow from the exposures to grasshoppers via the exposures temperature elevation grasshoppers or exposures precipitation elevation grasshoppers pathways having blocked all mediated pathways capable of propagating indirect effects ma exposure effect sizes reflect the magnitude of any direct effects between the exposures and grasshoppers lastly the fa model includes the exposures and outcome while adjusting for all dag variables the fa model was included for study completeness however assuming the ma model blocks indirect effect pathways and our hypothesis regarding a lack of exposure direct effects is correct the magnitudes of fa exposure effects are anticipated to be comparable to those from ma for emphasis although the additional covariates included with the fa model would be expected to explain greater grasshopper variation than do the te or ma models the goal of causal analysis is to identify changes in exposure effect size not to optimize model fit or prediction young 2019 measures of model fit like the aic bic or r 2 as applied in predictive modeling hold no weight during causal analysis where statistically important variables may be purposefully excluded to avoid bias acharya et al 2016 montgomery et al 2018 young 2019 as a result causally incorrect models with added effects often predict better than those models that are causally correct but incorporate fewer effects mcelreath 2020 for the climate indices depicted in the causal model the oceanic niño index 3 4 oni was acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center noaa 2021b the oni is calculated based on running three month averages of extended reconstructed sea surface temperature anomalies ersst v5 in the pacific ocean niño 3 4 region 5 n 5 s 120 170 w anomalies departures from long term means are based on 30 year time periods that are updated every 5 years huang et al 2017 as a compliment to the oni the monthly pacific decadal oscillation pdo index was also obtained noaa 2021c the pdo reflects sst variability over the north pacific mantua et al 1997 newman et al 2016 to quantify teleconnection between climate processes and terrestrial climate over the western us temperature and precipitation data from the prism climate group prism 2021 were utilized we secured and standardized monthly mean maximum temperature temp and total precipitation ppt grids for the us at 4 km grid resolution prism 2021 other data proxies for dag variables included a normalized difference vegetation index for vegetation v soil data from the international soil reference and information centre https www isric org characterizing ph and oc poggio et al 2021 land cover from the earthenv laboratory http www earthenv org tuanmu and jetz 2014 to estimate the proportion of cultivated area cult a standardized drought index abatzoglou et al 2014 for drought d and a digital elevation model for elevation e in the study area jarvis et al 2008 additional information for these data sets are provided in the supplemental information to include acquisition source native resolution and other details table s2 all variables excluding the climate indices were standardized for ease of interpretation more than 30 assumptions of variable conditional independence are implicit in the dag as examples enso is assumed independent of vegetation when conditioned on elevation precipitation and temperature e n s o v e p t and drought is considered independent of the pdo when conditioned on precipitation and temperature d p d o p t these assumptions and all others were evaluated using season specific sensitivity analyses textor et al 2016 ankan et al 2021 rosseel 2012 with results reported in the supplemental information fig s3 2 4 statistical model statistical analyses were implemented using bayesian hierarchical models a major challenge in translating our causal model to a statistical model was the need to account for measurement error resulting from ecological data collected by numerous different individuals over multiple decades and in the absence of a consistently applied and randomized sampling protocol reported grasshopper observations gh o b s fig 2 could not be considered as valid proxies for actual grasshopper numbers gh t r u e fig 2 without concurrently estimating the unobserved error u fig 2 stemming from the data collection process itself in the bayesian setting one solution to measurement error is to construct a joint likelihood model that effectively treats the quantities of interest as missing data richardson and gilks 1993 yang et al 2016 bhadra et al 2012 van smeden et al 2021 adopting this approach our statistical models incorporated different likelihoods for the grasshopper observation process and the true grasshopper density within a single joint model that facilitated error propagation specifically a bernoulli distribution was selected for human observation of grasshoppers y 1 and a gamma distribution for the true grasshopper density y 2 y 1 s t binomial π s t y 2 s t gamma a s t b s t where y 1 s t indicates if a survey was conducted in grid cell s s 1 2 3 2345 during year t t 1982 1983 1984 2021 and actual grasshopper density y 2 s t was assumed to be a positive value with shape and scale parameters a s t b s t such that e y 2 s t e x p o s u r e μ s t a s t b s t with exposure defined as the geographic area of cell s as a joint model with two likelihoods our response variable was specified as a bivariate matrix where the first column was coded to indicate if a survey was conducted 1 or not conducted 0 such that y 1 s t 1 if field survey at location s and time t was conducted 0 location not surveyed s t and the response variable s second column followed a gamma parameterization with the grasshopper density estimate plugged in when the location was surveyed and all other values truncated removed y 2 s t n a if location was not surveyed s t d e n s i t y if a density estimate was reported with survey s t each tier of the joint model included a dedicated linear predictor process component to account for latencies e g spatial and temporal autocorrelation unmodeled environmental factors and in the case of the second tier to estimate coefficients associated with climate covariates the linear predictors were specified such that 1 logit π s t α 1 ζ s t 1 φ s 1 λ s s t 2 log μ s t α 2 β 1 e f f o r t s t β 2 x s t k m f ξ k s t s v c k s t ζ s t 2 φ s 2 1 λ s s t where α 1 and α 2 are intercepts respectively providing estimates for mean survey probability eq 1 and mean grasshopper density eq 2 across the study area other effects common to both model levels include terms to account for tier specific spatiotemporal structure ζ s t and individual grid cell variation φ s individual cell variation was modeled as independent and identically distributed random variables with levels defined for each unique location time combination to aid in accounting for variation and interaction not captured by the spatiotemporal processes the term s s t designates a shared spatiotemporal effect that controls for correlation between the observation and density levels of the model with λ serving as a scaling coefficient that quantifies the strength magnitude of that between tier correlation blangiardo and cameletti 2015 krainski et al 2018 humphreys et al 2021a the β 1 e f f o r t s t term in eq 2 represents a sampling effort effect based on the number of year specific surveys conducted in the cell and β 2 x s t signifies environmental variables illustrated in the dag excluding the exposures outcome temperature and precipitation fig 2 the β 1 e f f o r t s t covariate was included with each model to aid in controlling for sampling bias whereas covariates in β 2 x s t differed by model as described for the te ma and fa formulations in section 2 3 spatial random effects ζ s t 1 2 and s s t followed a besag formulation besag 1975 that can be generalized as 3 ζ i ζ j i n 1 m i i j ζ j 1 m i τ where n is a normal distribution having a mean 1 m i i j ζ j and variance 1 m i τ with m i being the number of neighboring cells and τ being the precision here i j indicates that cells i and j are neighbors which we specified during model construction to include any two cells in the grid that adjoin at least one common boundary point when cells i and j are classified as neighbors they are assumed to exhibit spatial dependency with ζ i estimates conditional on those for ζ j the spdep package bivand and piras 2015 was used to construct the neighborhood graph and defined cell adjacency for our hexagonal grid which was found to have an average of 5 8 neighbors per grid cell spatiotemporal effects were assigned first order autoregressive structure and weakly informative penalizing complexity priors simpson et al 2017 riebler et al 2016 the f function presented in eq 2 signifies incorporation of climate covariates as spatially varying coefficients svc because relationships between grasshopper density and climate vary by location climate covariates oni pdo temperature and precipitation were designed to provide location and time specific coefficient estimates the s v c k s t term in eq 2 represents the k th climate variable k 1 4 at location s and time t with local coefficients that vary according to the latent gaussian spatial process ξ k s t the formulation for ξ k s t was similar to that given in eq 3 except that climate variables were added as location specific weights and the enforced zero mean constraint was removed a zero mean constraint forces the sum of the spatial field values to total zero conceptually comparable to scaling and centering the spatial field in the case of the ζ s t 1 2 and s s t effects a zero mean constraint was enforced to help reduce confounding between the spatial field and explanatory covariates however the constraint was not enforced for ξ k s t because doing so might have changed the magnitudes of svc estimates each of the three model formulations presented in section 2 3 i e te ma fa were separately analyzed with respect to four seasons for a total of 12 different models seasons were delimited as fall september october and november winter december january and february spring march april and may and summer june july and august rather than assume the calendar month of january as the end point for each year we instead based annual turnover on the grasshopper reproduction season ending in summer therefore the fall and winter seasons were assumed to influence grasshopper density during the following calendar year modeling based on seasons rather than months eased the computational demand for running models simplified results interpretation and served to better characterize the oni criteria used to identify the onset of el niño conditions surpassing the 0 5 c anomaly threshold in any three month period is indicative of el niño onset noaa 2021b joint models exhibited high dimensionality and required use of high performance computing resources provided by the usda scinet high performance computing system https scinet usda gov models were executed using integrated laplace approximation rue et al 2009 martins et al 2013 lindgren and rue 2015 combined with the pardiso solver verbosio et al 2017 kourounis et al 2018 to compare estimated oni and pdo effects from different geographic locations seasons and models with consideration of uncertainty posterior predictive contrasts were constructed by extracting predictive samples from posterior distributions we extracted 10 000 samples from 50 equal intervals across the full range of the oni and pdo indices as a final step to simplify results interpretation and presentation hierarchical clustering was conducted as a post modeling descriptive analysis to group geographic locations hexagonal grid cells exhibiting comparable climate grasshopper relationships oni and pdo svc effects from all 12 models were included in the cluster analysis 2 effects 12 models 40 yrs per model 960 variables for clustering cluster validation brock et al 2008 to evaluate between 2 20 possible clusters based on these 960 variables revealed that our study area was best described by seven groups the clustered groups are described as grasshopper climate regions gcrs in the results and discussion sections 3 results model estimated median grasshopper density across the entire study region was 2 18 gh m 2 with a 95 credible interval ci of 0 38 3 98 gh m 2 because the second tier density level of our model incorporated a log link function eq 2 coefficient estimates from the te model were re scaled exp x 1 x 100 to approximate oni and pdo effect sizes with respect to percent change δ g h from this global median for each 1 sd increase idx s d of the climate index fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3 and supplemental animated video s4 grasshopper responses to the oni and pdo varied by time and location for example contrasted responses between the northern e g wyoming and southern great plains e g texas were apparent in many years with the northern great plains subject to decreased grasshopper density as climate index values increased negative correlation and the southern great plains showing increased grasshopper density as index values increased positive correlation to avoid confusing adjusted effect sizes as causal effects presentation of estimated temperature and precipitation svcs is limited to maps depicting coefficient polarity fig 4 with videos showing annual and seasonal change available in the supplemental video s5 similarly estimated coefficients for sampling effort and adjusted environmental variables included in fa models are provided in the supplemental fig s6 a common mistake in presenting results from causal analysis is to interpret adjusted variables i e mediating and confounding effects similarly to exposures despite adjusted variables not having been subjected to deconfounding westreich and greenland 2013 to illustrate that temperature and precipitation effects would require different modeling assumptions than here presented for the oni and pdo fig s7 in the supplemental provides a dag in which temperature and precipitation effects are addressed as hypothetical exposures generally increased temperature was associated with decreased grasshopper density across the southwest e g arizona southern california western new mexico but showed positive correlation with density across the northern great plains and rocky mountains by comparison increased precipitation mostly showed a positive relationship to grasshopper density across the southwest and southern portions of the northern great plains and a negative correspondence with density across the northern rocky mountains and northwestern us fig 4 hierarchical clustering to group study area cells based on estimated oni and pdo effects identified seven grasshopper climate regions gcrs with a homogeneous synchronous grasshopper response to climate gcrs are mapped with a graphical synopsis of el niño la niña effects in fig 5 the overall pattern suggested by results is that el niño periods characterized by an extended pacific jet stream and stationary polar jet stream brought moisture and cooler temperatures to southern latitudes contributing to increased grasshopper densities in southern gcrs sgp swb by comparison a variable polar jet stream during la niña events bottom left caused increased grasshopper densities in more northern gcrs ngp pnw although grasshopper response to climate was largely synchronous within individual gcrs asynchrony between different gcrs was apparent and can be demonstrated through calculation of posterior predictive contrasts comparison of grasshopper climate relationships predicted for the northern and southern great plains ngp and sgp as delineated in fig 5 revealed that low oni values oni 0 5 experienced during the fall winter and spring seasons produced increased grasshopper densities in the ngp but reduced densities in the sgp fig 6 a conversely high oni values oni 0 5 showed the opposite pattern with increased densities in the sgp but decreased grasshoppers in the ngp although changes in density attributable to the pdo were less pronounced than those resulting from the oni in all seasons predictions for the winter pdo likewise exhibited asynchrony with positive pdo values leading to increased densities in the ngp and reduced numbers in the sgp fig 6 b a contrasting response was observed for negative pdo values during the winter increased densities in the sgp and decreased ranges in the ngp the summer season was found to exhibit the least influence on grasshopper density with the ngp and sgp showing near uniform response to the oni and pdo across all scenarios effect amplification and attenuation were observed when the oni and pdo exposures were concurrently changed for example largest grasshopper density increases in the ngp occurred when the oni and pdo both exhibited negative index values fig 6 c when low oni index values were coupled with high pdo values densities in the ngp were attenuated below levels obtained by the same oni index values while holding the pdo constant but sgp densities exhibited strong amplification under the same conditions fall and spring fig 6 d 4 discussion our results quantitatively demonstrated interannual changes in long term grasshopper density to be effected by pacific ocean sea surface temperature variability furthermore grasshoppers were found to exhibit spatial asynchrony and non stationarity in response to climate such that the relative influence of climate on grasshopper density varied both through time and across geographic space the general pattern shown by analysis revealed that the western us can be divided into seven geographic regions of approximately synchronous character with respect to how grasshoppers responded to climate fig 5 physiographically the relative positioning of these seven grasshopper climate regions gcrs suggested that latitudinal gradients exist both east and west of the rocky mountains with the rocky mountains acting as a transitional area at the east west partition we infer that the rocky mountain region a gcr delineated by our study functions as a transitional area after considering that shifts in grasshopper density are relatively muted in the region by comparison to gcrs found to the east and west and that the rocky mountains mostly parallel tracks associated with a variable polar jet stream fig 5 we also suspect that topographical variation in and around the rocky mountains largely drives weather and climate patterns within the rocky mountain region partially mitigating temperature and precipitation extremes experienced within the other gcrs corroborating several grasshopper studies conducted over smaller geographic extents capinera and thompson 1987 belovsky and joern 1995 capinera and horton 1989 the northern great plains ngp and southern great plains sgp delineated by our study were found to exhibit contrasting grasshopper responses to climate that are consistent with a climate dipole zuckerberg et al 2020 in the great plains a hypothesis drawn from this result is that el niño and la niña cycles augmented by the pdo which can modulate the intensity extent and duration of enso gershunov and barnett 1998 nguyen et al 2021 indirectly influence grasshopper abundances through mediated temperature and precipitation effects that impact plant productivity soil condition and other environmental aspects of the climate grasshopper system fig 2 because el niño events tend to increase precipitation across the sgp while concurrently reducing high temperature extremes increased grasshopper abundance in these locations may be due to improved soil moisture availability which would lead to increased plant quality productivity and delayed senescence that is el niño events bring additional precipitation to what is a prevailing arid climate resulting in supportive soil conditions for grasshopper egg development and a vegetation green up that increases food and habitat availability polis et al 1997 meserve et al 2003 vandenbosch 2003 holmgren et al 2006 srygley et al 2010 2014 by comparison el niño events in the ngp are associated with warmer and drier conditions reducing moisture availability plant quality and overall vegetative productivity thereby lessening grasshopper abundance during a la niña event the opposite pattern occurs warmer drier conditions reduce abundance in the sgp while cooler more moist conditions contribute to increased abundance in the ngp although we caution against interpreting temperature and precipitation effects sizes equivalently to modeled exposures westreich and greenland 2013 temperature and precipitation svcs generally supported our hypothesis by showing positive associations between grasshoppers and temperature in northern portions of the study area and positive precipitation effects in the southwest fig 4 although grasshopper density relationships to temperature and precipitation were less clear for locations laying between the northern and southern great plains cgp in fig 5 this may indicate that the subregion acts as a tension zone between the ngp and sgp variably taking on the character of the gcr to the north or south depending on the specific intensity of the enso or pdo event or the degree to which the enso and pdo interact to attenuate or amplify indirect effects fig 6 enso and pdo are known to affect other herbivore populations in subtropical desert and seasonally dry grasslands polis et al 1997 meserve et al 2003 vandenbosch 2003 holmgren et al 2006 cárdenas et al 2021 typically a pulse of primary productivity with increased rainfall in dry regions leads to population expansion at higher tropic levels however climate cycles can also affect predator abundance and top down control of herbivores preisser and strong 2004 for rodents population control shifts from bottom up in dry years when resources are limited to top down in wetter years meserve et al 2003 similarly breeding success of rufous crowned sparrows was limited by primary productivity during drier la niña years but population control shifted to top down in wetter el niño years morrison and bolger 2002 although we focused on temperature and precipitation changes in concert with climate cycles their effects on primary productivity and productivity cascading upwards to influence grasshopper abundances we lack information on how top down control of grasshoppers by predators and parasitoids changes with enso or pdo although we highlight this study as the first to leverage climate indices as spatially varying coefficients in assessing terrestrial species response to climate we concur with jonas et al 2015 in that both exogenous and endogenous factors are important in unraveling complex insect dynamics for example many of the dramatic shifts observed in grasshopper density may be as mechanistically tied to transient stage structured population dynamics carried over from prior years i e population inertia and momentum as they are to external climate forcing koons et al 2007 lockwood and lockwood 2008 to this end our study would have benefited from inclusion of covariates capturing population variability as functions of population growth rates density dependence effects and biotic influences in the environment e g competition and predation the single largest limitation faced when conducting our research was the unavailability of species specific density data lacking species designations for the majority of the study area determinations about endogenous population factors and food preferences were problematic as these characteristics vary widely by species jonas et al 2015 in hopes of broadening model generalizability we therefore opted to pursue assessment of climate grasshopper relationships across a massive geographic area rather than conduct a more detailed species specific analysis at a local scale due to the spatial scale of our study the second major limitation encountered during analysis was use of unbalanced field survey data our grasshopper database was amalgamated from different sources with variable geographic coverage and uneven sampling frequency the heterogeneity shown by our input data were the primary impetus for constructing a measurement error model anthropogenic climate change will likely influence the spatial and temporal stationarity of enso and pdo teleconnections and their relative importance to ecosystems globally vecchi and wittenberg 2010 haszpra et al 2020 for the western us in particular seasonal warming interacting with climate variability is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme drought flooding and wildfire events yeh et al 2018 wahl et al 2019 sun et al 2020 through a combination of immediate and delayed responses these climate changes may alter soil condition e g nitrogen deposition carbon stores moisture plant productivity and nutrient content and insect abundances throughout the western us reichstein et al 2013 welti et al 2020 substantial uncertainty remains in forecasting how climate change will affect ecosystem processes generally and grasshopper populations specifically however our work is the first to incorporate climate indices as spatially varying coefficients for assessment of terrestrial species and adds to a growing body of

24391,grasshoppers are preeminent herbivores and perhaps the most significant rangeland pests in the united states us despite the important ecosystem functions they provide grasshopper populations often obtain densities that cause significant economic harm to grazing operations and agricultural production although numerous studies conducted at the level of individual field sites have examined potential mechanisms contributing to grasshopper population boom and bust cycles there has yet to be a large regional scaled analysis that quantified grasshopper variation across the western us as a whole while taking steps to account for data collection biases mediating effects and variable confounding we assessed the influence of pacific ocean sea surface temperature oscillations on a 40 year record of grasshopper density in the western us central to our analysis was employing spatially varying coefficients to model time and location specific variation in grasshopper response to climate our results quantitatively demonstrated interannual changes in grasshopper density to be indirectly effected by seasonal el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo variability and to exhibit spatial asynchrony and non stationarity such that the relative influence of climate on grasshopper density varied through time and across geographic space our model is the

ars usda gov grasshopper 1 introduction grasshoppers are the foremost insect grassland herbivores on earth branson and sword 2010 and the most significant rangeland pests in the united states dakhel et al 2020 although grasshoppers are essential components of grassland ecosystems belovsky and slade 2018 their populations frequently reach densities that cause significant economic harm to the grazing industry branson et al 2006 kistner thomas et al 2021 economic harm is especially impactful when outbreaks coincide with drought periods when cattle forage is already scarce due to water limitation and extreme temperature branson et al 2006 grasshoppers annually destroy approximately one fifth of available rangeland forage in the united states us but routinely eliminate up to 100 of forage locally during severe outbreaks resulting in damage to us rangelands measured in the billions of dollars hewitt and onsager 1983 branson et al 2006 localized infestations occur every year in the western us however large scale grasshopper outbreaks have historically occurred about every 8 to 12 years belovsky and slade 2000 branson 2017 leading some to infer that cyclic or recurrent climate patterns like those associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso or the pacific decadal oscillation pdo play a role in shaping grasshopper population dynamics jonas et al 2015 enso is a semi periodic 3 7 years climate mode of variability that describes alternating warm and cool phases in the tropical pacific ocean through teleconnection processes enso warm el niño and cool la niña phases couple with atmospheric variability to disrupt prevailing temperature and precipitation patterns globally noaa 2021a the pdo functions comparably to enso but refers to alternating warm and cool phases that originate in pacific ocean regions north of the tropics and exhibit a longer periodicity of around 10 years viles and goudie 2003 gedalof et al 2002 the enso and pdo broadly affect jet

and grasshopper physiology jonas et al 2015 welti et al 2020 despite several well developed measures of natural climate variability being available few researchers have chosen to harness these indices during analysis of species distributional ecology thorson 2019 zuckerberg et al 2020 because of the intuitive nexus between an ocean s physical condition and the marine organisms that it holds published research describing use of climate indices from a spatial context has been predominately limited to marine environments see farchadi et al 2019 cimino et al 2020 díaz delgado et al 2021 by comparison links from oceans to terrestrial species have been less well studied due to being complicated by the teleconnections that transcribe an ocean s state to the local climate and weather conditions experienced over land and at distance rather than operating through direct effects enso and other climate oceanographic processes influence terrestrial species indirectly through mediating relationships with temperature and precipitation resultantly teleconnections do not affect all locations uniformly instead they variably effect temperature and precipitation by geographic location gershunov and barnett 1998 mccabe et al 2004 sheppard et al 2002 mann et al 2018 haszpra et al 2020 given this it is probable that species response to these mediated processes will also differ by location rather than be stationary or constant across the entire species range that is species will likely exhibit spatial non stationarity and asynchrony spatial non stationarity refers to the changes in species environment relationships that occur as species encounter heterogeneous abiotic conditions and mutable biotic interactions across their geographic range or through time osborne et al 2007 mauricio bini et al 2009 when spatially disjunct populations show correlated abundance changes increasing and decreasing along comparable time frames despite being geographically separated they demonstrate synchrony when abundance changes are temporally mismatched populations are said to display asynchrony mackin rogalska and nabagło 1990 hanski and woiwod 1993 liebhold et al 1996 bjørnstad et al 1999 liebhold et al 2004 if species environment relationships are assumed constant stationary or left unaddressed by statistical modeling spatial non stationarity can confound results interpretation particularly when assessing large study areas zuckerberg et al 2020 rollinson et al 2021 several statistical techniques have been developed to account for spatial non stationarity by providing location specific coefficient estimates rather than an average or global estimate of species environment relationships for a study area in its entirety gelfand et al 2004 finley 2011 often labeled as spatially varying coefficients svc these techniques have been successfully applied to improve estimates for avian community turnover jarzyna et al 2014 snow adapted species distributions sultaire et al 2021 and spatiotemporal variation in zoonotic disease hosts humphreys et al 2021b recently thorson 2019 proposed svc methods for quantifying the influence of climate oceanographic processes on marine species distributions in the eastern bering sea however the current study is the first to employ a comparable approach to appraise climate oceanographic variability on a terrestrial species our central objective was to assess the causal relationship of climate variability on long term grasshopper dynamics in the western united states distinguishing between the explanatory and predictive tasks during scientific research is essential to model based analysis and has major implications for methods selection and results interpretation macnally 2000 shmueli 2010 pescott and jitlal 2020 whereas the aim of statistical prediction is to identify the set of explanatory variables that maximally explain variation in a dependent variable the goal of causal inference is to obtain a minimally biased estimate of a variable s effect size on a dependent variable while in the presence of mediating variables potential confounds and unobserved error wright 1921 rubin 1974 pearl et al 2000 pearl 2010 often misunderstood as procedures reserved solely for experimental research conducted under randomization and controls causal inference is appropriate for observational data and is increasingly applied to ecological studies that incorporate biological field survey and remote sensing data larsen et al 2019 rosenbaum et al 2020 laubach et al 2021 meisner et al 2022 we applied causal analysis to assess the role of the enso and pdo in shaping grasshopper dynamics while in the presence of mediating climate effects confounding environmental variables and unobserved error arising from incomplete field survey spatiotemporal correlation and other unmeasured processes key to our approach was use of svcs to assess time and location specific variation in grasshopper response to climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study domain our study area encompassed the conterminous united states us west of approximately 95 5 west longitude this area exhibited an estimated areal extent of 4 74 million km 2 and included the states of arizona california colorado idaho kansas montana nebraska nevada new mexico north dakota oklahoma oregon south dakota texas utah washington and wyoming major ecoregions occurring in this area include temperate grasslands and savannas deserts and xeric shrublands and temperate coniferous forest olson and dinerstein 2002 for statistical analysis the study domain was divided into a regularized hexagonal grid comprised of 2 345 individual cells each with a 2 125 km 2 areal extent under albers equal area conic geographic projection cell number and size were determined through sensitivity analysis aimed at balancing spatial precision minimum cell resolution with optimal spatial autocorrelation reduction cell center distances between 25 and 200 km intervals were iteratively evaluated in 5 km increments with 65 km distance found to be optimal at a 65 km distance 2 345 individual cells were produced for the study area additional information detailing hexagonal grid sensitivity analysis is provided in the supplemental data fig s1 the study area and hexagonal grid are illustrated in fig 1 2 2 grasshopper data grasshopper density data were acquired from the us department of agriculture animal and plant health inspection service plant protection and quarantine ppq program at fort collins colorado the ppq program collated the data from recent and historic grasshopper orthoptera acrididae surveys conducted across the western us total grasshopper density all species combined survey date and the geographic coordinates for survey locations were documented in the data set for the current study we evaluated the 40 year period between 1982 and 2021 and converted density units from reported measures of grasshoppers yard 2 to grasshoppers m 2 1 gh yard 2 0 84 gh m 2 although grasshopper survey data were available for several years prior to 1982 these observations were limited to the states of montana and wyoming and predated remotely sensed vegetation and climate data incorporated for analysis more than 92 of grasshopper records had been documented during surveys in the months of june 23 2 july 47 8 and august 20 8 therefore we considered the data set as generally representative of grasshopper density during the late summer season given the potential for point level coordinate inaccuracy and a need to reduce the computational resources required by statistical models see section 2 4 we calculated mean grasshopper density in annual time steps for each of the grid cells described in section 2 1 e g 40 separate grids representing grasshopper density for each year 1982 2021 fig 1 b provides an example of the spatial aggregation process by showing mean grasshopper density 1982 2021 and the total number of survey years available for each location as with many ecological data sets davies and gray 2015 our grasshopper density database was presumed to have been subject to collection bias humphreys et al 2022a and to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal correlation welti et al 2021 therefore a major objective was to control for these statistically problematic influences during analysis see section 2 4 2 3 causal model scientific research requires the specification of two distinct models constructed under different analytical frameworks a causal model and a statistical model although statistical models are tools capable of quantifying correlations and associations among variables they are wholly insufficient in themselves to infer causal relationships mcelreath 2020 to infer cause a model that encapsulates information external to the data must be developed this model summarizes researcher understanding of the study system encodes principal hypotheses and outlines analytical assumptions once formulated the causal model guides construction of the statistical model and serves as the crux of subsequent statistical model evaluation and results interpretation the directed acyclic graph dag illustrated in fig 2 diagrams the cause effect relationships we hypothesize between grasshoppers climate variability and other observed and unobserved system elements dag nodes circles show observed and unobserved variables in the climate grasshopper system while arrows indicate the hypothesized causal relationships among them fig 2 our hypothesis is that the enso and pdo exposures of interest directly effect temperature t and precipitation p which in turn directly effect vegetation v drought d soil condition s and grasshopper density gh t r u e which is our outcome variable of interest note that the assertion enso effects temperature is symbolized by an arrow from enso the cause to t the effect clarifying the predominate direction of the cause effect relationship although cyclic relationships interactions and feed backs are assumed to exist between variables and are considered in statistical models they are implicit and not symbolized in the dag to clarify the chief cause effect relationships in our hypothesis during a single time step yuan and shou 2020 importantly grasshoppers are represented twice in our graphical heuristic fig 2 the symbol gh t r u e signifies true grasshopper density as occurs in nature whereas gh o b s stands for grasshopper observations as collected by humans during field survey although gh t r u e is not observed it is what we seek to explain the natural state by comparison gh o b s has been observed and documented but is only a function of gh t r u e and is also effected by unobserved error u unobserved error in gh o b s is due to incomplete sampling preferential sampling and other aspects of data collection that result in biased estimates and measurement error incomplete sampling refers to the issue of grasshopper observations being collected across a limited number of locations and times and therefore potentially not representative of the western us as a whole during the entirety of the grasshopper season the problem of preferential sampling occurs due to non random selection of survey locations diggle et al 2010 pennino et al 2019 in the case of grasshoppers there has been reported preference for survey locations known for historically high grasshopper numbers or having been reported as subject to grasshopper outbreaks humphreys et al 2022a the fundamental distinction between gh t r u e and gh o b s prevents direct adoption of gh o b s as a model response or dependent variable without first adjusting for conditioning on or controlling for unobserved error to make gh o b s a more reliable proxy for gh t r u e as later described for the statistical model this adjustment was accomplished through use of a measurement error model in addition to gh t r u e and observational unobserved error grasshopper intraspecific intra and interspeciifc inter competition are shown as unobserved factors in the dag as is grasshopper predation pred we hypothesized that these biotic variables strongly influence grasshopper density and included them for completeness despite not having reliable proxies for statistical modeling all aspects of soil condition s were likewise not completely observed however data reflecting soil ph ph and soil organic carbon oc were available and included in the statistical analysis nodes signifying the areal proportion of cultivated managed land cover cult and elevation e are displayed due to potential direct effects to grasshopper density the dag encodes the analytical assumptions surrounding our evaluation of grasshopper climate relationships and reveals three statistical models for comparison a total effects model te a minimal adjustment model ma and a full adjustment model fa the te includes the exposures enso and pdo and the outcome without any additional adjustment te exposure effect sizes indicate the total influence of the oni and pdo on grasshopper density through all direct and indirect pathways the ma model includes the exposures and outcome as well as the minimally sufficient adjustment set required to detect direct effects if they exist the minimal sufficient adjustment set includes temperature precipitation and elevation by conditioning on temperature and precipitation pathways from the exposures through these variables and to grasshopper density are blocked although the enso and pdo are not hypothesized to exert a causal influence on elevation elevation acts as a confounding common cause to temperature and precipitation and must be blocked to prevent information flow from the exposures to grasshoppers via the exposures temperature elevation grasshoppers or exposures precipitation elevation grasshoppers pathways having blocked all mediated pathways capable of propagating indirect effects ma exposure effect sizes reflect the magnitude of any direct effects between the exposures and grasshoppers lastly the fa model includes the exposures and outcome while adjusting for all dag variables the fa model was included for study completeness however assuming the ma model blocks indirect effect pathways and our hypothesis regarding a lack of exposure direct effects is correct the magnitudes of fa exposure effects are anticipated to be comparable to those from ma for emphasis although the additional covariates included with the fa model would be expected to explain greater grasshopper variation than do the te or ma models the goal of causal analysis is to identify changes in exposure effect size not to optimize model fit or prediction young 2019 measures of model fit like the aic bic or r 2 as applied in predictive modeling hold no weight during causal analysis where statistically important variables may be purposefully excluded to avoid bias acharya et al 2016 montgomery et al 2018 young 2019 as a result causally incorrect models with added effects often predict better than those models that are causally correct but incorporate fewer effects mcelreath 2020 for the climate indices depicted in the causal model the oceanic niño index 3 4 oni was acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center noaa 2021b the oni is calculated based on running three month averages of extended reconstructed sea surface temperature anomalies ersst v5 in the pacific ocean niño 3 4

decadal oscillation pdo index was also obtained noaa 2021c the pdo reflects sst variability over the north pacific mantua et al 1997 newman et al 2016 to quantify teleconnection between climate processes and terrestrial climate over the western us temperature and precipitation data from the prism climate group prism 2021 were utilized we secured and standardized monthly mean maximum temperature temp and total precipitation ppt grids for the us at 4 km grid resolution prism 2021 other data proxies for dag variables included a normalized difference vegetation index for vegetation v soil data from the international soil reference and information centre https www isric org characterizing ph and oc poggio et al 2021 land cover from the earthenv laboratory http www earthenv org tuanmu and jetz 2014 to estimate the proportion of cultivated area cult a standardized drought index abatzoglou et al 2014 for drought d and a digital elevation model for elevation e in the study area jarvis et al 2008 additional information for these data sets are provided in the supplemental information to include acquisition source native resolution and other details table s2 all variables excluding the climate indices were standardized for ease of interpretation more than 30 assumptions of variable conditional independence are implicit in the dag as examples enso is assumed independent of vegetation when conditioned on elevation precipitation and temperature e n s o v e p t and drought is considered independent of the pdo when conditioned on precipitation and temperature d p d o p t these assumptions and all others were evaluated using season specific sensitivity analyses textor et al 2016 ankan et al 2021 rosseel 2012 with results reported in the supplemental information fig s3 2 4 statistical model statistical analyses were implemented using bayesian hierarchical models a major challenge in translating our causal model to a statistical model was the need to account for measurement error resulting from ecological data collected by numerous different individuals over multiple decades and in the absence of a consistently applied and randomized sampling protocol reported grasshopper observations gh o b s fig 2 could not be considered as valid proxies for actual grasshopper numbers gh t r u e fig 2 without concurrently estimating the unobserved error u fig 2 stemming from the data collection process itself in the bayesian setting one solution to measurement error is to construct a joint likelihood model that effectively treats the quantities of interest as missing data richardson and gilks 1993 yang et al 2016 bhadra et al 2012 van smeden et al 2021 adopting this approach our statistical models incorporated different likelihoods for the grasshopper observation process and the true grasshopper density within a single joint model that facilitated error propagation specifically a bernoulli distribution was selected for human observation of grasshoppers y 1 and a gamma distribution for the true grasshopper density y 2 y 1 s t binomial π s t y 2 s t gamma a s t b s t where y 1 s t indicates if a survey was conducted in grid cell s s 1 2 3 2345 during year t t 1982 1983 1984 2021 and actual grasshopper density y 2 s t was assumed to be a positive value with shape and scale parameters a s t b s t such that e y 2 s t e x p o s u r e μ s t a s t b s t with exposure defined as the geographic area of cell s as a joint model with two likelihoods our response variable was specified as a bivariate matrix where the first column was coded to indicate if a survey was conducted 1 or not conducted 0 such that y 1 s t 1 if field survey at location s and time t was conducted 0 location not surveyed s t and the response variable s second column followed a gamma parameterization with the grasshopper density estimate plugged in when the location was surveyed and all other values truncated removed y 2 s t n a if location was not surveyed s t d e n s i t y if a density estimate was reported with survey s t each tier of the joint model included a dedicated linear predictor process component to account for latencies e g spatial and temporal autocorrelation unmodeled environmental factors and in the case of the second tier to estimate coefficients associated with climate covariates the linear predictors were specified such that 1 logit π

survey probability eq 1 and mean grasshopper density eq 2 across the study area other effects common to both model levels include terms to account for tier specific spatiotemporal structure ζ s t and individual grid cell variation φ s individual cell variation was modeled as independent and identically distributed random variables with levels defined for each unique location time combination to aid in accounting for variation and interaction not captured by the spatiotemporal processes the term s s t designates a shared spatiotemporal effect that controls for correlation between the observation and density levels of the model with λ serving as a scaling coefficient that quantifies the strength magnitude of that between tier correlation blangiardo and cameletti 2015 krainski et al 2018 humphreys et al 2021a the β 1 e f f o r t s t term in eq 2 represents a sampling effort effect based on the number of year specific surveys conducted in the cell and β 2 x s t signifies environmental variables illustrated in the dag excluding the exposures outcome temperature and precipitation fig 2 the β 1 e f f o r t s t covariate was included with each model to aid in controlling for sampling bias whereas covariates in β 2 x s t differed by model as described for the te ma and fa formulations in section 2 3 spatial random effects ζ s t 1 2 and s s t followed a besag formulation besag 1975 that can be generalized as 3 ζ i ζ j i n 1 m i i j ζ j 1 m i τ where n is a normal distribution having a mean 1 m i i j ζ j and variance 1 m i τ with m i being the number of neighboring cells and τ being the precision here i j indicates that cells i and j are neighbors which we specified during model construction to include any two cells in the grid that adjoin at least one common boundary point when cells i and j are classified as neighbors they are assumed to exhibit spatial dependency with ζ i estimates conditional on those for ζ j the spdep package bivand and piras 2015 was used to construct the neighborhood graph and defined cell adjacency for our hexagonal grid which was found to have an average of 5 8 neighbors per grid cell spatiotemporal effects were assigned first order autoregressive structure and weakly informative penalizing complexity priors simpson et al 2017 riebler et al 2016 the f function presented in eq 2 signifies incorporation of climate covariates as spatially varying coefficients svc because relationships between grasshopper density and climate vary by location climate covariates oni pdo temperature and precipitation were designed to provide location and time specific coefficient estimates the s v c k s t term in eq 2 represents the k th climate variable k 1 4 at location s and time t with local coefficients that vary according to the latent gaussian spatial process ξ k s t the formulation for ξ k s t was similar to that given in eq 3 except that climate variables were added as location specific weights and the enforced zero mean constraint was removed a zero mean constraint forces the sum of the spatial field values to total zero conceptually comparable to scaling and centering the spatial field in the case of the ζ s t 1 2 and s s t effects a zero mean constraint was enforced to help reduce confounding between the spatial field and explanatory covariates however the constraint was not enforced for ξ k s t because doing so might have changed the magnitudes of svc estimates each of the three model formulations presented in section 2 3 i e te ma fa were separately analyzed with respect to four seasons for a total of 12 different models seasons were delimited as fall september october and november winter december january and february spring march april and may and summer june july and august rather than assume the calendar month of january as the end point for each year we instead based annual turnover on the grasshopper reproduction season ending in summer therefore the fall and winter seasons were assumed to influence grasshopper density during the following calendar year modeling based on seasons rather than months eased the computational demand for running models simplified results interpretation and served to better characterize the oni criteria used to identify the onset of el niño conditions surpassing the 0 5 c anomaly threshold in any three month period is indicative of el

to compare estimated oni and pdo effects from different geographic locations seasons and models with consideration of uncertainty posterior predictive contrasts were constructed by extracting predictive samples from posterior distributions we extracted 10 000 samples from 50 equal intervals across the full range of the oni and pdo indices as a final step to simplify results interpretation and presentation hierarchical clustering was conducted as a post modeling descriptive analysis to group geographic locations hexagonal grid cells exhibiting comparable climate grasshopper relationships oni and pdo svc effects from all 12 models were included in the cluster analysis 2 effects 12 models 40 yrs per model 960 variables for clustering cluster validation brock et al 2008 to evaluate between 2 20 possible clusters based on these 960 variables revealed that our study area was best described by seven groups the clustered groups are described as grasshopper climate regions

to the oni and pdo varied by time and location for example contrasted responses between the northern e g wyoming and southern great plains e g texas were apparent in many years with the northern great plains subject to decreased grasshopper density as climate index values increased negative correlation and the southern great plains showing increased grasshopper density as index values increased positive correlation to avoid confusing adjusted effect sizes as causal effects presentation of estimated temperature and precipitation svcs is limited to maps depicting coefficient polarity fig 4 with videos showing annual and seasonal change available in the supplemental video s5 similarly estimated coefficients for sampling effort and adjusted environmental variables included in fa models are provided in the supplemental fig s6 a common mistake in presenting results from causal analysis is to interpret adjusted variables i e mediating and confounding effects similarly to exposures despite adjusted variables not having been subjected to deconfounding westreich and greenland 2013 to illustrate that temperature and precipitation effects would require different modeling assumptions than here presented for the oni and pdo fig s7 in the supplemental provides a dag in which temperature and precipitation effects are addressed as hypothetical exposures generally increased temperature was associated with decreased grasshopper density across the southwest e g arizona southern california western new mexico but showed positive correlation with density across the northern great plains and rocky mountains by comparison increased precipitation mostly showed a positive relationship to grasshopper density across the southwest and southern portions of the northern great plains and a negative correspondence with density across the northern rocky mountains and northwestern us fig 4 hierarchical clustering to group study area cells based on estimated oni and pdo effects identified seven grasshopper climate regions gcrs with a homogeneous synchronous grasshopper response to climate gcrs are mapped with a graphical synopsis of el niño la niña effects in fig 5 the overall pattern suggested by results is that el niño periods characterized by an extended pacific jet stream and stationary polar jet stream brought moisture and cooler temperatures to southern latitudes contributing to increased grasshopper densities in southern gcrs sgp swb by comparison a variable polar jet stream during la niña events bottom left caused increased grasshopper densities in more northern gcrs ngp pnw although grasshopper response to climate was largely synchronous within individual gcrs asynchrony between different gcrs was apparent and can be demonstrated through calculation of posterior predictive contrasts comparison of grasshopper climate relationships predicted for the northern and southern great plains ngp and sgp as delineated in fig 5 revealed that low oni values oni 0 5 experienced during the fall winter and spring seasons produced increased grasshopper densities in the ngp but reduced densities in the sgp fig 6 a conversely high oni values oni 0 5 showed the opposite pattern with increased densities in the sgp but decreased grasshoppers in the ngp although changes in density attributable to the pdo were less pronounced than those resulting from the oni in all seasons predictions for the winter pdo likewise exhibited asynchrony with positive pdo values leading to increased densities in the ngp and reduced numbers in the sgp fig 6 b a contrasting response was observed for negative pdo values during the winter increased densities in the sgp and decreased ranges in the ngp the summer season was found to exhibit the least influence on grasshopper density with the ngp and sgp showing near uniform response to the oni and pdo across all scenarios effect amplification and attenuation were observed when the oni and pdo exposures were concurrently changed for example largest grasshopper density increases in the ngp occurred when the oni and pdo both exhibited negative index values fig 6 c when low oni index values were coupled with high pdo values densities in the ngp were attenuated below levels obtained by the same oni index values while holding the pdo constant but sgp densities exhibited strong amplification under the same conditions fall and spring fig 6 d 4 discussion our results quantitatively demonstrated interannual changes in long term grasshopper density to be effected by pacific ocean sea surface temperature variability furthermore grasshoppers were found to exhibit spatial asynchrony and non stationarity in response to climate such that the relative influence of climate on grasshopper density varied both through time and across geographic space the general pattern shown by analysis revealed that the western us can be divided into seven geographic regions of approximately synchronous character with respect to how grasshoppers responded to climate fig 5 physiographically the relative positioning of these seven grasshopper climate regions gcrs suggested that latitudinal gradients exist both east and west of the rocky mountains with the rocky mountains acting as a transitional area at the east west partition we infer that the rocky mountain region a gcr delineated by our study functions as a transitional area after considering that shifts in grasshopper density are relatively muted in the region by comparison to gcrs found to the east and west and that the rocky mountains mostly parallel tracks associated with a variable polar jet stream fig 5 we also suspect that topographical variation in and around the rocky mountains largely drives weather and climate patterns within the rocky mountain region partially mitigating temperature and precipitation extremes experienced within the other gcrs corroborating several grasshopper studies conducted over smaller geographic extents capinera and thompson 1987 belovsky and joern 1995 capinera and horton 1989 the northern great plains ngp and southern great plains sgp delineated by our study were found to exhibit contrasting grasshopper responses to climate that are consistent with a climate dipole zuckerberg et al 2020 in the great plains a hypothesis drawn from this result is that el niño and la niña cycles augmented by the pdo which can modulate the intensity extent and duration of enso gershunov and barnett 1998 nguyen et al 2021 indirectly influence grasshopper abundances through mediated temperature and precipitation effects that impact plant productivity soil condition and other environmental aspects of the climate grasshopper system fig 2 because el niño events tend to increase precipitation across the sgp while concurrently reducing high temperature extremes increased grasshopper abundance in these locations may be due to improved soil moisture availability which would lead to increased plant quality productivity and delayed senescence that is el niño events bring additional precipitation to what is a prevailing arid climate resulting in supportive soil conditions for grasshopper egg development and a vegetation green up that increases food and habitat availability polis et al 1997 meserve et al 2003 vandenbosch 2003 holmgren et al 2006 srygley et al 2010 2014 by comparison el niño events in the ngp are associated with warmer and drier conditions reducing moisture availability plant quality and overall vegetative productivity thereby lessening grasshopper abundance during a la niña event the opposite pattern occurs warmer drier conditions reduce abundance in the sgp while cooler more moist conditions contribute to increased abundance in the ngp although we caution against interpreting temperature and precipitation effects sizes equivalently to modeled exposures westreich and greenland 2013 temperature and precipitation svcs generally supported our hypothesis by showing positive associations between grasshoppers and temperature in northern portions of the study area and positive precipitation effects in the southwest fig 4 although grasshopper density relationships to temperature and precipitation were less clear for locations laying between the northern and southern great plains cgp in fig 5 this may indicate that the subregion acts as a tension zone between the ngp and sgp variably taking on the character of the gcr to the north or south depending on the specific intensity of the enso or pdo event or the degree to which the enso and pdo interact to attenuate or amplify indirect effects fig 6 enso and pdo are known to affect other herbivore populations in subtropical desert and seasonally dry grasslands polis et al 1997 meserve et al 2003 vandenbosch 2003 holmgren et al 2006 cárdenas et al 2021 typically a pulse of primary productivity with increased rainfall in dry regions leads to population expansion at higher tropic levels however climate cycles can also affect predator abundance and top down control of herbivores preisser and strong 2004 for rodents population control shifts from bottom up in dry years when resources are limited to top down in wetter years meserve et al 2003 similarly breeding success of rufous crowned sparrows was limited by primary productivity during drier la niña years but population control shifted to top down in wetter el niño years morrison and bolger 2002 although we focused on temperature and precipitation changes in concert with climate cycles their effects on primary productivity and productivity cascading upwards to influence grasshopper abundances we lack information on how top down control of grasshoppers by predators and parasitoids changes with enso or pdo although we highlight this study as the first to leverage climate indices as spatially varying coefficients in assessing terrestrial species response to climate we concur with jonas et al 2015 in that both exogenous and endogenous factors are important in unraveling complex insect dynamics for example many of the dramatic shifts observed in grasshopper density may be as mechanistically tied to transient stage structured population dynamics carried over from prior years i e population inertia and momentum as they are to external climate forcing koons et al 2007 lockwood and lockwood 2008 to this end our study would have benefited from inclusion of covariates capturing population variability as functions of population growth rates density dependence effects and biotic influences in the environment e g competition and predation the single largest limitation faced when conducting our research was the unavailability of species specific density data lacking species designations for the majority of the study area determinations about endogenous population factors and food preferences were problematic as these characteristics vary widely by species jonas et al 2015 in hopes of broadening model generalizability we therefore opted to pursue assessment of climate grasshopper relationships across a massive geographic area rather than conduct a more detailed species specific analysis at a local scale due to the spatial scale of our study the second major limitation encountered during analysis was use of unbalanced field survey data our grasshopper database was amalgamated from different sources with variable geographic coverage and uneven sampling frequency the heterogeneity shown by our input data were the primary impetus for constructing a measurement error model anthropogenic climate change will likely influence the spatial and temporal stationarity of enso and pdo teleconnections and their relative importance to ecosystems globally vecchi and wittenberg 2010 haszpra et al 2020 for the western us in particular seasonal warming interacting with climate variability is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme drought flooding and wildfire events yeh et al 2018 wahl et al 2019 sun et al 2020 through a combination of immediate and delayed responses these climate changes may alter soil condition e g nitrogen deposition carbon stores moisture plant productivity and nutrient content and insect abundances throughout the western us reichstein et al 2013 welti et al 2020 substantial uncertainty remains in forecasting how climate change will affect ecosystem processes generally and grasshopper populations specifically however our work is the first to incorporate climate indices as spatially varying coefficients for assessment of terrestrial species and adds to a growing body of literature linking climate cycles like enso and pdo to insect population abundances in many regions of the globe including brown locusts locustana pardalina in southern africa todd et al 2002

24392,monitoring is usually among the first actions taken to help inform recovery planning for declining species but these data are rarely used formally to inform conservation decision making for example central valley chinook salmon were once abundant but anthropogenic activities have led to widespread habitat loss and degradation resulting in significant population declines monitoring data suggest survival through the southern sacramento san joaquin river delta in particular may be a limiting factor for juvenile chinook salmon outmigrating from the san joaquin river and its tributaries however survival and routing monitoring data have not been formally used to inform water management in a decision analytic framework here we illustrate how estimates derived from disjunct monitoring data can be used to inform water management and as a basis for adaptively managing flows we aggregated a meta analysis of chinook salmon smolt survival and routing estimates through the south delta with other sources of data to develop a survival and routing simulation model to estimate optimal flows for the san joaquin river during smolt outmigration from february may we found that large flow pulses at predictable times during the spring are projected to be optimal for increasing chinook salmon smolt survival to the san francisco bay and that optimal scenarios differed somewhat with water year type sensitivity analysis revealed temperature and smolt outmigration timing are driving optimal pulse distribution and that water allocation changes little with parameter uncertainty this case study highlights the utility of the decision analytic framework for solving conservation problems keywords chinook salmon san joaquin river river flows monitoring data optimization modeling california central valley data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction monitoring data are often collected on sensitive species with the objective of informing management for conservation nichols and williams 2006 lyons et al 2008 indeed these efforts can result in years of abundance survival movement and habitat quality data sometimes in excess of twenty years these data are rarely used formally for the purpose of informing management nichols and williams 2006 in many situations managers and biologists believe their data are insufficient for making informed management decisions and believe more monitoring data are needed wright et al 2020 the decoupling of monitoring from natural resource management decision making is inefficient and potentially wasteful if resources are expended for increased monitoring but the monitoring results lie idle nichols and williams 2006 a better approach incorporates monitoring data into a quantitative decision support framework to evaluate the potential effectiveness of management alternatives on valued resource objectives such as species recovery while maintaining a flow of information to reduce uncertainty and increase predictive performance i e adaptive resource management nichols and williams 2006 lyons et al 2008 williams 2011 conroy and peterson 2013 wright et al 2020 although adaptive resource management has demonstrated success when applied to conservation problems it remains relatively underutilized in practice an example of the decoupling of monitoring from management is in the management of water flows to support migration of anadromous salmonids in the central valley of california hydrological modifications and habitat degradation have in part resulted in substantial declines of populations of central valley chinook salmon and other anadromous fish smith et al 2003 myrick et al 2004 perry et al 2018 an extensive system of dams reservoirs diversions and aqueducts supports agricultural flood control and irrigation and municipal uses power generation and water supply throughout the central valley smith et al 2003 poff et al 2007 2010 perry et al 2018 zimmerman et al 2018 these modifications have blocked salmon access to historical spawning habitat and have greatly reduced the seasonal and interannual streamflow variability of rivers altered the timing and magnitude of river discharge and changed the temperature and turbidity of river water smith et al 2003 lund et al 2007 poff et al 2007 richter and thomas 2007 singer 2007 brown and bauer 2010 shenton et al 2012 perry et al 2018 zimmerman et al 2018 sturrock et al 2020 in addition physical habitat has been hardened and simplified to facilitate human navigation and flood control lehman et al 2019 and myriad non native species have become established resulting in dramatic changes in species assemblage structure dill and cordone 1997 feyrer and healey 2003 chinook salmon use ocean freshwater and estuarine habitats to fulfill their life history needs but observations of low survival 0 05 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b perry et al 2018 buchanan and skalski 2020 for juveniles outmigrating through the sacramento san joaquin river delta hereafter delta and the importance of this region for water management has made the delta a research priority sommer et al 2001 limm and marchetti 2009 michel et al 2013 2015 every natural origin juvenile must pass through the delta to successfully reach the ocean newman and brandes 2010 perry et al 2018 buchanan and skalski 2020 however the delta is also the core of california s water delivery system diverting water through a network of channels and canals grantham 2013 luoma et al 2015 healey et al 2016 perry et al 2018 buchanan and skalski 2020 the delta has undergone an almost complete transformation from historical conditions whipple et al 2012 michel et al 2013 juvenile salmon navigate through multiple potential pathways in the highly modified delta where route specific survival is highly variable perry et al 2010 2018 singer et al 2013 brown and bauer 2010 juvenile fall run chinook salmon can disperse from natal tributaries in early spring as smaller fry and achieve considerable growth for multiple weeks in non natal waters prior to ocean entry or they can rear in natal tributaries and leave as larger smolts later in the spring limm and marchetti 2009 merz et al 2013 zeug et al 2014 sturrock et al 2020 nobriga et al 2021 historically the delta was dominated by floodplains and wetlands that could support large numbers of rearing fry and provide predator and thermal refugia for later outmigrating smolts sommer et al 2001 however 3 of these habitats remain today and salmon that emigrate early from natal tributaries as fry have low survival sturrock et al 2020 salmon emigrating later as smolts also have low survival due to increased water temperature 20 c that corresponds with increases in bioenergetic demands of introduced predatory fish e g largemouth bass micropterus salmoides and a reduction in salmon swimming performance lehman et al 2017 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b freshwater input into the delta is influenced primarily by the san joaquin river in the south and is dominated by the sacramento river in the north buchanan et al 2018a 2018b perry et al 2018 in the south delta multiple decades of coded wire tag releases of juvenile chinook salmon have been used to develop models relating hydrologic conditions to salvage at the state and federal exports facilities zeug and cavallo 2014 smolt survival newman 2008 zeug and cavallo 2013 and movement through the delta baker and morhardt 2001 more recently acoustic tagging of individual smolts has allowed more precise estimation of individual smolt routing movement and survival in the south delta holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b these multiple years of acoustic data can facilitate identification of flow regimes for the san joaquin river that would maximize the survival of outmigrating salmon smolts through the various possible routes in the south delta our objectives were to show how to leverage currently available long term monitoring datasets to develop decision support tools that can directly inform management decisions without the need for waiting on additional monitoring data for purposes of illustration we assumed a decision context of what is the best timing and volume of water to release for migrating salmon with the objective of maximizing juvenile chinook salmon survival through the south delta from durham ferry to chipps island the objective could also have been e g minimize the probability that survival is below some threshold or maximize emigration timing diversity the important concept is that different or multiple formulations of objectives could have been used for optimization and we selected maximize survival to demonstrate the decision analytic framework to this end we aggregated estimates from various datasets from the south delta to develop a salmon smolt survival and movement simulation model that estimates the number of smolts that survive along the various routes in the delta for a given flow regime this included a meta analysis of chinook salmon smolt survival and routing probability estimates available from summary reports through years of monitoring that we related to environmental variables i e flow temperature water exports and tide we then used optimization modeling to determine the flow regimes that maximize survival during smolt outmigration we also used our simulation model to compare the outcome of flow decisions in previous years to model optimized flow and conducted a sensitivity analysis to help prioritize further data and monitoring needs 2 methods 2 1 management system the california central valley watershed is composed of two main drainage systems encompassing 160 000 km2 the sacramento and san joaquin basins the central valley experiences a mediterranean climate with historical flow regimes driven by winter storm events late spring snow melt and a hot dry summer dettinger et al 2011 san joaquin river group authority sjrga 2011 yarnell et al 2015 hestir et al 2016 seasonal variation in flows is substantial hestir et al 2016 with approximately 80 of average annual flow occurring in six months of the year with peak flows generally occurring in the late spring whipple et al 2012 the sacramento and san joaquin rivers join to form the delta at the eastern portion of the largest estuarine system on the west coast of the americas whipple et al 2012 the delta then feeds into san pablo suisun and san francisco bays to the west and then to the pacific ocean the region of focus for this paper is the southern portion of the delta from durham ferry in the south to chipps island in the northwest and bounded by the san joaquin and old river fig 1 buchanan and skalski 2020 the primary source of freshwater in this region is the san joaquin river and tides increasingly dominate hydrology downstream of the head of old river junction baker and morhardt 2001 cavallo et al 2015 sst 2017 the central valley project cvp and state water project swp pump water from the south delta for agricultural and municipal uses through a series of channels seasonal barriers and gates perry et al 2010 hestir et al 2016 munsch et al 2019 water exports from cvp and swp alter the hydrology in the old middle river corridor and juvenile chinook salmon can be entrained along with diverted water both the cvp and swp salvage fish from diverted water and truck them to the west delta where they are released greater numbers of chinook salmon are salvaged as diversion rates increase but entrainment may not increase total population mortality under most conditions kimmerer 2008 zeug and cavallo 2014 buchanan et al 2018a in some years a temporary fish barrier is constructed to prevent fish outmigrating from the san joaquin river routing to these pumping facilities buchanan et al 2018a 2018b low river flows also affect salmon survival by altering the location of the tidal transition zone perry et al 2010 cavallo et al 2013 water through the south delta is managed based on water year type and a variety of regulatory measures that are in place to protect special status fishes e g steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss delta smelt hypomesus transpacificus and water quality water year types are complex water management classifications generally based on the amount of unimpaired runoff from october to july and the previous year s index and are updated monthly during the rainy season california data exchange center 2021b we therefore modeled survival based on water year type and used the san joaquin 60 20 20 water year hydrological classification index that varied during our timeframe of interest 2008 2018 from least amount of water available to the most critical water years 2008 and 2013 2015 dry water years 2012 and 2016 below normal years 2009 and 2018 above normal year 2010 and wet years 2011 and 2017 california data exchange center 2021a 2 2 meta analysis of survival and routing studies in the south delta we conducted a meta analysis of the acoustic telemetry based survival and routing probability estimates for hatchery raised chinook salmon smolts collected in the south delta for regions where enough fish survived to include in the meta analysis holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b the monitoring objectives set by the above referenced fish studies were to relate environmental variables to survival and routing of chinook salmon smolts through the south delta each year the data were collected using smolt sized 100 mm fl hatchery fish and tag detection arrays that were deployed in the south delta from april through june 2008 2015 survival routing and detection probabilities were estimated using multistate mark recapture models brownie et al 1993 nichols et al 1994 lebreton and pradel 2002 for various routes through the south delta each year beginning at release points on the san joaquin river at durham ferry and ending at chipps island after which surviving salmon smolts entered saltwater environments we extracted the estimated survival and routing probabilities and their standard errors from annual reports of the hatchery fish studies holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b and entered estimates into a database we divided the south delta into seven regions based on the locations of acoustic tag detection arrays from previous studies 2008 2015 of salmon survival and routing holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b we used survival estimates from these reports for four of the seven regions for which enough fish survived as the basis of four separate survival meta analyses and four separate routing meta analyses region 1 begins on the san joaquin river at the release site for acoustic telemetry hatchery fish durham ferry and continues downstream to the head of old river hor fig 1 region 2 continues along the san joaquin river from the junction with hor to the junction at turner cut region 3 continues downstream on the san joaquin river to chipps island which is where juvenile salmon enter the brackish waters of the san francisco estuary on their way to the pacific ocean munsch et al 2019 region 4 picks up at the hor and heads down the old river to the cvp and swp facilities regions 5 and 6 represent entrainment pre screen mortality screen efficiency salvage and trucking to chipps island from swp and cvp see fig 2 from zeug and cavallo 2014 for more information region 5 begins at the trash rack for the cvp and ends with trucking to chipps island fig 1 region 6 begins at the radial gates at the entrance to clifton court forebay for the swp and ends with trucking to chipps island fig 1 region 7 represents survival of any fish routing through the interior delta this includes fish that route through old river north routes for fish making it past the pumping facilities and fish routing into the interior delta at turner cut region 7 ends therefore with fish routing through the interior and surviving to chipps island we did not conduct survival meta analyses for region 5 6 or 7 and instead used estimates based on other research supplement 1 gingras 1997 karp et al 2017 the regions we identify here sometimes included two segments that were used in the acoustic telemetry studies holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b because locations of tag detection arrays varied through time in instances where survival estimates were reported for two river segments that were within a single region we estimated the survival for the larger region as the product of the estimated survival for the two segments and standard errors using the delta method williams et al 2002 we excluded much of the 2008 and 2014 data that had poor transmitter battery survival and too few fish observed in downstream regions for reliable estimates but we included estimates from upstream sections we calculated the mean of the environmental variables from the start and end dates of each release to relate to each release s survival and routing estimates we downloaded daily flow m3s 1 and water temperature c data from u s geological survey usgs stream gages on the san joaquin river and the sacramento river usgs 2021 swp and cvp water exports from california department of water resources california data exchange center 2020 and minimum and maximum tide height data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2018 for stockton for the same dates that the survival and routing studies were conducted we used flow data from the usgs vernalis stream gage 11 303 500 prisoner s point stream gage 11 313 460 stockton stream gage 11 304 810 old river stream gage 11 313 315 and water temperature data from usgs vernalis and prisoner s point stream gages we conducted meta regression on survival and routing data which is a type of powerful meta analysis common in natural sciences meta analysis synthesizes effect sizes from the mean values and variance estimates and weights each mean contribution by the inverse of the associated standard errors steward and schmid 2015 lortie and filizzola 2020 here we assumed the estimates were logit normally distributed and used logit transformed survival and routing probabilities and their standard errors from the hatchery fish studies in our meta analyses holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b we assessed the additive and interaction effects of environmental variables on survival and routing probabilities the model formulation is as follows l o g i t y i x i β ϵ i i 1 m ϵ i n 0 s i where y i are the survival or routing estimates from the respective region m is the number of estimates from each region x i β defines the matrix of environmental covariates that represent the population averaged outcomes in terms of p unit level meta predictors in the design matrix x i with fixed effects coefficients β sera et al 2019 the vector ϵ i defines the unit level sampling errors i e standard errors for each fish release sera et al 2019 we did not use correlated environmental variables r 0 7 in the same models moore and mccabe 2005 water exports and the water export flow ratio are linearly associated r 0 83 newman and brandes 2010 so we did not use the water export flow ratio as an environmental variable to avoid multicollinearity during the survival and routing studies there was a temporary physical barrier in place in 2012 2014 and 2015 and a non physical barrier bio acoustic fish fence was tested in 2010 to prevent fish from entering the old river sjrga 2011 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b thus we also included the presence of the non physical or physical hor barrier horb i e yes 1 no 0 as a variable in candidate models of routing at hor survival meta regression models were fit for each of the four regions separately using the mean and se from each release similarly routing probability for four of the regions was modeled separately at each junction the best approximating meta regression model for each of the four regions and four junctions was selected using akaike information criterion with small sample bias adjustment aicc burnham and anderson 2002 we used the r package mixmeta gasparrini et al 2012 sera et al 2019 and r statistical software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 to conduct meta analyses where we used the logit survival or routing probability from the hatchery studies as the response the environmental variables as covariates and standard error from the hatchery studies as the estimate for standard error to estimate survival and entrainment at the cvp facility region 5 we used estimates from release recapture experiments of acoustically tagged juvenile chinook salmon conducted at the tracy fish collection facility tfcf fig 1 in march and may 2013 karp et al 2017 karp et al 2017 evaluated smolt sized salmon 105 mm fl entrainment and subsequent survival in front of and within the tfcf under a range of normal facility flows during a drought year the months chosen for testing were when wild juvenile salmonids were typically entrained by the water pumps karp et al 2017 in general there tends to be an increase in facility salvage efficiency as the number of pumps in operation at the c w bill jones pumping plant jpp increases from one to five we used the data in karp et al 2017 to refit models relating the number of pumps operating to the capture and survival at the cvp facility using logistic regression this prevented the estimated probabilities from being less than zero and greater than one as could occur with the linear regression equations reported in karp et al 2017 2 3 decision support simulation model development we used the results of the survival routing and entrainment meta analysis and estimates based on published research to develop a quantitative chinook salmon smolt survival and routing simulation model for the south delta the model operates on a daily time step and tracks the number of user specified smolts that start at durham ferry and ends at chipps island fish survive from durham ferry to hor region 1 as a function of average daily flow and water temperature at the usgs vernalis stream gage and the effect of fish size table 1 fish size was added to all survival models as a constant based on perry et al 2018 at hor surviving fish remain in the san joaquin river as a function of whether there is a barrier horb in place average daily flow at vernalis and their interaction table 1 fish remaining in the san joaquin river travel down to turner cut region 2 and survive as a function of average daily flow at vernalis and fish length table 1 at turner cut fish remain in the san joaquin river as a function of average daily flow at the usgs stockton stream gage table 1 the survival of fish remaining in the san joaquin river to chipps island region 3 is a function of average daily water temperature at the usgs prisoner s point stream gage and fish size table 1 at hor fish that enter old river travel down toward the export facilities region 4 and survive as a function of average daily water temperature at vernalis and fish size table 1 entrainment at the cvp facility was a function of the number of water pumps operating table 1 survival of entrained fish at the cvp that were then trucked to chipps island region 5 was modeled as a function of the number of water pumps operating fish that were not entrained at the cvp facility could then be entrained at the swp facility as a function of average daily water exports table 1 the survival of these swp entrained fish that were salvaged and trucked to the end point at chipps island region 6 was a constant 13 25 as estimated by gingras 1997 the survival of fish to chipps island that entered the interior via the old river and were not entrained in the cvp or swp facilities or that entered the interior delta via turner cut on their way to chipps island region 7 was modeled as a constant 1 table 1 based on observations of acoustically tagged salmon having very poor survival in this region sjrga 2011 2013 smolt survival is often related to size sogard 1997 perry et al 2018 sturrock et al 2020 however we did not have data specifically for chinook salmon outmigrating through the south delta in winter spring thus we used the fork length fl survival relationship from perry et al 2018 from hatchery fish outmigrating through the north delta from release sites in the sacramento river in december and january to link fish size to survival probability although smolts were from a different run age basin were released earlier and fl at the time of tagging was smaller in the acoustic telemetry studies 80 140 mm 2014 x 98 9 mm to 2013 x 115 3 mm buchanan et al 2020 than those used in perry et al 2018 140 mm fl the fl survival relationship likely holds true across varying scenarios r perry personal communication 2021 2 4 decision support simulation model inputs we developed three regression models to be able to link daily environmental inputs upstream to environmental variables downstream that are associated with routing and survival probabilities to use as inputs in the decision support simulation model fig 2 this allowed us to create inputs for variables known to affect survival and routing from the meta analysis that are related to user specified upstream inputs we included environmental variables that are typically included by water managers in central valley hydrologic simulation models to show how these models can be integrated with biological models in the future klipsch and hurst 2007 specifically we developed the first regression model for estimating average flow at stockton as a function of flow at vernalis and freeport minimum tide swp and cvp water exports and their interactions table 2 we developed a second regression model for estimating water temperature at prisoner s point as a function of flow at vernalis and freeport air temperature and the quadratic effect of air temperature at prisoner s point and the interaction of flow at vernalis and air temperature at prisoner s point lastly we developed a regression model to estimate water temperature at vernalis as a function of flow at vernalis and freeport air temperature and the quadratic effect of air temperature at vernalis and the interaction of flow and air temperature at vernalis in the vernalis temperature model we included freeport flows that do not reach vernalis because it is plausible that freeport flows could be a possible mechanism due to regional weather patterns coordinated reservoir releases in the sacramento and san joaquin rivers or a possible external mechanism that is correlated with freeport flows that we did not capture with our other covariates such as negative flows maximum tides etc we used aicc burnham and anderson 2002 and akaike weights wi to identify the best predicting model water managers use sacramento river flows to model conditions in the delta as part of regular water management operations however to justify using sacramento river flows in stockton flow and prisoner s point temperature models i e locations on the san joaquin river we evaluated the predictive ability of our model by estimating the out of sample error we therefore completed 500 iterations of 10 fold cross validation breiman and spector 1992 on the stockton and prisoners point models with and without freeport flows in the model the out of sample predictive accuracy as measured by the root mean squared error rmse mean across iterations was 20 6 and 35 5 for stockton discharge models with and without freeport discharge respectively similarly rmse of the prisoners point temperatures was 1 95 and 2 07 with and without freeport discharge respectively in fact the expected error in the discharge model is 42 lower and temperature 6 lower when freeport flows are included thus we chose to use the more accurate flow and temperature models that included freeport we developed the three regression models using daily air temperature at national weather service stations at modesto airport ghcnd usw00023258 at vernalis and stockton ghcnd usw00023237 at prisoners point and average daily flow at the usgs stream gages at vernalis and freeport for 2008 2018 we log transformed freeport and vernalis flow square root transformed swp exports and transformed minimum tide at stockton with the formula log minimum tide 1 for use in the regression models we used the r package mumin barton 2020 and r statistical software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 to conduct model selection and develop model selection tables we did not use correlated environmental variables r 0 7 in the same models moore and mccabe 2005 we report candidate models within aicc wi 10 of the model with the largest weight to evaluate strength of evidence royall 1997 and provide estimates from the top model if the top model had aicc wi 0 8 we used fish monitoring data collected by the mossdale trawl 2012 2020 usfws 2020 to estimate the mean and standard deviation for daily fl of smolts entering the south delta from february 1 through may 30 we also used the mossdale trawl data to estimate the proportion of the entire outmigration over the study period of chinook salmon smolts that passed through vernalis located near durham ferry fish release site each day hearn et al 2014 munsch et al 2019 the mossdale trawl samples open water habitats and avoids shallow edge habitats and is therefore more efficient at collecting larger smolts and much less efficient at collecting smaller rearing fry mahardja et al 2021 consequently few juveniles of fry size are captured in february and march in addition early emigrating fry survival is relatively low for fry rearing in the south delta sturrock et al 2020 nobriga et al 2021 thus our south delta model likely underestimates the effects of delta flows on smaller fry sized fish we used a generalized additive model gam r package mgcv wood 2017 with the smooth term knots 10 to model the proportion of smolts entering the south delta each day from mossdale trawl mean daily and total fish numbers the resulting function i e smooth terms 10 had a relatively high coefficient of determination p 0 0001 r 2 0 61 because the proportion of fish entering the delta each day across the migration window must sum to one we normalized the predicted values from the gam to sum to one when using these values in the simulation model although survival and routing estimates were from telemetry experiments conducted from april and may we wanted to assess flow optimization across the entire period when smolts could be outmigrating including february and march limm and marchetti 2009 merz et al 2013 zeug et al 2014 to avoid making predictions using covariate data outside the range of the data used to develop the model we constrained environmental variables within the range of values used in the meta analysis during the simulations described below supplement 2 we used measured mean daily flow and mean daily temperature at the same usgs stream gages to quantify mean daily flows in february may for each water year type existing managed flow regimes on the san joaquin river through vernalis are partly determined from decision 1641 d 1641 state water resources control board 2000 which was implemented in 1999 before studies relating chinook salmon survival to flows were initiated supplement 3 d 1641 defines minimum flow targets and any extra water available beyond that minimum is available for flow pulses or for reshaping the hydrograph in particular for a given volume of water available use of the upper rather than lower minimum flow objective results in having less extra water available to allocate to flow pulses these flow targets have been used to shape flows and determine the biological opinion and conference opinion on the long term operations of the cvp and swp nmfs 2009 the biological assessment for the california water fix nmfs 2016 and the biological opinion on long term operation of the central valley project and the swp nmfs 2019 for the purposes of demonstrating our model we chose to use the upper and lower d 1641 flow targets at vernalis to calculate the volume of water available at vernalis for a given water year type supplement 3 in recent years the spring pulse typically april 15 may 15 has been shaped to maximize flow variability zeug et al 2014 inundate floodplains for rearing habitat and manage water temperatures 2 5 simulation optimization procedure we wanted to determine the optimal flow regime for chinook salmon smolts outmigrating through the south delta in late winter through late spring the d 1641 targets are set for minimum flows from february through june with a specified flow pulse to occur april 15 to may 15 and vary by water year type supplement 3 using the flow rate targets we calculated total volume of water available using average daily flow rate m3s 1 as a substitute for volume from february through may by water year type by multiplying the rate by the number of days in the simulation 119 we partitioned this period into seventeen one week periods and distributed the total volume of water available for each period after subtracting the amount needed to maintain established minimum flows according to d 1641 supplement 3 we determined optimal distributions of water above minimum flows among these weekly periods using a simulation optimization approach conroy and peterson 2013 the objective was to maximize the number of smolts that survived to chipps island constraints were needed to ensure that only 100 of the available volume of water was used over the simulation time period thus we used nonlinear optimization with constraints to solve this problem parameters and model inputs were drawn from statistical distributions as described below and the optimal distribution of water was estimated this simulation optimization process was repeated 10 000 times and the mean water distribution for the seventeen one week time periods was calculated we initiated simulations with 500 000 juvenile salmon at durham ferry that were randomly distributed across the 17 weeks using a multinomial distribution with probability of emigrating derived from the normalized gam predicted values from the mossdale trawl we ran all comparisons with horb 0 no barrier because the physical barrier is no longer used we checked for convergence on all solver solutions and plotted mean flow with 95 confidence intervals for 17 weeks from february through may all optimization procedures were conducted using r package nlcoptim chen and yin 2019 and r statistical software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 briefly this package solves optimization problems with nonlinear constraints and nonlinear objective functions based on the augmented lagrange multiplier method for problems with parameters in the form of a matrix see chen 2016 we included stochasticity in the simulation optimization procedure average daily inputs for air temperature at prisoner s point and vernalis were sampled from a normal distribution and were based on average daily air temperatures from february through may with a mean monthly standard deviation from the 1999 2020 data 1 0 0 319 sd for prisoner s point and vernalis respectively minimum tides are cyclic do not vary with water year type and follow the same trend year after year therefore we used a randomly chosen year 2013 to represent the cyclic nature of the minimum tide and accounted for variation with an overall mean daily standard deviation from years 2008 2018 daily inputs for average flow at freeport cvp water exports and swp water exports do vary with water year type so we derived these environmental variables from the mean and standard deviations from 1999 to 2020 data by water year type values were sampled from a gamma distribution each day by converting their respective mean and standard deviation to shape and scale parameters using r package connmattools kaplan 2020 fl was also sampled from a gamma distribution accounting for more variation in the data day 89 i e march 30 and less variation day 89 variability in the proportion of smolts outmigrating was sampled from a multinomial distribution with probabilities of outmigration as described above parameter estimates of survival and routing probabilities were sampled from a normal distribution using the residual errors as the random effects in water resource management system dynamics cannot be completely controlled by management due to external drivers e g precipitation that affect the ability to implement management actions as planned this is known as partial controllability conroy and peterson 2013 thus in practice managers recalculate flow releases each month from february june that alter the volume of water available for flow management from what was initially predicted we included 20 variation on the lower and upper minimum and pulse targets from the d 1641 table using a uniform distribution to evaluate the effects of partial controllability on the optimal flow distribution in the south delta 2 6 hindcast scenarios we also used our decision support simulation model to compare the outcome of flow decisions in previous years with model optimized flow for this exercise we used measured environmental data i e flows temperatures water exports etc rather than predicted values from our regression models for the 119 day period from february may 2010 2013 and 2016 2018 we omitted 2014 2015 because the measured environmental data were incomplete due to a lack of data for many days in most years a separate distribution for fish fl and proportion of fish entering the south delta for each year was not possible thus we used the mean distribution of fish and fl for inputs as described previously we used measured vernalis total flows from february through may and assumed the april may pulse targets by water year type from d 1641 to calculate the minimum flow and the amount of water available to pulse for each year we omitted two of the critical and dry years 2012 2016 that did not have enough water for upper minimum flow targets because our aim was to evaluate managed flow releases in excess of minimum flow thresholds we then conducted year specific simulation optimization procedures detailed above to determine the optimal flow regime for that year constraining the amount of water available to equal the observed values we also used the routing and survival model to predict the cumulative survival of fish reaching chipps island under the observed flow and temperature regimes as measured at the gages and under the optimal flow regime using observed water temperatures and the flows at freeport we also compared our modeled total survival to chipps island to estimated total survival reported in the annual reports to determine how reliable our modeled survival under the observed conditions was 2 7 sensitivity analysis and value of information we used one way sensitivity analysis to identify the simulation model parameters i e intercepts and slopes from the meta regression analysis and model inputs i e developed from environmental variables that had the greatest influence on estimated smolt survival from durham ferry to chipps island conroy and peterson 2013 using the lower target from the below normal water year type water availability and minimum flows supplement 3 we varied the values of parameters and inputs throughout their 95 confidence intervals one at a time while keeping the other values unchanged and reran the optimization procedure 10 000 times for the survival and routing probability parameters we varied the parameters from the 5th percentile to the 95th percentile of a normal distribution by increments of 5 for the parameters without estimates of variability e g standard errors from regression parameters we varied the parameter 50 of the mean value by 5 increments to represent the variability we found in parameters with estimates of variability i e a mean difference from their 95 confidence intervals of 51 14 4 sd peterson and duarte 2020 for example for the survival intercept 0 1325 for the swp export facilities i e region 6 we used a lower bound of 0 06625 and an upper bound of 0 19875 for environmental inputs to the model we varied the values from the 10 000 simulations of the below normal water year type from the 5th to 95th percentile of a normal distribution by 5 increments we then recorded the estimated total number of smolts surviving through the south delta and plotted minimum i e 5th percentile and maximum survival i e 95th percentile in a tornado diagram to examine the sensitivity of the model predictions to both parameters and inputs conroy and peterson 2013 we included both intercepts and slopes because they have different interpretations for example the slope is the relationship between the survival or routing parameter and the environmental variable and indicates if the environmental variable itself is important in the model and the intercept is the mean of the survival or routing value at a chosen value of environmental variable and indicates if the survival or routing parameter is influential therefore sensitivity analysis of both intercepts and slopes should be important to managers in addition to the one way sensitivity analysis we conducted a response profile sensitivity analysis and calculated the expected value of perfect information evpi calculating evpi was a slow process therefore to illustrate the methodology we calculated evpi of the parameters most influential to survival as indicated by the one way sensitivity analysis a response profile sensitivity analysis differs from a one way sensitivity analysis in that the focus is to evaluate how the optimal decision changes across a range of parameter values conroy and peterson 2013 here we used the results from the one way sensitivity analysis of varying the parameters one at a time between the 5th and 95th percentile by 5 increments from the 10 000 iterations of the simulation optimization as described above we plotted these nineteen flow regimes to evaluate how the distribution of water varied with the parameter we estimated the relative value of improving knowledge of the top four parameters by calculating the expected value of perfect information evpi conroy and peterson 2013 the evpi is the expected increase in a decision maker s objective i e proportion of smolts surviving to chipps island if the uncertainty regarding a parameter value were completely eliminated 3 results 3 1 model fitting the meta analysis of survival and routing probabilities was based on 16 24 hatchery fish releases from 2008 to 2015 table 1 meta analysis indicated survival probability progressively declined downstream from durham ferry to hor 0 66 0 03 hor to turner cut 0 26 0 04 hor to cvp 0 22 0 07 and turner cut to chipps island 0 06 0 06 probability of fish staying in sjr at hor was lower 0 57 0 04 than at turner cut 0 85 0 07 we compared various meta analysis models with san joaquin river flows and temperatures for explaining smolt survival and routing through four of the regions for which we had enough data model selection results indicated that survival from durham ferry to the hor region 1 was positively related to average daily flow at vernalis whereas it was negatively related to water temperature at vernalis supplement 4 table 1 and fig 1 survival from hor to turner cut region 2 also was positively related to average daily flow at vernalis survival from turner cut to chipps island region 3 was negatively related to average daily temperature at prisoner s point and survival from hor to cvp region 4 was negatively related to average daily temperature at vernalis supplement 4 table 1 and fig 1 the probability of remaining in the san joaquin river at hor was positively related to the presence of the hor barrier average daily flow from vernalis and an interaction between the two supplement 4 table 1 and fig 2 the probability of fish remaining in the san joaquin river at turner cut was negatively related to average daily flow at stockton supplement 4 table 1 and fig 2 the probability of fish becoming entrained at swp was positively related to swp exports table 1 the mossdale trawl analyses were based on from 1 059 fish in 2019 to 6 334 fish caught in 2013 mean 3 324 1 sd 1 859 2 the daily proportion of smolts entering the south delta had two peaks indicating few outmigrants in february march and had a bimodal trend of smolt outmigration with peaks in mid april and mid may fig 3 a fork length represented earlier migrations of smaller fish in february and march and later migrations of larger fish in april and may fig 3b model selection indicated regression models for predicting model inputs downstream had many variables and complex interactions supplement 5 and had high adjusted r 2 i e 0 90 0 92 indicating good predictive ability table 2 none of the transformed variables used in the downstream input regression models were correlated at r 0 7 3 2 simulated optimal flow regimes in the simulated water year examples the optimal flow regime for smolts differed among water year types e g critical wet but all had patterns consisting of two periods of pulsed flows that coincided with peak outmigration through the south delta one in april and one in may with a much bigger pulse allocated to may fig 4 aside from the critical water year type february march and april air temperatures were similar among water year types while the critical year type was warmer in all months table 3 may monthly air temperatures at vernalis and prisoner s point were generally higher for the drier water year types than wetter water year types table 3 in critical dry below normal and above normal water years when water was available to pulse it was optimal to allocate extra water i e when going from the lower to upper target about equally to the april and may peak outmigration periods fig 4 as minimum flows and available pulse water increase in wet water years the strategy again was to pulse most of the water in may but when moving from the lower to the upper target more water was distributed to the trailing end of peak migration through the south delta in may smolts predicted by the model to have survived through the south delta with optimal pulsing of water varied substantially among water years and was five times higher in wet years 0 13 0 040 than critical years 0 026 0 017 3 3 hindcasting the optimal flow regimes calculated using historical water availability and temperatures were similar to our water year specific optimization with two large pulses of water that coincided with the two outmigration peaks in april and may fig 5 however in most water years except 2016 dry water year the highest optimal pulse coincided with the peak in april outmigrating fish with a lower optimal pulse corresponding with the beginning of the peak of may outmigrating fish fig 5 in 2016 the largest pulse was allocated for may outmigrating fish this may be related to the fact that 2016 had the highest average daily water temperature at prisoner s point and among the lowest average daily flows at stockton in april during that time period supplement 6a and b the main difference between observed flows and simulated hindcast optimal flows was that simulated pulses were allocated when the largest proportion of smolts were estimated to be migrating through the south delta during april and may in contrast the observed flows were distributed more evenly over a longer time frame and do not correspond well with estimated peak migrations through the south delta in general more smolts were predicted to survive to the ocean by saving more water to pulse in april when fish are outmigrating through the south delta as opposed to having a higher minimum flow fig 5 as opposed to the simulations based on inputs from the previous section small hindcast pulses are allocated to february this is likely due to the measured temperature inputs being allowed 15 c whereas we imposed constraints on temperature in february and march for the simulations based on inputs due to our model being based on hatchery fish survival studies from april and may where temperatures did not go below 15 c our simulation model suggests that optimizing flows can increase cumulative survival through the south delta in this example predicted survival with optimal hindcast flows was on average 1 3 times greater than under the observed flows and temperatures fig 5 the difference in cumulative survival between hindcast and optimal flows was lowest for the dry and critical water years survival under optimal 1 1 65 times greater s increase 0 0 015 that had the least amount of water available to manage interestingly the differences in cumulative survival between the optimal and observed regimes were greatest for the below and above normal water years optimal 1 47 1 67 times greater s increase 0 027 0 035 and not the wet years optimal 1 22 1 31 greater s increase 0 08 these counterintuitive non linear results may have been difficult to verify without an optimization model for three years for which we had total survival estimates from the hatchery fish releases from mossdale to chipps island and we had enough environmental data to run the survival optimization model to make comparisons 2010 2012 2013 our survival estimates were exactly the same as in the reports sjrga 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2016 indicating our optimization model reliably estimates smolt survival through the south delta for a range of water year types 3 4 sensitivity analysis and value of information the one way sensitivity analysis indicated that the simulation model estimates were most sensitive to survival parameters particularly the effect of temperature on survival fig 6 in contrast the routing parameters were much less influential as were the parameters related to the cvp and swp the four most influential parameters on estimated smolt survival through the south delta were survival from hor to the cvp facility intercept and temperature at vernalis and survival from turner cut to chipps island intercept and temperature at prisoner s point fig 6 export parameters were generally insensitive between the 5th to 95th percentiles fig 6 model inputs were much less influential than model parameters on juvenile survival of the model inputs the most influential on survival were flows at freeport and air temperature at prisoner s point and vernalis fig 6 response profile analysis of the top four parameter slope estimates indicated the hydrographs would generally keep the same shape throughout the range of the 5th to 95th percentile of a normal distribution by increments of 5 with only a re distribution of water over the april and may pulses fig 7 with lower values of the survival model intercepts and vernalis temperature parameter estimates water would be allocated to the april pulse and with larger values of the parameter slope estimates water would be allocated to the interval after the usual may peak pulse with water in the most extreme upper ends of the parameter ci being allocated to the intervals between the april and may pulses for turner cut to chipps island parameter estimates any change in the parameter estimates results in redistribution of water within the may peak the evpi for all parameters was similar averaging 0 038 overall survival fig 7 this suggests that reducing uncertainty of these parameters would improve flow management such that it would result in up to 1 57 times greater juvenile survival in below normal water years using the lower target mean under uncertainty 0 051 compared to mean with perfect information 0 089 4 discussion it is commonly thought that one of the major impediments to developing management strategies through quantitative modeling is the paucity of data on the linkages between habitat modification and biological responses pringle et al 2000 arthington et al 2006 murchie et al 2008 brown and bauer 2010 in our case study we were able to synthesize a large number of disconnected south delta studies and incorporate meta analysis techniques to develop a decision support simulation model to link managed flows i e habitat modifications to chinook salmon smolt survival and movement i e biological responses we then solved the model using optimization and evaluated the relative effect of uncertainty on management objectives in our case smolt survival through the south delta to be able to demonstrate how models like these can be used to prioritize future research and monitoring efforts given the inherent limitations of any decision support simulation model such tools will never be a replacement for human decision makers particularly where real world management strategies frequently must address economic or social considerations not just biological outcomes undeniably these tools are often best used to identify general patterns that may then be translated into real world management rulesets and provide hypotheses for directed studies to test predicted benefits a management ruleset for smolts gleaned from our case study is to allocate increased flows in may when larger smolts are entering the south delta furthermore when more water is available for flow pulses the optimal strategy is to spread the additional water to adjacent intervals after peak water pulses interestingly even in very low water years the model suggests it is optimal to have large pulses in may when most smolts are entering the south delta decision support simulation models can provide insights into management tradeoffs that may be counterintuitive when not formally integrating information from disparate sources peterson and duarte 2020 for example results of our simulation modeling indicate pulses allocated in april do not follow a smooth progression from critical to wet years but that in below normal years it is more beneficial to allocate most of the water above the minimum target to may another example is that our results consistently support a flow pulse in may when water temperatures can be lethal to salmon kjelson et al 1982 smith et al 2003 perry et al 2010 2018 vogel 2010 cavallo et al 2013 lehman et al 2017 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b but flow pulses at this time are generally discouraged by managers however the potential for elevated flows to decrease water temperatures enough to increase chinook salmon smolt survival in the south delta in may has yet to be formally evaluated largely because of resistance to releasing the amount of water necessary to achieve temperature reduction in the various regions of the south delta our results suggest that implementing flow pulses in may has the potential to increase survival of later migrating larger smolts if true this management strategy may provide a longer window in which successful outmigration is possible which could minimize competition decrease predation risk and promote diverse life history strategies munsch et al 2019 sturrock et al 2020 similar to other analyses of the south delta acoustic tagging studies partially relied upon in our model dauble et al 2010 we found no negative effect of exports on salmon smolts this suggests elevated river flows can benefit smolt survival even if water diversions from the south delta are increased which further supports implementing pulse flows during may an adaptive resource management framework could be used to pair the implementation of increased flows in may with physical modeling and strategic monitoring to evaluate hypotheses on how flows temperature and diversions affect juvenile survival during this time period it should be noted that survival studies that informed our optimization modeling are limited in their temporal scope april and may and life history stage smolt only relative to the entire period chinook salmon are in the south delta additionally we only used the timing of chinook salmon smolts entering the delta while there is some evidence that the proportion of juveniles migrating as fry parr or smolts is linked with hydrology brandes and mclain 2001 zeug et al 2014 adding dynamic entry timing based on flow pulses and life history stages and integrating new survival studies may change the optimal pulse strategy suggested by our example application thus it would be worthwhile to evaluate management rulesets similar to that suggested by the decision support simulation model through adaptive resource management for example one could incorporate a sub model that predicts the proportion of fry parr and smolt emigrating through the south delta as a function of flow we would then update our understanding of system dynamics with the revised parameter estimates to make better management decisions each year based on monitoring or directed research deciding how to allocate resources among management monitoring and research efforts can be difficult even in some of the most well funded management programs using decision analysis techniques we can leverage existing information to evaluate the influence of various uncertainties using a common currency typically the currency of the management objective s in our example we found the temperature survival relationships from turner cut to chipps island and from hor to cvp had the largest influence on cumulative smolt survival through the south delta specifically we found the expected cumulative smolt survival increased by up to 1 57 times for below normal water year types by improving flow management due to reduced uncertainty in smolt survival estimates from these two regions using evpi in other words improved management of below normal water year flows made possible by reducing uncertainty in our parameter estimates is expected to result in a cumulative smolt survival similar to an above normal water year under uncertainty this would be equivalent to having more than twice as much water for target minimum flows i e moving from 40 2 m3s 1 to 96 8 m3s 1 and 1 5 times more water to pulse i e 5964 m3s 1 in an above normal water year vs 3925 m3s 1 in a below normal water year thus reducing uncertainty in these parameters might mean managers can maximize the biological objective in this case cumulative smolt survival to the same degree for less water potentially leaving more water that can be used for other objectives if survival is already at an acceptable level e g floodplain rearing habitat uncertainties can be used to design future modeling efforts in our smolt example the sensitivity analyses indicated the interval for preferred flow pulses i e april and may was invariant to changes in either slopes or intercepts of the parameters with the largest uncertainties but matched with smolt outmigration patterns through the south delta this indicates resources may potentially be wasted attempting to reduce uncertainty in meta regression parameters linked to survival and routing if this knowledge does not change the predicted optimal action the finding that the optimal intervals for flow pulses matches outmigration patterns suggests that a better understanding of the timing of smolt migration through the south delta may be needed to inform flow management in this region as the smolt arrival timing monitoring data came with limitations such as missing data biased detection rates and high variation in estimates future monitoring efforts should focus on the variation in smolt timing to evaluate the robustness of the management rulesets that seem to be emerging with the current model had the pulse interval changed with varying the parameters with the largest uncertainties i e survival intercept for turner cut to chipps island and slope with prisoner s point temperature managers would then consider trying to reduce the uncertainty in both the survival estimate and the effect of temperature on that survival estimate the intercept and residual error for that matter may include factors important to survival that we didn t account for in this model so determining where those sources of uncertainty in the intercept occur as well as the slope would both be important in this alternate case although the hydrographs were invariant to change in survival and routing parameters with the largest range of survival outcomes in this model varying the temperature parameter values at vernalis for survival from durham ferry to head of old river allowed us to see that survival includes zero in the range of survival outcomes a risk averse manager may be more concerned with the uncertainty that includes zero smolts surviving than an uncertainty that spans somewhat low and very high survival i e temperature survival relationships from turner cut to chipps island and from hor to cvp satisfying the apprehensions of a risk averse manager to encourage them to implement an alternative but potentially beneficial strategy could mean we redefine the objective to minimizing survival to be less than a certain value e g 0 025 as opposed to maximizing survival in addition the effects of temperature at vernalis on survival from durham ferry to hor as a priority in the monitoring framework could be added into the same adaptive management plan suggested previously for learning how increased pulses in may affect juvenile survival as this parameter had high uncertainty in how it would affect survival narrowing that uncertainty through additional research would be helpful for assuring the risk averse manager the new management has low probability of a zero survival result incorporating objectives for risk aversion can be done easily at the beginning of a structured approach to the decision making process conroy and peterson 2013 managing ecological systems can be difficult particularly when some of the factors influencing the decision are outside of the decision maker s control this partial controllability can sometimes deter managers from using decision support simulation models because it can be viewed that the system is too complex to model in our example we demonstrated how uncertainty in seasonal amounts of water availability can be incorporated directly into decision support simulation models that link hydrological flow and ecological response models this allowed the model to be solved using optimization while accounting for the real world uncertainty in seasonal water availability still it is often the case that the projected water amounts are updated in near real time as the season progresses state water resources control board 2000 thus a natural extension of this case study would be to incorporate an adaptive in season flow management plan that uses migrating fish capture data e g trawl or rotary screw trap data the newly predicted amount of water available e g water year type and temperature trends to feed into the decision support simulation model and inform within season flow management using the most up to date information the call for more data rather than using what data are available to develop decision support simulation models and evaluate tradeoffs in management actions as we did likely stems from biologists and managers knowing the limitations of their data and wanting to avoid using biased information to inform decisions for example our flow analysis incorporated meta analysis of survival and routing of tagged hatchery raised smolts which likely have reduced survival when compared to natural origin smolts del real 2012 additionally we used a size survival relationship from smolts from a different basin timing and life stage which while positive may have a different effect size furthermore the acoustic tagging studies were observational and did not occur when temperatures were lower than 15 5 c and when average daily flows were 175 275 m3s 1 environmental conditions that exist during the smolt outmigration window but for which we do not have tagging data although we certainly agree that not all monitoring data are collected in a way that makes them suitable to inform decision making it is worth noting that all ecological data are compromised to some extent and that this does not mean they do not provide useful information that is imperfect data do not prevent effective evaluation of tradeoffs in management actions when uncertainty in a particular parameter does not influence the management objective biologists and managers need not be as concerned with the related data limitation for example we were able to evaluate the effect of parametric uncertainty on the management objective in a transparent way one parameter included in our model cvp entrainment may have had increased uncertainty because we only had estimates from releases within one year karp et al 2017 however we did not find much of an effect of varying this parameter through its confidence interval on survival we also found varying the parameters with the most uncertainty did not change how water volume would be distributed on the other hand if uncertainty in a particular set of parameters governs which decision is most effective e g optimal flows were to change from april and may to february and march this would highlight the parameter s that managers and biologists would benefit most from in reducing uncertainty the south delta optimization model we developed could be built upon for general use by water managers for example an application could be made for managers to explicitly evaluate which management knobs to turn relative to their expected outcome and cost in the south delta the main knobs available to managers include changing the ratio of water imports into the delta e g via dam manipulations to water exports via the cvp or swp export facilities forgoing water exports reshaping the hydrograph of available water increasing flows to reduce temperatures and restoring more historical habitats that favor native over non native species some of these factors affect rearing habitat and therefore survival before emigrating fish even reach the south delta therefore adding upstream tributary sub models would incorporate optimizing flows for the varying portfolios of fry parr and smolts important for diversifying outmigration strategies sturrock et al 2020 in an upstream tributary sub model the weekly time step used in our south delta model could be adapted to a daily time step to account for flow variability that cues fry outmigration from natal tributaries zeug et al 2014 sturrock et al 2020 the results from our south delta smolt model are directly related to the management objective we considered i e optimizing cumulative survival of smolts through the south delta managers must manage the system for other sometimes competing biological objectives such as the number of adult fish that return to spawn fry outmigration floodplain rearing habitat other species of concern such as steelhead trout salinity and dissolved oxygen luoma et al 2015 horne et al 2018 peterson and duarte 2020 these objectives are relatively easy to incorporate into our modeling framework using multi criteria decision analysis horne et al 2018 such an effort would probably be best implemented within a structured decision making process where complicated problems are broken down into discrete steps through a series of stakeholder driven workshops conroy and peterson 2013 horne et al 2018 5 conclusions as the human population grows and the climate becomes warmer conserving wild populations that depend on water will require a more focused level of commitment technical effort and investment in conservation lackey et al 2006 naiman et al 2008 hanak et al 2011 katz et al 2012 luoma et al 2015 we suggest using tools and data that we currently have to help solve complex problems despite far from perfect knowledge about how systems will respond webb et al 2018 we demonstrated how to use advanced decision analytic modeling techniques to provide the direct link between monitoring optimization modeling and management using chinook salmon smolts in the south delta as an example we were able to use less than perfect long term monitoring data on chinook salmon smolt survival and routing to develop an optimization model to predict salmon smolt survival based on environmental covariates we then used the optimization modeling to determine flow hydrographs that optimize chinook salmon smolt survival through the south delta for varying water year types we were also able to identify future monitoring priorities based on sensitivity analysis this type of decision support framework can be used for a wide array of conservation problems throughout the world to link biological responses to management alternatives via an adaptive process

24392,monitoring is usually among the first actions taken to help inform recovery planning for declining species but these data are rarely used formally to inform conservation decision making for example central valley chinook salmon were once abundant but anthropogenic activities have led to widespread habitat loss and degradation resulting in significant population declines monitoring data suggest survival through the southern sacramento san joaquin river delta in particular may be a limiting factor for juvenile chinook salmon outmigrating from the san joaquin river and its tributaries however survival and routing monitoring data have not been formally used to inform water management in a decision analytic framework here we illustrate how estimates derived from disjunct monitoring data can be used to inform water management and as a basis for adaptively managing flows we aggregated a meta analysis of chinook salmon smolt survival and routing estimates through the south delta with other sources of data to develop a survival and routing simulation model to estimate optimal flows for the san joaquin river during smolt outmigration from february may we found that large flow pulses at predictable times during the spring are projected to be optimal for increasing chinook salmon smolt survival to the san francisco bay and that optimal scenarios differed somewhat with water year type sensitivity analysis revealed temperature and smolt outmigration timing are driving optimal pulse distribution and that water allocation changes little with parameter uncertainty this case study highlights the utility of the decision analytic framework for solving conservation problems keywords chinook salmon san joaquin river river flows monitoring data optimization modeling california central valley data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction monitoring data are often collected on sensitive species with the objective of informing management for conservation nichols and williams 2006 lyons et al 2008 indeed these efforts can result in years of abundance survival movement and habitat quality data sometimes in excess of twenty years these data are rarely used formally for the purpose of informing management nichols and williams 2006 in many situations managers and biologists believe their data are insufficient for making informed management decisions and believe more monitoring data are needed wright et al 2020 the decoupling of monitoring from natural resource management decision making is inefficient and potentially wasteful if resources are expended for increased monitoring but the monitoring results lie idle nichols and williams 2006 a better approach incorporates monitoring data into a quantitative decision support framework to evaluate the potential effectiveness of management alternatives on valued resource objectives such as species recovery while maintaining a flow of information to reduce uncertainty and increase predictive performance i e adaptive resource management nichols and williams 2006 lyons et al 2008 williams 2011 conroy and peterson 2013 wright et al 2020 although adaptive resource management has demonstrated success when applied to conservation problems it remains relatively underutilized in practice an example of the decoupling of monitoring from management is in the management of water flows to support migration of anadromous salmonids in the central valley of california hydrological modifications and habitat degradation have in part resulted in substantial declines of populations of central valley chinook salmon and other anadromous fish smith et al 2003 myrick et al 2004 perry et al 2018 an extensive system of dams reservoirs diversions and aqueducts supports agricultural flood control and irrigation and municipal uses power generation and water supply throughout the central valley smith et al 2003 poff et al 2007 2010 perry et al 2018 zimmerman et al 2018 these modifications have blocked salmon access to historical spawning habitat and have greatly reduced the seasonal and interannual streamflow variability of rivers altered the timing and magnitude of river discharge and changed the temperature and turbidity of river water smith et al 2003 lund et al 2007 poff et al 2007 richter and thomas 2007 singer 2007 brown and bauer 2010 shenton et al 2012 perry et al 2018 zimmerman et al 2018 sturrock et al 2020 in addition physical habitat has been hardened and simplified to facilitate human navigation and flood control lehman et al 2019 and myriad non native species have become established resulting in dramatic changes in species assemblage structure dill and cordone 1997 feyrer and healey 2003 chinook salmon use ocean freshwater and estuarine habitats to fulfill their life history needs but observations of low survival 0 05 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b perry et al 2018 buchanan and skalski 2020 for juveniles outmigrating through the sacramento san joaquin river delta hereafter delta and the importance of this region for water management has made the delta a research priority sommer et al 2001 limm and marchetti 2009 michel et al 2013 2015 every natural origin juvenile must pass through the delta to successfully reach the ocean newman and brandes 2010 perry et al 2018 buchanan and skalski 2020 however the delta is also the core of california s water delivery system diverting water through a network of channels and canals grantham 2013 luoma et al 2015 healey et al 2016 perry et al 2018 buchanan and skalski 2020 the delta has undergone an almost complete transformation from historical conditions whipple et al 2012 michel et al 2013 juvenile salmon navigate through multiple potential pathways in the highly modified delta where route specific survival is highly variable perry et al 2010 2018 singer et al 2013 brown and bauer 2010 juvenile fall run chinook salmon can disperse from natal tributaries in early spring as smaller fry and achieve considerable growth for multiple weeks in non natal waters prior to ocean entry or they can rear in natal tributaries and leave as larger smolts later in the spring limm and marchetti 2009 merz et al 2013 zeug et al 2014 sturrock et al 2020 nobriga et al 2021 historically the delta was dominated by floodplains and wetlands that could support large numbers of rearing fry and provide predator and thermal refugia for later outmigrating smolts sommer et al 2001 however 3 of these habitats remain today and salmon that emigrate early from natal tributaries as fry have low survival sturrock et al 2020 salmon emigrating later as smolts also have low survival due to increased water temperature 20 c that corresponds with increases in bioenergetic demands of introduced predatory fish e g largemouth bass micropterus salmoides and a reduction in salmon swimming performance lehman et al 2017 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b freshwater input into the delta is influenced primarily by the san joaquin river in the south and is dominated by the sacramento river in the north buchanan et al 2018a 2018b perry et al 2018 in the south delta multiple decades of coded wire tag releases of juvenile chinook salmon have been used to develop models relating hydrologic conditions to salvage at the state and federal exports facilities zeug and cavallo 2014 smolt survival newman 2008 zeug and cavallo 2013 and movement through the delta baker and morhardt 2001 more recently acoustic tagging of individual smolts has allowed more precise estimation of individual smolt routing movement and survival in the south delta holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b these multiple years of acoustic data can facilitate identification of flow regimes for the san joaquin river that would maximize the survival of outmigrating salmon smolts through the various possible routes in the south delta our objectives were to show how to leverage currently available long term monitoring datasets to develop decision support tools that can directly inform management decisions without the need for waiting on additional monitoring data for purposes of illustration we assumed a decision context of what is the best timing and volume of water to release for migrating salmon with the objective of maximizing juvenile chinook salmon survival through the south delta from durham ferry to chipps island the objective could also have been e g minimize the probability that survival is below some threshold or maximize emigration timing diversity the important concept is that different or multiple formulations of objectives could have been used for optimization and we selected maximize survival to demonstrate the decision analytic framework to this end we aggregated estimates from various datasets from the south delta to develop a salmon smolt survival and movement simulation model that estimates the number of smolts that survive along the various routes in the delta for a given flow regime this included a meta analysis of chinook salmon smolt survival and routing probability estimates available from summary reports through years of monitoring that we related to environmental variables i e flow temperature water exports and tide we then used optimization modeling to determine the flow regimes that maximize survival during smolt outmigration we also used our simulation model to compare the outcome of flow decisions in previous years to model optimized flow and conducted a sensitivity analysis to help prioritize further data and monitoring needs 2 methods 2 1 management system the california central valley watershed is composed of two main drainage systems encompassing 160 000 km2 the sacramento and san joaquin basins the central valley experiences a mediterranean climate with historical flow regimes driven by winter storm events late spring snow melt and a hot dry summer dettinger et al 2011 san joaquin river group authority sjrga 2011 yarnell et al 2015 hestir et al 2016 seasonal variation in flows is substantial hestir et al 2016 with approximately 80 of average annual flow occurring in six months of the year with peak flows generally occurring in the late spring whipple et al 2012 the sacramento and san joaquin rivers join to form the delta at the eastern portion of the largest estuarine system on the west coast of the americas whipple et al 2012 the delta then feeds into san pablo suisun and san francisco bays to the west and then to the pacific ocean the region of focus for this paper is the southern portion of the delta from durham ferry in the south to chipps island in the northwest and bounded by the san joaquin and old river fig 1 buchanan and skalski 2020 the primary source of freshwater in this region is the san joaquin river and tides increasingly dominate hydrology downstream of the head of old river junction baker and morhardt 2001 cavallo et al 2015 sst 2017 the central valley project cvp and state water project swp pump water from the south delta for agricultural and municipal uses through a series of channels seasonal barriers and gates perry et al 2010 hestir et al 2016 munsch et al 2019 water exports from cvp and swp alter the hydrology in the old middle river corridor and juvenile chinook salmon can be entrained along with diverted water both the cvp and swp salvage fish from diverted water and truck them to the west delta where they are released greater numbers of chinook salmon are salvaged as diversion rates increase but entrainment may not increase total population mortality under most conditions kimmerer 2008 zeug and cavallo 2014 buchanan et al 2018a in some years a temporary fish barrier is constructed to prevent fish outmigrating from the san joaquin river routing to these pumping facilities buchanan et al 2018a 2018b low river flows also affect salmon survival by altering the location of the tidal transition zone perry et al 2010 cavallo et al 2013 water through the south delta is managed based on water year type and a variety of regulatory measures that are in place to protect special status fishes e g steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss delta smelt hypomesus transpacificus and water quality water year types are complex water management classifications generally based on the amount of unimpaired runoff from october to july and the previous year s index and are updated monthly during the rainy season california data exchange center 2021b we therefore modeled survival based on water year type and used the san joaquin 60 20 20 water year hydrological classification index that varied during our timeframe of interest 2008 2018 from least amount of water available to the most critical water years 2008 and 2013 2015 dry water years 2012 and 2016 below normal years 2009 and 2018 above normal year 2010 and wet years 2011 and 2017 california data exchange center 2021a 2 2 meta analysis of survival and routing studies in the south delta we conducted a meta analysis of the acoustic telemetry based survival and routing probability estimates for hatchery raised chinook salmon smolts collected in the south delta for regions where enough fish survived to include in the meta analysis holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b the monitoring objectives set by the above referenced fish studies were to relate environmental variables to survival and routing of chinook salmon smolts through the south delta each year the data were collected using smolt sized 100 mm fl hatchery fish and tag detection arrays that were deployed in the south delta from april through june 2008 2015 survival routing and detection probabilities were estimated using multistate mark recapture models brownie et al 1993 nichols et al 1994 lebreton and pradel 2002 for various routes through the south delta each year beginning at release points on the san joaquin river at durham ferry and ending at chipps island after which surviving salmon smolts entered saltwater environments we extracted the estimated survival and routing probabilities and their standard errors from annual reports of the hatchery fish studies holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b and entered estimates into a database we divided the south delta into seven regions based on the locations of acoustic tag detection arrays from previous studies 2008 2015 of salmon survival and routing holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b we used survival estimates from these reports for four of the seven regions for which enough fish survived as the basis of four separate survival meta analyses and four separate routing meta analyses region 1 begins on the san joaquin river at the release site for acoustic telemetry hatchery fish durham ferry and continues downstream to the head of old river hor fig 1 region 2 continues along the san joaquin river from the junction with hor to the junction at turner cut region 3 continues downstream on the san joaquin river to chipps island which is where juvenile salmon enter the brackish waters of the san francisco estuary on their way to the pacific ocean munsch et al 2019 region 4 picks up at the hor and heads down the old river to the cvp and swp facilities regions 5 and 6 represent entrainment pre screen mortality screen efficiency salvage and trucking to chipps island from swp and cvp see fig 2 from zeug and cavallo 2014 for more information region 5 begins at the trash rack for the cvp and ends with trucking to chipps island fig 1 region 6 begins at the radial gates at the entrance to clifton court forebay for the swp and ends with trucking to chipps island fig 1 region 7 represents survival of any fish routing through the interior delta this includes fish that route through old river north routes for fish making it past the pumping facilities and fish routing into the interior delta at turner cut region 7 ends therefore with fish routing through the interior and surviving to chipps island we did not conduct survival meta analyses for region 5 6 or 7 and instead used estimates based on other research supplement 1 gingras 1997 karp et al 2017 the regions we identify here sometimes included two segments that were used in the acoustic telemetry studies holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b because locations of tag detection arrays varied through time in instances where survival estimates were reported for two river segments that were within a single region we estimated the survival for the larger region as the product of the estimated survival for the two segments and standard errors using the delta method williams et al 2002 we excluded much of the 2008 and 2014 data that had poor transmitter battery survival and too few fish observed in downstream regions for reliable estimates but we included estimates from upstream sections we calculated the mean of the environmental variables from the start and end dates of each release to relate to each release s survival and routing estimates we downloaded daily flow m3s 1 and water temperature c data from u s geological survey usgs stream gages on the san joaquin river and the sacramento river usgs 2021 swp and cvp water exports from california department of water resources california data exchange center 2020 and minimum and maximum tide height data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2018 for stockton for the same dates that the survival and routing studies were conducted we used flow data from the usgs vernalis stream gage 11 303 500 prisoner s point stream gage 11 313 460 stockton stream gage 11 304 810 old river stream gage 11 313 315 and water temperature data from usgs vernalis and prisoner s point stream gages we conducted meta regression on survival and routing data which is a type of powerful meta analysis common in natural sciences meta analysis synthesizes effect sizes from the mean values and variance estimates and weights each mean contribution by the inverse of the associated standard errors steward and schmid 2015 lortie and filizzola 2020 here we assumed the estimates were logit normally distributed and used logit transformed survival and routing probabilities and their standard errors from the hatchery fish studies in our meta analyses holbrook et al 2009 sjrga 2010 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b we assessed the additive and interaction effects of environmental variables on survival and routing probabilities the model formulation is as follows l o g i t y i x i β ϵ i i 1 m ϵ i n 0 s i where y i are the survival or routing estimates from the respective region m is the number of estimates from each region x i β defines the matrix of environmental covariates that represent the population averaged outcomes in terms of p unit level meta predictors in the design matrix x i with fixed effects coefficients β sera et al 2019 the vector ϵ i defines the unit level sampling errors i e standard errors for each fish release sera et al 2019 we did not use correlated environmental variables r 0 7 in the same models moore and mccabe 2005 water exports and the water export flow ratio are linearly associated r 0 83 newman and brandes 2010 so we did not use the water export flow ratio as an environmental variable to avoid multicollinearity during the survival and routing studies there was a temporary physical barrier in place in 2012 2014 and 2015 and a non physical barrier bio acoustic fish fence was tested in 2010 to prevent fish from entering the old river sjrga 2011 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b thus we also included the presence of the non physical or physical hor barrier horb i e yes 1 no 0 as a variable in candidate models of routing at hor survival meta regression models were fit for each of the four regions separately using the mean and se from each release similarly routing probability for four of the regions was modeled separately at each junction the best approximating meta regression model for each of the four regions and four junctions was selected using akaike information criterion with small sample bias adjustment aicc burnham and anderson 2002 we used the r package mixmeta gasparrini et al 2012 sera et al 2019 and r statistical software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 to conduct meta analyses where we used the logit survival or routing probability from the hatchery studies as the response the environmental variables as covariates and standard error from the hatchery studies as the estimate for standard error to estimate survival and entrainment at the cvp facility region 5 we used estimates from release recapture experiments of acoustically tagged juvenile chinook salmon conducted at the tracy fish collection facility tfcf fig 1 in march and may 2013 karp et al 2017 karp et al 2017 evaluated smolt sized salmon 105 mm fl entrainment and subsequent survival in front of and within the tfcf under a range of normal facility flows during a drought year the months chosen for testing were when wild juvenile salmonids were typically entrained by the water pumps karp et al 2017 in general there tends to be an increase in facility salvage efficiency as the number of pumps in operation at the c w bill jones pumping plant jpp increases from one to five we used the data in karp et al 2017 to refit models relating the number of pumps operating to the capture and survival at the cvp facility using logistic regression this prevented the estimated probabilities from being less than zero and greater than one as could occur with the linear regression equations reported in karp et al 2017 2 3 decision support simulation model development we used the results of the survival routing and entrainment meta analysis and estimates based on published research to develop a quantitative chinook salmon smolt survival and routing simulation model for the south delta the model operates on a daily time step and tracks the number of user specified smolts that start at durham ferry and ends at chipps island fish survive from durham ferry to hor region 1 as a function of average daily flow and water temperature at the usgs vernalis stream gage and the effect of fish size table 1 fish size was added to all survival models as a constant based on perry et al 2018 at hor surviving fish remain in the san joaquin river as a function of whether there is a barrier horb in place average daily flow at vernalis and their interaction table 1 fish remaining in the san joaquin river travel down to turner cut region 2 and survive as a function of average daily flow at vernalis and fish length table 1 at turner cut fish remain in the san joaquin river as a function of average daily flow at the usgs stockton stream gage table 1 the survival of fish remaining in the san joaquin river to chipps island region 3 is a function of average daily water temperature at the usgs prisoner s point stream gage and fish size table 1 at hor fish that enter old river travel down toward the export facilities region 4 and survive as a function of average daily water temperature at vernalis and fish size table 1 entrainment at the cvp facility was a function of the number of water pumps operating table 1 survival of entrained fish at the cvp that were then trucked to chipps island region 5 was modeled as a function of the number of water pumps operating fish that were not entrained at the cvp facility could then be entrained at the swp facility as a function of average daily water exports table 1 the survival of these swp entrained fish that were salvaged and trucked to the end point at chipps island region 6 was a constant 13 25 as estimated by gingras 1997 the survival of fish to chipps island that entered the interior via the old river and were not entrained in the cvp or swp facilities or that entered the interior delta via turner cut on their way to chipps island region 7 was modeled as a constant 1 table 1 based on observations of acoustically tagged salmon having very poor survival in this region sjrga 2011 2013 smolt survival is often related to size sogard 1997 perry et al 2018 sturrock et al 2020 however we did not have data specifically for chinook salmon outmigrating through the south delta in winter spring thus we used the fork length fl survival relationship from perry et al 2018 from hatchery fish outmigrating through the north delta from release sites in the sacramento river in december and january to link fish size to survival probability although smolts were from a different run age basin were released earlier and fl at the time of tagging was smaller in the acoustic telemetry studies 80 140 mm 2014 x 98 9 mm to 2013 x 115 3 mm buchanan et al 2020 than those used in perry et al 2018 140 mm fl the fl survival relationship likely holds true across varying scenarios r perry personal communication 2021 2 4 decision support simulation model inputs we developed three regression models to be able to link daily environmental inputs upstream to environmental variables downstream that are associated with routing and survival probabilities to use as inputs in the decision support simulation model fig 2 this allowed us to create inputs for variables known to affect survival and routing from the meta analysis that are related to user specified upstream inputs we included environmental variables that are typically included by water managers in central valley hydrologic simulation models to show how these models can be integrated with biological models in the future klipsch and hurst 2007 specifically we developed the first regression model for estimating average flow at stockton as a function of flow at vernalis and freeport minimum tide swp and cvp water exports and their interactions table 2 we developed a second regression model for estimating water temperature at prisoner s point as a function of flow at vernalis and freeport air temperature and the quadratic effect of air temperature at prisoner s point and the interaction of flow at vernalis and air temperature at prisoner s point lastly we developed a regression model to estimate water temperature at vernalis as a function of flow at vernalis and freeport air temperature and the quadratic effect of air temperature at vernalis and the interaction of flow and air temperature at vernalis in the vernalis temperature model we included freeport flows that do not reach vernalis because it is plausible that freeport flows could be a possible mechanism due to regional weather patterns coordinated reservoir releases in the sacramento and san joaquin rivers or a possible external mechanism that is correlated with freeport flows that we did not capture with our other covariates such as negative flows maximum tides etc we used aicc burnham and anderson 2002 and akaike weights wi to identify the best predicting model water managers use sacramento river flows to model conditions in the delta as part of regular water management operations however to justify using sacramento river flows in stockton flow and prisoner s point temperature models i e locations on the san joaquin river we evaluated the predictive ability of our model by estimating the out of sample error we therefore completed 500 iterations of 10 fold cross validation breiman and spector 1992 on the stockton and prisoners point models with and without freeport flows in the model the out of sample predictive accuracy as measured by the root mean squared error rmse mean across iterations was 20 6 and 35 5 for stockton discharge models with and without freeport discharge respectively similarly rmse of the prisoners point temperatures was 1 95 and 2 07 with and without freeport discharge respectively in fact the expected error in the discharge model is 42 lower and temperature 6 lower when freeport flows are included thus we chose to use the more accurate flow and temperature models that included freeport we developed the three regression models using daily air temperature at national weather service stations at modesto airport ghcnd usw00023258 at vernalis and stockton ghcnd usw00023237 at prisoners point and average daily flow at the usgs stream gages at vernalis and freeport for 2008 2018 we log transformed freeport and vernalis flow square root transformed swp exports and transformed minimum tide at stockton with the formula log minimum tide 1 for use in the regression models we used the r package mumin barton 2020 and r statistical software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 to conduct model selection and develop model selection tables we did not use correlated environmental variables r 0 7 in the same models moore and mccabe 2005 we report candidate models within aicc wi 10 of the model with the largest weight to evaluate strength of evidence royall 1997 and provide estimates from the top model if the top model had aicc wi 0 8 we used fish monitoring data collected by the mossdale trawl 2012 2020 usfws 2020 to estimate the mean and standard deviation for daily fl of smolts entering the south delta from february 1 through may 30 we also used the mossdale trawl data to estimate the proportion of the entire outmigration over the study period of chinook salmon smolts that passed through vernalis located near durham ferry fish release site each day hearn et al 2014 munsch et al 2019 the mossdale trawl samples open water habitats and avoids shallow edge habitats and is therefore more efficient at collecting larger smolts and much less efficient at collecting smaller rearing fry mahardja et al 2021 consequently few juveniles of fry size are captured in february and march in addition early emigrating fry survival is relatively low for fry rearing in the south delta sturrock et al 2020 nobriga et al 2021 thus our south delta model likely underestimates the effects of delta flows on smaller fry sized fish we used a generalized additive model gam r package mgcv wood 2017 with the smooth term knots 10 to model the proportion of smolts entering the south delta each day from mossdale trawl mean daily and total fish numbers the resulting function i e smooth terms 10 had a relatively high coefficient of determination p 0 0001 r 2 0 61 because the proportion of fish entering the delta each day across the migration window must sum to one we normalized the predicted values from the gam to sum to one when using these values in the simulation model although survival and routing estimates were from telemetry experiments conducted from april and may we wanted to assess flow optimization across the entire period when smolts could be outmigrating including february and march limm and marchetti 2009 merz et al 2013 zeug et al 2014 to avoid making predictions using covariate data outside the range of the data used to develop the model we constrained environmental variables within the range of values used in the meta analysis during the simulations described below supplement 2 we used measured mean daily flow and mean daily temperature at the same usgs stream gages to quantify mean daily flows in february may for each water year type existing managed flow regimes on the san joaquin river through vernalis are partly determined from decision 1641 d 1641 state water resources control board 2000 which was implemented in 1999 before studies relating chinook salmon survival to flows were initiated supplement 3 d 1641 defines minimum flow targets and any extra water available beyond that minimum is available for flow pulses or for reshaping the hydrograph in particular for a given volume of water available use of the upper rather than lower minimum flow objective results in having less extra water available to allocate to flow pulses these flow targets have been used to shape flows and determine the biological opinion and conference opinion on the long term operations of the cvp and swp nmfs 2009 the biological assessment for the california water fix nmfs 2016 and the biological opinion on long term operation of the central valley project and the swp nmfs 2019 for the purposes of demonstrating our model we chose to use the upper and lower d 1641 flow targets at vernalis to calculate the volume of water available at vernalis for a given water year type supplement 3 in recent years the spring pulse typically april 15 may 15 has been shaped to maximize flow variability zeug et al 2014 inundate floodplains for rearing habitat and manage water temperatures 2 5 simulation optimization procedure we wanted to determine the optimal flow regime for chinook salmon smolts outmigrating through the south delta in late winter through late spring the d 1641 targets are set for minimum flows from february through june with a specified flow pulse to occur april 15 to may 15 and vary by water year type supplement 3 using the flow rate targets we calculated total volume of water available using average daily flow rate m3s 1 as a substitute for volume from february through may by water year type by multiplying the rate by the number of days in the simulation 119 we partitioned this period into seventeen one week periods and distributed the total volume of water available for each period after subtracting the amount needed to maintain established minimum flows according to d 1641 supplement 3 we determined optimal distributions of water above minimum flows among these weekly periods using a simulation optimization approach conroy and peterson 2013 the objective was to maximize the number of smolts that survived to chipps island constraints were needed to ensure that only 100 of the available volume of water was used over the simulation time period thus we used nonlinear optimization with constraints to solve this problem parameters and model inputs were drawn from statistical distributions as described below and the optimal distribution of water was estimated this simulation optimization process was repeated 10 000 times and the mean water distribution for the seventeen one week time periods was calculated we initiated simulations with 500 000 juvenile salmon at durham ferry that were randomly distributed across the 17 weeks using a multinomial distribution with probability of emigrating derived from the normalized gam predicted values from the mossdale trawl we ran all comparisons with horb 0 no barrier because the physical barrier is no longer used we checked for convergence on all solver solutions and plotted mean flow with 95 confidence intervals for 17 weeks from february through may all optimization procedures were conducted using r package nlcoptim chen and yin 2019 and r statistical software version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 briefly this package solves optimization problems with nonlinear constraints and nonlinear objective functions based on the augmented lagrange multiplier method for problems with parameters in the form of a matrix see chen 2016 we included stochasticity in the simulation optimization procedure average daily inputs for air temperature at prisoner s point and vernalis were sampled from a normal distribution and were based on average daily air temperatures from february through may with a mean monthly standard deviation from the 1999 2020 data 1 0 0 319 sd for prisoner s point and vernalis respectively minimum tides are cyclic do not vary with water year type and follow the same trend year after year therefore we used a randomly chosen year 2013 to represent the cyclic nature of the minimum tide and accounted for variation with an overall mean daily standard deviation from years 2008 2018 daily inputs for average flow at freeport cvp water exports and swp water exports do vary with water year type so we derived these environmental variables from the mean and standard deviations from 1999 to 2020 data by water year type values were sampled from a gamma distribution each day by converting their respective mean and standard deviation to shape and scale parameters using r package connmattools kaplan 2020 fl was also sampled from a gamma distribution accounting for more variation in the data day 89 i e march 30 and less variation day 89 variability in the proportion of smolts outmigrating was sampled from a multinomial distribution with probabilities of outmigration as described above parameter estimates of survival and routing probabilities were sampled from a normal distribution using the residual errors as the random effects in water resource management system dynamics cannot be completely controlled by management due to external drivers e g precipitation that affect the ability to implement management actions as planned this is known as partial controllability conroy and peterson 2013 thus in practice managers recalculate flow releases each month from february june that alter the volume of water available for flow management from what was initially predicted we included 20 variation on the lower and upper minimum and pulse targets from the d 1641 table using a uniform distribution to evaluate the effects of partial controllability on the optimal flow distribution in the south delta 2 6 hindcast scenarios we also used our decision support simulation model to compare the outcome of flow decisions in previous years with model optimized flow for this exercise we used measured environmental data i e flows temperatures water exports etc rather than predicted values from our regression models for the 119 day period from february may 2010 2013 and 2016 2018 we omitted 2014 2015 because the measured environmental data were incomplete due to a lack of data for many days in most years a separate distribution for fish fl and proportion of fish entering the south delta for each year was not possible thus we used the mean distribution of fish and fl for inputs as described previously we used measured vernalis total flows from february through may and assumed the april may pulse targets by water year type from d 1641 to calculate the minimum flow and the amount of water available to pulse for each year we omitted two of the critical and dry years 2012 2016 that did not have enough water for upper minimum flow targets because our aim was to evaluate managed flow releases in excess of minimum flow thresholds we then conducted year specific simulation optimization procedures detailed above to determine the optimal flow regime for that year constraining the amount of water available to equal the observed values we also used the routing and survival model to predict the cumulative survival of fish reaching chipps island under the observed flow and temperature regimes as measured at the gages and under the optimal flow regime using observed water temperatures and the flows at freeport we also compared our modeled total survival to chipps island to estimated total survival reported in the annual reports to determine how reliable our modeled survival under the observed conditions was 2 7 sensitivity analysis and value of information we used one way sensitivity analysis to identify the simulation model parameters i e intercepts and slopes from the meta regression analysis and model inputs i e developed from environmental variables that had the greatest influence on estimated smolt survival from durham ferry to chipps island conroy and peterson 2013 using the lower target from the below normal water year type water availability and minimum flows supplement 3 we varied the values of parameters and inputs throughout their 95 confidence intervals one at a time while keeping the other values unchanged and reran the optimization procedure 10 000 times for the survival and routing probability parameters we varied the parameters from the 5th percentile to the 95th percentile of a normal distribution by increments of 5 for the parameters without estimates of variability e g standard errors from regression parameters we varied the parameter 50 of the mean value by 5 increments to represent the variability we found in parameters with estimates of variability i e a mean difference from their 95 confidence intervals of 51 14 4 sd peterson and duarte 2020 for example for the survival intercept 0 1325 for the swp export facilities i e region 6 we used a lower bound of 0 06625 and an upper bound of 0 19875 for environmental inputs to the model we varied the values from the 10 000 simulations of the below normal water year type from the 5th to 95th percentile of a normal distribution by 5 increments we then recorded the estimated total number of smolts surviving through the south delta and plotted minimum i e 5th percentile and maximum survival i e 95th percentile in a tornado diagram to examine the sensitivity of the model predictions to both parameters and inputs conroy and peterson 2013 we included both intercepts and slopes because they have different interpretations for example the slope is the relationship between the survival or routing parameter and the environmental variable and indicates if the environmental variable itself is important in the model and the intercept is the mean of the survival or routing value at a chosen value of environmental variable and indicates if the survival or routing parameter is influential therefore sensitivity analysis of both intercepts and slopes should be important to managers in addition to the one way sensitivity analysis we conducted a response profile sensitivity analysis and calculated the expected value of perfect information evpi calculating evpi was a slow process therefore to illustrate the methodology we calculated evpi of the parameters most influential to survival as indicated by the one way sensitivity analysis a response profile sensitivity analysis differs from a one way sensitivity analysis in that the focus is to evaluate how the optimal decision changes across a range of parameter values conroy and peterson 2013 here we used the results from the one way sensitivity analysis of varying the parameters one at a time between the 5th and 95th percentile by 5 increments from the 10 000 iterations of the simulation optimization as described above we plotted these nineteen flow regimes to evaluate how the distribution of water varied with the parameter we estimated the relative value of improving knowledge of the top four parameters by calculating the expected value of perfect information evpi conroy and peterson 2013 the evpi is the expected increase in a decision maker s objective i e proportion of smolts surviving to chipps island if the uncertainty regarding a parameter value were completely eliminated 3 results 3 1 model fitting the meta analysis of survival and routing probabilities was based on 16 24 hatchery fish releases from 2008 to 2015 table 1 meta analysis indicated survival probability progressively declined downstream from durham ferry to hor 0 66 0 03 hor to turner cut 0 26 0 04 hor to cvp 0 22 0 07 and turner cut to chipps island 0 06 0 06 probability of fish staying in sjr at hor was lower 0 57 0 04 than at turner cut 0 85 0 07 we compared various meta analysis models with san joaquin river flows and temperatures for explaining smolt survival and routing through four of the regions for which we had enough data model selection results indicated that survival from durham ferry to the hor region 1 was positively related to average daily flow at vernalis whereas it was negatively related to water temperature at vernalis supplement 4 table 1 and fig 1 survival from hor to turner cut region 2 also was positively related to average daily flow at vernalis survival from turner cut to chipps island region 3 was negatively related to average daily temperature at prisoner s point and survival from hor to cvp region 4 was negatively related to average daily temperature at vernalis supplement 4 table 1 and fig 1 the probability of remaining in the san joaquin river at hor was positively related to the presence of the hor barrier average daily flow from vernalis and an interaction between the two supplement 4 table 1 and fig 2 the probability of fish remaining in the san joaquin river at turner cut was negatively related to average daily flow at stockton supplement 4 table 1 and fig 2 the probability of fish becoming entrained at swp was positively related to swp exports table 1 the mossdale trawl analyses were based on from 1 059 fish in 2019 to 6 334 fish caught in 2013 mean 3 324 1 sd 1 859 2 the daily proportion of smolts entering the south delta had two peaks indicating few outmigrants in february march and had a bimodal trend of smolt outmigration with peaks in mid april and mid may fig 3 a fork length represented earlier migrations of smaller fish in february and march and later migrations of larger fish in april and may fig 3b model selection indicated regression models for predicting model inputs downstream had many variables and complex interactions supplement 5 and had high adjusted r 2 i e 0 90 0 92 indicating good predictive ability table 2 none of the transformed variables used in the downstream input regression models were correlated at r 0 7 3 2 simulated optimal flow regimes in the simulated water year examples the optimal flow regime for smolts differed among water year types e g critical wet but all had patterns consisting of two periods of pulsed flows that coincided with peak outmigration through the south delta one in april and one in may with a much bigger pulse allocated to may fig 4 aside from the critical water year type february march and april air temperatures were similar among water year types while the critical year type was warmer in all months table 3 may monthly air temperatures at vernalis and prisoner s point were generally higher for the drier water year types than wetter water year types table 3 in critical dry below normal and above normal water years when water was available to pulse it was optimal to allocate extra water i e when going from the lower to upper target about equally to the april and may peak outmigration periods fig 4 as minimum flows and available pulse water increase in wet water years the strategy again was to pulse most of the water in may but when moving from the lower to the upper target more water was distributed to the trailing end of peak migration through the south delta in may smolts predicted by the model to have survived through the south delta with optimal pulsing of water varied substantially among water years and was five times higher in wet years 0 13 0 040 than critical years 0 026 0 017 3 3 hindcasting the optimal flow regimes calculated using historical water availability and temperatures were similar to our water year specific optimization with two large pulses of water that coincided with the two outmigration peaks in april and may fig 5 however in most water years except 2016 dry water year the highest optimal pulse coincided with the peak in april outmigrating fish with a lower optimal pulse corresponding with the beginning of the peak of may outmigrating fish fig 5 in 2016 the largest pulse was allocated for may outmigrating fish this may be related to the fact that 2016 had the highest average daily water temperature at prisoner s point and among the lowest average daily flows at stockton in april during that time period supplement 6a and b the main difference between observed flows and simulated hindcast optimal flows was that simulated pulses were allocated when the largest proportion of smolts were estimated to be migrating through the south delta during april and may in contrast the observed flows were distributed more evenly over a longer time frame and do not correspond well with estimated peak migrations through the south delta in general more smolts were predicted to survive to the ocean by saving more water to pulse in april when fish are outmigrating through the south delta as opposed to having a higher minimum flow fig 5 as opposed to the simulations based on inputs from the previous section small hindcast pulses are allocated to february this is likely due to the measured temperature inputs being allowed 15 c whereas we imposed constraints on temperature in february and march for the simulations based on inputs due to our model being based on hatchery fish survival studies from april and may where temperatures did not go below 15 c our simulation model suggests that optimizing flows can increase cumulative survival through the south delta in this example predicted survival with optimal hindcast flows was on average 1 3 times greater than under the observed flows and temperatures fig 5 the difference in cumulative survival between hindcast and optimal flows was lowest for the dry and critical water years survival under optimal 1 1 65 times greater s increase 0 0 015 that had the least amount of water available to manage interestingly the differences in cumulative survival between the optimal and observed regimes were greatest for the below and above normal water years optimal 1 47 1 67 times greater s increase 0 027 0 035 and not the wet years optimal 1 22 1 31 greater s increase 0 08 these counterintuitive non linear results may have been difficult to verify without an optimization model for three years for which we had total survival estimates from the hatchery fish releases from mossdale to chipps island and we had enough environmental data to run the survival optimization model to make comparisons 2010 2012 2013 our survival estimates were exactly the same as in the reports sjrga 2011 2013 buchanan et al 2016 indicating our optimization model reliably estimates smolt survival through the south delta for a range of water year types 3 4 sensitivity analysis and value of information the one way sensitivity analysis indicated that the simulation model estimates were most sensitive to survival parameters particularly the effect of temperature on survival fig 6 in contrast the routing parameters were much less influential as were the parameters related to the cvp and swp the four most influential parameters on estimated smolt survival through the south delta were survival from hor to the cvp facility intercept and temperature at vernalis and survival from turner cut to chipps island intercept and temperature at prisoner s point fig 6 export parameters were generally insensitive between the 5th to 95th percentiles fig 6 model inputs were much less influential than model parameters on juvenile survival of the model inputs the most influential on survival were flows at freeport and air temperature at prisoner s point and vernalis fig 6 response profile analysis of the top four parameter slope estimates indicated the hydrographs would generally keep the same shape throughout the range of the 5th to 95th percentile of a normal distribution by increments of 5 with only a re distribution of water over the april and may pulses fig 7 with lower values of the survival model intercepts and vernalis temperature parameter estimates water would be allocated to the april pulse and with larger values of the parameter slope estimates water would be allocated to the interval after the usual may peak pulse with water in the most extreme upper ends of the parameter ci being allocated to the intervals between the april and may pulses for turner cut to chipps island parameter estimates any change in the parameter estimates results in redistribution of water within the may peak the evpi for all parameters was similar averaging 0 038 overall survival fig 7 this suggests that reducing uncertainty of these parameters would improve flow management such that it would result in up to 1 57 times greater juvenile survival in below normal water years using the lower target mean under uncertainty 0 051 compared to mean with perfect information 0 089 4 discussion it is commonly thought that one of the major impediments to developing management strategies through quantitative modeling is the paucity of data on the linkages between habitat modification and biological responses pringle et al 2000 arthington et al 2006 murchie et al 2008 brown and bauer 2010 in our case study we were able to synthesize a large number of disconnected south delta studies and incorporate meta analysis techniques to develop a decision support simulation model to link managed flows i e habitat modifications to chinook salmon smolt survival and movement i e biological responses we then solved the model using optimization and evaluated the relative effect of uncertainty on management objectives in our case smolt survival through the south delta to be able to demonstrate how models like these can be used to prioritize future research and monitoring efforts given the inherent limitations of any decision support simulation model such tools will never be a replacement for human decision makers particularly where real world management strategies frequently must address economic or social considerations not just biological outcomes undeniably these tools are often best used to identify general patterns that may then be translated into real world management rulesets and provide hypotheses for directed studies to test predicted benefits a management ruleset for smolts gleaned from our case study is to allocate increased flows in may when larger smolts are entering the south delta furthermore when more water is available for flow pulses the optimal strategy is to spread the additional water to adjacent intervals after peak water pulses interestingly even in very low water years the model suggests it is optimal to have large pulses in may when most smolts are entering the south delta decision support simulation models can provide insights into management tradeoffs that may be counterintuitive when not formally integrating information from disparate sources peterson and duarte 2020 for example results of our simulation modeling indicate pulses allocated in april do not follow a smooth progression from critical to wet years but that in below normal years it is more beneficial to allocate most of the water above the minimum target to may another example is that our results consistently support a flow pulse in may when water temperatures can be lethal to salmon kjelson et al 1982 smith et al 2003 perry et al 2010 2018 vogel 2010 cavallo et al 2013 lehman et al 2017 buchanan et al 2018a 2018b but flow pulses at this time are generally discouraged by managers however the potential for elevated flows to decrease water temperatures enough to increase chinook salmon smolt survival in the south delta in may has yet to be formally evaluated largely because of resistance to releasing the amount of water necessary to achieve temperature reduction in the various regions of the south delta our results suggest that implementing flow pulses in may has the potential to increase survival of later migrating larger smolts if true this management strategy may provide a longer window in which successful outmigration is possible which could minimize competition decrease predation risk and promote diverse life history strategies munsch et al 2019 sturrock et al 2020 similar to other analyses of the south delta acoustic tagging studies partially relied upon in our model dauble et al 2010 we found no negative effect of exports on salmon smolts this suggests elevated river flows can benefit smolt survival even if water diversions from the south delta are increased which further supports implementing pulse flows during may an adaptive resource management framework could be used to pair the implementation of increased flows in may with physical modeling and strategic monitoring to evaluate hypotheses on how flows temperature and diversions affect juvenile survival during this time period it should be noted that survival studies that informed our optimization modeling are limited in their temporal scope april and may and life history stage smolt only relative to the entire period chinook salmon are in the south delta additionally we only used the timing of chinook salmon smolts entering the delta while there is some evidence that the proportion of juveniles migrating as fry parr or smolts is linked with hydrology brandes and mclain 2001 zeug et al 2014 adding dynamic entry timing based on flow pulses and life history stages and integrating new survival studies may change the optimal pulse strategy suggested by our example application thus it would be worthwhile to evaluate management rulesets similar to that suggested by the decision support simulation model through adaptive resource management for example one could incorporate a sub model that predicts the proportion of fry parr and smolt emigrating through the south delta as a function of flow we would then update our understanding of system dynamics with the revised parameter estimates to make better management decisions each year based on monitoring or directed research deciding how to allocate resources among management monitoring and research efforts can be difficult even in some of the most well funded management programs using decision analysis techniques we can leverage existing information to evaluate the influence of various uncertainties using a common currency typically the currency of the management objective s in our example we found the temperature survival relationships from turner cut to chipps island and from hor to cvp had the largest influence on cumulative smolt survival through the south delta specifically we found the expected cumulative smolt survival increased by up to 1 57 times for below normal water year types by improving flow management due to reduced uncertainty in smolt survival estimates from these two regions using evpi in other words improved management of below normal water year flows made possible by reducing uncertainty in our parameter estimates is expected to result in a cumulative smolt survival similar to an above normal water year under uncertainty this would be equivalent to having more than twice as much water for target minimum flows i e moving from 40 2 m3s 1 to 96 8 m3s 1 and 1 5 times more water to pulse i e 5964 m3s 1 in an above normal water year vs 3925 m3s 1 in a below normal water year thus reducing uncertainty in these parameters might mean managers can maximize the biological objective in this case cumulative smolt survival to the same degree for less water potentially leaving more water that can be used for other objectives if survival is already at an acceptable level e g floodplain rearing habitat uncertainties can be used to design future modeling efforts in our smolt example the sensitivity analyses indicated the interval for preferred flow pulses i e april and may was invariant to changes in either slopes or intercepts of the parameters with the largest uncertainties but matched with smolt outmigration patterns through the south delta this indicates resources may potentially be wasted attempting to reduce uncertainty in meta regression parameters linked to survival and routing if this knowledge does not change the predicted optimal action the finding that the optimal intervals for flow pulses matches outmigration patterns suggests that a better understanding of the timing of smolt migration through the south delta may be needed to inform flow management in this region as the smolt arrival timing monitoring data came with limitations such as missing data biased detection rates and high variation in estimates future monitoring efforts should focus on the variation in smolt timing to evaluate the robustness of the management rulesets that seem to be emerging with the current model had the pulse interval changed with varying the parameters with the largest uncertainties i e survival intercept for turner cut to chipps island and slope with prisoner s point temperature managers would then consider trying to reduce the uncertainty in both the survival estimate and the effect of temperature on that survival estimate the intercept and residual error for that matter may include factors important to survival that we didn t account for in this model so determining where those sources of uncertainty in the intercept occur as well as the slope would both be important in this alternate case although the hydrographs were invariant to change in survival and routing parameters with the largest range of survival outcomes in this model varying the temperature parameter values at vernalis for survival from durham ferry to head of old river allowed us to see that survival includes zero in the range of survival outcomes a risk averse manager may be more concerned with the uncertainty that includes zero smolts surviving than an uncertainty that spans somewhat low and very high survival i e temperature survival relationships from turner cut to chipps island and from hor to cvp satisfying the apprehensions of a risk averse manager to encourage them to implement an alternative but potentially beneficial strategy could mean we redefine the objective to minimizing survival to be less than a certain value e g 0 025 as opposed to maximizing survival in addition the effects of temperature at vernalis on survival from durham ferry to hor as a priority in the monitoring framework could be added into the same adaptive management plan suggested previously for learning how increased pulses in may affect juvenile survival as this parameter had high uncertainty in how it would affect survival narrowing that uncertainty through additional research would be helpful for assuring the risk averse manager the new management has low probability of a zero survival result incorporating objectives for risk aversion can be done easily at the beginning of a structured approach to the decision making process conroy and peterson 2013 managing ecological systems can be difficult particularly when some of the factors influencing the decision are outside of the decision maker s control this partial controllability can sometimes deter managers from using decision support simulation models because it can be viewed that the system is too complex to model in our example we demonstrated how uncertainty in seasonal amounts of water availability can be incorporated directly into decision support simulation models that link hydrological flow and ecological response models this allowed the model to be solved using optimization while accounting for the real world uncertainty in seasonal water availability still it is often the case that the projected water amounts are updated in near real time as the season progresses state water resources control board 2000 thus a natural extension of this case study would be to incorporate an adaptive in season flow management plan that uses migrating fish capture data e g trawl or rotary screw trap data the newly predicted amount of water available e g water year type and temperature trends to feed into the decision support simulation model and inform within season flow management using the most up to date information the call for more data rather than using what data are available to develop decision support simulation models and evaluate tradeoffs in management actions as we did likely stems from biologists and managers knowing the limitations of their data and wanting to avoid using biased information to inform decisions for example our flow analysis incorporated meta analysis of survival and routing of tagged hatchery raised smolts which likely have reduced survival when compared to natural origin smolts del real 2012 additionally we used a size survival relationship from smolts from a different basin timing and life stage which while positive may have a different effect size furthermore the acoustic tagging studies were observational and did not occur when temperatures were lower than 15 5 c and when average daily flows were 175 275 m3s 1 environmental conditions that exist during the smolt outmigration window but for which we do not have tagging data although we certainly agree that not all monitoring data are collected in a way that makes them suitable to inform decision making it is worth noting that all ecological data are compromised to some extent and that this does not mean they do not provide useful information that is imperfect data do not prevent effective evaluation of tradeoffs in management actions when uncertainty in a particular parameter does not influence the management objective biologists and managers need not be as concerned with the related data limitation for example we were able to evaluate the effect of parametric uncertainty on the management objective in a transparent way one parameter included in our model cvp entrainment may have had increased uncertainty because we only had estimates from releases within one year karp et al 2017 however we did not find much of an effect of varying this parameter through its confidence interval on survival we also found varying the parameters with the most uncertainty did not change how water volume would be distributed on the other hand if uncertainty in a particular set of parameters governs which decision is most effective e g optimal flows were to change from april and may to february and march this would highlight the parameter s that managers and biologists would benefit most from in reducing uncertainty the south delta optimization model we developed could be built upon for general use by water managers for example an application could be made for managers to explicitly evaluate which management knobs to turn relative to their expected outcome and cost in the south delta the main knobs available to managers include changing the ratio of water imports into the delta e g via dam manipulations to water exports via the cvp or swp export facilities forgoing water exports reshaping the hydrograph of available water increasing flows to reduce temperatures and restoring more historical habitats that favor native over non native species some of these factors affect rearing habitat and therefore survival before emigrating fish even reach the south delta therefore adding upstream tributary sub models would incorporate optimizing flows for the varying portfolios of fry parr and smolts important for diversifying outmigration strategies sturrock et al 2020 in an upstream tributary sub model the weekly time step used in our south delta model could be adapted to a daily time step to account for flow variability that cues fry outmigration from natal tributaries zeug et al 2014 sturrock et al 2020 the results from our south delta smolt model are directly related to the management objective we considered i e optimizing cumulative survival of smolts through the south delta managers must manage the system for other sometimes competing biological objectives such as the number of adult fish that return to spawn fry outmigration floodplain rearing habitat other species of concern such as steelhead trout salinity and dissolved oxygen luoma et al 2015 horne et al 2018 peterson and duarte 2020 these objectives are relatively easy to incorporate into our modeling framework using multi criteria decision analysis horne et al 2018 such an effort would probably be best implemented within a structured decision making process where complicated problems are broken down into discrete steps through a series of stakeholder driven workshops conroy and peterson 2013 horne et al 2018 5 conclusions as the human population grows and the climate becomes warmer conserving wild populations that depend on water will require a more focused level of commitment technical effort and investment in conservation lackey et al 2006 naiman et al 2008 hanak et al 2011 katz et al 2012 luoma et al 2015 we suggest using tools and data that we currently have to help solve complex problems despite far from perfect knowledge about how systems will respond webb et al 2018 we demonstrated how to use advanced decision analytic modeling techniques to provide the direct link between monitoring optimization modeling and management using chinook salmon smolts in the south delta as an example we were able to use less than perfect long term monitoring data on chinook salmon smolt survival and routing to develop an optimization model to predict salmon smolt survival based on environmental covariates we then used the optimization modeling to determine flow hydrographs that optimize chinook salmon smolt survival through the south delta for varying water year types we were also able to identify future monitoring priorities based on sensitivity analysis this type of decision support framework can be used for a wide array of conservation problems throughout the world to link biological responses to management alternatives via an adaptive process

potato harvest area according to the results the average yp was 67 3 t ha 1 and actual yield ya was 30 t ha 1 therefore the average tuber yield gap was 37 3 t ha 1 these results indicate that the potato producers achieved 45 of the potential yield in iran iranian farmers produced 5 million tons of potato from about 164 000 ha if they can obtain only 80 of yp 53 8 t ha 1 amount of potato production will be 8 8 million tones as result they can produce 5 2 million tons tuber yield of potato in 97 000 ha cultivation area thus with closing yield gap and increasing potato production it is possible to decrease potato lands keywords actual yield harvest area map environmental factors potential yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iran is the 12th potato producing country in the world s ranking and is the fourth biggest producer in asia after china india and bangladesh fao 2019 iranian farmers produced 4 92 million tons of potato with an average yield of 30 t ha 1 faostat 2019 demand for potatoes in iran is expected to increase by 2030 due to the economic growth and changing diet razzaghi et al 2017 currently potato production in iran cannot meet the domestic demand driven by increasing potato consumption sci 2016 closing yield gap is a strong approach which can help to supply potato to the growing population stuart et al 2016 the importance of yield gap analysis has been well documented in the literature as it provides a criterion of untapped food production capacity van wart et al 2013 yield gap yg is determined as the difference between yp potential yield the yield of a given crop cultivar grown without water and nutrient limitations and biotic stresses or yw water limited yield potential and ya farmers average yield in a given region kassiea et al 2014 van ittersum and cassman 2013 binder et al 2008 estimating yp and yg can help recognize the situation of current farmers yield relative to yp and the possible yield increase in the future lobell 2013 hochman et al 2016 various methodologies have been proposed to calculate potential yield and yield gap the methods for benchmarking yields and identifying yield gaps are presented through a number of case studies grouped into four approaches covering a range of applications first where actual levels of yield can be compared with attainable yields 80 of yp there can be an immediate benefit to increase farm yield second analysis of actual yields against environmental drivers provides insight into management possibilities to increase yield third crop models when used to provide independent benchmarks for potential and water limited yield can be extrapolated to areas of limited data availability as it is currently the case for developing countries where the largest increases in food demand will occur fourth large scale comparisons made by combining actual yield data with model estimates and remotely sensed information of crops and environment can inform about priority assessments and policy planning at regional and national scales sadras et al 2015 van ittersum and cassman 2013 reported that in this approach the crop simulation models are the most powerful tool to estimate yp because the crop simulation models consider interactive effects of genotype environmental factors management g e m also for estimating the yield gap on a large scale van ittersum et al 2013 outlined the global yield gap atlas gyga protocol based on the locally relevant and credible assessment of the world s major crops in the gyga protocol the national yield gap is estimated using a climate zoning scheme van wart et al 2013 to group similar climatic zones the so called bottom up method so far various studies have been conducted using this protocol in different countries gobbett et al 2017 using gyga protocol showed that wheat production in australia takes place at 6 main climatic regions they selected 22 reference weather stations rws in these regions and calculated water limited yield potential using apsim model for the years 1996 to 2010 their results showed that the yield gap of wheat in australia was about 2 ton ha 1 and the relative yield actual yield to yield potential multiplied by 100 was about 47 espe et al 2016 selected 14 weather stations to investigate rice yield gap in the united states which covered 87 of rice fields of the country they estimated the yield potential for each climatic zone using oryza model according to gyga protocol for a 13 to 15 year period and demonstrated that the yield potential varies from 11 5 to 14 5 ton ha 1 whereas yield gap with the assumption of reaching 85 of yield potential ranged from 1 1 to 3 5 ton ha merlos et al 2015 estimated the yield potential of maize 11 6 ton ha 1 wheat 5 2 ton ha 1 and soybean 3 9 ton ha 1 in argentina using the ceres maize model the ceres wheat model and the cropgro soybean model respectively they also reported the yield gap of soybean maize and wheat at 1 3 4 8 and 1 2 ton ha 1 respectively they also reported a yield gap equal to1 3 4 8 and 2 1 ton ha 1 for soybean maize and wheat respectively nehbandani et al 2020 using gyga protocol reported that soybean production in iran takes place at 9 main climatic regions they selected 9 reference weather stations rws in these regions and calculated yield potential using ssm icrop2 soltani and sinclair 2012 soltani et al 2020 for the years 2005 to 2014 their results showed a yp of 4681 kg ha while actual yield ya was around 2257 kg ha and the yg was estimated the 2425 kg ha in another study using the ssm icrop2 model based on the gyga protocol potential yield and yield gap of irrigated wheat in iran was estimated at 8 8 and 5 4 ton ha 1 respectively zahed et al 2019 several studies using the gyga protocol have estimated crops yield gap such as wheat hochman et al 2016 rice espe et al 2016 maize liu et al 2017 in australia the usa and china respectively the estimation of the yield gap and potential production of potato is lacking across any major potato producing regions in iran therefore the aims of this study are a defining the size of the potato yield gap in main potato producing regions in iran b assessing the additional production by decreasing the yield gap on available potato harvested area and c evaluating decrease in potato cultivated area without decreases in production d evaluating the relationship between potential yield and effective environmental factors 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the ssm icrop2 model runs to simulate yp based on crop traits weather data daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and precipitation soil information and management options within rws on the basis of the gyga protocol the model uses several sub models to simulate the growth and yield in the crop phenology sub model the occurrence of phenological stages is simulated with temperature unit thermal time or temperature sum the phenological stages are emergence beginning of tuber growth termination of tuber growth physiological maturity and harvest maturity phenological stages simulated based on cumulative temperature units adjusted by water deficit if any development rate is influenced by daily temperature experienced by the crop in range of cardinal temperatures soltani and sinclair 2012 chapters 6 and 15 changes in leaf area index lai under non water limited and water limited conditions is simulated as given in soltani and sinclair 2012 chapter 9 is based on cumulative temperature unit and crop allometry but is modified for water deficit stress a common exponential regression function is used to describe lai expansion as a function of normalized temperature unit williams et al 1989 soltani et al 1999 this function has been used in the epic williams et al 1989 and swat models arnold et al 2012 dry matter production tuber production is simulated on the basis of radiation interception and radiation use efficiency rue water deficit stress and atmospheric co2 concentration are affected dry matter production soltani and sinclair 2012 chapter 10 dry matter distribution between vegetative tissues leaf stem tuber and dry matter re translocation later in the growing season allow estimation of harvestable yield tuber soltani and sinclair 2012 chapter 11 in the current model tuber formation is simulated based on the linear increase in harvest index concept which requires the slope of the harvest index increase versus time during the tuber formation period spaeth and sinclair 1985 a soltani et al 2013 the soil water balance and crop responses to soil water deficit and excess in the model are described by soltani and sinclair 2012 chapters 13 14 and 15 briefly the soil profile is consisted of a top layer usually 15 to 20 cm deep and a second layer that includes the first layer plus the soil depth occupied by roots the soil water balance of the two layers is calculated separately the entrance water result from precipitation irrigation and increasing rooting depth the existence water includes deep drainage run off soil evaporation and plant transpiration 2 2 the global yield gap atlas protocol the gyga protocol estimates the regional and national yield gap based on locally observed data using a bottom up methodology the protocol details guidelines for designation of major climate zones czs referred to as designated climate zones dcz and then for the designation of rwss within dczs using a climate zonation scheme to classify agro climatically similar regions for analysis of yield gap each climate zone is identified by a particular combination of growing degree days aridity index and temperature seasonality van wart et al 2013 for buffers around the rwss a zone with a given radius around the rws yp is simulated using a parameterized and evaluated crop model under a given local agronomic and soil information and also ya within the buffer is obtained from reliable survey data gobbett et al 2017 both yp and ya are first estimated at the rws scale and then scaled up from rwss to dcz and from dczs to a national scale using cropland regions weighted averages van bussel et al 2015 an important principle is the use of the local data and information with high quality grassini et al 2015a 2 3 climate zones and land use climatic condition for growing potato is different in the geographic regions of iran the geographic regions with similar climatic conditions are classified by the gyga protocol as climate zones czs by gis software the gyga developed a spatial framework for combination of cz and soil water storage capacity to support crop growth by delineating technology extrapolation domains gyga teds that is useful to transfer technology in crop production systems within a gyga ted the crop and soil management options would perform similarly because biophysical conditions for crop growth are sufficiently homogeneous hence the extrapolation domain for field research evaluating crop and soil management options or comprising different cropping systems conducted at a given location can be spatially determine by the gyga ted https www yieldgap org web guest cz ted the gyga climate zoning scheme is constructed from three climatic variables temperature unit tu temperature seasonality ts an annual aridity index ai the values of annual tu range from 0 to more than 9856 there are 9 classes from 0 to 9000 with an interval of 1000 for tu values of 0 to 9850 and a class 10 000 for tu values more than 9856 the ai is the ratio of mean annual precipitation to the mean annual potential evapotranspiration multiplied by 1000 the values of ai range from 0 to more than 12 877 there are 9 classes from 0 to 800 with an interval of 100 for ai values of 0 to 12 876 and a class 900 for ai values more than 12 877 ts is calculated as the standard deviation of the 12 mean monthly temperatures 100 the mean monthly temperatures are in c 10 ts has 2 classes for ai values of 0 to 8355 and a class for more than 8356 in general the higher tu class is indicated the warmer zone the higher ts class is indicated a zone with the higher temperature fluctuations during the year and the higher ai class is indicated the wetter zone the climate zones are indicated by a 4 digit code xxxx indicating zone climatic condition using these three variables values for instance code 4103 indicates that the tu is in the class 4000 with value of 3792 4829 ai in the class 100 2696 3893 and ts in the class 3 fig 1 see more details in https www yieldgap org cz ted spatial information on crop growing areas land use is needed to assess yield gap spatial production allocation model spam produces a global map for crop growing areas in year 2000 with 8 3 km pixel size you et al 2014 gobbett et al 2017 the spam dataset could not estimate well the total irrigated potato areas in iran we modified the spam dataset for accurate estimation based on the ministry of agriculture information about potato growing areas during 2014 to 2016 for each township fig 2 in the modified version pixel size is approximately 8 3 km the spam dataset was modified for canada from 0 to 18 iraq from 0 to 50 nepal from 0 to 50 india from 50 to 80 south africa from 0 to 85 turkey from 0 to 50 and thailand from 0 to 50 2 4 reference weather stations for selecting rwss in potato growing areas buffer zones were drawn on the weather stations layer with 100 km radius around the each rws the buffers were clipped at the boundary of the climate zones by gis software van wart et al 2013 eventually 35 rwss were selected which had at least 1 potato growing area of total national potato growing area table 1 these rwss covered approximately 83 of total national potato growing area for yg analysis in a scale larger than the rws it is necessary to determine dczs according to the gyga protocol czs with more than 5 crop growing area of total national crop growing area were selected as dczs in this study dczs were included the climate of selected rwss and also the climate with more than 1 potato growing area but without rws therefore dczs covered approximately 94 of total national potato growing area 2 5 soil information soil information was obtained from ifpri harvest choice as indicated in table 2 koo and dimes 2010 according to the gyga protocol soil types are chosen based on the coverage of potato growing area within rws buffer zone a soil that covers at least 50 of the potato growing area within the buffer zone is selected as dominant soil if there is no dominant soil type within rws the soils with more than 10 coverage of potato growing area within rws are selected as dominant soils 2 6 agronomic management we simulated yp for a late maturity potato cultivar with a growth period of 150 days to simulate the potential yield under irrigated cultivation model needs planting date input potato planting dates are varied throughout iran due to the diverse climate condition in general in cold regions planting is taken during spring but in warm season the planting is done in autumn therefore planting date was considered from 90 to 160th day of the year for cold regions and from 270 to 340th day of the year for warm regions 2 7 actual yield potential yield and yield gap for yg analysis on the national scale it should be obtained ya and yp in rwss buffer zone dczs and on the national scale the gyga protocol normally prefers to estimate yg by difference between average ya and yp across a 10 year period which often has stable climatic conditions grassini et al 2015 in this study it was found a significant and positive trend for estimated ya across a 10 year period 2006 2015 due to technological improvement so for estimating ya the last 5 year period was just chosen fig 3 the gyga protocol shows that ya values should be derived from administrative units that are within the rws buffer zones and where multiple administrative units place within an rws buffer a weighted average based on the crop area should be calculated eventually the values of ya for rwss were obtained based on the weighted average of annual ya for the 5 year period the yp was simulated over a 10 year period 2006 2015 using the ssm icrop2 model for combinations of soil and crop management for a buffer zone around rwss with a radius of 100 km across a 10 year period both yp and ya are estimated at the rws scale and then scaled up from rwss to dcz and from dczs to the national scale using cropland area weighted averages van bussel et al 2015 the ssm icrop2 model had previously been parameterized and evaluated for the simulation of potato growth and development simulation by dadrasi et al 2020 the evaluation results indicated that values of r rmse and cv for simulated tuber yield versus observed tuber yield were 0 80 543 g m 2 and 14 respectively 2 8 environmental factors in the present study the effect of environmental factors on the ya yp and yg was considered the value of environmental factors such as solar radiation srad maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin from the sowing to physiological maturity period in dczs was calculated based on a weighted average the same as what used for upscaling yields the relationship between potential yield and environmental factors were statistically analyzed using regression method in sas software sas institute inc 2013 in addition the boxplot was used to indicate variation in potential yield sowing date and environmental factors among different simulation years for each dcz 3 results 3 1 potato crop area the total potato cultivated area in iran is 164 000 ha fig 2 the 35 rws buffer zones were covered 83 of the national potato cultivated area while selected 15 dczs for estimating the tuber yield gap covered 94 of the total potato cultivated area the selection of rwss within czs was based on coverage of more than 1 of the national potato cultivated area but dczs have included the cultivated area of selected rwss in each dcz and cultivated area more than 1 but without rws coverage the highest potato cultivated area with an average of 23 45 equals 38 576 hectares was related to the cz 4003 with 9 rwss it seems that this climate zone is more suitable for planting potatoes than other climates the highest potato cultivated area with an average of 9 8 equals 16 178 ha was related to rws 23 sarein which located in the climate zone 3103 and the lowest potato cultivated area with an average 0 6 equals 942 hectares was related to the rws 3 which located in cz 5002 table 3 3 2 actual yield the actual yield on the national scale was estimated at 30 t ha 1 fig 4 the actual yield on cz 3103 4003 4102 4103 and 5103 was higher than the actual yield on the national scale these czs are located in relatively cool to temperate regions the actual yield was lower on other czs located in temperate to warm regions compared to the national scale fig 4 among the dczs the highest actual yield was related to cz 3103 with an average of 36 3 t ha 1 in which 3 rwss were located climate zone 3103 is a climate with cold winters and hot summers where potato is grown in the summer with high solar radiation the lowest actual yield with an average of 18 5 t ha 1 was in the cz 7003 with only one rws this climate zone has mild winters and very hot summers in these areas potato is grown in autumn and winter with low solar radiation during the growing season comparing the actual yield estimated through the gyga protocol between 2011 and 2015 with the actual yield reported by the ministry of agriculture shows that the gyga protocol is accurate to estimate product yield gaps fig 5 3 3 potential yield potential yield is the maximum simulated yield in a given environment under the optimum management condition on the national scale the potential yield is estimated at 67 3 t ha 1 fig 6 the range of potential yield changes between dczs from 46 3 t ha 1 in the cz 7003 up to 78 1 t ha 1 in the dcz 5003 fig 6 the dczs between 3102 and 6102 except for the dcz 5002 had higher potential yield compared to the national scale the potential yield in dczs 6102 to 8003 was lower compared to the national scale an exact investigation showed the potential yield was higher in the western central and northwestern regions compared to southwestern northeastern and southern regions due to relatively colder climate by comparing the dczs with high actual and potential yield as well as the climate with low actual and potential yield it can be concluded that the dcz 7003 is an unsuitable area for potato cultivation so that both yields were low while dczs 5003 and 4002 have ideal conditions for potato production however they have low actual yield indicating poor management in these areas 3 4 yield gap yield gap on the national scale was estimated at 37 3 t ha 1 fig 8 among dczs the range of yield gap is between 23 9 t ha 1 from dcz 8002 to 51 6 in the dcz 4002 in the dcz 8002 the actual yield is 26 7 t ha 1 fig 4 and the potential yield is 50 6 t ha 1 fig 6 which shows that farmers obtain relatively good yields in this region the actual yields which obtained by farmers in dcz 4002 and is 24 7 t ha 1 and the potential yield is 76 4 t ha 1 indicating a considerable difference between actual and potential yield due to poor crop management in potato production fig 7 the results showed that the dczs 3102 4002 4003 5002 5003 and 5103 have a yield gap equal or larger compared to the national scale while in other dczs the amount of yield gaps is lower compared to the national scale 3 5 relative yield the relative yield represents a fraction of the potential yield that farmers can achieve on the national scale the relative yield is 45 indicating that farmers have achieved only 45 of the potential yield among the dczs the highest relative yield 53 was related to the dcz 8003 which also had a lower yield gap the lowest relative yield 32 was related to the dcz 4002 fig 8 in some dczs the range of relative yield variations ranged from 35 to 48 with the exception for dczs 3103 4102 4103 8002 in which relative yield was greater than 50 in the first three dcz cultivation is taken in summer and the actual and potential yields are high but in the dcz 8002 the environmental factors for achieving high potential yield are unsuitable but farmers produce relatively acceptable yields in among the dczs 3103 4102 4103 5103 7002 8002 and 8003 have a higher relative yield compared to the national scale due to the high cultivated area the dcz 4003 has a relative yield equal to the relative yield on the national scale also dczs 3102 4002 5002 5003 6102 6202 and 7003 have lower relative yield compared to the national relative yield fig 8 3 6 relationship between potential yield and environmental factors the results showed that potential yield increased with increasing srad in deferent stages of potato growing season fig 6 it was found a linear relationship between yp and srad from sowing to maturity with r2 0 70 it can be concluded that tuber yield increases by modifying the sowing date and selecting the suitable dczs which have the highest received solar radiation during growing season the results also showed that there was a linear relationship between maximum temperature tmin minimum temperature tmax and average temperature tmean during growing season with yp the results of regression analysis showed that tmax has a greater impact on the yp r2 0 45 fig 9 in order to identify the susceptible climate condition with high potential yield for potato it s necessary to evaluate the trend of tuber potential yield in dczs as a box plot for ten years the value of each box plot in the dczs is based on obtained results from the selected reference weather stations in each climate fig 8a shows the trend of potential yield in different dczs these results indicated that the highest and lowest yp was obtained from dczs 5003 and 7003 respectively in areas with warm or very warm summers and mild winters dczs 6102 6202 7002 7003 8002 8003 potato is sown in autumn but in areas with cold or very cold winters dczs 3102 3103 4002 4003 4102 4103 5002 5003 5103 it is sown in spring due to srad and tmax higher during spring sown potato growing season in cold areas fig 12b c and d this showed that potential yield in spring sowing date is higher compared to autumn sowing date due to receiving high srad and tu during the growing season in spring cropping areas 4 discussion in different parts of the world the yield gap between potential and actual yield for different crops is about 20 to 80 percent lobel et al 2013 in general weeds viral diseases universal diseases and pests reduce the actual yield amount 8 10 13 and 7 percent respectively and it causes the difference between potential and actual yields huber 2010 there is no impressive study about determining the tuber yield gap of potato at the national level in iran in potato production processes proper fertilizer use timely control of pests diseases and weeds and soil conditions have been identified as the most important factors in creating the difference between potential and actual yield huber 2010 according to the available information and expert reports in iran there are other factors which reduce the tuber yield in potato including fungi viruses prokaryotes and nematodes this damage was estimated at more than 4000 kg ha which equals 3 2 million dollars per years sepahvand et al 2008 additionally environmental factors solar radiation temperature and precipitation edaphic and management factors are effective on growth and yield of potato quantifying the impacts of these factors on potato production in different regions by crop modeling can helped to better understand of the factors impact on tuber yield and yield gap in different regions carli et al 2014 as shown in figure 12 difference in climatic conditions in the studied climates was the main reason of different potential yield factors affecting potential yield are determined by climatic and genetic factors in the model such as temperature radiation and rainfall therefore based on the model outputs the relationships between potential yield and climatic parameters were investigated the results show that there is a significant linear relationship r2 0 704 between potential yield and radiation from planting to physiological maturity figs 10 and 11 regarding to the relationship between mean minimum and maximum temperature during growth period with potential yield the existence of a linear relationship between these three parameters with potential yield was turned out however among those three parameters the relationship between maximum temperature during growth period with r 0 45 had the highest explanation coefficient which demonstrates that temperatures between 20 and 33 c has provided better growth condition for crops considerable point spotted in figure 12 was the different potential yield in warm climate zones cultivation is conducted across fall in these areas and cold areas cultivation is conducted across spring in these areas which has experienced less receiving radiation and maximum temperature during their growth time as well as observed in figure 12d in climate code 3102 to 5103 potato cultivation is conducted in spring however in climate code 6102 to 8003 8003 potato are cultivated through fall december and january which had less potential yield due to less cloudiness decline in radiation and lower maximum temperature during growth time in this regard numerous studies that verify these results among which some will be pointed out in the following based on the results of this study the difference in climate zones of iran can explain the yield gap for example in the dczs 6102 to 8003 tmaxt and srad are limiting factors for increase of tuber yield another reason is that iranian farmers focused on just one region for potato production hamedan province with 23 of production in the country which however has not a high potential yield based on table 5 in this region yp is 67 t ha 1 whereas ya is 34 t ha 1 hence by determining the best cultivation pattern we can obtain the highest ya for the whole country based on several reported by farmers and researchers the most important factors limiting ya in iran were poor seed quality poor soil health lack inappropriate use of fertilizers soil amendments sub optimum use of lime low yielding varieties farmers knowledge poor timing of operation lack of access to market as incentive and too much and persistent clouds in addition there are several reports about crop management being a potato yield limiting factor by svubure et al 2015 schulte geldermann 2013 thomas sharma et al 2016 however there are several approaches to reduce the yield gap of potato in iran conditions which are especially effective when these strategies are part of a holistic approach these strategies include use of clean potato seed removal of wilted and or volunteer plants pathogen free soil appropriate crop rotation systems with non host plant species negative positive selection techniques and other agronomic practices other perceived drivers are listed above for better management in the farming gobet et al 2016 showed that wheat fields in australia are located in 6 main climatic zones they selected 22 reference weather stations in these areas and calculated the potential yield under rainfed conditions for the years from 1996 to 2010 using the apsim model his results showed that the potential yield was about 3 6 ton ha on the national scale espi et al 2016 selected 14 weather stations which covered 87 of us rice fields they estimated the potential yield in each climate using the oryza model for 15 years they also reported that the potential yield ranged from 11 5 to 14 5 t ha 1 5 conclusions based on the gyga protocol fifteen czs selected as dczs for analysis covered 94 of the total potato crop area and 35 rws buffer zones covered 83 of the national potato crop area on the national scale ya and yp were 30 0 t ha 1 and 67 3 t ha 1 respectively the average tuber yield gap was 37 3 t ha 1 these results indicated that the farmers achieved 45 of the potential yield in iran meanwhile investigation of the climate factors indicated that the relationship between potential yield yp and sradt is a linear dependency with a r2 value of 0 81 the relationship between maximum temperature tmin minimum temperature tmax and average temperature tmean and yp were also increased but the highest r2 0 45 was related to relationship between yp and tmax also the highest and lowest yp were obtained from the 5003 and 7003 czs respectively in areas with warm or very warm summers and mild winters gyga ed climate 6102 6202 7002 7003 8002 8003 potato is sown in autumn but in areas with cold or very cold winters gyga ed climate 3102 3103 4002 4003 4102 4103 5002 5003 5103 it is sown in spring than sradt tmaxt and potential yields are higher in spring sown potato in cold areas

24393,understanding yield potential yp and yield gap yg in current intensive potato solanum tuberosum l production is essential to meet future food demand with the limited resources evaluating yield gap is a strong approach to estimate maximum production potential when all factors are in the best condition a complete estimation of yield gap and potential yield across all major potato producing regions in iran is lacking the global yield gap atlas gyga protocol was used to estimate potential yield of potato in iran this protocol is based on the climatic zones czs and the reference weather stations rws buffer zones soil types in each buffer zone thirty five rws buffer zones in potato producing regions were selected and total potato area in the rws buffer zones covered 83 of the whole potato harvest area according to the results the average yp was 67 3 t ha 1 and actual yield ya was 30 t ha 1 therefore the average tuber yield gap was 37 3 t ha 1 these results indicate that the potato producers achieved 45 of the potential yield in iran iranian farmers produced 5 million tons of potato from about 164 000 ha if they can obtain only 80 of yp 53 8 t ha 1 amount of potato production will be 8 8 million tones as result they can produce 5 2 million tons tuber yield of potato in 97 000 ha cultivation area thus with closing yield gap and increasing potato production it is possible to decrease potato lands keywords actual yield harvest area map environmental factors potential yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iran is the 12th

yield in a given region kassiea et al 2014 van ittersum and cassman 2013 binder et al 2008 estimating yp and yg can help recognize the situation of current farmers yield relative to yp and the possible yield increase in the future lobell 2013 hochman et al 2016 various methodologies have been proposed to calculate potential yield and yield gap the methods for benchmarking yields and identifying yield gaps are presented through a number of case studies grouped into four approaches covering a range of applications first where actual levels of yield can be compared with attainable yields 80 of yp there can be an immediate benefit to increase farm yield second analysis of actual yields against environmental drivers provides insight into management possibilities to increase yield third crop models when used to provide independent benchmarks for potential and water limited yield can be extrapolated to areas of limited data availability as it is currently the case for developing countries where the largest increases in food demand will occur fourth large scale comparisons made by combining actual yield data with model estimates and remotely sensed information of crops and environment can inform about priority assessments and policy planning at regional and national scales sadras et al 2015 van ittersum and cassman 2013 reported that in this approach the crop simulation models are the most powerful tool to estimate yp because the crop simulation models consider interactive effects of genotype environmental factors management g e m also for estimating the yield gap on a large scale van ittersum et al 2013 outlined the global yield gap atlas gyga protocol based on the locally relevant and credible assessment of the world s major crops in the gyga protocol the national yield gap is estimated using a climate zoning scheme van wart et al 2013 to group similar climatic zones the so called bottom up method so far various studies have been conducted using this protocol in different countries gobbett et al 2017 using gyga protocol showed that wheat production in australia takes place at 6 main climatic regions they selected 22 reference weather stations rws in these regions and calculated water limited yield potential using apsim model for the years 1996 to 2010 their results showed that the yield gap of wheat in australia was about 2 ton ha 1 and the relative yield actual yield to yield potential multiplied by 100 was about 47 espe et al 2016 selected 14 weather stations to investigate rice yield gap in the united states which covered 87 of rice fields of the country they estimated the yield potential for each climatic zone using oryza model according to gyga protocol for a 13 to 15 year period and demonstrated that the yield potential varies from 11 5 to 14 5 ton ha 1 whereas yield gap with the assumption of reaching 85 of yield potential ranged from 1 1 to 3 5 ton ha merlos et al 2015 estimated the yield potential of maize 11 6 ton ha 1 wheat 5 2 ton ha 1 and soybean 3 9 ton ha 1 in argentina using the ceres maize model the ceres wheat model and the cropgro soybean model respectively they also reported the yield gap of soybean maize and wheat at 1 3 4 8 and 1 2 ton ha 1 respectively they also reported a yield gap equal to1 3 4 8 and 2 1 ton ha 1 for soybean maize and wheat respectively nehbandani et al 2020 using gyga protocol reported that soybean production in iran takes place at 9 main climatic regions they selected 9 reference weather stations rws in these regions and calculated yield potential using ssm icrop2 soltani and sinclair 2012 soltani et al 2020 for the years 2005 to 2014 their results showed a yp of 4681 kg ha while actual yield ya was around 2257 kg ha and the yg was estimated the 2425 kg ha in another study using the ssm icrop2 model based on the gyga protocol potential yield and yield gap of irrigated wheat in iran was estimated at 8 8 and 5 4 ton ha 1 respectively zahed et al 2019 several studies using the gyga protocol have estimated crops yield gap such as wheat hochman et al 2016 rice espe et al 2016 maize liu et al 2017 in australia the usa and china respectively the estimation of the yield gap and potential production of potato is lacking across any major potato producing regions in iran therefore the aims of this study are a defining the size of the potato yield gap in main potato producing regions in iran b assessing the additional production by decreasing the yield gap on available potato harvested area and c evaluating decrease in potato cultivated area without decreases in production d evaluating the relationship between potential yield and effective environmental factors 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the ssm icrop2 model runs to simulate yp based on crop traits weather data daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and precipitation soil information and management options within rws on the basis of the gyga protocol the model uses several sub models to simulate the growth and yield in the crop phenology sub model the occurrence of phenological stages is simulated with temperature unit thermal time or temperature sum the phenological stages are emergence beginning of tuber growth termination of tuber growth physiological maturity and harvest maturity phenological stages simulated based on cumulative temperature units adjusted by water deficit if any development rate is influenced by daily temperature experienced by the crop in range of cardinal temperatures soltani and sinclair 2012 chapters 6 and 15 changes in leaf area index lai under non water limited and water limited conditions is simulated as given in soltani and sinclair 2012 chapter 9 is based on cumulative temperature unit and crop allometry but is modified for water deficit stress a common exponential regression function is used to describe lai expansion as a function of normalized temperature unit williams et al 1989 soltani et al 1999 this function has been used in the epic williams et al 1989 and swat models arnold et al 2012 dry matter production tuber production is simulated on the basis of radiation interception and radiation use efficiency rue water deficit stress and atmospheric co2 concentration are affected dry matter production soltani and sinclair 2012 chapter 10 dry matter distribution between vegetative tissues leaf stem tuber and dry matter re translocation later in the growing season allow estimation of harvestable yield tuber soltani and sinclair 2012 chapter 11 in the current model tuber formation is simulated based on the linear increase in harvest index concept which requires the slope of the harvest index increase versus time during the tuber formation period spaeth and sinclair 1985 a soltani et al 2013 the soil water balance and crop responses to soil water deficit and excess in the model are described by soltani and sinclair 2012 chapters 13 14 and 15 briefly the soil profile is consisted of a top layer usually 15 to 20 cm deep and a second layer that includes the first layer plus the soil depth occupied by roots the soil water balance of the two layers is calculated separately the entrance water result from precipitation irrigation and increasing rooting depth the existence water includes deep drainage run off soil evaporation and plant transpiration 2 2 the global yield gap atlas protocol the gyga protocol estimates the regional and national yield gap based on locally observed data using a bottom up methodology the protocol details guidelines for designation of major climate zones czs referred to as designated climate zones dcz and then for the designation of rwss within dczs using a climate zonation scheme to classify agro climatically similar regions for analysis of yield gap each climate zone is identified by a particular combination of growing degree days aridity index and temperature seasonality van wart et al 2013 for buffers around the rwss a zone with a given radius around the rws yp is simulated using a parameterized and evaluated crop model under a given local agronomic and soil information and also ya within the buffer is obtained from reliable survey data gobbett et al 2017 both yp and ya are first estimated at the rws scale and then scaled up from rwss to dcz and from dczs to a national scale using cropland regions weighted averages van bussel et al 2015 an important principle is the use of the local data and information with high quality grassini et al 2015a 2 3 climate zones and land use climatic condition for growing potato is different in the geographic regions of iran the geographic regions with similar climatic conditions are classified by the gyga protocol as climate zones czs by gis software the gyga developed a spatial framework for combination of cz and soil water storage capacity to support crop growth by delineating technology extrapolation domains gyga teds that is useful to transfer technology in crop production systems within a gyga ted the crop and soil management options would perform similarly because biophysical conditions for crop growth are sufficiently homogeneous hence the extrapolation domain for field research evaluating crop and soil management options or comprising different cropping systems conducted at a given location can be spatially determine by the gyga ted https www yieldgap org web guest cz ted the gyga climate zoning scheme is constructed from three climatic variables temperature unit tu temperature seasonality ts an annual aridity index ai the values of annual tu range from 0 to more than 9856 there are 9 classes from 0 to 9000 with an interval of 1000 for tu values of 0 to 9850 and a class 10 000 for tu values more than 9856 the ai is the ratio of mean annual precipitation to the mean annual potential evapotranspiration multiplied by 1000 the values of ai range from 0 to more than 12 877 there are 9 classes from 0 to 800 with an interval of 100 for ai values of 0 to 12 876 and a class 900 for ai values more than 12 877 ts is calculated as the standard deviation of the 12 mean monthly temperatures 100 the mean monthly temperatures are in c 10 ts has 2 classes for ai values of 0 to 8355 and a class for more than 8356 in general the higher tu class is indicated the warmer zone the higher ts class is indicated a zone with the higher temperature fluctuations during the year and the higher ai class is indicated the wetter zone the climate zones are indicated by a 4 digit code xxxx indicating zone climatic condition using these three variables values for instance code 4103 indicates that the tu is in the class 4000 with value of 3792 4829 ai in the class 100 2696 3893 and ts in the class 3 fig 1 see more details in https www yieldgap org cz ted spatial information on crop growing areas land use is needed to assess yield gap spatial production allocation model spam produces a global map for crop growing areas in year 2000 with 8 3 km pixel size you et al 2014 gobbett et al 2017 the spam dataset could not estimate well the total irrigated potato areas in iran we modified the spam dataset for accurate estimation based on the ministry of agriculture information about potato growing areas during 2014 to 2016 for each township fig 2 in the modified version pixel size is approximately 8 3 km the spam dataset was modified for canada from 0 to 18 iraq from 0 to 50 nepal from 0 to 50 india from 50 to 80 south africa from 0 to 85 turkey from 0 to 50 and thailand from 0 to 50 2 4 reference weather stations for selecting rwss in potato growing areas buffer zones were drawn on the weather stations layer with 100 km radius around the each rws the buffers were clipped at the boundary of the climate zones by gis software van wart et al 2013 eventually 35 rwss were selected which had at least 1 potato growing area of total national potato growing area table 1 these rwss covered approximately 83 of total national potato growing area for yg analysis in a scale larger than the rws it is necessary to determine dczs according to the gyga protocol czs with more than 5 crop growing area of total national crop growing area were selected as dczs in this study dczs were included the climate of selected rwss and also the climate with more than 1 potato growing area but without rws therefore dczs covered approximately 94 of total national potato growing area 2 5 soil information soil information was obtained from ifpri harvest choice as indicated in table 2 koo and dimes 2010 according to the gyga protocol soil types are chosen based on the coverage of potato growing area within rws buffer zone a soil that covers at least 50 of the potato growing area within the buffer zone is selected as dominant soil if there is no dominant soil type within rws the soils with more than 10 coverage of potato growing area within rws are selected as dominant soils 2 6 agronomic management we simulated yp for a late maturity potato cultivar with a growth period of 150 days to simulate the potential yield under irrigated cultivation model needs planting date input potato planting dates are varied throughout iran due to the diverse climate condition in general in cold regions planting is taken during spring but in warm season the planting is done in autumn therefore planting date was considered from 90 to 160th day of the year for cold regions and from 270 to 340th day of the year for warm regions 2 7 actual yield potential yield and yield gap for yg analysis on the national scale it should be obtained ya and yp in rwss buffer zone dczs and on the national scale the gyga protocol normally prefers to estimate yg by difference between average ya and yp across a 10 year period which often has stable climatic conditions grassini et al 2015 in this study it was found a significant and positive trend for estimated ya across a 10 year period 2006 2015 due to technological improvement so for estimating ya the last 5 year period was just chosen fig 3 the gyga protocol shows that ya values should be derived from administrative units that are within the rws buffer zones and where multiple administrative units place within an rws buffer a weighted average based on the crop area should be calculated eventually the values of ya for rwss were obtained based on the weighted average of annual ya for the 5 year period the yp was simulated over a 10 year period 2006 2015 using the ssm icrop2 model for combinations of soil and crop management for a buffer zone around rwss with a radius of 100 km across a 10 year period both yp and ya are estimated at the rws scale and then scaled up from rwss to dcz and from dczs to the national scale using cropland area weighted averages van bussel et al 2015 the ssm icrop2 model had previously been parameterized and evaluated for the simulation of potato growth and development simulation by dadrasi et al 2020 the evaluation results indicated that values of r rmse and cv for simulated tuber yield versus observed tuber yield were 0 80 543 g m 2 and 14 respectively 2 8 environmental factors in the present study the effect of environmental factors on the ya yp and yg was considered the value of environmental factors such as solar radiation srad maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin from the sowing to physiological maturity period in dczs was calculated based on a weighted average the same as what used for upscaling yields the relationship between potential yield and environmental factors were statistically analyzed using regression method in sas software sas institute inc 2013 in addition the boxplot was used to indicate variation in potential yield sowing date and environmental factors among different simulation years for each dcz 3 results 3 1 potato crop area the total potato cultivated area in iran is 164 000 ha fig 2 the 35 rws buffer zones were covered 83 of the national potato cultivated area while selected 15 dczs for estimating the tuber yield gap covered 94 of the total potato cultivated area the selection of rwss within czs was based on coverage of more than 1 of the national potato cultivated area but dczs have included the cultivated area of selected rwss in each dcz and cultivated area more than 1 but without rws coverage the highest potato cultivated area with an average of 23 45 equals 38 576 hectares was related to the cz 4003 with 9 rwss it seems that this climate zone is more suitable for planting potatoes than other climates the highest potato cultivated area with an average of 9 8 equals 16 178 ha was related to rws 23 sarein which located in the climate zone 3103 and the lowest potato cultivated area with an average 0 6 equals 942 hectares was related to the rws 3 which located in cz 5002 table 3 3 2 actual yield the actual yield on the national scale was estimated at 30 t ha 1 fig 4 the actual yield on cz 3103 4003 4102 4103 and 5103 was higher than the actual yield on the national scale these czs are located in relatively cool to temperate regions the actual yield was lower on other czs located in temperate to warm regions compared to the national scale fig 4 among the dczs the highest actual yield was related to cz 3103 with an average of 36 3 t ha 1 in which 3 rwss were located climate zone 3103 is a climate with cold winters and hot summers where potato is grown in the summer with high solar radiation the lowest actual yield with an average of 18 5 t ha 1 was in the cz 7003 with only one rws this climate zone has mild winters and very hot summers in these areas potato is grown in autumn and winter with low solar radiation during the growing season comparing the actual yield estimated through the gyga protocol between 2011 and 2015 with the actual yield reported by the ministry of agriculture shows that the gyga protocol is accurate to estimate product yield gaps fig 5 3 3 potential yield potential yield is the maximum simulated yield in a given environment under the optimum management condition on the national scale the potential yield is estimated at 67 3 t ha 1 fig 6 the range of potential yield changes between dczs from 46 3 t ha 1 in the cz 7003 up to 78 1 t ha 1 in the dcz 5003 fig 6 the dczs between 3102 and 6102 except for the dcz 5002 had higher potential yield compared to the national scale the potential yield in dczs 6102 to 8003 was lower compared to the national scale an exact investigation showed the potential yield was higher in the western central and northwestern regions compared to southwestern northeastern and southern regions due to relatively colder climate by comparing the dczs with high actual and potential yield as well as the climate with low actual and potential yield it can be concluded that the dcz 7003 is an unsuitable area for potato cultivation so that both yields were low while dczs 5003 and 4002 have ideal conditions for potato production however they have low actual yield indicating poor management in these areas 3 4 yield gap yield gap on the national scale was estimated at 37 3 t ha 1 fig 8 among dczs the range of yield gap is between 23 9 t ha 1 from dcz 8002 to 51 6 in the dcz 4002 in the dcz 8002 the actual yield is 26 7 t ha 1 fig 4 and the potential yield is 50 6 t ha 1 fig 6 which shows that farmers obtain relatively good yields in this region the actual yields which obtained by farmers in dcz 4002 and is 24 7 t ha 1 and the potential yield is 76 4 t ha 1 indicating a considerable difference between actual and potential yield due to poor crop management in potato production fig 7 the results showed that the dczs 3102 4002 4003 5002 5003 and 5103 have a yield gap equal or larger compared to the national scale while in other dczs the amount of yield gaps is lower compared to the national scale 3 5 relative yield the relative yield represents a fraction of the potential yield that farmers can achieve on the national scale the relative yield is 45 indicating that farmers have achieved only 45 of the potential yield among the dczs the highest relative yield 53 was related to the dcz 8003 which also had a lower yield gap the lowest relative yield 32 was related to the dcz 4002 fig 8 in some dczs the range of relative yield variations ranged from 35 to 48 with the exception for dczs 3103 4102 4103 8002 in which relative yield was greater than 50 in the first three dcz cultivation is taken in summer and the actual and potential yields are high but in the dcz 8002 the environmental factors for achieving high potential yield are unsuitable but farmers produce relatively acceptable yields in among the dczs 3103 4102 4103 5103 7002 8002 and 8003 have a higher relative yield compared to the national scale due to the high cultivated area the dcz 4003 has a relative yield equal to the relative yield on the national scale also dczs 3102 4002 5002 5003 6102 6202 and 7003 have lower relative yield compared to the national relative yield fig 8 3 6 relationship between potential yield and environmental factors the results showed that potential yield increased with increasing srad in deferent stages of potato growing season fig 6 it was found a linear relationship between yp and srad from sowing to maturity with r2 0 70 it can be concluded that tuber yield increases by modifying the sowing date and selecting the suitable dczs which have the highest received solar radiation during growing season the results also showed that there was a linear relationship between maximum temperature tmin minimum temperature tmax and average temperature tmean during growing season with yp the results of regression analysis showed that tmax has a greater impact on the yp r2 0 45 fig 9 in order to identify the susceptible climate condition with high potential yield for potato it s necessary to evaluate the trend of tuber potential yield in dczs as a box plot for ten years the value of each box plot in the dczs is based on obtained results from the selected reference weather stations in each climate fig 8a shows the trend of potential yield in different dczs these results indicated that the highest and lowest yp was obtained from dczs 5003 and 7003 respectively in areas with warm or very warm summers and mild winters dczs 6102 6202 7002 7003 8002 8003 potato is sown in autumn but in areas with cold or very cold winters dczs 3102 3103 4002 4003 4102 4103 5002 5003 5103 it is sown in spring due to srad and tmax higher during spring sown potato growing season in cold areas fig 12b c and d this showed that potential yield in spring sowing date is higher compared to autumn sowing date due to receiving high srad and tu during the growing season in spring cropping areas 4 discussion in different parts of the world the yield gap between potential and actual yield for different crops is about 20 to 80 percent lobel et al 2013 in general weeds viral diseases universal diseases and pests reduce the actual yield amount 8 10 13 and 7 percent respectively and it causes the difference between potential and actual yields huber 2010 there is no impressive study about determining the tuber yield gap of potato at the national level in iran in potato production processes proper fertilizer use timely control of pests diseases and weeds and soil conditions have been identified as the most important factors in creating the difference between potential and actual yield huber 2010 according to the available information and expert reports in iran there are other factors which reduce the tuber yield in potato including fungi viruses prokaryotes and nematodes this damage was estimated at more than 4000 kg ha which equals 3 2 million dollars per years sepahvand et al 2008 additionally environmental factors solar radiation temperature and precipitation edaphic and management factors are effective on growth and yield of potato quantifying the impacts of these factors on potato production in different regions by crop modeling can helped to better understand of the factors impact on tuber yield and yield gap in different regions carli et al 2014 as shown in figure 12 difference in climatic conditions in the studied climates was the main reason of different potential yield factors affecting potential yield are determined by climatic and genetic factors in the model such as temperature radiation and rainfall therefore based on the model outputs the relationships between potential yield and climatic parameters were investigated the results show that there is a significant linear relationship r2 0 704 between potential yield and radiation from planting to physiological maturity figs 10 and 11 regarding to the relationship between mean minimum and maximum temperature during growth period with potential yield the existence of a linear relationship between these three parameters with potential yield was turned out however among those three parameters the relationship between maximum temperature during growth period with r 0 45 had the highest explanation coefficient which demonstrates that temperatures between 20 and 33 c has provided better growth condition for crops considerable point spotted in figure 12 was the different potential yield in warm climate zones cultivation is conducted across fall in these areas and cold areas cultivation is conducted across spring in these areas which has experienced less receiving radiation and maximum temperature during their growth time as well as observed in figure 12d in climate code 3102 to 5103 potato cultivation is conducted in spring however in climate code 6102 to 8003 8003 potato are cultivated through fall december and january which had less potential yield due to less cloudiness decline in radiation and lower maximum temperature during growth time in this regard numerous studies that verify these results among which some will be pointed out in the following based on the results of this study the difference in climate zones of iran can explain the yield gap for example in the dczs 6102 to 8003 tmaxt and srad are limiting factors for increase of tuber yield another reason is that iranian farmers focused on just one region for potato production hamedan province with 23 of production in the country which however has not a high potential yield based on table 5 in this region yp is 67 t ha 1 whereas ya is 34 t ha 1 hence by determining the best cultivation pattern we can obtain the highest ya for the whole country based on several reported by farmers and researchers the most important factors limiting ya in iran were poor seed quality poor soil health lack inappropriate use of fertilizers soil amendments sub optimum use of lime low yielding varieties farmers knowledge poor timing of operation lack of access to market as incentive and too much and persistent clouds in addition there are several reports about crop management being a potato yield limiting factor by svubure et al 2015 schulte geldermann 2013 thomas sharma et al 2016 however there are several approaches to reduce the yield gap of potato in iran conditions which are especially effective when these strategies are part of a holistic approach these strategies include use of clean potato seed removal of wilted and or volunteer plants pathogen free soil appropriate crop rotation systems with non host plant species negative positive selection techniques and other agronomic practices other perceived drivers are listed above for better management in the farming gobet et al 2016 showed that wheat fields in australia are located in 6 main climatic zones they selected 22 reference weather stations in these areas and calculated the potential yield under rainfed conditions for the years from 1996 to 2010 using the apsim model his results showed that the potential yield was about 3 6 ton ha on the national scale espi et al 2016 selected 14 weather stations which covered 87 of us rice fields they estimated the potential yield in each climate using the oryza model for 15 years they also reported that the potential yield ranged from 11 5 to 14 5 t ha 1 5 conclusions based on the gyga protocol fifteen czs selected as dczs for analysis covered 94 of the total potato crop area and 35 rws buffer zones covered 83 of the national potato crop area on the national scale ya and yp were 30 0 t ha 1 and 67 3 t ha 1 respectively the average tuber yield gap was 37 3 t ha 1 these results indicated that the farmers achieved 45 of the potential yield in iran meanwhile investigation of the climate factors indicated that the relationship between potential yield yp and sradt is a linear dependency with a r2 value of 0 81 the relationship between maximum temperature tmin minimum temperature tmax and average temperature tmean and yp were also increased but the highest r2 0 45 was related to relationship between yp and tmax also the highest and lowest yp were obtained from the 5003 and 7003 czs respectively in areas with warm or very warm summers and mild winters gyga ed climate 6102 6202 7002 7003 8002 8003 potato is sown in autumn but in areas with cold or very cold winters gyga ed climate 3102 3103 4002 4003 4102 4103 5002 5003 5103 it is sown in spring than sradt tmaxt and potential yields are higher in spring sown potato in cold areas

24394,in 2015 the fundão dam s failure in brazil released 44 million m3 of tailings that traveled 670 km in the doce river watershed crossing 40 municipalities and two states until reaching the atlantic ocean since then a public civil action pca is responsible for litigation processes and recently established a value of us 43 8 billion to repair losses and damages a value that brings doubts about its accuracy in expressing the loses and damages of the disaster this claims for alternative methods for its monetary quantification than the current tradicional economic ones among others biophysical approaches the emergy accounting appears as a powerful tool due to its donor side perspective that objectively quantifies value and recognizes energy quality this study aims to use emergy accounting as method to firstly identify and then quantify the impacts of fundão dam s failure considering exclusively the negative direct and immediate impacts three categories are considered to quantify loses and damages i suppressed stocks in the mud passage and deposition areas mpda ii social disruption and iii changes in landscape for all the three scenarios of turnover times tt results show that about 98 of total emergy in the suppressed stocks are related to ii and iii while only 2 in average is related to i this discrepancy highlights the importance of accounting for ii and iii since they are often disregarded or not directly considered by traditional economic approaches from a macroeconomic perspective the highest total emergy based dollars emdollar emus found for scenario 3 reached emus 149 18 billion a value 3 4 times higher than the us 43 8 billion established by pca this higher value is equivalent to the annual emergy demanded by the ecuador economy with 18 million inhabitants rather than providing an accurate monetary value for the fundão disaster repair this study contributes for the advancement of discussions about using biophysical methods such as emergy accounting that allows tracking all numbers for objective verification as alternative to the traditional economic approaches in quantifying losses and damages of high proportion disasters keywords

complexity of assessing environmental impacts a first approximation of disaster valuation was legally determined in public civil action pca which established the base value of us 43 8 billions for repairing all losses and damages brasil 2016 that value was established from comparison bases with another disaster repair investments the deepwater horizon oil platform explosion in the gulf of mexico in 2010 brasil 2016 brasil 2020 this comparison was adopted without any methodological description or objective justification about the assumed equivalence other monetary valuation methods as contingent valuation were also applied to sustain the us 43 8 billions but they were considered in a partial way and developed only to claim compensation and reparation for the affected families contingent valuation method was applied in several studies and lawsuits mota 2001 hausman 2012 but this method has limitations related to the interviewee s beliefs to the interviewee s lack of understanding about the environmental resources costanza et al 1997 kramer and mercer 1997 serôa da motta 1997 christie et al 2012 and their socioeconomic status maia 2002 critics argue that the central problem with this and other traditional economic approaches is that the money paid for environmental products and services does not consider the work done by nature and cannot be used to assess the real environmental wealth that means the effort of nature in providing resources to build and to maintain natural capital that provides environmental services odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1999 odum and odum 2001 this limitation is also expressed by costanza et al 1997 in their seminal article which says that if we actually lived in a world that was ecologically sustainable socially fair and where everyone had perfect knowledge of their connection to ecosystem services both market prices and surveys of willingness to pay would yield very different results than they currently do and the value of ecosystem services would probably increase the traditional valuation methods raises doubts about its accuracy because it does not allow tracking back to on how it was established all these uncertainties claim for alternative approaches in quantifying environmental disasters biophysical based tools are alternatives to traditional economic valuation tools as they quantify the investment of natural resources in the production of goods and services gasparatos and scolobig 2012 among others emergy accounting is an important biophysical based tool that can be used to assess the environmental impacts of disruption developed between the 1960s and 1990s emergy accounting consists of an assessment tool to guide policy and an enterprise decision making odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1997 unlike the traditional economic approach the use of the emergy method allows calculating both the usage and the esthetic values to be compared on the same basis odum 1972 brown et al 1993 1996 for this comparison all resources used to make a product or service available are tracked back and expressed in amount of solar energy units of sej joules of solar emergy thus emergy accounting integrates ecological and economic values regardless of human perception or preference about them odum 1996 odum and odum 2001 that leads to a stronger biophysical based sustainability model related to the precautionary principle gasparatos et al 2008 however others authors claim for the necessity to consider or reflect the needs and expectations of the stakeholders as strategical aspect for practical application of policy decision making gasparatos and scolobig 2012 i e scientific robustness and policy relevance should be equally sought in the emergy accounting method energy material labor information and relationships are identified modelled and quantified allowing the evaluation of emergy variation in scenarios of the same system with and without environmental changes odum 1972 brown 2005 lee and brown 2021 scientific literature shows that emergy studies are being published for the most distinct systems as agriculture systems agostinho et al 2008 fossil fuel production brown et al 2011 environmental impacts duan et al 2010 cristiano and gonella 2019 and countries and cities sevegnani et al 2016 lee and braham 2020 but very few studies are focusing on the environmental disasters caused by man e g brown et al 1993 in this present study we recognize the importance in establishing economic values for the loss and damage due to tailings spills additionally we investigate that traditional economic approaches for such task bring uncertainties and do not allow tracking back the calculation procedures and assumptions this work aims to quantify the environmental impacts of the passage and deposition of tailings sludge from an emergy biophysical perspective as a case study the disaster occurred in brazil 2015 named as fundão dam failure is considered to allow quantitative analysis rather than provide an accurate economic value this work contributes to the discussions of advantages and disadvantages in using emergy accounting instead of traditional economic approaches in quantifying environmental disasters 2 methods 2 1 case study description on november 5th 2015 the fundão tailings dam collapsed and destroyed parts of towns villages farms and natural protected areas along the doce river watershed since the disaster different works have been published aires et al 2018 investigated the land use changes due the tailings passage queiroz et al 2018 pointed the metals contamination possibility in the estuarine region and milanez et al 2021 highlighted the gaps in mining disasters repair mechanisms besides existing other aspects that were affected by the fundão dam disaster the present work is limited to the areas in which mining tailings walked through within the watershed the case study is in the doce river basin fig 1 and corresponds to the mud passage and deposition area mpda calculated as 28 082 ha that affected 40 municipalities institutos lactec 2020 2 2 identification and quantification of the suppressed stocks or assets secondary raw data were collected to sustain the scope definition boundaries of this study it was considered the brazilian legislation that classifies environmental impacts as described in the 001 86 resolution of brazilian councill for the environment sánchez 2008 as illustrated by fig 2 the aspects encompassing losses damage and environmental impacts immediate direct and negative ones as a result of mpda are included in the boundaries of this study due to the unavailability of data other attributes of fig 2 were not accounted for as well for both the positive environmental impacts and the negative indirect ones the option to evaluate and quantify the suppressed stocks derives from the definition of natural capital used in the valuation of natural resources by costanza et al 1997 which considers stocks of materials energy or information existing at a given time in a system the identified stocks for the fundão dam failure were organized and represented by an energy hierarchy fig 3 diagram that represents the previous transformation processes making available energy to support the subsequent transformations giannetti et al 2019 specifically three evaluated stocks suppression categories were identified and named as i mpda stocks ii social disruption and iii landscape all they are detailed explained in the next subsections the sum of i ii and iii results on the total emergy lost in the suppressed stocks due to tailings walk through and deposition 2 2 1 identifying the suppressed stocks in the mpda i social disruption ii and in the landscape iii the suppressed stocks categories were defined according to the data available from technical reports and scientific literature table 2 shows the mpda stocks i that correspond to quantitative information for different categories of land use that were affected by mpda as well power plants structures and biomass suppression vegetal and animal as for the stocks suppressed in social disturbance ii data available are more qualitative than quantitative which makes difficult to precisely identify the stocks affected table 3 presents data related to human health and other sociocultural variables of the affected population which although being qualitative data all they were used to identify the suppressed stocks for social disturbance ii part of the damage to historical and cultural heritage may be linked to the destroyed buildings while nontangible aspects of these stocks were not properly identified to allow sketching an emergy quantification fig 4 as a way of considering the sociocultural damage and of indicating its existence a good proxy is to use a unique unit emergy value uev in sej person year to represent social disruption this approach was firstly used to represent human stress losses called here social disruption in the work of brown et al 1993 that evaluated social and cultural impacts of the exxon valdez oil spill together with this uev the number of people described in the ramboll s 2020 survey was considered which indicates the existence of 64 962 families who declared themselves affected by the fundão dam failure here we assumed this number of families multiplied by the number of two individuals per family since the present work quantifies the immediate and direct damages related to the passage and deposition of tailings a period of one year is adopted for social disturbance ii calculations for the suppressed stocks in landscape iii quantitative data were also unavailable thus the analyzed data refer to negative environmental impacts losses and damages characterized in qualitative levels of severity and referability table 4 a third damage extends throughout the mpda and coastal areas affected by the tailings plume the alteration of landscape elements since there are incomplete information about the landscape before the disaster the calculation procedures are based on the landscape physical chemical available elements these elements were built through weathering and material dynamics which processes occurred in larger time scale than the time of mud passage and deposition for this reason the landscape elements are represented as stocks within the energy diagram fig 5 there are no applications of emergy environmental accounting on similar systems that considers the physical chemical elements of the landscape as stocks suppressed in disasters however odum 1996 establishes that natural resources and geological information can be represented as stocks when built in a time window greater than the window of the evaluated system for example odum 1996 represented an estuarine basin as a stock formed by geological work in which the outflow fed tidal power plants this same approach is considered in this work as a proxy to quantify the landscape iii elements in fig 5 diagram the features that form the landscape correspond to the flow of renewable resources that form the stock along a turnover time tt corresponding to the formation of that capital for the formation of this stock annual flows are considered in five different compartments which consist of the entire mpda and the coast the compartments are defined according to the data described in institutos lactec 2020 including water bodies and coastal zone intense and soft plume 2 2 2 approach for stocks quantification emergy accounting from the identified suppressed stocks suppressed i ii and iii it is possible to represent them in a general energy diagram fig 6 the stock diagram resulting a conceptual model that depicts components importance and relationships for the entire doce river watershed impacted by the tailing sludge the watershed is a complex system that demands external resources natural and human made ones to sustain its internal processes and distinct outputs the diagram shows the main elements within the watershed including natural capital areas agroecosystems and urban areas the storages tank symbols correspond to the resources accumulated in a window time period months or years longer than the time demanded by the passage and deposition of the tailing s sludge the gray colored symbols indicate the storages calculated in this work although representing a fraction of the entire watershed complexity fig 6 shows that storages affected and quantified in this work gray ones had fundamental importance to reach a self organized structure before the fundão dam s failure disaster the main information about the application of emergy accounting is provided in this study thus for deeper information on the method please refer to seminal published papers and books such as odum 1996 and brown and ulgiati 2004 among several others the most updated emergy baseline geb value of 12 1024 sej year 1 is used and the following emergy indicators are considered a transformity tr or the general term unit emergy value uev tr corresponds to the solar emergy required to generate one joule of service or product its unit is the solar emjoule per joule sej j and is obtained by the total emergy invested y divided by the energy available by the system ep odum 1996 tr y ep transformity also indicates the position of the system product or service in the hierarchical scale of energy in the geobiosphere higher values of transformity indicate that higher aggregate energy was needed for its generation odum 1996 in this work the uev values were obtained from published studies presented in supplementary material a b emergy money ratio emr it corresponds to the total amount of resources in emergy units used by the economy in a period divided by the gross domestic product gdp of the country in the same period odum 1996 the emr is used to convert the emergy values of suppressed stocks into monetary values the emr of 2 89 1012 sej us 1 nead 2018 is used in this study which corresponds to the national brazilian emr value for the year 2014 the most updated available c emdollar emus the emus of a flow or stock is defined as the value of emergy divided by the emr of a given economy in a given year odum 1996 the emus is a macroeconomic measure which encompasses the values obtained from a donor side perspective effort of nature to represent the energy quality hierarchy aspects disregarded by traditional economic tools it corresponds to an appropriate measure to discuss large scale systems in the economy since decisions that maximize the emus also maximize energy in addition they correspond to an improvement of the sustainability and of the system competitiveness in relation to lower emus values d turnover time tt although it is not an emergy indicator it has fundamental importance in this work tt is the time required for a flow amount flowing per unit of time to replace the amount stored in a stock odum 1996 odum and odum 2000 for better understanding the calculations procedures performed to quantify the suppression of stocks through emergy accounting are step 1 each suppressed stock is identified from published reports and articles and then depicted in system diagrams step 2 an emergy accounting table is built for each identified stock step 3 an aggregate emergy stored in the subsystem is calculated which corresponds to the sum of all annual energy flows sustaining the stock multiplied by the stocks formation tt step 4 the value obtained corresponds to the stock suppression by the tailings passage and disposal expressed in emergy step 5 lastly the emergy is converted into currency by dividing by the emr resulting in a macroeconomic value emus used for comparisons with monetary resources understanding the complexity existing along with the calculation procedures fig 7 presents an example of the application of this procedure to allow easier understanding in the provided hypothetical example the area occupied by the subsystem corresponds to 32 ha and the tt is 20 years calculation of the biomass stock is as follows r n m s 1012 sej ha 1 year 1 turnover time suppressed area 1600 10 900 190 1012 sej ha 1 year 1 20 year 32 ha 2700 1012 sej ha 1 year 1 20 year 32 ha 1 73 1018 sej therefore the suppression of 32 ha of biomass subsystem caused by the passage and deposition of tailings from the rupture of the fundão dam corresponds to as loss of 1 73 1018 sej this value can be represented in emus by dividing the emergy value by the adopted emr which corresponds to 1 73 1018 sej 2 89 1012 sej 1 emus 598 615 92 this same procedure is performed for all the suppressed stocks evaluated in this work and the emus value is compared with the actual us as established by the brazilian court 3 results 3 1 emergy of mpda i suppressed stocks the 11 stocks suppressed identified in the mpda table 2 were quantified as summarized in table 5 details are presented in supplementary materials a and b special attention should be done to the anthropic subsystem named as urban area built area mining and water which presents the highest emergy values achieving 94 of total emergy for mpda water subsystem presents the highest emergy value due to the hydropower power plants hpp stocks suppressed 3 2 emergy of social disruption ii suppressed stocks the sociocultural capital stocks category is another element affected by the tailings passage and disposal as illustrated by fig 4 table 6 gathers the values used for the calculation and presents the result of the first year of social disturbance damage reaching 3 13e 22 sej 3 3 emergy of landscape iii suppressed stocks for landscape suppressed stocks the compartments were defined according to the institutos lactec 2020 data standardization as shown by emergy tables 7 8 and 9 including i compartment 1 mpda in bodies of water from the fundão s dam to the risoleta neves hpp ii compartment 2a mpda in water bodies along the stretch of risoleta neves hpp to baguari s hpp iii compartment 2b mpda in water bodies along the stretch of baguari s hpp at the mouth of the doce river iv mpdas in the land area from compartments 1 2a e 2b v compartment 3 coastal zone composed by the intense and soft plume zones according to the adopted methodology the next step would be the multiplication of the emergy flows by the tt adopted for the suppressed stocks however unlike the subsystems existing in mpda and social disruption stocks the landscape suppressed stocks are not described as the total suppression of a biomass stock as in the case of forests or agroecosystems or even with the suppression of human infrastructure as in the case of built up areas this requires the establishment of tt for the suppressed landscape stocks which represents itself a challenge and a source of uncertainties because there are no data available in the scientific literature on this regard thus an alternative approach is to consider scenarios for tt as explained in the next subitems 3 3 1 scenario 1 replacement time tt of 50 years a tt of 50 years is assumed for landscape iii stocks in scenario 1 which means that all elements of the landscape affected by the passage and deposition of tailings in the mpda and on the coast would be replaced within a period of 50 years the soft plume tt was assumed as 10 of the intense plume tt value since it was necessary to assume a minimum value for tailings in this situation both assumptions increase the uncertainties of this study which can be developed in future studies when more data becomes available table 8 presents the value of suppressed stock obtained by multiplying the emergy flows by the respective areas and turnover time tt of 50 years exception for compartment 3 because its emergy flows already includes the areas of influence thus it is multiplied exclusively by the tt to calculate the emergy value 3 3 2 scenario 2 replacement time tt of 100 years a tt of 100 years is assumed for landscape iii stocks in scenario 2 as for scenario 1 a tt of 10 is assumed for the soft plume area table 9 presents the value of suppressed stock obtained by multiplying the emergy flows by the respective areas and turnover time tt of 100 years with exception for compartment 3 because its emergy flows already includes the areas of influence thus it is multiplied exclusively by the tt to calculate the emergy value 3 3 3 scenario 3 replacement time t t estimated based on the global material flows and releasing tailing volume for the landscape iii stocks in scenario 3 a different approach for estimating replacement time is considered the global sediment flux values is used to estimated the natural time needed to remove the sediments deposited in the landscape table 12 shows the value of continental sediment flux calculated by considering the tt of tailings in the continental area and the oceanic basalt flow value from tailings in the coastal zone table 11 presents the value of suppressed stocks calculated by multiplying the emergy flows described in the compartments 1 2a 2b and 3 tables 7 8 and 9 by the respective areas and replacement times tt calculated in table 10 3 4 total emergy of losses and damages caused by the tailings release table 12 presents the values of damage to mpda stocks i added to the values of losses and social ii and landscape iii losses and damages and considering the three scenarios evaluated for turnover times the amounts of losses are presented in emergy values of suppressed stocks sej and in monetary values expressed by the macroeconomic indicator emdollar emus results show that total emergy and emus values increases according to higher values adopted of t t adopted for the damage to the landscape 4 discussion 4 1 scope definition since we utilize secondary raw data to sustain our scope definition boundaries some limitations can be detected i most part of our secondary raw data are derived from technical reports the calculations and assumptions can be revisited and revised since more data be available and ii we considered the brazilian legislation and agregated the terms losses damage and environmental impacts due to the unavailability of more detailed data other attributes like positive environmental impacts and the negative indirect ones were not considered this means that the following important questions are outside the boundaries of this study have energy flows altered with the new post disaster dynamics what are the new impacts generated by the reconstruction and resettlement of affected communities what are the impacts of the disaster on the mobilization of legal and governmental resources in the resolution of this socio environmental conflict were there positive economic impacts with the dynamization of jobs and activities related to recovery activities if yes which sectors were benefited although not providing answers for these questions the study has considerable scientific contribution by sustaining discussions for the advancement of theme 4 2 spatial dimension of the total emergy lost with fundão dam failure disaster the calculated values for stock suppression by tailings passage and deposition are presented in table 12 in three different scenarios where the total values vary according to the different landscape damage values these variations refer to the adopted t t in damage calculation for scenarios 1 and 2 a t t of 50 and 100 years were assumed while for scenario 3 a tt the time was estimated based on values of geobiosphere material flows for all scenarios the mpda i stocks suppression values that includes natural capital stocks agricultural stocks and infrastructures stocks range from 0 19 to 1 60 of total emergy while for sociocultural ii and landscaping iii storage losses have values from 10 to 80 times higher it is noteworthy the mpdas subsystems differences in which the highest value of 94 for emergy table 5 refers to the suppressed anthropic infrastructure while the remaining 6 is related to the suppressed biomass in natural or agricultural systems thus the values obtained from emergy environmental accounting highlights the existing magnitude differences for the natural and anthropic infrastructure capitals brown et al 1993 reported comparable results that applied emergy environmental accounting to quantify the loss and damage from the exxon valdez oil spills despite the differences between our work and that performed by brown et al 1993 it is interesting that the economic losses were about 20 times higher than the natural capital losses in both works in the exxon valdez case the indirect losses related to oil supply and other processes affected by the spill were disregarded but values referring to recovery operations were considered both aspects were not accounted for in our study due to a lack of information however accounting for the affected landscape iii is a novelty of our study and it shows to be important since it is responsible to the largest emergy lost when compared to mpda i and social disruption ii for scenarios 2 and 3 as summarized in fig 8 although high 37 scenario 1 is the only in which the emergy value of losses and damages of landscape i is lower than social disturbance ii that reaches 61 as a result of the tt of 50 years assumed when compared to other scenarios landscape iii becomes even more important as higher the landscape s tt to return to pre disturbance stat before the dam s failure these findings emphasize the importance for further studies focused on determining more accurate tt values based on the calculation procedures adopted in this work it is possible that there is double counting since the renewable flows r are accounted in both mpda i and landscape iii damages please see details in the supplementary materials however the r values in the mpda are expressive i e 10 of the total emergy exclusively for rock outcrop sandbank islands and native vegetation which correspond respectively to 0 01 0 01 0 41 and 3 56 table 5 of the emergy in the suppressed stocks totalizing 4 of the total emergy in the mpda thus even potentially existing double counting the obtained values show that this influence will hardly affect the obtained results fig 8 shows the energy hierarchy diagram for the geobiosphere where the systems were arranged in ascending order from left to right according to their supporting territories replacement time tt and transformity tr as defined by odum 1996 the evaluated damages resulting from the tailings passage and deposition are allocated on the energy hierarchy diagram to assist their spatial visualization in the environmental and economic processes windows the mpda s i stocks suppression is allocated and presents an increasing emergy values from natural biomass to infrastructure stocks however for all the evaluated scenarios for tt the highest emergy values are in the human society and geological systems that contains the storages of social disruption ii and landscape iii lost this result was expected because while for the environment and economic systems have lower tt the human society and geological information systems have higher tt values this means that losses and damages caused at these systems located far right in the geobiosphere energy hierarchy will take more time to be restored and will cause higher overall disturbance than losses and damages caused in those systems located on the left portion of fig 8 the expressiveness of the landscape iii damage and losses values highlights the importance in quantifying them since they represent emergy values about a hundred time higher than the emergy of mpdas i this becomes even more important because the existing traditional economic approaches to quantify disasters are based exclusively on the processes located at the second panel of fig 8 at this windown in the economic and environmental systems interface the valuation techniques priorizes the human preference and disregard the ecosystems functions odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1999 for example cheng et al 2021 studied the economic valuation of water resources and found that the perception of the economic value of an environmental resource within a watershed can change according to the distance where the human settlements are located from the river those who living far away from the river attributed lower economic values to the watercourses thus applying exclusively the traditional economic tools to evaluate environmental assets or to quantify disasters would lead to inaccurate values restricted to human perception based on the economic process panels of fig 8 important to say that although containing several disadvantages in perceiving and quantifying environmental assets and disasters the traditional economic valuation methodologies have their importance for some purposes for instance to be used in a complementary way together with emergy accounting or with other biophysical based accounting to sustain more accurate decisions towards more a sustainable future besides traditional economic approaches would be considered more practical for policy decisions although distinct values for emergy has being found based on their spatial location in fig 8 and that criticisms about the limitation of contingent valuation from traditional economic tools were here punctuated it is necessary to bring back how odum 2002 understand the geobiosphere as a system the author emphases that no scale is inherently more important than another and that in the self organization energy transformations unite the scales symbiotically maximizing power at all scales this means that even though there is importance on the abstraction exercise proposed in the diagram of fig 8 the intention of this type of study is not to say that certain damages are more important than others however in fact that a system is more than the sum of its parts with emergent qualities which dependent on the different complexity levels that interact and feed each other branco 2014 thus the finding that more than 98 of losses and damages occurred by the fundão dam failure are in the last two panels of energy hierarchy diagram of fig 8 do not imply that the remaining 2 located in the first panel must be simply ignored this statement is in line with tiezzi et al 2003 that states about the necessity to recognize the value of the priceless environmental goods and to allow the decision makers actors to perceive the systems complexity in the geobiosphere 4 3 monetary values comparisons it is noteworthy that this study is limited to direct and immediate damages caused by the stock s suppression due to fundão dam s failure excluding all the indirect damages as for indirect impacts it can be quoted natural and economic flows suppression or alteration the twenty three public water supply systems shutdowns the machinery traffic on roads opening and other mitigation measures land use conversion for population displaced resettlement and health problems arising tailings exposure ambios 2019 institutos lactec 2020 ramboll 2020 direct costs invested by society government and the mining company onto repair strategies are also excluded because the public authorities of justice and civil society organizations are still investing for repairing purposes reminding that main contribution of this study is to promote discussions about alternative ways in quantifying monetarily the disaster impacts instead of providing an accurate value the obtained values can be comparable to the one established by the public civil action pca of us 43 8 billion considering the total damage and reparation table 15 for comparison the value for scenario 3 of 149 18 emus is 3 4 higher than the pca while the values of scenarios 1 and 2 are 2 4 and 1 5 times lower than pca respectively instead of providing accurate values the advantage of the proposed approach might be that all its calculations procedures and assumptions can be tracked for revisions discussions and further improvements differently the traditional economic approaches as the pda value established of us 43 8 billion hardly allow tracing back procedures since the three evaluated scenarios do not fully represents the total damages and repair costs only the direct and immediate ones are included they might be underestimated value but they still allow reproduction and are transparent about how they were obtained using emergy accounting lee and brown 2021 estimated the gross primary production and global biotic natural capital values for the pre anthropocene period achieving a value of emus 578 5 trillion for losses as result of land use changes the value achieved was emus 88 5 trillion in contrast with this last value obtained by lee and brown 2021 the three evaluated scenarios in this present study correspond to 0 02 in scenario 1 0 03 in 2 and 0 17 in 3 of those historical losses although recognizing both studies have different stocks being evaluated this direct and simple comparison is important to show how severe or affecting was the fundão dam s failure since this single event even partially evaluated here can be equated to 0 17 of biotic natural capital suppressed in the earth although it represents only 0 01 of earth s territorial land area numbers raises astonishment and at the same time claims for further studies to overcome the performed assumptions and lack of data towards a more accurate value about the brazilian mining disaster the emergy method allows different systems can be quantified and compared under the same units of sej allowing decision makers to better understand the performance of the evaluated systems through comparisons with similar or even different systems contrary to the traditional economic tools emergy accounting is still incipient regarding communication with a non scientific audience and its acceptance by decision makers thus it is important to provide easier examples for comparisons regarding the obtained numbers in sej for instance as an attempt to provide a clear picture about the dimension of the fundão dam s failure the obtained emergy values for the three evaluated scenarios are compared with the emergy supporting whole south america countries table 16 scenario 3 corresponds to an intermediate value between the emergy flows from bolivia and ecuador in which the suppressed emergy by the disaster is closer to the emergy flow interruption for one year for ecuador economy that currently has 18 million inhabitants similarly scenario 2 is equivalent to the emergy demanded by guiana economy with 0 8 million inhabitants and scenario 1 with two times more than french guiana economy with 0 3 million inhabitants this kind of comparison is useful to efficiently communicate how big is the disaster since the public is usually not familiar with emergy units 5 conclusions the negative direct and immediate environmental impacts because of fundão dam s failure are modeled through emergy accounting biophysical tool to identify and quantify the suppressed environmental and social stocks by the mud passage and deposition in the doce river watershed brazil according to emergy principles that focuses on a geobiosphere scale that recognizes the quality of energy the identified suppressed stocks include the following systems biotic natural agrarian and extractive industrial and economic human society and geological and information this distribution of systems based on an energy hierarchy including territory of influence turnover time and transformity supports a classification of the suppressed stocks according to their magnitude as expressed by emergy values for the three evaluated scenarios about 98 of total emergy refers to stocks suppression in human society and geological systems while only 2 in average belongs to environment and economic processes this suggests that traditional economic approaches that usually focus on theories based on economic processes hardly will provide an accurate value for environmental disasters repairs since they are based on human willingness to pay under market rules and ignores the effort of nature in making the natural capital that sustain human development the value of stocks suppressed ranges from emus 17 7 billion for the most conservative scenario 1 to scenario 2 with emus 28 6 billion and the highest value for emus 149 2 billion for scenario 3 on the other hand the value of us 43 8 billion was established by the public civil action without any evidence about the methods applied for its quantification although direct comparisons among these values should be seeing with care due to uncertainties assumptions and boundaries considered to obtain them at least one advantage of the emergy based approach is that it allows tracking back all the calculation procedures to verify its consistency numbers are carefully and objectively presented allowing reproduction and changes towards higher accuracy rather than providing an accurate value of the disaster due to fundão dam s failure in brazil our study supports discussions about the advantages in using biophysical methods specifically emergy accounting instead of traditional economic methods for disasters quantification the advantages behind emergy are related to higher scientific based objectiveness of calculation procedures allowing tracking back all numbers for verifications and improvements when needed due to unavailability of raw data this work is restricted to the negative direct and immediate impacts but future efforts are being developed to include also all others impacts for a complete assessment lastly the usage of emergy based methodological procedures are encouraged for future studies to quantify environmental disasters that not only leverages economic impacts but also environmental and societal credit authorship contribution statement juliano scarpelin conceptualization data curation methodology writing original draft feni

24394,in 2015 the fundão dam s failure in brazil released 44 million m3 of tailings that traveled 670 km in the doce river watershed crossing 40 municipalities and two states until reaching the atlantic ocean since then a public civil action pca is responsible for litigation processes and recently established a value of us 43 8 billion to repair losses and damages a value that brings doubts about its accuracy in expressing the loses and damages of the disaster this claims for alternative methods for its monetary quantification than the current tradicional economic ones among others biophysical approaches the emergy accounting appears as a powerful tool due to its donor side perspective that objectively quantifies value and recognizes energy quality this study aims to use emergy accounting as method to firstly identify and then quantify the impacts of fundão dam s failure considering exclusively the negative direct and immediate impacts three categories are considered to quantify loses and damages i suppressed stocks in the mud passage and deposition areas mpda ii social disruption and iii changes in landscape for all the three scenarios of turnover times tt results show that about 98 of total emergy in the suppressed stocks are related to ii and iii while only 2 in average is related to i this discrepancy highlights the importance of accounting for ii and iii since they are often disregarded or not directly considered by traditional economic approaches from a macroeconomic perspective the highest total emergy based dollars emdollar emus found for scenario 3 reached emus 149 18 billion a value 3 4 times higher than the us 43 8 billion established by pca this higher value is equivalent to the annual emergy demanded by the ecuador economy with 18 million inhabitants rather than providing an accurate monetary value for the fundão disaster repair this study contributes for the advancement of discussions about using biophysical methods such as emergy accounting that allows tracking all numbers for objective verification as alternative to the traditional economic approaches in quantifying losses and damages of high proportion disasters keywords brazil dam failure ecological economy environmental valuation fundão dam data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mining derived products are vital components in modern societies however the mining industry activity generates million tons of tailings per year which can be disposed in the natural environment be handling in backfilling or stored behind dam structures lottermoser 2007 it is estimated that there are between 29 000 and 35 000 tailings storage facilities worldwide wmtf 2020 where tailings dam is the main storage method kossoff et al 2014 at tailing dam facilities dam failures have dumped more than 250 million m3 of tailings and have caused almost 3000 human deaths santamarina et al 2019 more than 300 ruptures were recorded in the last century of which 50 were classified as very serious csp2 2020 in this category bowker and chambers 2015 surveyed public damage costs related dam failure cases funding records of 14 cases between 1990 and 2010 of these only 7 had sufficient data for analysis and are shown in table 1 together with the recent disruption that occurred in brazil the values in table 1 do not show a pattern between the damage values and the variables that compose them although these have been used in the classification of the magnitude of the disruptions it is possible that other variables not explained in table 1 are part of the composition of the damage values but the information on the methodology used to define values for each of the listed cases was not identified in the review fundão s collapse was by far the most impacting event in tailings volume and linear distance fundão s dam failure released about 44 million cubic meters of mining tailings which traveled more than 670 km in water courses and adjacent territories in the states of minas gerais and espírito santo until reaching the atlantic ocean ibama 2015 institutos lactec 2020 villages were dissipated 19 human lives were immediately lost cruz and domingues 2017 and several health problems affected the population vormittag et al 2018 neves et al 2018 lins et al 2019 which still has to deal with a slow and insufficient repair system zhouri et al 2016 aleixo and bastos 2018 scarpelin et al 2020 the identification valuation and repair obligation are objects of legal dispute involving the population governments and mining companies despite the complexity of assessing environmental impacts a first approximation of disaster valuation was legally determined in public civil action pca which established the base value of us 43 8 billions for repairing all losses and damages brasil 2016 that value was established from comparison bases with another disaster repair investments the deepwater horizon oil platform explosion in the gulf of mexico in 2010 brasil 2016 brasil 2020 this comparison was adopted without any methodological description or objective justification about the assumed equivalence other monetary valuation methods as contingent valuation were also applied to sustain the us 43 8 billions but they were considered in a partial way and developed only to claim compensation and reparation for the affected families contingent valuation method was applied in several studies and lawsuits mota 2001 hausman 2012 but this method has limitations related to the interviewee s beliefs to the interviewee s lack of understanding about the environmental resources costanza et al 1997 kramer and mercer 1997 serôa da motta 1997 christie et al 2012 and their socioeconomic status maia 2002 critics argue that the central problem with this and other traditional economic approaches is that the money paid for environmental products and services does not consider the work done by nature and cannot be used to assess the real environmental wealth that means the effort of nature in providing resources to build and to maintain natural capital that provides environmental services odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1999 odum and odum 2001 this limitation is also expressed by costanza et al 1997 in their seminal article which says that if we actually lived in a world that was ecologically sustainable socially fair and where everyone had perfect knowledge of their connection to ecosystem services both market prices and surveys of willingness to pay would yield very different results than they currently do and the value of ecosystem services would probably increase the traditional valuation methods raises doubts about its accuracy because it does not allow tracking back to on how it was established all these uncertainties claim for alternative approaches in quantifying environmental disasters biophysical based tools are alternatives to traditional economic valuation tools as they quantify the investment of natural resources in the production of goods and services gasparatos and scolobig 2012 among others emergy accounting is an important biophysical based tool that can be used to assess the environmental impacts of disruption developed between the 1960s and 1990s emergy accounting consists of an assessment tool to guide policy and an enterprise decision making odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1997 unlike the traditional economic approach the use of the emergy method allows calculating both the usage and the esthetic values to be compared on the same basis odum 1972 brown et al 1993 1996 for this comparison all resources used to make a product or service available are tracked back and expressed in amount of solar energy units of sej joules of solar emergy thus emergy accounting integrates ecological and economic values regardless of human perception or preference about them odum 1996 odum and odum 2001 that leads to a stronger biophysical based sustainability model related to the precautionary principle gasparatos et al 2008 however others authors claim for the necessity to consider or reflect the needs and expectations of the stakeholders as strategical aspect for practical application of policy decision making gasparatos and scolobig 2012 i e scientific robustness and policy relevance should be equally sought in the emergy accounting method energy material labor information and relationships are identified modelled and quantified allowing the evaluation of emergy variation in scenarios of the same system with and without environmental changes odum 1972 brown 2005 lee and brown 2021 scientific literature shows that emergy studies are being published for the most distinct systems as agriculture systems agostinho et al 2008 fossil fuel production brown et al 2011 environmental impacts duan et al 2010 cristiano and gonella 2019 and countries and cities sevegnani et al 2016 lee and braham 2020 but very few studies are focusing on the environmental disasters caused by man e g brown et al 1993 in this present study we recognize the importance in establishing economic values for the loss and damage due to tailings spills additionally we investigate that traditional economic approaches for such task bring uncertainties and do not allow tracking back the calculation procedures and assumptions this work aims to quantify the environmental impacts of the passage and deposition of tailings sludge from an emergy biophysical perspective as a case study the disaster occurred in brazil 2015 named as fundão dam failure is considered to allow quantitative analysis rather than provide an accurate economic value this work contributes to the discussions of advantages and disadvantages in using emergy accounting instead of traditional economic approaches in quantifying environmental disasters 2 methods 2 1 case study description on november 5th 2015 the fundão tailings dam collapsed and destroyed parts of towns villages farms and natural protected areas along the doce river watershed since the disaster different works have been published aires et al 2018 investigated the land use changes due the tailings passage queiroz et al 2018 pointed the metals contamination possibility in the estuarine region and milanez et al 2021 highlighted the gaps in mining disasters repair mechanisms besides existing other aspects that were affected by the fundão dam disaster the present work is limited to the areas in which mining tailings walked through within the watershed the case study is in the doce river basin fig 1 and corresponds to the mud passage and deposition area mpda calculated as 28 082 ha that affected 40 municipalities institutos lactec 2020 2 2 identification and quantification of the suppressed stocks or assets secondary raw data were collected to sustain the scope definition boundaries of this study it was considered the brazilian legislation that classifies environmental impacts as described in the 001 86 resolution of brazilian councill for the environment sánchez 2008 as illustrated by fig 2 the aspects encompassing losses damage and environmental impacts immediate direct and negative ones as a result of mpda are included in the boundaries of this study due to the unavailability of data other attributes of fig 2 were not accounted for as well for both the positive environmental impacts and the negative indirect ones the option to evaluate and quantify the suppressed stocks derives from the definition of natural capital used in the valuation of natural resources by costanza et al 1997 which considers stocks of materials energy or information existing at a given time in a system the identified stocks for the fundão dam failure were organized and represented by an energy hierarchy fig 3 diagram that represents the previous transformation processes making available energy to support the subsequent transformations giannetti et al 2019 specifically three evaluated stocks suppression categories were identified and named as i mpda stocks ii social disruption and iii landscape all they are detailed explained in the next subsections the sum of i ii and iii results on the total emergy lost in the suppressed stocks due to tailings walk through and deposition 2 2 1 identifying the suppressed stocks in the mpda i social disruption ii and in the landscape iii the suppressed stocks categories were defined according to the data available from technical reports and scientific literature table 2 shows the mpda stocks i that correspond to quantitative information for different categories of land use that were affected by mpda as well power plants structures and biomass suppression vegetal and animal as for the stocks suppressed in social disturbance ii data available are more qualitative than quantitative which makes difficult to precisely identify the stocks affected table 3 presents data related to human health and other sociocultural variables of the affected population which although being qualitative data all they were used to identify the suppressed stocks for social disturbance ii part of the damage to historical and cultural heritage may be linked to the destroyed buildings while nontangible aspects of these stocks were not properly identified to allow sketching an emergy quantification fig 4 as a way of considering the sociocultural damage and of indicating its existence a good proxy is to use a unique unit emergy value uev in sej person year to represent social disruption this approach was firstly used to represent human stress losses called here social disruption in the work of brown et al 1993 that evaluated social and cultural impacts of the exxon valdez oil spill together with this uev the number of people described in the ramboll s 2020 survey was considered which indicates the existence of 64 962 families who declared themselves affected by the fundão dam failure here we assumed this number of families multiplied by the number of two individuals per family since the present work quantifies the immediate and direct damages related to the passage and deposition of tailings a period of one year is adopted for social disturbance ii calculations for the suppressed stocks in landscape iii quantitative data were also unavailable thus the analyzed data refer to negative environmental impacts losses and damages characterized in qualitative levels of severity and referability table 4 a third damage extends throughout the mpda and coastal areas affected by the tailings plume the alteration of landscape elements since there are incomplete information about the landscape before the disaster the calculation procedures are based on the landscape physical chemical available elements these elements were built through weathering and material dynamics which processes occurred in larger time scale than the time of mud passage and deposition for this reason the landscape elements are represented as stocks within the energy diagram fig 5 there are no applications of emergy environmental accounting on similar systems that considers the physical chemical elements of the landscape as stocks suppressed in disasters however odum 1996 establishes that natural resources and geological information can be represented as stocks when built in a time window greater than the window of the evaluated system for example odum 1996 represented an estuarine basin as a stock formed by geological work in which the outflow fed tidal power plants this same approach is considered in this work as a proxy to quantify the landscape iii elements in fig 5 diagram the features that form the landscape correspond to the flow of renewable resources that form the stock along a turnover time tt corresponding to the formation of that capital for the formation of this stock annual flows are considered in five different compartments which consist of the entire mpda and the coast the compartments are defined according to the data described in institutos lactec 2020 including water bodies and coastal zone intense and soft plume 2 2 2 approach for stocks quantification emergy accounting from the identified suppressed stocks suppressed i ii and iii it is possible to represent them in a general energy diagram fig 6 the stock diagram resulting a conceptual model that depicts components importance and relationships for the entire doce river watershed impacted by the tailing sludge the watershed is a complex system that demands external resources natural and human made ones to sustain its internal processes and distinct outputs the diagram shows the main elements within the watershed including natural capital areas agroecosystems and urban areas the storages tank symbols correspond to the resources accumulated in a window time period months or years longer than the time demanded by the passage and deposition of the tailing s sludge the gray colored symbols indicate the storages calculated in this work although representing a fraction of the entire watershed complexity fig 6 shows that storages affected and quantified in this work gray ones had fundamental importance to reach a self organized structure before the fundão dam s failure disaster the main information about the application of emergy accounting is provided in this study thus for deeper information on the method please refer to seminal published papers and books such as odum 1996 and brown and ulgiati 2004 among several others the most updated emergy baseline geb value of 12 1024 sej year 1 is used and the following emergy indicators are considered a transformity tr or the general term unit emergy value uev tr corresponds to the solar emergy required to generate one joule of service or product its unit is the solar emjoule per joule sej j and is obtained by the total emergy invested y divided by the energy available by the system ep odum 1996 tr y ep transformity also indicates the position of the system product or service in the hierarchical scale of energy in the geobiosphere higher values of transformity indicate that higher aggregate energy was needed for its generation odum 1996 in this work the uev values were obtained from published studies presented in supplementary material a b emergy money ratio emr it corresponds to the total amount of resources in emergy units used by the economy in a period divided by the gross domestic product gdp of the country in the same period odum 1996 the emr is used to convert the emergy values of suppressed stocks into monetary values the emr of 2 89 1012 sej us 1 nead 2018 is used in this study which corresponds to the national brazilian emr value for the year 2014 the most updated available c emdollar emus the emus of a flow or stock is defined as the value of emergy divided by the emr of a given economy in a given year odum 1996 the emus is a macroeconomic measure which encompasses the values obtained from a donor side perspective effort of nature to represent the energy quality hierarchy aspects disregarded by traditional economic tools it corresponds to an appropriate measure to discuss large scale systems in the economy since decisions that maximize the emus also maximize energy in addition they correspond to an improvement of the sustainability and of the system competitiveness in relation to lower emus values d turnover time tt although it is not an emergy indicator it has fundamental importance in this work tt is the time required for a flow amount flowing per unit of time to replace the amount stored in a stock odum 1996 odum and odum 2000 for better understanding the calculations procedures performed to quantify the suppression of stocks through emergy accounting are step 1 each suppressed stock is identified from published reports and articles and then depicted in system diagrams step 2 an emergy accounting table is built for each identified stock step 3 an aggregate emergy stored in the subsystem is calculated which corresponds to the sum of all annual energy flows sustaining the stock multiplied by the stocks formation tt step 4 the value obtained corresponds to the stock suppression by the tailings passage and disposal expressed in emergy step 5 lastly the emergy is converted into currency by dividing by the emr resulting in a macroeconomic value emus used for comparisons with monetary resources understanding the complexity existing along with the calculation procedures fig 7 presents an example of the application of this procedure to allow easier understanding in the provided hypothetical example the area occupied by the subsystem corresponds to 32 ha and the tt is 20 years calculation of the biomass stock is as follows r n m s 1012 sej ha 1 year 1 turnover time suppressed area 1600 10 900 190 1012 sej ha 1 year 1 20 year 32 ha 2700 1012 sej ha 1 year 1 20 year 32 ha 1 73 1018 sej therefore the suppression of 32 ha of biomass subsystem caused by the passage and deposition of tailings from the rupture of the fundão dam corresponds to as loss of 1 73 1018 sej this value can be represented in emus by dividing the emergy value by the adopted emr which corresponds to 1 73 1018 sej 2 89 1012 sej 1 emus 598 615 92 this same procedure is performed for all the suppressed stocks evaluated in this work and the emus value is compared with the actual us as established by the brazilian court 3 results 3 1 emergy of mpda i suppressed stocks the 11 stocks suppressed identified in the mpda table 2 were quantified as summarized in table 5 details are presented in supplementary materials a and b special attention should be done to the anthropic subsystem named as urban area built area mining and water which presents the highest emergy values achieving 94 of total emergy for mpda water subsystem presents the highest emergy value due to the hydropower power plants hpp stocks suppressed 3 2 emergy of social disruption ii suppressed stocks the sociocultural capital stocks category is another element affected by the tailings passage and disposal as illustrated by fig 4 table 6 gathers the values used for the calculation and presents the result of the first year of social disturbance damage reaching 3 13e 22 sej 3 3 emergy of landscape iii suppressed stocks for landscape suppressed stocks the compartments were defined according to the institutos lactec 2020 data standardization as shown by emergy tables 7 8 and 9 including i compartment 1 mpda in bodies of water from the fundão s dam to the risoleta neves hpp ii compartment 2a mpda in water bodies along the stretch of risoleta neves hpp to baguari s hpp iii compartment 2b mpda in water bodies along the stretch of baguari s hpp at the mouth of the doce river iv mpdas in the land area from compartments 1 2a e 2b v compartment 3 coastal zone composed by the intense and soft plume zones according to the adopted methodology the next step would be the multiplication of the emergy flows by the tt adopted for the suppressed stocks however unlike the subsystems existing in mpda and social disruption stocks the landscape suppressed stocks are not described as the total suppression of a biomass stock as in the case of forests or agroecosystems or even with the suppression of human infrastructure as in the case of built up areas this requires the establishment of tt for the suppressed landscape stocks which represents itself a challenge and a source of uncertainties because there are no data available in the scientific literature on this regard thus an alternative approach is to consider scenarios for tt as explained in the next subitems 3 3 1 scenario 1 replacement time tt of 50 years a tt of 50 years is assumed for landscape iii stocks in scenario 1 which means that all elements of the landscape affected by the passage and deposition of tailings in the mpda and on the coast would be replaced within a period of 50 years the soft plume tt was assumed as 10 of the intense plume tt value since it was necessary to assume a minimum value for tailings in this situation both assumptions increase the uncertainties of this study which can be developed in future studies when more data becomes available table 8 presents the value of suppressed stock obtained by multiplying the emergy flows by the respective areas and turnover time tt of 50 years exception for compartment 3 because its emergy flows already includes the areas of influence thus it is multiplied exclusively by the tt to calculate the emergy value 3 3 2 scenario 2 replacement time tt of 100 years a tt of 100 years is assumed for landscape iii stocks in scenario 2 as for scenario 1 a tt of 10 is assumed for the soft plume area table 9 presents the value of suppressed stock obtained by multiplying the emergy flows by the respective areas and turnover time tt of 100 years with exception for compartment 3 because its emergy flows already includes the areas of influence thus it is multiplied exclusively by the tt to calculate the emergy value 3 3 3 scenario 3 replacement time t t estimated based on the global material flows and releasing tailing volume for the landscape iii stocks in scenario 3 a different approach for estimating replacement time is considered the global sediment flux values is used to estimated the natural time needed to remove the sediments deposited in the landscape table 12 shows the value of continental sediment flux calculated by considering the tt of tailings in the continental area and the oceanic basalt flow value from tailings in the coastal zone table 11 presents the value of suppressed stocks calculated by multiplying the emergy flows described in the compartments 1 2a 2b and 3 tables 7 8 and 9 by the respective areas and replacement times tt calculated in table 10 3 4 total emergy of losses and damages caused by the tailings release table 12 presents the values of damage to mpda stocks i added to the values of losses and social ii and landscape iii losses and damages and considering the three scenarios evaluated for turnover times the amounts of losses are presented in emergy values of suppressed stocks sej and in monetary values expressed by the macroeconomic indicator emdollar emus results show that total emergy and emus values increases according to higher values adopted of t t adopted for the damage to the landscape 4 discussion 4 1 scope definition since we utilize secondary raw data to sustain our scope definition boundaries some limitations can be detected i most part of our secondary raw data are derived from technical reports the calculations and assumptions can be revisited and revised since more data be available and ii we considered the brazilian legislation and agregated the terms losses damage and environmental impacts due to the unavailability of more detailed data other attributes like positive environmental impacts and the negative indirect ones were not considered this means that the following important questions are outside the boundaries of this study have energy flows altered with the new post disaster dynamics what are the new impacts generated by the reconstruction and resettlement of affected communities what are the impacts of the disaster on the mobilization of legal and governmental resources in the resolution of this socio environmental conflict were there positive economic impacts with the dynamization of jobs and activities related to recovery activities if yes which sectors were benefited although not providing answers for these questions the study has considerable scientific contribution by sustaining discussions for the advancement of theme 4 2 spatial dimension of the total emergy lost with fundão dam failure disaster the calculated values for stock suppression by tailings passage and deposition are presented in table 12 in three different scenarios where the total values vary according to the different landscape damage values these variations refer to the adopted t t in damage calculation for scenarios 1 and 2 a t t of 50 and 100 years were assumed while for scenario 3 a tt the time was estimated based on values of geobiosphere material flows for all scenarios the mpda i stocks suppression values that includes natural capital stocks agricultural stocks and infrastructures stocks range from 0 19 to 1 60 of total emergy while for sociocultural ii and landscaping iii storage losses have values from 10 to 80 times higher it is noteworthy the mpdas subsystems differences in which the highest value of 94 for emergy table 5 refers to the suppressed anthropic infrastructure while the remaining 6 is related to the suppressed biomass in natural or agricultural systems thus the values obtained from emergy environmental accounting highlights the existing magnitude differences for the natural and anthropic infrastructure capitals brown et al 1993 reported comparable results that applied emergy environmental accounting to quantify the loss and damage from the exxon valdez oil spills despite the differences between our work and that performed by brown et al 1993 it is interesting that the economic losses were about 20 times higher than the natural capital losses in both works in the exxon valdez case the indirect losses related to oil supply and other processes affected by the spill were disregarded but values referring to recovery operations were considered both aspects were not accounted for in our study due to a lack of information however accounting for the affected landscape iii is a novelty of our study and it shows to be important since it is responsible to the largest emergy lost when compared to mpda i and social disruption ii for scenarios 2 and 3 as summarized in fig 8 although high 37 scenario 1 is the only in which the emergy value of losses and damages of landscape i is lower than social disturbance ii that reaches 61 as a result of the tt of 50 years assumed when compared to other scenarios landscape iii becomes even more important as higher the landscape s tt to return to pre disturbance stat before the dam s failure these findings emphasize the importance for further studies focused on determining more accurate tt values based on the calculation procedures adopted in this work it is possible that there is double counting since the renewable flows r are accounted in both mpda i and landscape iii damages please see details in the supplementary materials however the r values in the mpda are expressive i e 10 of the total emergy exclusively for rock outcrop sandbank islands and native vegetation which correspond respectively to 0 01 0 01 0 41 and 3 56 table 5 of the emergy in the suppressed stocks totalizing 4 of the total emergy in the mpda thus even potentially existing double counting the obtained values show that this influence will hardly affect the obtained results fig 8 shows the energy hierarchy diagram for the geobiosphere where the systems were arranged in ascending order from left to right according to their supporting territories replacement time tt and transformity tr as defined by odum 1996 the evaluated damages resulting from the tailings passage and deposition are allocated on the energy hierarchy diagram to assist their spatial visualization in the environmental and economic processes windows the mpda s i stocks suppression is allocated and presents an increasing emergy values from natural biomass to infrastructure stocks however for all the evaluated scenarios for tt the highest emergy values are in the human society and geological systems that contains the storages of social disruption ii and landscape iii lost this result was expected because while for the environment and economic systems have lower tt the human society and geological information systems have higher tt values this means that losses and damages caused at these systems located far right in the geobiosphere energy hierarchy will take more time to be restored and will cause higher overall disturbance than losses and damages caused in those systems located on the left portion of fig 8 the expressiveness of the landscape iii damage and losses values highlights the importance in quantifying them since they represent emergy values about a hundred time higher than the emergy of mpdas i this becomes even more important because the existing traditional economic approaches to quantify disasters are based exclusively on the processes located at the second panel of fig 8 at this windown in the economic and environmental systems interface the valuation techniques priorizes the human preference and disregard the ecosystems functions odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1999 for example cheng et al 2021 studied the economic valuation of water resources and found that the perception of the economic value of an environmental resource within a watershed can change according to the distance where the human settlements are located from the river those who living far away from the river attributed lower economic values to the watercourses thus applying exclusively the traditional economic tools to evaluate environmental assets or to quantify disasters would lead to inaccurate values restricted to human perception based on the economic process panels of fig 8 important to say that although containing several disadvantages in perceiving and quantifying environmental assets and disasters the traditional economic valuation methodologies have their importance for some purposes for instance to be used in a complementary way together with emergy accounting or with other biophysical based accounting to sustain more accurate decisions towards more a sustainable future besides traditional economic approaches would be considered more practical for policy decisions although distinct values for emergy has being found based on their spatial location in fig 8 and that criticisms about the limitation of contingent valuation from traditional economic tools were here punctuated it is necessary to bring back how odum 2002 understand the geobiosphere as a system the author emphases that no scale is inherently more important than another and that in the self organization energy transformations unite the scales symbiotically maximizing power at all scales this means that even though there is importance on the abstraction exercise proposed in the diagram of fig 8 the intention of this type of study is not to say that certain damages are more important than others however in fact that a system is more than the sum of its parts with emergent qualities which dependent on the different complexity levels that interact and feed each other branco 2014 thus the finding that more than 98 of losses and damages occurred by the fundão dam failure are in the last two panels of energy hierarchy diagram of fig 8 do not imply that the remaining 2 located in the first panel must be simply ignored this statement is in line with tiezzi et al 2003 that states about the necessity to recognize the value of the priceless environmental goods and to allow the decision makers actors to perceive the systems complexity in the geobiosphere 4 3 monetary values comparisons it is noteworthy that this study is limited to direct and immediate damages caused by the stock s suppression due to fundão dam s failure excluding all the indirect damages as for indirect impacts it can be quoted natural and economic flows suppression or alteration the twenty three public water supply systems shutdowns the machinery traffic on roads opening and other mitigation measures land use conversion for population displaced resettlement and health problems arising tailings exposure ambios 2019 institutos lactec 2020 ramboll 2020 direct costs invested by society government and the mining company onto repair strategies are also excluded because the public authorities of justice and civil society organizations are still investing for repairing purposes reminding that main contribution of this study is to promote discussions about alternative ways in quantifying monetarily the disaster impacts instead of providing an accurate value the obtained values can be comparable to the one established by the public civil action pca of us 43 8 billion considering the total damage and reparation table 15 for comparison the value for scenario 3 of 149 18 emus is 3 4 higher than the pca while the values of scenarios 1 and 2 are 2 4 and 1 5 times lower than pca respectively instead of providing accurate values the advantage of the proposed approach might be that all its calculations procedures and assumptions can be tracked for revisions discussions and further improvements differently the traditional economic approaches as the pda value established of us 43 8 billion hardly allow tracing back procedures since the three evaluated scenarios do not fully represents the total damages and repair costs only the direct and immediate ones are included they might be underestimated value but they still allow reproduction and are transparent about how they were obtained using emergy accounting lee and brown 2021 estimated the gross primary production and global biotic natural capital values for the pre anthropocene period achieving a value of emus 578 5 trillion for losses as result of land use changes the value achieved was emus 88 5 trillion in contrast with this last value obtained by lee and brown 2021 the three evaluated scenarios in this present study correspond to 0 02 in scenario 1 0 03 in 2 and 0 17 in 3 of those historical losses although recognizing both studies have different stocks being evaluated this direct and simple comparison is important to show how severe or affecting was the fundão dam s failure since this single event even partially evaluated here can be equated to 0 17 of biotic natural capital suppressed in the earth although it represents only 0 01 of earth s territorial land area numbers raises astonishment and at the same time claims for further studies to overcome the performed assumptions and lack of data towards a more accurate value about the brazilian mining disaster the emergy method allows different systems can be quantified and compared under the same units of sej allowing decision makers to better understand the performance of the evaluated systems through comparisons with similar or even different systems contrary to the traditional economic tools emergy accounting is still incipient regarding communication with a non scientific audience and its acceptance by decision makers thus it is important to provide easier examples for comparisons regarding the obtained numbers in sej for instance as an attempt to provide a clear picture about the dimension of the fundão dam s failure the obtained emergy values for the three evaluated scenarios are compared with the emergy supporting whole south america countries table 16 scenario 3 corresponds to an intermediate value between the emergy flows from bolivia and ecuador in which the suppressed emergy by the disaster is closer to the emergy flow interruption for one year for ecuador economy that currently has 18 million inhabitants similarly scenario 2 is equivalent to the emergy demanded by guiana economy with 0 8 million inhabitants and scenario 1 with two times more than french guiana economy with 0 3 million inhabitants this kind of comparison is useful to efficiently communicate how big is the disaster since the public is usually not familiar with emergy units 5 conclusions the negative direct and immediate environmental impacts because of fundão dam s failure are modeled through emergy accounting biophysical tool to identify and quantify the suppressed environmental and social stocks by the mud passage and deposition in the doce river watershed brazil according to emergy principles that focuses on a geobiosphere scale that recognizes the quality of energy the identified suppressed stocks include the following systems biotic natural agrarian and extractive industrial and economic human society and geological and information this distribution of systems based on an energy hierarchy including territory of influence turnover time and transformity supports a classification of the suppressed stocks according to their magnitude as expressed by emergy values for the three evaluated scenarios about 98 of total emergy refers to stocks suppression in human society and geological systems while only 2 in average belongs to environment and economic processes this suggests that traditional economic approaches that usually focus on theories based on economic processes hardly will provide an accurate value for environmental disasters repairs since they are based on human willingness to pay under market rules and ignores the effort of nature in making the natural capital that sustain human development the value of stocks suppressed ranges from emus 17 7 billion for the most conservative scenario 1 to scenario 2 with emus 28 6 billion and the highest value for emus 149 2 billion for scenario 3 on the other hand the value of us 43 8 billion was established by the public civil action without any evidence about the methods applied for its quantification although direct comparisons among these values should be seeing with care due to uncertainties assumptions and boundaries considered to obtain them at least one advantage of the emergy based approach is that it allows tracking back all the calculation procedures to verify its consistency numbers are carefully and objectively presented allowing reproduction and changes towards higher accuracy rather than providing an accurate value of the disaster due to fundão dam s failure in brazil our study supports discussions about the advantages in using biophysical methods specifically emergy accounting instead of traditional economic methods for disasters quantification the advantages behind emergy are related to higher scientific based objectiveness of calculation procedures allowing tracking back
