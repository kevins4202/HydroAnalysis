10800,population growth and climate change are necessitating increases in food production and reduction in amounts of water used for agriculture deficit irrigation has been proposed as a strategy to maintain increase yield while reducing the use of water in agriculture however it has not been widely adopted in part due to risk of reduced yield in this paper we describe a meta analysis designed to quantify effects of deficit irrigation on wheat water use efficiency wue and yields and identify optimal strategies for deploying deficit irrigation to achieve win win effects of improving wue and yield simultaneously overall the meta analysis of 41 peer reviewed publications collectively containing over 381 observations showed that the win win relationship between wue and wheat yield does exist overall deficit irrigation improved wheat wue by 6 6 but decreased yield by 16 2 however the results varied depending on irrigation methods such as irrigation type timing and water amount and environmental factors such as precipitation temperature and soil properties in order to maximize win win effects and minimize tradeoff between wue and yield we found that deficit irrigation is most appropriate for areas where total precipitation during the growing season is less than 200 mm and the soil is loamy or sandy deficit irrigation using border and furrow irrigation is more likely to achieve high wue and yield concurrently than drip or sprinkler irrigation importantly we found that the most influential factors affecting yield and wue are the irrigation level and the irrigation thresholds to achieve various scenarios between wue and yield our findings suggest deficit irrigation can improve yield and wue simultaneously and identifies the conditions under which these improvements can be realized keywords limited irrigation yield water use efficiency meta analysis win win trade off 1 introduction agriculture globally faces the major challenge of feeding a growing population while water resources are becoming increasingly scarce especially in the context of global climate change hanjra and qureshi 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 by 2050 the global population is expected to reach 9 6 billion and the global demand for food is expected to double godfray et al 2010 tilman et al 2011 globally only 17 of croplands are irrigated but these lands account for 40 of total food production molden et al 2010 and agriculture accounts for 70 of all fresh water use fao 2007 however the availability of water globally is threatened by climate change and population growth vorosmarty et al 2000 thus it is essential to find ways to reduce water use in agriculture while maintaining or increasing yields rosegrant et al 2009 wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the key staple crops on which global food security depends with about 730 million tons harvested annually from a total area of around 2 1 million km2 around the world shiferaw et al 2013 the world bank has estimated that global production of wheat would need to increase by 60 to meet the food requirements of a population of 9 6 billion by 2050 savadi et al 2018 therefore increasing wheat yield while reducing irrigation is an urgent priority and poses a significant challenge due to dwindling land and water resources and climate change brauman et al 2013 in deficit irrigation a concept introduced in the 1970s irrigation volumes are recduced at certain times in the growing season to save water resources while largely maintaining or even improving yield kang et al 2002 du et al 2015 considerable effort has been spentexamining whether deficit irrigation can maintain or improve yield using less water zhang et al 1998 du et al 2010 these studies showed that the empirical coefficients in the relationship vary with climate crop type and variety irrigation method and soil texture for example some studies have found that crop yields can be largely maintained and product quality can be improved while substantially reducing volumes of water used for irrigation sharma and alonso neto 1986 zhang et al 1999 kang et al 2002 however others have found that although deficit irrigation reduced water use and increased wue to some extent it also greatly reduced yield huang et al 2005 tari 2016 the main sources of variability in the results are the timing of irrigation reductions the extent to which irrigation is reduced and environmental factors kang et al 2002 in addition researchers are rarely able to examine effects of a wide range of irrigation methods or growing environments because of limitations imposed by available human material and financial resources therefore a meta analysis of deficit irrigation is needed to examine these variations qualitatively and draw general quantitative conclusions meta analysis is the quantitative scientific synthesis of research results it can be used to establish evidence based practice and resolve seemingly conflicting research outcomes gurevitch et al 2018 to date there have been few meta analyses of deficit irrigation studies sadras 2009 adu et al 2018 moreover previous meta analyses have focused largely on the comparison of different irrigation types full irrigation deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying irrigation in efforts to identify optimal irrigation methods they have not systematically addressed variations in outcomes of a particular irrigation method and sources of the variation furthermore these meta analyses have considered crop wue or yield but not both hence the relationship between wue and agricultural yield in response to deficit irrigation remains poorly understood at the global scale in some case studies researchers have regarded high wue as an important determinant of yield under stress blum 2009 however high wue is often if not always associated with low photosynthesis due to significant correlation between leaves transpirational and photosynthetic capacities of leaves flexas et al 2016 to assist efforts to meet the challenges of increasing agricultural crop production and reducing water consumption imposed by climate change and an increasing global population there is a clear need for a global synthesis of wheat wue and yield responses to deficit irrigation therefore the primary objectives of this study were to apply global meta analysis in an effort to 1 determine how deficit irrigation affects wheat wue and yield concurrently 2 identify the main factors responsible for the variation in effects and 3 identify deficit irrigation strategies that can maximize win win effects and minimize trade offs between wue and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and extraction we used the web of science and google scholar to identify relevant peer reviewed literature from 1970 to 2019 the search was performed using the search terms wheat or triticum aestivum and water use efficiency or efficiency of water use or wue or water productivity and yield or gain yield and limited irrigation or deficit irrigation or regulated deficit irrigation we also collected data from cnki china national knowledge internet including three published papers written in chinese in total 41 published papers reporting 381 observations of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation satisfied our selection criteria for the meta analysis the list of 41 papers from which the data were extracted are listed in appendix a we screened the publications on the basis of the following criteria only publications describing field experiments with side by side comparisons of full sufficient and deficit irrigation were selected and pot experiments were excluded importantly other inclusion criteria included strict enforcement of full sufficient irrigation and documentation of paired data of yield and wue of wheat under full sufficient and deficit irrigation together with standard deviation error for wue and simple size in this study we mainly focus on agronomic crop wue at field level defined following viets 1962 as the ratio between yield the economic output of crops and evapotranspiration et observations of leaf or whole plant level are not included in addition several explanatory variables referred to as moderators in our meta analysis could affect wue and yield under deficit irrigation these moderators include irrigation and environmental factors therefore we extracted classified and stored the following data as described in appendix b i the means standard deviations or standard errors of wue and yield and sizes of samples used to obtain them ii the location and geographic coordinates of the study site iii the amount of water used for deficit irrigation as a proportion of the full amount divided into four deficit irrigation levels 80 100 60 80 40 60 and 40 v irrigation method sprinkler border drip flood and furrow irrigation vi the period when deficit irrigation was undertaken vegetative stage

two categories 7 and 7 when data from the selected studies had been presented graphically the figures were first digitized to extract the numerical values using the get data graph digitizer ver 2 22 russian federation 2 2 statistical analyses we used the log response ratios as a metric of the effect size in this meta analysis hedges et al 1999 1 l n r r l n x e x c for each study x e and x c are the mean values of the focal variable either wue or yield under deficit and full irrigation respectively lnrr is a unit free index with positive and negative values respectively indicating an increase or decrease of wue or yield under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation effect values close to 0 lnrr 0 indicate little or no effect of deficit irrigation the within column variance v lnrr associated with each lnrr value was calculated from the standard deviation associated with each wue and yield value using the formula 2 v l n r r s e 2 n e x e 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where se and sc are the standard deviations of the target variable in the experimental and control groups respectively and ne and nc are the sample sizes of the target variable in the experimental and control groups respectively benítez lópez et al 2017 if no standard deviation was quoted in a particular study we used one the following methods i if the study provided years of data standard deviations were calculated ii otherwise deviations were assumed to be 1 10 of the mean luo et al 2006 tian et al 2015 a random effects model hedges et al 1999 gurevitch and hedges 1999 was selected because regression coefficients are likely to differ among ecological studies and there will be sampling errors between estimates of coefficient among studies hedges et al 1999 the weighted mean response ratios were calculated using the following formula 3 l n r r i 1 k w i l i i k w i where i is the number of the study k is the cumulative number and w is the weight of each response ratio 95 confidence intervals 95 ci were calculated using the following equation 4 95 c i l n r r 1 96 1 i 1 k w i the lnrr was considered to be significantly different from 0 if the 95 confidence interval did not include 0 specifically the lnrr results are shown as a percentage elnrr 1 100 based on the comparison between limited and full irrigation in order to examine the heterogeneity between studies the qt statistic was used to describe the total variation among studies duffy et al 2017 qt is a statistic based on a chi squared test used to examine the heterogeneity across case studies a significant value of qt indicates that effect sizes are not equal across studies implying that other explanatory variables influence the results meta analysis and lnrr calculations were conducted using openmee software designed to conduct meta analyses of data from ecological and evolutionary studies wallace et al 2017 gurevitch et al 2018 2 3 publication and bias we searched for possible biases in effect sizes by repeating our analyses on subsets of the selected studies any possibility of publication bias in the overall database for each response variable was assessed using a funnel plot wallace et al 2017 the funnel plot of all variables was symmetrical see fig a 1 and fig a 2 suggesting no publication bias was present in addition we also used rosenthal s fail safe number orwin 1983 which estimates the number of additional studies that would be required to invalidate statistically significant results in the meta analysis 5 n 5 k 10 where n is the fail safe number and k is the number of studies in our meta analysis k is 381 and n values calculated using openmee are 154 862 for yield and 354 965 for wue since both of these n numbers are significantly more than 1915 5 381 10 the calculations indicate that the results are reliable 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the database was derived from 41 articles including 381 pairs of observations of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation the frequency distributions of effect sizes on yield and wue of wheat were found to follow a normal distribution fig 1 a and b the overall effect sizes of wue and yield were 0 06 and 0 182 and the 95 cis were 0 04 to 0 08 and 0 208 to 0 155 respectively that is wheat wue is 6 2 higher but yield is 16 6 lower than that of full irrigation however there was significant residual heterogeneity in the random effects meta analysis for wue and yield qt 2832 13 and 5545 40 p 0 001 which means that moderators are required for in depth explanations therefore irrigation and environmental factors were used as moderators in an attempt to explain the heterogeneity 3 2 effects of different deficit irrigation methods on wue and yield the irrigation method timing and amounts are all significantly affect responses of wheat wue and yield to deficit irrigation irrigation methods exhibited very different responses to deficit irrigation across all observations fig 2 across all studies for irrigation methods deficit irrigation decreased wheat yield by 19 83 2 2 20 1 and 15 2 when using sprinkler border drip and flood irrigations respectively but increased wheat yield by 10 8 when using furrow irrigation in contrast deficit irrigation increased wheat wue by 11 5 16 6 3 4 and 5 7 when using sprinkler border flood and furrow irrigation but decreased wheat wue by 18 1 using drip irrigation only furrow irrigation increased wue and yield under deficit irrigation but this result was not significant because the 95 ci of furrow irrigation included 0 fig 2a when the timing of deficit irrigation is considered deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation significantly decreased wheat yield by 14 1 vegetative 21 6 reproductive and 18 3 throughout the season but increased wheat wue by 2 6 8 2 and 13 0 respectively the results for wue in the vegetative and reproductive stages were not significant fig 2b the total heterogeneity was also significantly affected by the deficit irrigation level the effect size of deficit irrigation on yield was positively correlated with the volume of water used expressed as a fraction of the normal irrigation volume fig 3 a when this fraction is 0 945 the yield obtained is equal to that obtained under normal irrigation moreover deficit irrigation decreased yield by 0 7 13 2 23 7 and 33 0 when the irrigation level is in the ranges 1 0 8 0 8 0 6 0 6 0 4 and 0 4 0 respectively fig 2c the effect size of wue increased and then decreased as irrigation water amount increased with the highest vertex coordinate being 0 79 0 11 fig 3b similarly deficit irrigation increased wue by 7 7 8 0 and 10 7 respectively but decreased wue by 1 8 when relative water amount was 0 40 fig 2c 3 3 effects of environmental factors on wue and yield precipitation temperature and soil properties significantly affected wheat yield and wue under deficit irrigation the effect sizes of deficit irrigation on wue and yield were both highly correlated with precipitation during the growing season fig 4 a both wue and yield showed the same trend with precipitation initially decreasing and then increasing as precipitation increased the decreases in yield associated with deficit irrigation were 13 3 and 19 3 for precipitation categories 200 mm and 200 mm respectively deficit irrigation increased wheat wue by 4 7 and 2 1 in regions where precipitation during the growing season amounted to 200 mm and 200 mm respectively effect in regions with 200 mm precipitation was not significant because the 95 ci contains 0 fig 5 a the effect size of deficit irrigation on yield was negatively correlated with average annual temperature but not significant relationship between wue and average annual temperature was detected fig 4b the decrease in yield associated with deficit irrigation was higher in areas with an average annual temperature 9 18 5 than in areas with lower average annual temperatures 8 6 the increases in wue under deficit irrigation with average annual temperatures 9 and 9 were 7 5 and 4 0 respectively fig 5b soil texture bulk density and ph significantly affected wheat yield and wue under deficit irrigation deficit irrigation decreased yield of wheat in clay clay loam loam and sandy soil by 23 0 32 0 8 1 and 9 8 respectively changes in wue under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation were 3 1 9 4 6 4 and 34 6 for clay clay loam loam and sandy soil respectively fig 5c the decreased yield of wheat in soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was 16 9 and 4 0 higher than that of soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm3 whereas the increase in wue of wheat for soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was 0 7 and 3 1 for density 1 35 g cm3 fig 5d the decrease in yield of wheat in soil having ph 7 and 7 were 6 8 and 13 3 respectively and the increases in wue were 5 8 and 11 9 respectively both effect sizes for yield and wue in response to deficit irrigation were not significant due to small sample sizes n 4 fig 5e 3 4 overall trade off or win win relationship between wue and yield under deficit irrigation in order to better understand how deficit irrigation can be used to increase or maintain production and save water in the future we analyzed the homogeneity of successful case studies in which deficit irrigation provided high yield and enhanced wue we plotted the 381 paired data points of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation on a cartesian plane and the data were divided into five zones i ii iii iv and v based on the zero and average effect size the plot clearly visualized trade off win win and lose lose relationships between yield and wue fig 6 the points in zone i represent increases in both wue and yield under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation conversely the points in zone iii represent decreases in both yield and wue the points in zone ii represent increase in yield but decrease in wue importantly zone v represents the situation of minimize tradeoff that is the points were higher than average effect size lnrr 0 182 of yield but less than 0 the points in zone iv represent the decrease in yield but increase in wue intuitively the points in zone i represent a win win situation where yield and wue increase while points in zone v represent a good trade off between marginally decreased yield but improved wue the goals we wish to achieve in practice our analysis shows a win win situation where wue and yield both increase under deficit irrigation can be achieved although zone i only contains 17 6 of all data points there were almost no data points in the zone ii with 35 3 and 17 1 of the points in zones iii and iv were respectively 30 0 of the points were in zone v fig 7 significant differences within the five zones were observed so it is necessary to analyze whether the factors in each zone are different this analysis may help guide the use of deficit irrigation in the future by identifying factors that achieve high wue and yield under deficit irrigation the percentages of irrigation and environmental factors in each zone are listed in tables 1 and 2 for convenience we refer to zones i and v collectively as the target zone deficit irrigation methods and regional environment both showed significant differences in performance across the five zones in the target zone the percentage of furrow irrigation was highest 93 3 followed by border 66 7 sprinkler 46 8 flood 28 1 and drip irrigation 28 6 the percentages of irrigation timing were similar among vegetative reproductive and throughout the season and were 56 7 54 7 and 44 2 respectively the deficit irrigation levels for the ranges 1 0 8 0 8 0 6 0 6 0 4 and 0 4 0 in the target zone were 71 3 48 1 38 3 and 25 0 respectively table 1 the percentage where the precipitation is 200 mm was 52 9 higher than that for precipitation 200 mm by 15 1 there were no significant differences in the target zone where the annual average temperature was 9 44 4 and 9 49 5 the percentages of loam 57 9 and sandy soil 58 8 were similar and significantly higher than clay 31 5 and clay loam 14 5 the percentage of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was 49 7 and was significantly higher by 17 7 than that of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 similarly the percentage of ph 7 75 0 in the target zone was significantly higher than that of ph 7 54 8 4 discussion sustainably feeding the growing global population in the face of climate change and dwindling water resources is a major challenge zheng et al 2019 the results of our global meta analysis provide a systematic and quantitative analysis of the impacts of deficit irrigation on the wue and yield of wheat the overall results showed a slight increase in crop wue lnrr 0 06 but a significant decrease in yield lnrr 0 182 it is not advisable to increase wue at the cost of reducing yield by reducing irrigation however the case studies reveal varying responses of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation due to differences in experimental settings and regional environments therefore it is necessary to identify positive factors impacting wheat wue and yield in order to develop deficit irrigation strategies that increase yield while reducing water use 4 1 effects of deficit irrigation methods on wue and yield the results of our meta analysis indicate that response of wheat wue and yield to deficit irrigation treatments vary significantly in response to deficit irrigation treatments depending on factors such as irrigation methods timing and volumes irrigation methods such as furrow and border systems have a more positive effect on wheat wue and yield than sprinkler and drip systems under deficit irrigation this may be because normal furrow and border irrigation may cause uneven distribution of water in the soil abbasi et al 2003 causing excessive build up of water in some locations leading to hypoxia or anoxia over an extended period of time which is not conducive to root respiration and soil nutrient transport thus reducing amounts of water used in furrow and border irrigation may improve oxygen levels in the soil reduce nutrient losses and thereby increase wue and yield sprinkler and drip irrigation have been suggested as means of supplying most types of crops with frequent and uniform applications of water as they are adaptable and can be used at sites with a wide range of topographic and soil conditions cetin and bilgel 2002 dagdelen et al 2006 however deficit irrigation with drip and sprinkler systems showed the largest reduction in yield and wue this may be because normal drip and sprinkler irrigation systems provide better water conditions for crops than other irrigation methods so deficit irrigation using these systems generally leads to reductions in wue and yield camp 1998 it should be noted that deficit irrigation with sprinkler irrigation improved wheat wue but decreased yield fig 2a largely because evapotranspiration was greatly reduced sezen and yazar 2006 these insights provide a new perspective of yield and wue under different deficit irrigation methods and provide the basis for interesting follow up studies regarding deficit irrigation timing our meta analysis which was based on a considerable amount of data revealed that the greatest reduction in yields relative to yield obtained with full irrigation occurred if deficit irrigation was applied during the reproductive stage possibly due to water stress at the flowering stage robertson and giunta 1994 water shortage at anthesis significantly inhibits formation of flowers and ultimately reduces the quantity of grain grewal 2010 another possible reason is that water deficit during reproductive growth limits the growth of reproductive organs which need large amounts of water zhang et al 2006 the results also revealed that deficit irrigation throughout the season has a beneficial effect on wue however some researchers have concluded that soil drying in the early vegetative growth period and severe soil drying in the mature period is an optimum deficit irrigation regime for wheat kang et al 2002 our meta analysis includes a wide variety of studies so it is perhaps inevitable that some of the findings will not be conclusive we also note the difficulty of accurately identifying all growing stages in each of the studies we believe the results of this section should be given careful consideration and follow up studies should be developed in order to better understand how the timing of deficit irrigation affects wue and yield the amount of water used for wheat irrigation has a remarkable effect on wue and yield the results perhaps unsurprisingly revealed the yield decreases as the amount of irrigation water decreases however when the deficit irrigation amount is 94 5 of the full irrigation amount the yield is unaffected the wue of wheat in relation to the amount of water used showed a parabolic trend and the maximum wue was obtained at 79 of full irrigation water amount the results indicated that the irrigation water amount to achieve maximum yield is higher than maximum wue which is consistent with yu and wang 2010 and fan et al 2018 on the other hand the result also indicated that the improvement in wue was not synonymous with high yield under limited water condition even with significant yield of reduction and is consistent with the findings of blum 2009 the main reason for this is significant correlation between the transpirational and photosynthetic capacities of leaves in response to water stress flexas et al 2016 a major goal for improving crop performance in the context of climate change would be to increase both photosynthesis and wue up to now this goal has not been achieved using the method of integrated analysis 4 2 effects of environmental factors on wue and yield the results confirmed as expected that responses of wheat wue and wheat yield to deficit irrigation were affected by environmental factors including precipitation temperature and soil properties effect sizes of deficit irrigation on wue and yield both initially decreased initially then increased as precipitation increased figs 4a and 5 a the results indicate that precipitation during the growing season is one of the most important factors affecting wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation high wheat yield and wue using deficit irrigation were easier to achieve in arid areas possibly because crops in arid areas are generally more resistant to drought banik et al 2016 and when appropriate water deficit occurs it will promote crop performance under deficit irrigation conditions gilbert and medina 2016 on the other hand data displayed in fig 4a indicate that in wet areas with sufficient rainfall high yield and wue can also be obtained through deficit irrigation a possible reason for this is that deficit irrigation can avoid excessive soil saturation and create favorable water temperature air conditions xu et al 2016 our results showed that the higher the average annual temperature was the greater the wheat yield reduction was however there was no significant relationship between annual average temperature and wue fig 4b wue is a function of photosynthesis carbon assimilation and water loss gago et al 2014 and has significant coordination between the diffusional and photosynthetic capacities of leaves flexas et al 2016 in other words although high temperature may significantly reduce wheat yield it also increases et mahmood 1997 thus wue does not change significantly as temperature changes for soil texture the effect sizes of wue and yield under deficit irrigation tended to increase as clay content decreased tolk et al 1999 suggested that textural characteristics of soils affect both rooting and the extraction of water from the soil which limit a plant s ability to tolerate water stress typical soil water retention curves from clay versus sandy soils show higher content of plant available water which is however more tightly bound i e present in smaller soil pores in clay soils taiz and zeiger 2002 therefore when water deficit occurs the change of soil moisture in clay soil is significantly larger than it is in sandy soil thus crops growing in sandy soil are generally more prone to drought which may improve their wue than crops growing in clay in fact due to the extensive deep root system wheat may develop in clay soil zhang et al 2004 it can be difficult to assess if deficit irrigation actually imposes a drought stress on the crop these observations are consistent with the findings of fensham et al 2015 the performance of wue and wheat yield in response to deficit irrigation with soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was better than that of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 the main reason is that soil with low bulk density has large pores and experiences greater infiltration and evaporation under water deficit than soil with high bulk density wang et al 2018 on the other hand deficit irrigation can increase oxygen levels in soil with high bulk density compared with normal irrigation resulting in increased nutrient uptake and elongation of roots wolkowski and lowery 2008 the effect size of wue showed the opposite trend to that of yield in response to deficit irrigation with soil ph 7 and 7 this result might be attributed to ammonia volatilization in alkaline soils carrijo et al 2017 which will most likely be aggravated because of more aerobic conditions induced du et al 2018 by deficit irrigation so reduced nitrogen absorption under deficit irrigation in alkaline soils may result in lower yields due to the small sample size with ph 7 n 4 the effect values are not significant so a larger study needs to be undertaken in order to obtain more robust conclusions 4 3 maintaining or increasing yield while increasing wue using deficit irrigation our meta analysis demonstrated that it is possible to increase yield and wue using deficit irrigation a win win situation but only 17 6 of the data points in our analysis exhibited it in short it is difficult to implement deficit irrigation in such a way that wue and yield are both increased therefore we also considered the possibility of minimizing tradeoffs by identifying data points in which the effect size of wue is positive and the effect value of yield is higher than the mean but less than 0 zone v specifically zones i and v the target zone contain data points corresponding to the outcomes that we wish to achieve in practice the result in tables 1 and 2 was generally consistent with the results of various moderators notably table 1 shows that the points in the target zone were more likely to be associated with deficit irrigation during the vegetative stage rather than the reproductive stage or throughout the season whereas fig 2 showed that the best time to perform deficit irrigation was throughout the season the reason for this difference may be that the division of development stages is not detailed enough because many articles prefer to study the combination of multiple development stages stone et al 2001 importantly except for the moderator of irrigation volume the yield and wue show a consistent trend in response to deficit irrigation sorted by other moderators which is one of the reasons why there are fewer points in the win win zone our results suggest that if we want to achieve a win win situation the amount of water used for deficit irrigation should not be less than 94 5 of the full irrigation amount and if we want to achieve a trade off situation the percentage ranges from 79 to 94 5 the range of irrigation water amount to achieve minimum trade off is 61 5 94 5 of full irrigation amount these observations may provide guidance for deficit irrigation parameters according to local needs and requirements for yield and wue 4 4 implications and limitations our findings have important implications for scientists farmers and policy makers producing and justly distributing sufficient food for a growing population while minimizing use of precious water resources is posing sever challenges optimal strategies for deficit irrigation to increase or at least maintain yield and save water depend on numerous factors that vary regionally such as local soil conditions climate and management practices our results show that win win relationships between wue and yield may be achieved in regions with suitable precipitation temperature and soil properties using appropriate irrigation methods at appropriate times with appropriate amounts of water in order to maximize win win or minimize trade off relationships between wue and yield careful special attention should be paid to effects of relative irrigation amounts on yield and wue due to differences in their responses to amounts of supplied water in the future investment should focus on field management measures that take into account both efficient use of natural resources and productivity when modifying and adapting intensive agricultural systems karimi et al 2012 cui et al 2013 for instance combining mulching fertilization farming and irrigation technology with deficit irrigation can provide strategies satisfying many of the requirements of sustainable intensification karimi et al 2012 however our study also has some limitations due to the difficulty of finding paired data in existing field research studies relating to wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation our meta analysis highlights for example the need to consider the timing of deficit irrigation in more detail stone et al 2001 similarly seasonal temperatures and relative humidity or vapor pressure deficit significantly affect yield and wue under well and deficit irrigation alghory and yazar 2019 but most studies have considered effects of average annual temperature in the future studies should provide detailed climatic data especially during the growth period in addition there was a strong geographical bias in the dataset that likely has implications for the results of this analysis asian countries were overrepresented in the dataset especially in china for guiding future decision of deficit irrigation regarding applicability and performance in different contexts it is better to undertake field research of deficit irrigation in under represented areas to minimize data biases finally there were too few studies and observations to conduct the interactive analysis that is needed to fully elucidate effects of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and wue 5 conclusion numerous studies have examined the effects of deficit irrigation on yield and wue of wheat however it is not clear how to implemented deficit irrigation to achieve a win win of yield and wue our objectives in this analysis were to evaluated and identify management and environment under which deficit irrigation can be practiced to achieve a win win we found that deficit irrigation performed better in precipitation with 200 mm and the soil with loamy or sandy and is more appropriate for border and furrow than drip and sprinkler irrigation importantly we gave threshold of relative irrigation amount water to achieve four scenarios of yield and wue under deficit irrigation these results demonstrate that deficit irrigation is a promising practice the regional environment and

improvements can be realized keywords limited irrigation yield water use efficiency meta analysis win win trade off 1 introduction agriculture globally faces the major challenge of feeding a growing population while water resources are becoming increasingly scarce especially in the context of global climate change hanjra and qureshi 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 by 2050 the global population is expected to reach 9 6 billion and the global demand for food is expected to double godfray et al 2010 tilman et al 2011 globally only 17 of croplands are irrigated but these lands account for 40 of total food production molden et al 2010 and agriculture accounts for 70 of all fresh water use fao 2007 however the availability of water globally is threatened by climate change and population growth vorosmarty et al 2000 thus it is essential to find ways to reduce water use in agriculture while maintaining or increasing yields rosegrant et al 2009 wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the key staple crops on which global food security depends with about 730 million tons harvested annually from a total area of around 2 1 million km2 around the world shiferaw et al 2013 the world bank has estimated that global production of wheat would need to increase by 60 to meet the food requirements of a population of 9 6 billion by 2050 savadi et al 2018 therefore increasing wheat yield while reducing irrigation is an urgent priority and poses a significant challenge due to dwindling land and water resources and climate change brauman et al 2013 in deficit irrigation a concept introduced in the 1970s irrigation volumes are recduced at certain times in the growing season to save water resources while largely maintaining or even improving yield kang et al 2002 du et al 2015 considerable effort has been spentexamining whether deficit irrigation can maintain or improve yield using less water zhang et al 1998 du et al 2010 these studies showed that the empirical coefficients in the relationship vary with climate crop type and variety irrigation method and soil texture for example some studies have found that crop yields can be largely maintained and product quality can be improved while substantially reducing volumes of water used for irrigation sharma and alonso neto 1986 zhang et al 1999 kang et al 2002 however others have found that although deficit irrigation reduced water use and increased wue to some extent it also greatly reduced yield huang et al 2005 tari 2016 the main sources of variability in the results are the timing of irrigation reductions the extent to which irrigation is reduced and environmental factors kang et al 2002 in addition researchers are rarely able to examine effects of a wide range of irrigation methods or growing environments because of limitations imposed by available human material and financial resources therefore a meta analysis of deficit irrigation is needed to examine these variations qualitatively and draw general quantitative conclusions meta analysis is the quantitative scientific synthesis of research results it can be used to establish evidence based practice and resolve seemingly conflicting research outcomes gurevitch et al 2018 to date there have been few meta analyses of deficit irrigation studies sadras 2009 adu et al 2018 moreover previous meta analyses have focused largely on the comparison of different irrigation types full irrigation deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying irrigation in efforts to identify optimal irrigation methods they have not systematically addressed variations in outcomes of a particular irrigation method and sources of the variation furthermore these meta analyses have considered crop wue or yield but not both hence the relationship between wue and agricultural yield in response to deficit irrigation remains poorly understood at the global scale in some case studies researchers have regarded high wue as an important determinant of yield under stress blum 2009 however high wue is often if not always associated with low photosynthesis due to significant correlation between leaves transpirational and photosynthetic capacities of leaves flexas et al 2016 to assist efforts to meet the challenges of increasing agricultural crop production and reducing water consumption imposed by climate change and an increasing global population there is a clear need for a global synthesis of wheat wue and yield responses to deficit irrigation therefore the primary objectives of this study were to apply global meta analysis in an effort to 1 determine how deficit irrigation affects wheat wue and yield concurrently 2 identify the main factors responsible for the variation in effects and 3 identify deficit irrigation strategies that can maximize win win effects and minimize trade offs between wue and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and extraction we used the web of science and google scholar to identify relevant peer reviewed literature from 1970 to 2019 the search was performed using the search terms wheat or triticum aestivum and water use efficiency or efficiency of water use or wue or water productivity and yield or gain yield and limited irrigation or deficit irrigation or regulated deficit irrigation we also collected data from cnki china national knowledge internet including three published papers written in chinese in total 41 published papers reporting 381 observations of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation satisfied our selection criteria for the meta analysis the list of 41 papers from which the data were extracted are listed in appendix a we screened the publications on the basis of the following criteria only publications describing field experiments with side by side comparisons of full sufficient and deficit irrigation were selected and pot experiments were excluded importantly other inclusion criteria included strict enforcement of full sufficient irrigation and documentation of paired data of yield and wue of wheat under full sufficient and deficit irrigation together with standard deviation error for wue and simple size in this study we mainly focus on agronomic crop wue at field level defined following viets 1962 as the ratio between yield the economic output of crops and evapotranspiration et observations of leaf or whole plant level are not included in addition several explanatory variables referred to as moderators in our meta analysis could affect wue and yield under deficit irrigation these moderators include irrigation and environmental factors therefore we extracted classified and stored the following data as described in appendix b i the means standard deviations or standard errors of wue and yield and sizes of samples used to obtain them ii the location and geographic coordinates of the study site iii the amount of water used for deficit irrigation as a proportion of the full amount divided into four

two categories 7 and 7 when data from the selected studies had been presented graphically the figures were first digitized to extract the numerical values using the get data graph digitizer ver 2 22 russian federation 2 2 statistical analyses we used the log response ratios as a metric of the effect size in this meta analysis hedges et al 1999 1 l n r r l n x e x c for each study x e and x c are the mean values of the focal variable either wue or yield under deficit and full irrigation respectively lnrr is a unit free index with positive and negative values respectively indicating an increase or decrease of wue or yield under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation effect values close to 0 lnrr 0 indicate little or no effect of deficit irrigation the within column variance v lnrr associated with each lnrr value was calculated from the standard deviation associated with each wue and yield value using the formula 2 v l n r r s e 2 n e x e 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where se and sc are the standard deviations of the target variable in the experimental and control groups respectively and ne and nc are the sample sizes of the target variable in the experimental and control groups respectively benítez lópez et al 2017 if no standard deviation was quoted in a particular study we used one the following methods i if the study provided years of data standard deviations were calculated ii otherwise deviations were assumed to be 1 10 of the mean luo et al 2006 tian et al 2015 a random effects model hedges et al 1999 gurevitch and hedges 1999 was selected because regression coefficients are likely to differ among ecological studies and there will be sampling errors between estimates of coefficient among studies hedges et al 1999 the weighted mean response ratios were calculated using the following formula 3 l n r r i 1 k w i l i i k w i where i is the number of the study k is the cumulative number and w is the weight of each response ratio 95 confidence intervals 95 ci were calculated using the following equation 4 95 c i l n r r 1 96 1 i 1 k w i the lnrr was considered to be significantly different from 0 if the 95 confidence interval did not include 0 specifically the lnrr results are shown as a percentage elnrr 1 100 based on the comparison between limited and full irrigation in order to examine the heterogeneity between studies the qt statistic was used to describe the total variation among studies duffy et al 2017 qt is a statistic based on a chi squared test used to examine the heterogeneity across case studies a significant value of qt indicates that effect sizes are not equal across studies implying that other explanatory variables influence the results meta analysis and lnrr calculations were conducted using openmee software designed to conduct meta analyses of data from ecological and evolutionary studies wallace et al 2017 gurevitch et al 2018 2 3 publication and bias we searched for possible biases in effect sizes by repeating our analyses on subsets of the selected studies any possibility of publication bias in the overall database for each response variable was assessed using a funnel plot wallace et al 2017 the funnel plot of all variables was symmetrical see fig a 1 and fig a 2 suggesting no publication bias was present in addition we also used rosenthal s fail safe number orwin 1983 which estimates the number of additional studies that would be required to invalidate statistically significant results in the meta analysis 5 n 5 k 10 where n is the fail safe number and k is the number of studies in our meta analysis k is 381 and n values calculated using openmee are 154 862 for yield and 354 965 for wue since both of these n numbers are significantly more than 1915 5 381 10 the calculations indicate that the results are reliable 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the database was derived from 41 articles including 381 pairs of observations of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation the frequency distributions of effect sizes on yield and wue of wheat were found to follow a normal distribution fig 1 a and b the overall effect sizes of wue and yield were 0 06 and 0 182 and the 95 cis were 0 04 to 0 08 and 0 208 to 0 155 respectively that is wheat wue is 6 2 higher but yield is 16 6 lower than that of full irrigation however there was significant residual heterogeneity in the random effects meta analysis for wue and yield qt 2832 13 and 5545 40 p 0 001 which means that moderators are required for in depth explanations therefore irrigation and environmental factors were used as moderators in an attempt to explain the heterogeneity 3 2 effects of different deficit irrigation methods on wue and yield the irrigation method timing and amounts are all significantly affect responses of wheat wue and yield to deficit irrigation irrigation methods exhibited very different responses to deficit irrigation across all observations fig 2 across all studies for irrigation methods deficit irrigation decreased wheat yield by 19 83 2 2 20 1 and 15 2 when using sprinkler border drip and flood irrigations respectively but increased wheat yield by 10 8 when using furrow irrigation in contrast deficit irrigation increased wheat wue by 11 5 16 6 3 4 and 5 7 when using sprinkler border flood and furrow irrigation but decreased wheat wue by 18 1 using drip irrigation only furrow irrigation increased wue and yield under deficit irrigation but this result was not significant because the 95 ci of furrow irrigation included 0 fig 2a when the timing of deficit irrigation is considered deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation significantly decreased wheat yield by 14 1 vegetative 21 6 reproductive and 18 3 throughout the season but increased wheat wue by 2 6 8 2 and 13 0 respectively the results for wue in the vegetative and reproductive stages were not significant fig 2b the total heterogeneity was also significantly affected by the deficit irrigation level the effect size of deficit irrigation on yield was positively correlated with the volume of water used expressed as a fraction of the normal irrigation volume fig 3 a when this fraction is 0 945 the yield obtained is equal to that obtained under normal irrigation moreover deficit irrigation decreased yield by 0 7 13 2 23 7 and 33 0 when the irrigation level is in the ranges 1 0 8 0 8 0 6 0 6 0 4 and 0 4 0 respectively fig 2c the effect size of wue increased and then decreased as irrigation water amount increased with the highest vertex coordinate being 0 79 0 11 fig 3b similarly deficit irrigation increased wue by 7 7 8 0 and 10 7 respectively but decreased wue by 1 8 when relative water amount was 0 40 fig 2c 3 3 effects of environmental factors on wue and yield precipitation temperature and soil properties significantly affected wheat yield and wue under deficit irrigation the effect sizes of deficit irrigation on wue and yield were both highly correlated with precipitation during the growing season fig 4 a both wue and yield showed the same trend with precipitation initially decreasing and then increasing as precipitation increased the decreases in yield associated with deficit irrigation were 13 3 and 19 3 for precipitation categories 200 mm and 200 mm respectively deficit irrigation increased wheat wue by 4 7 and 2 1 in regions where precipitation during the growing season amounted to 200 mm and 200 mm respectively effect in regions with 200 mm precipitation was not significant because the 95 ci contains 0 fig 5 a the effect size of deficit irrigation on yield was negatively correlated with average annual temperature but not significant relationship between wue and average annual temperature was detected fig 4b the decrease in yield associated with deficit irrigation was higher in areas with an average annual temperature 9 18 5 than in areas with lower average annual temperatures 8 6 the increases in wue under deficit irrigation with average annual temperatures 9 and 9 were 7 5 and 4 0 respectively fig 5b soil texture bulk density and ph significantly affected wheat yield and wue under deficit irrigation deficit irrigation decreased yield of wheat in clay clay loam loam and sandy soil by 23 0 32 0 8 1 and 9 8 respectively changes in wue under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation were 3 1 9 4 6 4 and 34 6 for clay clay loam loam and sandy soil respectively fig 5c the decreased yield of wheat in soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was 16 9 and 4 0 higher than that of soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm3 whereas the increase in wue of wheat for soil with bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was 0 7 and 3 1 for density 1 35 g cm3 fig 5d the decrease in yield of wheat in soil having ph 7 and 7 were 6 8 and 13 3 respectively and the increases in wue were 5 8 and 11 9 respectively both effect sizes for yield and wue in response to deficit irrigation were not significant due to small sample sizes n 4 fig 5e 3 4 overall trade off or win win relationship between wue and yield under deficit irrigation in order to better understand how deficit irrigation can be used to increase or maintain production and save water in the future we analyzed the homogeneity of successful case studies in which deficit irrigation provided high yield and enhanced wue we plotted the 381 paired data points of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation on a cartesian plane and the data were divided into five zones i ii iii iv and v based on the zero and average effect size the plot clearly visualized trade off win win and lose lose relationships between yield and wue fig 6 the points in zone i represent increases in both wue and yield under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation conversely the points in zone iii represent decreases in both yield and wue the points in zone ii represent increase in yield but decrease in wue importantly zone v represents the situation of minimize tradeoff that is the points were higher than average effect size lnrr 0 182 of yield but less than 0 the points in zone iv represent the decrease in yield but increase in wue intuitively the points in zone i represent a win win situation where yield and wue increase while points in zone v represent a good trade off between marginally decreased yield but improved wue the goals we wish to achieve in practice our analysis shows a win win situation where wue and yield both increase under deficit irrigation can be achieved although zone i only contains 17 6 of all data points there were almost no data points in the zone ii with 35 3 and 17 1 of the points in zones iii and iv were respectively 30 0 of the points were in zone v fig 7 significant differences within the five zones were observed so it is necessary to analyze whether the factors in each zone are different this analysis may help guide the use of deficit irrigation in the future by identifying factors that achieve high wue and yield under deficit irrigation the percentages of irrigation and environmental factors in each zone are listed in tables 1 and 2 for convenience we refer to zones i and v collectively as the target zone deficit irrigation methods and regional environment both showed significant differences in performance across the five zones in the target zone the percentage of furrow irrigation was highest 93 3 followed by border 66 7 sprinkler 46 8 flood 28 1 and drip irrigation 28 6 the percentages of irrigation timing were similar among vegetative reproductive and throughout the season and were 56 7 54 7 and 44 2 respectively the deficit irrigation levels for the ranges 1 0 8 0 8 0 6 0 6 0 4 and 0 4 0 in the target zone were 71 3 48 1 38 3 and 25 0 respectively table 1 the percentage where the precipitation is 200 mm was 52 9 higher than that for precipitation 200 mm by 15 1 there were no significant differences in the target zone where the annual average temperature was 9 44 4 and 9 49 5 the percentages of loam 57 9 and sandy soil 58 8 were similar and significantly higher than clay 31 5 and clay loam 14 5 the percentage of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was 49 7 and was significantly higher by 17 7 than that of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 similarly the percentage of ph 7 75 0 in the target zone was significantly higher than that of ph 7 54 8 4 discussion sustainably feeding the growing global population in the face of climate change and dwindling water resources is a major challenge zheng et al 2019 the results of our global meta analysis provide a systematic and quantitative analysis of the impacts of deficit irrigation on the wue and yield of wheat the overall results showed a slight increase in crop wue lnrr 0 06 but a significant decrease in yield lnrr 0 182 it is not advisable to increase wue at the cost of reducing yield by reducing irrigation however the case studies reveal varying responses of wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation due to differences in experimental settings and regional environments therefore it is necessary to identify positive factors impacting wheat wue and yield in order to develop deficit irrigation strategies that increase yield while reducing water use 4 1 effects of deficit irrigation methods on wue and yield the results of our meta analysis indicate that response of wheat wue and yield to deficit irrigation treatments vary significantly in response to deficit irrigation treatments depending on factors such as irrigation methods timing and volumes irrigation methods such as furrow and border systems have a more positive effect on wheat wue and yield than sprinkler and drip systems under deficit irrigation this may be because normal furrow and border irrigation may cause uneven distribution of water in the soil abbasi et al 2003 causing excessive build up of water in some locations leading to hypoxia or anoxia over an extended period of time which is not conducive to root respiration and soil nutrient transport thus reducing amounts of water used in furrow and border irrigation may improve oxygen levels in the soil reduce nutrient losses and thereby increase wue and yield sprinkler and drip irrigation have been suggested as means of supplying most types of crops with frequent and uniform applications of water as they are adaptable and can be used at sites with a wide range of topographic and soil conditions cetin and bilgel 2002 dagdelen et al 2006 however deficit irrigation with drip and sprinkler systems showed the largest reduction in yield and wue this may be because normal drip and sprinkler irrigation systems provide better water conditions for crops than other irrigation methods so deficit irrigation using these systems generally leads to reductions in wue and yield camp 1998 it should be noted that deficit irrigation with sprinkler irrigation improved wheat wue but decreased yield fig 2a largely because evapotranspiration was greatly reduced sezen and yazar 2006 these insights provide a new perspective of yield and wue under different deficit irrigation methods and provide the basis for interesting follow up studies regarding deficit irrigation timing our meta analysis which was based on a considerable amount of data revealed that the greatest reduction in yields relative to yield obtained with full irrigation occurred if deficit irrigation was applied during the reproductive stage possibly due to water stress at the flowering stage robertson and giunta 1994 water shortage at anthesis significantly inhibits formation of flowers and ultimately reduces the quantity of grain grewal 2010 another possible reason is that water deficit during reproductive growth limits the growth of reproductive organs which need large amounts of water zhang et al 2006 the results also revealed that deficit irrigation throughout the season has a beneficial effect on wue however some researchers have concluded that soil drying in the early vegetative growth period and severe soil drying in the mature period is an optimum deficit irrigation regime for wheat kang et al 2002 our meta analysis includes a wide variety of studies so it is perhaps inevitable that some of the findings will not be conclusive we also note the difficulty of accurately identifying all growing stages in each of the studies we believe the results of this section should be given careful consideration and follow up studies should be developed in order to better understand how the timing of deficit irrigation affects wue and yield the amount of water used for wheat irrigation has a remarkable effect on wue and yield the results perhaps unsurprisingly revealed the yield decreases as the amount of irrigation water decreases however when the deficit irrigation amount is 94 5 of the full irrigation amount the yield is unaffected the wue of wheat in relation to the amount of water used showed a parabolic trend and the maximum wue was obtained at 79 of full irrigation water amount the results indicated that the irrigation water amount to achieve maximum yield is higher than maximum wue which is consistent with yu and wang 2010 and fan et al 2018 on the other hand the result also indicated that the improvement in wue was not synonymous with high yield under limited water condition even with significant yield of reduction and is consistent with the findings of blum 2009 the main reason for this is significant correlation between the transpirational and photosynthetic capacities of leaves in response to water stress flexas et al 2016 a major goal for improving crop performance in the context of climate change would be to increase both photosynthesis and wue up to now this goal has not been achieved using the method of integrated analysis 4 2 effects of environmental factors on wue and yield the results confirmed as expected that responses of wheat wue and wheat yield to deficit irrigation were affected by environmental factors including precipitation temperature and soil properties effect sizes of deficit irrigation on wue and yield both initially decreased initially then increased as precipitation increased figs 4a and 5 a the results indicate that precipitation during the growing season is one of the most important factors affecting wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation high wheat yield and wue using deficit irrigation were easier to achieve in arid areas possibly because crops in arid areas are generally more resistant to drought banik et al 2016 and when appropriate water deficit occurs it will promote crop performance under deficit irrigation conditions gilbert and medina 2016 on the other hand data displayed in fig 4a indicate that in wet areas with sufficient rainfall high yield and wue can also be obtained through deficit irrigation a possible reason for this is that deficit irrigation can avoid excessive soil saturation and create favorable water temperature air conditions xu et al 2016 our results showed that the higher the average annual temperature was the greater the wheat yield reduction was however there was no significant relationship between annual average temperature and wue fig 4b wue is a function of photosynthesis carbon assimilation and water loss gago et al 2014 and has significant coordination between the diffusional and photosynthetic capacities of leaves flexas et al 2016 in other words although high temperature may significantly reduce wheat yield it also increases et mahmood 1997 thus wue does not change significantly as temperature changes for soil texture the effect sizes of wue and yield under deficit irrigation tended to increase as clay content decreased tolk et al 1999 suggested that textural characteristics of soils affect both rooting and the extraction of water from the soil which limit a plant s ability to tolerate water stress typical soil water retention curves from clay versus sandy soils show higher content of plant available water which is however more tightly bound i e present in smaller soil pores in clay soils taiz and zeiger 2002 therefore when water deficit occurs the change of soil moisture in clay soil is significantly larger than it is in sandy soil thus crops growing in sandy soil are generally more prone to drought which may improve their wue than crops growing in clay in fact due to the extensive deep root system wheat may develop in clay soil zhang et al 2004 it can be difficult to assess if deficit irrigation actually imposes a drought stress on the crop these observations are consistent with the findings of fensham et al 2015 the performance of wue and wheat yield in response to deficit irrigation with soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 was better than that of soil bulk density 1 35 g cm3 the main reason is that soil with low bulk density has large pores and experiences greater infiltration and evaporation under water deficit than soil with high bulk density wang et al 2018 on the other hand deficit irrigation can increase oxygen levels in soil with high bulk density compared with normal irrigation resulting in increased nutrient uptake and elongation of roots wolkowski and lowery 2008 the effect size of wue showed the opposite trend to that of yield in response to deficit irrigation with soil ph 7 and 7 this result might be attributed to ammonia volatilization in alkaline soils carrijo et al 2017 which will most likely be aggravated because of more aerobic conditions induced du et al 2018 by deficit irrigation so reduced nitrogen absorption under deficit irrigation in alkaline soils may result in lower yields due to the small sample size with ph 7 n 4 the effect values are not significant so a larger study needs to be undertaken in order to obtain more robust conclusions 4 3 maintaining or increasing yield while increasing wue using deficit irrigation our meta analysis demonstrated that it is possible to increase yield and wue using deficit irrigation a win win situation but only 17 6 of the data points in our analysis exhibited it in short it is difficult to implement deficit irrigation in such a way that wue and yield are both increased therefore we also considered the possibility of minimizing tradeoffs by identifying data points in which the effect size of wue is positive and the effect value of yield is higher than the mean but less than 0 zone v specifically zones i and v the target zone contain data points corresponding to the outcomes that we wish to achieve in practice the result in tables 1 and 2 was generally consistent with the results of various moderators notably table 1 shows that the points in the target zone were more likely to be associated with deficit irrigation during the vegetative stage rather than the reproductive stage or throughout the season whereas fig 2 showed that the best time to perform deficit irrigation was throughout the season the reason for this difference may be that the division of development stages is not detailed enough because many articles prefer to study the combination of multiple development stages stone et al 2001 importantly except for the moderator of irrigation volume the yield and wue show a consistent trend in response to deficit irrigation sorted by other moderators which is one of the reasons why there are fewer points in the win win zone our results suggest that if we want to achieve a win win situation the amount of water used for deficit irrigation should not be less than 94 5 of the full irrigation amount and if we want to achieve a trade off situation the percentage ranges from 79 to 94 5 the range of irrigation water amount to achieve minimum trade off is 61 5 94 5 of full irrigation amount these observations may provide guidance for deficit irrigation parameters according to local needs and requirements for yield and wue 4 4 implications and limitations our findings have important implications for scientists farmers and policy makers producing and justly distributing sufficient food for a growing population while minimizing use of precious water resources is posing sever challenges optimal strategies for deficit irrigation to increase or at least maintain yield and save water depend on numerous factors that vary regionally such as local soil conditions climate and management practices our results show that win win relationships between wue and yield may be achieved in regions with suitable precipitation temperature and soil properties using appropriate irrigation methods at appropriate times with appropriate amounts of water in order to maximize win win or minimize trade off relationships between wue and yield careful special attention should be paid to effects of relative irrigation amounts on yield and wue due to differences in their responses to amounts of supplied water in the future investment should focus on field management measures that take into account both efficient use of natural resources and productivity when modifying and adapting intensive agricultural systems karimi et al 2012 cui et al 2013 for instance combining mulching fertilization farming and irrigation technology with deficit irrigation can provide strategies satisfying many of the requirements of sustainable intensification karimi et al 2012 however our study also has some limitations due to the difficulty of finding paired data in existing field research studies relating to wheat wue and yield under deficit irrigation our meta analysis highlights for example the need to consider the timing of deficit irrigation in more detail stone et al 2001 similarly seasonal temperatures and relative humidity or vapor pressure deficit significantly affect yield and wue under well and deficit irrigation alghory and yazar 2019 but most studies have considered effects of average annual temperature in the future studies should provide detailed climatic data especially during the growth period in addition there was a strong geographical bias in the dataset that likely has implications for the results of this analysis asian countries were overrepresented in the dataset especially in china for guiding future decision of deficit irrigation regarding applicability and performance in different contexts it is better to undertake field research of deficit irrigation in under represented areas to minimize data biases finally there were too few studies and observations to conduct the interactive analysis that is needed to fully elucidate effects of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and wue 5 conclusion numerous studies have examined the effects of deficit irrigation on yield and wue of wheat however it is not clear how to implemented deficit irrigation to achieve a win win of yield and wue our objectives in this analysis were to evaluated and identify management and environment under which deficit irrigation can be practiced to achieve a win win we found that deficit irrigation performed better in precipitation with 200 mm and the soil with loamy or sandy and is more appropriate for border and furrow than drip and sprinkler irrigation importantly we gave threshold of relative irrigation amount water to achieve four scenarios of yield and wue under deficit irrigation these results demonstrate that deficit irrigation is a promising practice the regional environment and

2007 the cvm factor for the labyrinth emitters used in the tapes is less than 0 1 and cannot be controlled by designers clark et al 2005 solomon 1979 von bernuth and solomon 1986 in the design of drip irrigation systems the outflow discharges from all emitters are considered to be equal scaloppi and allen 1993 thokal et al 2001 furthermore for uniform water distribution in the field a maximum 10 difference in emitter discharges is acceptable bucks and myers 1973 keller and karmeli 1974 wu and gitlin 1974 the main cause of the emitters discharge differences non uniform water distribution in the field is the change in farm operating pressure mostafa and sultan 2018 wei et al 2006 another major factor that affects the emitter discharge is the temperature variations in ambient temperature include temperature variations at different times of the day different days of the week and different seasons of the year thokal et al 2001 moreover tight exposure may affect different parts of the drip irrigation system thokal et al 2001 that can change the geometrical shape and flow paths clark et al 2005 dogan and kirnak 2010 also with increasing the temperature the water kinematic viscosity will decrease and the emitter discharge will increase al amoud 1995 rodríguez sinobas et al 1999 senyigit and ilkhan 2017 thokal et al 2001 the temperature also indirectly changes the pressure in the system by changing the water viscosity and the diameter of the pipes and emitters empirically the emitter discharge might be obtained as follows keller and karmeli 1974 1 q k p x where q is the emitter discharge l h p is the operating pressure kpa k is the discharge coefficient lh 1 kpa and x is the pressure exponent its value depends on the flow regime in the emitters based on x values the emitters are divided into three groups of laminar x 1 turbulent x 0 4 0 8 and self component x 0 evans et al 2007 the flow regime in labyrinth emitters of tapes is turbulent evans et al 2007 recognition of influential parameters on emitters discharge variations effective parameters on uniformity of water distribution and the way how they affect these changes can be considered as a proper solution in condition controlling therefore until now different models have been presented to describe the emitter discharge and uniformity of water distribution some researchers such as keller and karmeli 1974 parchomchuk 1976 zur and tal 1981 kadale et al 1992 thokal et al 2001 and clark et al 2005 have studied the effect of temperature and pressure separately and have attempted to present temperature discharge or pressure discharge relationships in the presented equations alike eq 1 the emitter discharge was only a function of changes in the temperature or pressure individually and no attempt has been carried out to investigate the simultaneous effect of variations of these parameters on emitter discharge however at a given operating pressure the temperature variation will indirectly change the pressure with the size of the pipes resulting in a discharge change given the large range of variations in these two parameters and the complexity of their simultaneous effect on emitter discharge it would be difficult to provide an analytical or regression equation with optimal accuracy and ease of use for non specialists farmers therefore it is necessary to use a simple and accurate method for estimating the variations of the emitter discharge influenced by these parameters simultaneously so artificial intelligence based methods might be useful tools in this issue in the recent years with increasing the computer processors various artificial intelligence based methods e g artificial neural networks ann least square support vector machine ls svm neuro fuzzy system with subtractive clustering nf sc and neuro fuzzy system with c means clustering nf fcm have been developed as useful approaches for modeling complex problems these models have been expanded to simulate and solve the problems in different fields due to a large number of effective parameters interactions between the parameters higher uncertainty and complexity of the solution various applications of ai models have been reported so far in the field of irrigation e g estimation of the nutrient and water distribution uniformity in the soil hinnell et al 2010 lazarovitch et al 2009 li et al 2004

reported in the other fields of water resource management alizadeh et al 2018 fotovatikhah et al 2018 karimi et al 2018 yaseen et al 2019 a review of the literature by the authors showed that despite the development of ai models applications in various fields there is still no attempt to use these models for estimating the emitter discharge values under simultaneous variations of the temperature and pressure parameters nevertheless the developed equations for the emitter discharge considered only the discharge pressure or discharge temperature relations in this study however the effect of simultaneous variations of temperature and pressure on the emitter discharge of drip tape irrigation systems was investigated experimentally further using ann nf sc nf fcm and ls svm models the emitter discharge magnitudes subjected to the simultaneous effect of these two parameters are estimated the development of applied models over a wide range of temperature and pressure variations may lead to a comprehensive model that can be easily applied by optimizing its parameters under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data for conducting the experiments a physical model of drip irrigation was built at water and soil research laboratory in the university of kurdistan fig 1 a 150 samples of slit tape were prepared fig 1b the nominal discharges of the tapes were in the range of 0 74 3 42 l h and their nominal pressures varied between 60 and 100 kpa according to the international standard organization iso 2004 the water temperature was selected in the range of 13 53 c digital thermostat and element were used to supply high temperatures and ice molds were used for low temperatures in all tests according to iso 2004 the pressure was checked in the range of 0 1 2 times of the maximum operating pressure of the samples 100 200 kpa for the used emitters according to the available standards iso 2004 the range of 23 3 c was selected as the standard temperature to determine the discharge pressure relationship at the standard temperature eq 1 the k and x parameters were determined according to iso 2004 2 2 selection and division of data selection of the input variables has been fulfilled by reviewing the literature as well as the physical background of the study numerous studies have demonstrated that the operating pressure plays a key role in controlling the emitter discharge values and variations al amoud 1995 bucks and myers 1973 hezarjaribi et al 2008 howell and hiler 1974 keller and karmeli 1974 mattar and alamoud 2015 senyigit and ilkhan 2017 wu and gitlin 1974 moreover direct impact of water temperature on emitter discharge has been confirmed by literature clark et al 2005 keller and karmeli 1974 mattar and alamoud 2015 parchomchuk 1976 senyigit and ilkhan 2017 thokal et al 2001 nevertheless discharge coefficient and pressure exponent have been selected as inputs based on the emitter discharge relation eq 1 considering the direct relationship between the pressure discharge and velocity bralts and wu 1980 and evans et al 2007 have categorized the emitters based on reynolds number therefore the operating pressure water temperature discharge coefficient pressure exponent and nominal discharge given by manufacture were selected as input parameters of the models modified coefficient m was the model output the modified coefficient m is the ratio of the measured emitter discharge in the laboratory at the operating pressure and the test temperature qm to the emitter nominal discharge qn m q m q n a number of 1725 samples were collected in the laboratory the statistical indices of the tested tapes are presented in table 1 according to table 1 the nominal discharge and the operating pressure presented the highest and lowest skewness coefficient values 0 9 and 0 42 respectively in addition considering the highest and lowest values for the nominal discharge and m it can be observed that the measured discharges have the minimum error of 27 4 and maximum error of 49 9 compared to the nominal discharge according to the standard deviation index the temperature and operating pressure have the highest data deviation from the mean values of the data nonetheless a kolmogorov smirnov test was performed to check the statistical distribution of data based on the results of this test and given the small values of the kurtosis index for all parameters it can be reported that all data have a normal distribution in order to better evaluation of the model efficiency it is suggested to divide the dataset into training and testing subsets then the model will be established with the training data set and its accuracy was evaluated with the testing data set however all patterns existed in the data will not be examined by the model therefore k fold cross validation mode was used in order to avoid the over fitting and making a complete data scanning cios et al 2007 shiri et al 2019 2015 by using this data scanning technique the original dataset was divided into k blocks here k 10 and the model was trained with k 1 blocks at each stage 1553 samples and tested with the residual block 172 samples this process was repeated 10 times so that all the available data were participated in training and testing stages 3 artificial intelligence models 3 1 artificial neural network ann ann is a mathematical or computational model that attempts to simulate the structure or tasks of the biological neural networks duan et al 2013 in other words the ann is based on the current understanding of the biological neuron system sarıdemir 2009 the processor element in ann is called a neuron the non linear or linear properties of the neurons are controlled by the activation function the neurons are composed of two elements of the weight and the activation function inputs mapped to neurons and weighted then the result is applied as input to the activation function and the final output is obtained the effective parameters to control ann modeling errors include the number of epochs in training phase number of network layers number of neurons in hidden layer and activation functions in this study the sigmoid hyperbolic tangent sigmoid tangent and linear activation functions were evaluated and finally the sigmoid tangent and the linear activation functions were applied in the hidden and output layers respectively because they presented the lowest error the highest accuracy among the mentioned functions it also includes three layers and six back propagation algorithms e g levenberg marquardt lm gradient descent gd gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gda gradient descent with momentum gdm gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation gdx and scaled conjugate gradient scg it is noted that the applied six algorithms were selected based on their accuracy with respect to the other algorithms not presented here to optimize the model performance the number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined based on the minimum rmse fig 2 shows the hidden layer neurons for all test stages in which 1 20 neurons were examined per algorithm in addition for the weight decays of 0 0001 and 0 002 were considered as minimum and maximum in the hidden layer respectively fig 3 shows the structure of the applied ann models 3 2 least square support vector machines ls svm support vector machines svm method is one of the supervised learning methods in this method a concept known as structural risk minimization is used to minimize the model error while other methods such as ann use the principles of empirical risk minimization cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 dibike et al 2001 in general the svm is used in two or more group classification problems and regression in the svm model quadratic programming is used to solve the equations which will make the problem complex and time consuming however suykens and osipov 2008 proposed a least square support vector machines ls svm method that uses linear equations in solving and results in higher computational accuracy similar to many machine learning methods the modeling process involves two stages of training and testing at the end of the training phase the capability of the model training is evaluated selection of an appropriate kernel function is one of the factors affecting the estimation accuracy in the ls svm model in this study linear and radial basis functions were investigated fig 4 shows the schematic view of the ls svm model 3 3 neuro fuzzy nf system the nf model which combines ann and fuzzy logic was designed by jang 1993 the most important significant benefit of fuzzy logic is that it can give an intermediate answer to zero one programming problems on the other hand it can be used when there is no complete understanding of the physical and fundamental relationships of the system the nf structure is formed based on input data input and output membership functions fuzzy rules and the number of membership function tanaka 1997 parameters related to membership functions need to be selected so that they are most consistent with the input output data in order to optimize the rules in the model training process clustering methods are used in this study subtractive clustering and fuzzy c means clustering methods were investigated the flowchart of the nf structure used in the present study is shown in fig 5 3 4 subtractive clustering in the nf model by increasing the number of membership functions and the number of model parameters the number of rules to determine the optimal system increases too therefore it is necessary to optimize the nf rules to reduce computational cost to this end the subtractive cluster integrates with the nf system in this structure modeling process consists of two stages first the fuzzy inference system is determined using the subtractive clustering method then nf is used to adjust the fuzzy inference system and train it based on input output data in general the performance of this type of clustering is as follows 1 finding the data having the greatest potential to be the first center 2 separate all data adjacent to the first center by the specified radius to determine the cluster and the center of the next cluster 3 repeat the above steps until all the data are fallen in the center of the cluster in subtractive clustering the center of each cluster represents the behavior of a part of the data system and represents a rule therefore to determine the optimal structure cluster information is used to determine the number of basic rules and membership functions the effective radius in this study was determined by trial and error based on the minimum root mean square error rmse values in the range of zero to one according to fig 6 except for stage no 3 in each of the 10 stages the radius value was greater than 0 5 choosing a small radius will increase the number of rules and make the computations more complicated based on the minimum rmse for all test stages the numbers of epochs and clusters in the nf sc model 100 and 60 were selected respectively 3 5 fuzzy c means fcm clustering fcm is a clustering technique where each point belongs to a cluster with a certain degree which is determined by degree of membership this technique was firstly introduced by bezdek 1973 to improve the efficiency of previous clustering methods in fcm the data clustering in multi dimensional space is described by a certain number of different clusters the fcm starts from an initial hypothesis as the centers of the clusters usually this initial hypothesis is incorrect and does not specify the correct location of the centers the fcm then associates each point with the degree of membership of each cluster by repeating the update of the cluster centers and the degree of membership of each cluster the cluster centers gradually move to their actual location in the data set these updates are based on minimizing the objective function the objective function is to provide the distance between each point to the cluster center based on its degree of membership the optimal number of clusters in fcm was determined based on the minimum rmse the numbers of epochs in the nf fcm model was 300 3 6 evaluation indices in this study the scatter index si the coefficient of determination r 2 the mean absolute error mae the uncertainty with 95 confidence level u 95 behar et al 2015 gueymard 2014 the t statistic test tstat stone 1993 and the global performance indicator gpi stone 1993 were used to assess the applied models the explanations and equations of the utilized indices are as follows 3 6 1 root mean square error rmse the rmse is said to provide information on the short term performance of a model by allowing a term by term comparison of the actual difference between the estimated value and measured value ma and iqbal 1984 rmse is an inappropriate measure of average error because it is a function of three characteristics of a set of errors rather than of one average error willmott and matsuura 2006 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m i e i 2 m where ei and mi are respectively the values of estimated and measured discharges in each experiment n is the total number of measured discharges 3 6 2 mean absolute error mae when comparing estimation models applied to a single data series or to several data series with the same units the mae is popular as it is easy to both understand and compute a simulation method that minimizes the mae will lead to estimate of the median while minimizing the rmse will lead to estimation of the mean values consequently the rmse is widely used despite being more difficult to interpret lewis beck 2005 3 m a e 1 n i 1 n m i e i 3 6 3 coefficient of determination r 2 the coefficient r 2 points out the fraction of the estimated values that are the closest to the line of measurement data values of the coefficient of determination close to 1 indicate a good accuracy of the model if r 2 x this means that x of the total predicted values can be explained by a linear relationship between predictions and experiments this indicator test the linearity and it is very helpful for enhancing the performance of models behar et al 2015 4 r 2 i 1 n m i m e i e i 1 n m i m 2 i 1 n e i e 2 2 where e and m are respectively the mean values of estimated and measured discharges 3 6 4 scatter index si this index is based on the rmse index and acts like it the advantage of this index over rmse is that it can be classify the models performance accuracy as discussed by li et al 2013 based on this index qualitative comparison of model performances is as excellent good fair and poor 5 s i r m s e m according to li et al 2013 qualitative comparison of model performances based on si index is as follows i f s i 0 1 e x c e l l e n t 0 1 s i 0 2 g o o d 0 2 s i 0 3 f a i r s i 0 3 p o o r 3 6 5 mean bias error mbe mbe was used for assessing the models overestimations positive mbe and underestimations negative mbe during the experiment setup ma and iqbal 1984 based on this index the best model will have mbe near zero 6 m b e 1 n i 1 n e i m i 3 6 6 t statistic test t stat t stat is a function of the widely used root mean square and mean bias errors separate application of these indices can lead to incorrect selection of the best model from a suite of candidate models so using this index supplement them in aiding the model tester to more rapidly and reliably assess a model s performance stone 1993 7 t s t a t n 1 m b e 2 r m s e 2 m b e 2 3 6 7 uncertainty with 95 confidence level u 95 the confidence interval represents the uncertainty of the effect size in a source data when calculating a confidence interval the width of the interval is determined by the sample size the amount of measurement error of the study and the degree of confidence required there is a unique relationship between the 95 confidence interval and a two sided 5 level of significance when the 95 confidence interval for differences in effect does not include 0 for absolute measures of association e g mean differences or 1 for relative measures of association e g odds ratios it can be inferred that the association is statistically significant p 0 05 the advantage of the 95 confidence interval over the p value is that it provides information about the size of the effect and the direction of the effect patino and ferreira 2015 8 u 95 1 96 s d 2 r m s e 2 where sd is the standard deviation index to represent the deviation of the estimated values from the measured values 3 6 8 global performance indicator gpi the gpi is a multiplication of five statistical factors these factors are less than a unity therefore the smaller the five statistics the smaller is the gpi the gpi combines the advantages of all the root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe coefficient of determination r 2 expanded uncertainty u 95 t statistic test t stat indicators because it examines the short and long term performance and linearity of the models so that it can be used for ranking the models since it offers a higher resolution as its values are in the order of 10 5 an important advantage of the gpi is classifying the applied models easier and more realistic when assessing different applied models performance accuracy the most accurate model ranked as the first best model has the gpi values closer to zero behar et al 2015 9 g p i m b e r m s e u 95 t s t a t 1 r 2 in comparison of the model performances by the above indices the superior model is the model in which the values of all indices except r 2 are minimum tends to zero and the r 2 index tends to 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 general assessment the global results of the applied models are given in table 2 to construct a global vector the estimations of the modified coefficient m were gathered at each k fold stage then the evaluation indices for this vector were calculated therefore the results given in table 2 show the performance of the models for the whole dataset in the ann model six algorithms were investigated the number of epoch for lm and scg was 1000 and for the other algorithms was 50 000 after which the error values did not show clear reduction according to table 2 lm gdx and scg algorithms gave the excellent performance with si 0 1 the least accuracy was related to gdm with si mae and r 2 of 0 16 0 13 and 0 721 respectively the results of the nf fcm and nf sc models presented in table 2 showed that nf sc performed better than nf fcm with si mae and r 2 values of 0 075 0 055 and 0 939 respectively for the ls svm model linear and rbf kernel functions were investigated the results showed that rbf with si and mae of 0 073 and 0 054 had the highest accuracy the improvement of si and mae in the rbf kernel was 54 in si and 58 in mae compared to the linear kernel 4 2 comparison of applied models comparison of the results presented in table 2 shows that ls svm1 model with the minimum si and mae values 0 073 and 0 054 respectively and the maximum r 2 0 942 performed better than the other models according to the thresholds suggested by li et al 2013 si values ranked the ls svm1 model performance as excellent followed by nf1 the highest difference between the model performance with respect to the ls svm1 was belonged to ls svm2 δsi 0 089 followed by ann4 with δsi 0 087 choosing the best model among ann nf and ls svm models can provide an evident comparison of models therefore ls svm1 nf1 and ann1 models with the highest performance accuracy were selected and examined separately per each test stage as can be seen in fig 7 different trends can be observed in variations of the error indices and determination coefﬁcient it can be observed from fig 7 that all three models have r 2 0 9 except for stages 8 and 9 from mae viewpoint except for stage 3 ann1 had the highest values for this index in most cases 0 053 the nf1 and ls svm1 models also had similar performance based on the si index all three models were in the excellent rank at all test stages si 0 1 except for stage 8 where the si index was 0 1 and ann1 had the worst conditions the maximum values of si and mae recorded in the test stages were related to ann1 at stage 8 and the minimum values related to ls svm1 at stage 4 these observations indicated the need to apply a strategy for the complete scanning of data such as k fold test otherwise the results may not be sufficiently valid the next comparison is the overall error distributions in a boxplot fig 8 in which error equals differences between estimated e and measured m values accordingly the negative and positive error values correspond to the over estimation and under estimation behavior of the models respectively the interquartile range in fig 8 shows that the error is centered on zero for the ls svm1 ann1 and nf1 the error values were 0 065 0 076 and 0 072 respectively the lower quartile value in the ls svm1 is 0 030 which is lower than the ann1 q25 0 037 and nf1 q25 0 034 in addition in upper quartile the ls svm1 with q75 0 035 performed better than ann1 with q75 0 039 and nf1 q75 0 038 as can be seen in fig 8 the maximum and minimum errors in ls svm1 model were lower than ann1 and nf1 model which confirms the ability of ls svm1 to estimate m values for a deep evaluation of the obtained results the uncertainty u 95 the t statistic test and the global performance indicator were used as stone 1993 demonstrated the rmse and mbe indices might not give valid evaluation of the model performances therefore additional indices e g the t statistic can be a suitable alternative that indicates the significant differences between the measured and estimated values fig 9 shows the t statistic and u 95 values for the applied models it is clear that the ls svm1 presents a lower u 95 value than the other models followed by nf1 with a slight difference the highest value of u 95 was 0 52 for the ann2 ann4 and ls svm2 models in t statistic index ls svm1 model with value of 0 34 presented lower performance than ann6 t statistic 0 21 and ls svm2 t statistic 0 12 models among all models ann3 had the highest u 95 1 66 finally it can be demonstrated that different statistical indices may lead to a different classification of the model accuracy because each index evaluates the performance of the model at a unique level according to maroufpoor et al 2019a the selection of the model with the highest accuracy based on the different statistical indices is not a reliable approach in this regard the global performance indicator was used in this study the superiority of gpi over other indicators is in using 5 statistical indices rmse mae tstat u 95 and r 2 simultaneously the ability to classify the models is one of the features of gpi and the model with the lowest gpi near zero is both superior in accuracy and performance than other models behar et al 2015 gueymard 2014 stone 1993 due to the low gpi values the values had to be multiplied by 1000 fig 10 shows the rankings of the ls svm1 nf1 ann6 ann1 ann5 nf2 and ls svm2 models in terms of gpi 1000 other models including ann2 ann3 and ann4 were not included in the evaluation presented in fig 10 due to presenting gpi 1 ls svm1 was the best model gpi 0 021 followed by nf1 with slight difference δgpi 0 004 also ann4 and ann2 models had the least accuracy in estimating the target parameter with gpi 2 26 and 2 20 respectively the gpi index as a 5 agent index eliminates any doubts about the choice of high quality and high precision modeling finally taylor s diagram was used to illustrate schematically the performance of the models fig 11 taylor 2001 the taylor s diagram shows the consistency of the estimated values to the measured values taylor 2001 and make the comparative assessment of the models easy according to fig 11 with the exception of the ann3 ann5 and ls svm2 the other models have slight differences with the standard deviation of measured m values in addition in the rmse index except for the ls svm1 nf1 and ann1 models the other models are in the second radius relative to the measured point and ann2 ann4 and ls svm2 models have the most distances 4 3 further ai model uses the results demonstrated that the ai models have good ability to establish the relationship between simultaneous effect of influential parameters and outlet flow s discharge and also estimation of the emitter s discharge variation these parameters will be changed daily weekly monthly and seasonally and will cause changes in emitter discharge the mentioned changes can be estimated using ai models with the least cost and time finally the results of ai models were used to implement proper management to achieve uniform distribution of water at the farm increasing efficiency and productivity on the other hand the previously mentioned models can be introduced as a condition controller due to high automation potential of drip irrigation systems 5 conclusions the main objective of this study is to introduce an artificial intelligence based method to estimate the change of emitter discharge due to simultaneous variations of the operating pressure and temperature in this regard the ann nf fcm nf sc and ls svm models were used to estimate the discharge changes in term of modified coefficient m the number of 1725 samples of discharge variations at different temperatures and pressures were prepared in the laboratory and used to evaluate the applied models the k fold tool scans the dataset to allow models to examine all patterns in their training and testing stages based on the obtained results the ls svm model with rbf kernel function is the most accurate model in addition the results showed that nf and ann models could estimate m with less accuracy than ls svm according to the global performance indicator gpi the rank of the applied models is ls svm nf and ann models among them ls svm is superior to the other models evaluation of applied models over a wide range of temperatures and pressures as well as the use of various emitters can be a factor in ensuring that ai is used in real time conditions however to optimize the models it is necessary to test them in new conditions the findings of this study showed that user friendly systems that use ai can be a good substitute for laboratory and field measurements saving both the time and cost temperature variations in this study were based on changes in water temperature so the effect of direct temperature radiation on flow carrying pipes has not been investigated further studies might be carried out for examining the effect of direct irradiation on different parts of the irrigation system declaration of interests none 
10801,one of the effective factors to ensure the desirable operation of drip irrigation systems is the uniform emitter discharge which is affected by operating pressure and temperature accurate estimation of this parameter is crucial for optimal irrigation system management and operation in this research the emitter outflow discharge was simulated through artificial intelligence ai based approaches under a wide range of temperature 13 53 c and operating pressures 0 240 kpa variations the applied ai models included artificial neural networks ann neuro fuzzy sub clustering nf sc neuro fuzzy c means clustering nf fcm and least square support vector machine ls svm the input parameters matrix consisted of operating pressure water temperature discharge coefficient pressure exponent and nominal discharge while the ratio of measured discharge to nominal discharge modified coefficient m was the output of the models the applied models were assessed through the robust k fold testing data scanning mode the 5 agent global performance indicator gpi was used for the final reliable ranking the results showed that all the applied ai models with an average mean absolute error mae of 8 8 had acceptable accuracy for estimating the modified m coefficient according to the gpi the ls svm model had the lowest error followed by the nf sc model with a slight difference keywords artificial neural

them for different topographic conditions dhuyvetter et al 1994 lamm et al 1992 the amount of water use efficiency productivity largely depends on the uniformity of water distribution by emitters the non uniform distribution of water at the farm due to changes in emitter discharge can greatly affect the efficiency of drip irrigation systems in general the success of a drip tape irrigation system depends on the selection of an appropriate irrigation tape and its hydraulic properties al amoud 1995 physical chemical and biological clogging system pressure variations irrigation water temperature and manufacturing coefficient of variation cvm of emitters may alter the uniformity of the water distribution and decrease the irrigation efficiency abdel mawgoud et al 2009 bracy et al 2003 li et al

irrigation systems the outflow discharges from all emitters are considered to be equal scaloppi and allen 1993 thokal et al 2001 furthermore for uniform water distribution in the field a maximum 10 difference in emitter discharges is acceptable bucks and myers 1973 keller and karmeli 1974 wu and gitlin 1974 the main cause of the emitters discharge differences non uniform water distribution in the field is the change in farm operating pressure mostafa and sultan 2018 wei et al 2006 another major factor that affects the emitter discharge is the temperature variations in ambient temperature include temperature variations at different times of the day different days of the week and different seasons of the year thokal et al 2001 moreover tight exposure may affect different parts of the drip irrigation system thokal et al 2001 that can change the geometrical shape and flow paths clark et al 2005 dogan and kirnak 2010 also with increasing the temperature the water kinematic viscosity will decrease and the emitter discharge will increase al amoud 1995 rodríguez sinobas et al 1999 senyigit and ilkhan 2017 thokal et al 2001 the temperature also indirectly changes the pressure in the system by changing the water viscosity and the diameter of the pipes and emitters empirically the emitter discharge might be obtained as follows keller and karmeli 1974 1 q k p x where q is the emitter discharge l h p is the operating pressure kpa k is the discharge coefficient lh 1 kpa and x is the pressure exponent its value depends on the flow regime in the emitters based on x values the emitters are divided into three groups of laminar x 1 turbulent x 0 4 0 8 and self component x 0 evans et al 2007 the flow regime in labyrinth emitters of tapes is turbulent evans et al 2007 recognition of influential parameters on emitters discharge variations effective parameters on uniformity of water distribution and the way how they affect these changes can be considered as a proper solution in condition controlling therefore until now different models have been presented to describe the emitter discharge and uniformity of water distribution some researchers such as keller and karmeli 1974 parchomchuk 1976 zur and tal 1981 kadale et al 1992 thokal et al 2001 and clark et al 2005 have studied the effect of temperature and pressure separately and have attempted to present temperature discharge or pressure discharge relationships in the presented equations alike eq 1 the emitter discharge was only a function of changes in the temperature or pressure individually and no attempt has been carried out to investigate the simultaneous effect of variations of these parameters on emitter discharge however at a given operating pressure the temperature variation will indirectly change the pressure with the size of the pipes resulting in a discharge change given the large range of variations in these two parameters and the complexity of their simultaneous effect on emitter discharge it would be difficult to provide an analytical or regression equation with optimal accuracy and ease of use for non specialists farmers therefore it is necessary to use a simple and accurate method for estimating the variations of the emitter discharge influenced by these parameters simultaneously so artificial intelligence based methods might be useful tools in this issue in the recent years with increasing the computer processors various artificial intelligence based methods e g artificial neural networks ann least square support vector machine ls svm neuro fuzzy system with subtractive clustering nf sc and neuro fuzzy system with c means clustering nf fcm have been developed as useful approaches for modeling complex problems these models have been expanded to simulate and solve the problems in different fields due to a large number of effective parameters interactions between the parameters higher uncertainty and complexity of the solution various applications of ai models have been reported so far in the field of irrigation e g estimation of the nutrient and water distribution uniformity in the soil hinnell et al 2010 lazarovitch et al 2009 li et al 2004

reported in the other fields of water resource management alizadeh et al 2018 fotovatikhah et al 2018 karimi et al 2018 yaseen et al 2019 a review of the literature by the authors showed that despite the development of ai models applications in various fields there is still no attempt to use these models for estimating the emitter discharge values under simultaneous variations of the temperature and pressure parameters nevertheless the developed equations for the emitter discharge considered only the discharge pressure or discharge temperature relations in this study however the effect of simultaneous variations of temperature and pressure on the emitter discharge of drip tape irrigation systems was investigated experimentally further using ann nf sc nf fcm and ls svm models the emitter discharge magnitudes subjected to the simultaneous effect of these two parameters are estimated the development of applied models over a wide range of temperature and pressure variations may lead to a comprehensive model that can be easily applied by optimizing its parameters under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data for conducting the experiments a physical model of drip irrigation was built at water and soil research laboratory in the university of kurdistan fig 1 a 150 samples of slit tape were prepared fig 1b the nominal discharges of the tapes were in the range of 0 74 3 42 l h and their nominal pressures varied between 60 and 100 kpa according to the international standard organization iso 2004 the water temperature was selected in the range of 13 53 c digital thermostat and element were used to supply high temperatures and ice molds were used for low temperatures in all tests according to iso 2004 the pressure was checked in the range of 0 1 2 times of the maximum operating pressure of the samples 100 200 kpa for the used emitters according to the available standards iso 2004 the range of 23 3 c was selected as the standard temperature to determine the discharge pressure relationship at the standard temperature eq 1 the k and x parameters were determined according to iso 2004 2 2 selection and division of data selection of the input variables has been fulfilled by reviewing the literature as well as the physical background of the study numerous studies have demonstrated that the operating pressure plays a key role in controlling the emitter discharge values and variations al amoud 1995 bucks and myers 1973 hezarjaribi et al 2008 howell and hiler 1974 keller and karmeli 1974 mattar and alamoud 2015 senyigit and ilkhan 2017 wu and gitlin 1974 moreover direct impact of water temperature on emitter discharge has been confirmed by literature clark et al 2005 keller and karmeli 1974 mattar and alamoud 2015 parchomchuk 1976 senyigit and ilkhan 2017 thokal et al 2001 nevertheless discharge coefficient and pressure exponent have been selected as inputs based on the emitter discharge relation eq 1 considering the direct relationship between the pressure discharge and velocity bralts and wu 1980 and evans et al 2007 have categorized the emitters based on reynolds number therefore the operating pressure water temperature discharge coefficient pressure exponent and nominal discharge given by manufacture were selected as input parameters of the models modified coefficient m was the model output the modified coefficient m is the ratio of the measured emitter discharge in the laboratory at the operating pressure and the test temperature qm to the emitter nominal discharge qn m q m q n a number of 1725 samples were collected in the laboratory the statistical indices of the tested tapes are presented in table 1 according to table 1 the nominal discharge and the operating pressure presented the highest and lowest skewness coefficient values 0 9 and 0 42 respectively in addition considering the highest and lowest values for the nominal discharge and m it can be observed that the measured discharges have the minimum error of 27 4 and maximum error of 49 9 compared to the nominal discharge according to the standard deviation index the temperature and operating pressure have the highest data deviation from the mean values of the data nonetheless a kolmogorov smirnov test was performed to check the statistical distribution of data based on the results of this test and given the small values of the kurtosis index for all parameters it can be reported that all data have a normal distribution in order to better evaluation of the model efficiency it is suggested to divide the dataset into training and testing subsets then the model will be established with the training data set and its accuracy was evaluated with the testing data set however all patterns existed in the data will not be examined by the model therefore k fold cross validation mode was used in order to avoid the over fitting and making a complete data scanning cios et al 2007 shiri et al 2019 2015 by using this data scanning technique the original dataset was divided into k blocks here k 10 and the model was trained with k 1 blocks at each stage 1553 samples and tested with the residual block 172 samples this process was repeated 10 times so that all the available data were participated in training and testing stages 3 artificial intelligence models 3 1 artificial neural network ann ann is a mathematical or computational model that attempts to simulate the structure or tasks of the biological neural networks duan et al 2013 in other words the ann is based on the current understanding of the biological neuron system sarıdemir 2009 the processor element in ann is called a neuron the non linear or linear properties of the neurons are controlled by the activation function the neurons are composed of two elements of the weight and the activation function inputs mapped to neurons and weighted then the result is applied as input to the activation function and the final output is obtained the effective parameters to control ann modeling errors include the number of epochs in training phase number of network layers number of neurons in hidden layer and activation functions in this study the sigmoid hyperbolic tangent sigmoid tangent and linear activation functions were evaluated and finally the sigmoid tangent and the linear activation functions were applied in the hidden and output layers respectively because they presented the lowest error the highest accuracy among the mentioned functions it also includes three layers and six back propagation algorithms e g levenberg marquardt lm gradient descent gd gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gda gradient descent with momentum gdm gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation gdx and scaled conjugate gradient scg it is noted that the applied six algorithms were selected based on their accuracy with respect to the other algorithms not presented here to optimize the model performance the number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined based on the minimum rmse fig 2 shows the hidden layer neurons for all test stages in which 1 20 neurons were examined per algorithm in addition for the weight decays of 0 0001 and 0 002 were considered as minimum and maximum in the hidden layer respectively fig 3 shows the structure of the applied ann models 3 2 least square support vector machines ls svm support vector machines svm method is one of the supervised learning methods in this method a concept known as structural risk minimization is used to minimize the model error while other methods such as ann use the principles of empirical risk minimization cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 dibike et al 2001 in general the svm is used in two or more group classification problems and regression in the svm model quadratic programming is used to solve the equations which will make the problem complex and time consuming however suykens and osipov 2008 proposed a least square support vector machines ls svm method that uses linear equations in solving and results in higher computational accuracy similar to many machine learning methods the modeling process involves two stages of training and testing at the end of the training phase the capability of the model training is evaluated selection of an appropriate kernel function is one of the factors affecting the estimation accuracy in the ls svm model in this study linear and radial basis functions were investigated fig 4 shows the schematic view of the ls svm model 3 3 neuro fuzzy nf system the nf model which combines ann and fuzzy logic was designed by jang 1993 the most important significant benefit of fuzzy logic is that it can give an intermediate answer to zero one programming problems on the other hand it can be used when there is no complete understanding of the physical and fundamental relationships of the system the nf structure is formed based on input data input and output membership functions fuzzy rules and the number of membership function tanaka 1997 parameters related to membership functions need to be selected so that they are most consistent with the input output data in order to optimize the rules in the model training process clustering methods are used in this study subtractive clustering and fuzzy c means clustering methods were investigated the flowchart of the nf structure used in the present study is shown in fig 5 3 4 subtractive clustering in the nf model by increasing the number of membership functions and the number of model parameters the number of rules to determine the optimal system increases too therefore it is necessary to optimize the nf rules to reduce computational cost to this end the subtractive cluster integrates with the nf system in this structure modeling process consists of two stages first the fuzzy inference system is determined using the subtractive clustering method then nf is used to adjust the fuzzy inference system and train it based on input output data in general the performance of this type of clustering is as follows 1 finding the data having the greatest potential to be the first center 2 separate all data adjacent to the first center by the specified radius to determine the cluster and the center of the next cluster 3 repeat the above steps until all the data are fallen in the center of the cluster in subtractive clustering the center of each cluster represents the behavior of a part of the data system and represents a rule therefore to determine the optimal structure cluster information is used to determine the number of basic rules and membership functions the effective radius in this study was determined by trial and error based on the minimum root mean square error rmse values in the range of zero to one according to fig 6 except for stage no 3 in each of the 10 stages the radius value was greater than 0 5 choosing a small radius will increase the number of rules and make the computations more complicated based on the minimum rmse for all test stages the numbers of epochs and clusters in the nf sc model 100 and 60 were selected respectively 3 5 fuzzy c means fcm clustering fcm is a clustering technique where each point belongs to a cluster with a certain degree which is determined by degree of membership this technique was firstly introduced by bezdek 1973 to improve the efficiency of previous clustering methods in fcm the data clustering in multi dimensional space is described by a certain number of different clusters the fcm starts from an initial hypothesis as the centers of the clusters usually this initial hypothesis is incorrect and does not specify the correct location of the centers the fcm then associates each point with the degree of membership of each cluster by repeating the update of the cluster centers and the degree of membership of each cluster the cluster centers gradually move to their actual location in the data set these updates are based on minimizing the objective function the objective function is to provide the distance between each point to the cluster center based on its degree of membership the optimal number of clusters in fcm was determined based on the minimum rmse the numbers of epochs in the nf fcm model was 300 3 6 evaluation indices in this study the scatter index si the coefficient of determination r 2 the mean absolute error mae the uncertainty with 95 confidence level u 95 behar et al 2015 gueymard 2014 the t statistic test tstat stone 1993 and the global performance indicator gpi stone 1993 were used to assess the applied models the explanations and equations of the utilized indices are as follows 3 6 1 root mean square error rmse the rmse is said to provide information on the short term performance of a model by allowing a term by term comparison of the actual difference between the estimated value and measured value ma and iqbal 1984 rmse is an inappropriate measure of average error because it is a function of three characteristics of a set of errors rather than of one average error willmott and matsuura 2006 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m i e i 2 m where ei and mi are respectively the values of estimated and measured discharges in each experiment n is the total number of measured discharges 3 6 2 mean absolute error mae when comparing estimation models applied to a single data series or to several data series with the same units the mae is popular as it is easy to both understand and compute a simulation method that minimizes the mae will lead to estimate of the median while minimizing the rmse will lead to estimation of the mean values consequently the rmse is widely used despite being more difficult to interpret lewis beck 2005 3 m a e 1 n i 1 n m i e i 3 6 3 coefficient of determination r 2 the coefficient r 2 points out the fraction of the estimated values that are the closest to the line of measurement data values of the coefficient of determination close to 1 indicate a good accuracy of the model if r 2 x this means that x of the total predicted values can be explained by a linear relationship between predictions and experiments this indicator test the linearity and it is very helpful for enhancing the performance of models behar et al 2015 4 r 2 i 1 n m i m e i e i 1 n m i m 2 i 1 n e i e 2 2 where e and m are respectively the mean values of estimated and measured discharges 3 6 4 scatter index si this index is based on the rmse index and acts like it the advantage of this index over rmse is that it can be classify the models performance accuracy as discussed by li et al 2013 based on this index qualitative comparison of model performances is as excellent good fair and poor 5 s i r m s e m according to li et al 2013 qualitative comparison of model performances based on si index is as follows i f s i 0 1 e x c e l l e n t 0 1 s i 0 2 g o o d 0 2 s i 0 3 f a i r s i 0 3 p o o r 3 6 5 mean bias error mbe mbe was used for assessing the models overestimations positive mbe and underestimations negative mbe during the experiment setup ma and iqbal 1984 based on this index the best model will have mbe near zero 6 m b e 1 n i 1 n e i m i 3 6 6 t statistic test t stat t stat is a function of the widely used root mean square and mean bias errors separate application of these indices can lead to incorrect selection of the best model from a suite of candidate models so using this index supplement them in aiding the model tester to more rapidly and reliably assess a model s performance stone 1993 7 t s t a t n 1 m b e 2 r m s e 2 m b e 2 3 6 7 uncertainty with 95 confidence level u 95 the confidence interval represents the uncertainty of the effect size in a source data when calculating a confidence interval the width of the interval is determined by the sample size the amount of measurement error of the study and the degree of confidence required there is a unique relationship between the 95 confidence interval and a two sided 5 level of significance when the 95 confidence interval for differences in effect does not include 0 for absolute measures of association e g mean differences or 1 for relative measures of association e g odds ratios it can be inferred that the association is statistically significant p 0 05 the advantage of the 95 confidence interval over the p value is that it provides information about the size of the effect and the direction of the effect patino and ferreira 2015 8 u 95 1 96 s d 2 r m s e 2 where sd is the standard deviation index to represent the deviation of the estimated values from the measured values 3 6 8 global performance indicator gpi the gpi is a multiplication of five statistical factors these factors are less than a unity therefore the smaller the five statistics the smaller is the gpi the gpi combines the advantages of all the root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe coefficient of determination r 2 expanded uncertainty u 95 t statistic test t stat indicators because it examines the short and long term performance and linearity of the models so that it can be used for ranking the models since it offers a higher resolution as its values are in the order of 10 5 an important advantage of the gpi is classifying the applied models easier and more realistic when assessing different applied models performance accuracy the most accurate model ranked as the first best model has the gpi values closer to zero behar et al 2015 9 g p i m b e r m s e u 95 t s t a t 1 r 2 in comparison of the model performances by the above indices the superior model is the model in which the values of all indices except r 2 are minimum tends to zero and the r 2 index tends to 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 general assessment the global results of the applied models are given in table 2 to construct a global vector the estimations of the modified coefficient m were gathered at each k fold stage then the evaluation indices for this vector were calculated therefore the results given in table 2 show the performance of the models for the whole dataset in the ann model six algorithms were investigated the number of epoch for lm and scg was 1000 and for the other algorithms was 50 000 after which the error values did not show clear reduction according to table 2 lm gdx and scg algorithms gave the excellent performance with si 0 1 the least accuracy was related to gdm with si mae and r 2 of 0 16 0 13 and 0 721 respectively the results of the nf fcm and nf sc models presented in table 2 showed that nf sc performed better than nf fcm with si mae and r 2 values of 0 075 0 055 and 0 939 respectively for the ls svm model linear and rbf kernel functions were investigated the results showed that rbf with si and mae of 0 073 and 0 054 had the highest accuracy the improvement of si and mae in the rbf kernel was 54 in si and 58 in mae compared to the linear kernel 4 2 comparison of applied models comparison of the results presented in table 2 shows that ls svm1 model with the minimum si and mae values 0 073 and 0 054 respectively and the maximum r 2 0 942 performed better than the other models according to the thresholds suggested by li et al 2013 si values ranked the ls svm1 model performance as excellent followed by nf1 the highest difference between the model performance with respect to the ls svm1 was belonged to ls svm2 δsi 0 089 followed by ann4 with δsi 0 087 choosing the best model among ann nf and ls svm models can provide an evident comparison of models therefore ls svm1 nf1 and ann1 models with the highest performance accuracy were selected and examined separately per each test stage as can be seen in fig 7 different trends can be observed in variations of the error indices and determination coefﬁcient it can be observed from fig 7 that all three models have r 2 0 9 except for stages 8 and 9 from mae viewpoint except for stage 3 ann1 had the highest values for this index in most cases 0 053 the nf1 and ls svm1 models also had similar performance based on the si index all three models were in the excellent rank at all test stages si 0 1 except for stage 8 where the si index was 0 1 and ann1 had the worst conditions the maximum values of si and mae recorded in the test stages were related to ann1 at stage 8 and the minimum values related to ls svm1 at stage 4 these observations indicated the need to apply a strategy for the complete scanning of data such as k fold test otherwise the results may not be sufficiently valid the next comparison is the overall error distributions in a boxplot fig 8 in which error equals differences between estimated e and measured m values accordingly the negative and positive error values correspond to the over estimation and under estimation behavior of the models respectively the interquartile range in fig 8 shows that the error is centered on zero for the ls svm1 ann1 and nf1 the error values were 0 065 0 076 and 0 072 respectively the lower quartile value in the ls svm1 is 0 030 which is lower than the ann1 q25 0 037 and nf1 q25 0 034 in addition in upper quartile the ls svm1 with q75 0 035 performed better than ann1 with q75 0 039 and nf1 q75 0 038 as can be seen in fig 8 the maximum and minimum errors in ls svm1 model were lower than ann1 and nf1 model which confirms the ability of ls svm1 to estimate m values for a deep evaluation of the obtained results the uncertainty u 95 the t statistic test and the global performance indicator were used as stone 1993 demonstrated the rmse and mbe indices might not give valid evaluation of the model performances therefore additional indices e g the t statistic can be a suitable alternative that indicates the significant differences between the measured and estimated values fig 9 shows the t statistic and u 95 values for the applied models it is clear that the ls svm1 presents a lower u 95 value than the other models followed by nf1 with a slight difference the highest value of u 95 was 0 52 for the ann2 ann4 and ls svm2 models in t statistic index ls svm1 model with value of 0 34 presented lower performance than ann6 t statistic 0 21 and ls svm2 t statistic 0 12 models among all models ann3 had the highest u 95 1 66 finally it can be demonstrated that different statistical indices may lead to a different classification of the model accuracy because each index evaluates the performance of the model at a unique level according to maroufpoor et al 2019a the selection of the model with the highest accuracy based on the different statistical indices is not a reliable approach in this regard the global performance indicator was used in this study the superiority of gpi over other indicators is in using 5 statistical indices rmse mae tstat u 95 and r 2 simultaneously the ability to classify the models is one of the features of gpi and the model with the lowest gpi near zero is both superior in accuracy and performance than other models behar et al 2015 gueymard 2014 stone 1993 due to the low gpi values the values had to be multiplied by 1000 fig 10 shows the rankings of the ls svm1 nf1 ann6 ann1 ann5 nf2 and ls svm2 models in terms of gpi 1000 other models including ann2 ann3 and ann4 were not included in the evaluation presented in fig 10 due to presenting gpi 1 ls svm1 was the best model gpi 0 021 followed by nf1 with slight difference δgpi 0 004 also ann4 and ann2 models had the least accuracy in estimating the target parameter with gpi 2 26 and 2 20 respectively the gpi index as a 5 agent index eliminates any doubts about the choice of high quality and high precision modeling finally taylor s diagram was used to illustrate schematically the performance of the models fig 11 taylor 2001 the taylor s diagram shows the consistency of the estimated values to the measured values taylor 2001 and make the comparative assessment of the models easy according to fig 11 with the exception of the ann3 ann5 and ls svm2 the other models have slight differences with the standard deviation of measured m values in addition in the rmse index except for the ls svm1 nf1 and ann1 models the other models are in the second radius relative to the measured point and ann2 ann4 and ls svm2 models have the most distances 4 3 further ai model uses the results demonstrated that the ai models have good ability to establish the relationship between simultaneous effect of influential parameters and outlet flow s discharge and also estimation of the emitter s discharge variation these parameters will be changed daily weekly monthly and seasonally and will cause changes in emitter discharge the mentioned changes can be estimated using ai models with the least cost and time finally the results of ai models were used to implement proper management to achieve uniform distribution of water at the farm increasing efficiency and productivity on the other hand the previously mentioned models can be introduced as a condition controller due to high automation potential of drip irrigation systems 5 conclusions the main objective of this study is to introduce an artificial intelligence based method to estimate the change of emitter discharge due to simultaneous variations of the operating pressure and temperature in this regard the ann nf fcm nf sc and ls svm models were used to estimate the discharge changes in term of modified coefficient m the number of 1725 samples of discharge variations at different temperatures and pressures were prepared in the laboratory and used to evaluate the applied models the k fold tool scans the dataset to allow models to examine all patterns in their training and testing stages based on the obtained results the ls svm model with rbf kernel function is the most accurate model in addition the results showed that nf and ann models could estimate m with less accuracy than ls svm according to the global performance indicator gpi the rank of the applied models is ls svm nf and ann models among them ls svm is superior to the other models evaluation of applied models over a wide range of temperatures and pressures as well as the use of various emitters can be a factor in ensuring that ai is used in real time conditions however to optimize the models it is necessary to test them in new conditions the findings of this study showed that user friendly systems that use ai can be a good substitute for laboratory and field measurements saving both the time and cost temperature variations in this study were based on changes in water temperature so the effect of direct temperature radiation on flow carrying pipes has not been investigated further studies might be carried out for examining the effect of direct irradiation on different parts of the irrigation system declaration of interests none 
10802,accurate design suitable management and optimization of irrigation design parameters play an important role in increasing the performance of furrow irrigation the main objective of this study was to optimize the performance of furrow irrigation using winsrfr in the fields of salman farsi agro industry sugarcane located in the southwest of iran for this purpose field experiments were conducted under nine blocked ended furrows with the length of 250 m the top width of 1 83 m and slope of 0 04 and in three inflow treatments 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 l s with three repetitions the winsrfr software was employed to optimize the combination of irrigation parameters such as inflow rate cut off time and field geometry objective function of including application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation was also employed to optimize the performance the results showed that using 1 0 l s inflow rate could increase of by 35 99 which was the best performance compared to 1 5 and 2 0 l s changing furrow length from 250 m to 200 m showed that of value increased by 39 8 however changing it to 300 m of decreased by 7 7 in addition changing slope from 0 04 to 0 03 decreased of by 0 9 while changing it to 0 05 of was improved by 1 on the other hand changing the inflow and cut off time field length and combinations of them led to the increased of by 25 8 39 and 31

and drip irrigation thus many studies have been carried out to increase the efficiency of surface irrigation systems walker and skogerboe 1987 surface irrigation covers about 80 of the total irrigated lands in iran moreover suitable design and logical management of the surface irrigation can led to increased water use efficiency and cultivated area ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 lalehzari and boroomand nasab 2017 because of suitable aeration in the root zone furrow irrigation is the best method in surface irrigation wu et al 2017 however furrow irrigation has some problems such as low efficiency poor distribution uniformity and high deep percolation elliott et al 1993 moravejalahkami et al 2009 the inappropriate management design and implementation are the important reasons for poor performance of surface irrigation systems ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 it is possible to design and evaluate furrow irrigation systems using different simulation models in past years many researchers used some models to improve the performance of surface irrigation gillies et al 2010 koech et al 2014 morris et al 2015 it is necessary to use simulation models such as surdev jurriens et al 2001 sirmod walker 2003 winsrfr bautista et al 2012 sides adamala et al 2014 surcos burguete et al 2014 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 to reduce costs and design time mahdizadeh khasraghi et al 2015 bautista et al 2009 used winsrfr software to evaluate field events characterize infiltration and optimize the combination of irrigation parameters in addition gonzlez et al 2011 2016 evaluated performance of surface irrigation and applied a new method to improve field topography the results of this study showed that optimum slope depends on the infiltration length and inflow rate finally this method could be used to calculate the optimal slope it is difficult to manage surface irrigation because of large number of effective parameters therefore it is necessary to use the most effective parameters for improvement of irrigation performance according to raine et al 1997 smith et al 2005 bautista et al 2009 morris et al 2015 studies inflow rate and cut off time are the most effective parameters morris et al 2015 suggested that inflow rate of the range of 2 7 l s and cut off time from 50 to 300 min were suitable for the best performance according to walker and skogerboe 1987 clemmens et al 1999 and chen et al 2012 geometric parameters such as slope length and cross section are effective parameters as well according to chen et al 2012 suitable field geometry could increase irrigation application efficiency up to 26 7 anwar et al 2016 reported that application efficiency and distribution uniformity are the common indicators for evaluation of surface irrigation while gonzlez et al 2011 used distribution uniformity as performance indicator chen et al 2012 used application efficiency average depth applied and distribution uniformity reddy et al 2013 used application efficiency and water requirements morris et al 2015 used application efficiency requirement efficiency and deep percolation finally kifle et al 2017 used different indicators such as application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation and runoff volume as indicators sugarcane fields seven plantation sites are the major agricultural activities in the southwest of iran cover an area about 100 000 ha which have become the largest sources of water consumption veysi et al 2017 also accurate estimation of infiltration parameters appropriate inflow rate and cut off time suitable physical design are essential to improve irrigation management of this area hamzeh et al 2013 2016 on the other hand inappropriate design and unsuitable optimizations of irrigation parameters lead to decrease efficiency and non uniform distribution of water in the furrow so to optimize irrigation parameters and suggest accurate approach the aim of current study were defined as follows a the first objective of this study is to evaluate winsrfr ability for simulating furrow irrigation b the second objective is to achieve the best combination of inflow rate and cut off time c the third objective in the current study is to suggest the best combination of inflow rate cut off time and field length and slope in fact the last goal is to analyze different inflow rates cut off time field layout and combination of them for improving furrow irrigation performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area data used in the current study were collected from salman farsi agro industry sugarcane fields on a clay loam soil texture sugarcane fields located in southwest of iran latitudes 31 00ʹ30ʺ 32 30ʹ00ʺn and longitudes 48 15ʹ00ʺ 48 40ʹ40ʺe as shown in fig 1 the average rainfall of the study area is 266 mm and the annual evaporation is 2788 mm total area of the salman farsi agro industry is over 14 000 ha however its cultivated area is 12 000 ha all fields were divided into rectangular fields of 25 ha 250 m 1000 area all of which have subsurface drainage in the depth of 1 8 m in this district all fields are irrigated using furrow irrigation and low pressure hydro flume irrigation usually starts in may and continues until early november during the sugarcane growth period in this area the applied irrigation water is 3000 mm with peak crop water use of 10 13 mm d veysi et al 2017 2 2 field measurements field experiments were carried out on r5 22 fields of sugarcane with the age of raton 2 and there were three different irrigation events from 14 september to 31 october 2016 it should be noted that in this study we investigated three important irrigation events i e first second and third in surface irrigation the performance of these events are different because of temporal changes of soil infiltration after third irrigation soil infiltration variation is not significant during the growing season to evaluate the irrigation system all experiments were conducted on the furrows of 250 m in length 1 83 m in space and 0 04 in slope in this study nine block ended furrows were irrigated under three repetitions and values of 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 l s for inflow rate first inflow rate was measured by w s c flume type 2 the furrows were divided into 10 stations that advance and recession time were recorded at each of the stations fig 2 because of better control and management of the inflow treatments we considered the same layout for each repetition the sipar id model was used to estimate the roughness coefficient rodriguez and martos 2010 2 3 winsrfr software winsrfr is a new software for evaluating and simulating the surface irrigation winsrfr integrates the earlier software such as srfr strelkoff et al 1998 border strelkoff et al 1996 and basin clemmens et al 1995 winsrfr needs different data to analyse irrigation performance data required for software include inflow geometric properties and depth of water application in the current study the event analysis world was used to estimate and calibrate the infiltration parameters in addition the advance and recession trajectory and irrigation performance under different inflow rates in three irrigation events were simulated using simulation world also the physical design world were used to evaluate different geometric scenarios such as changing field length and slope finally the operations analysis world is used to determine the best combination of inflow rate and cut off time which the analysis is conducted with the help of performance contours as a function of inflow rate and cut off time bautista et al 2009 it should be noted that we considered three inflow rates i e 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 l s in the filed study and five inflow rates 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l s in the simulation study the winsrfr software consists of zero inertia and kinematic wave models in this study we used the zero inertia model to simulate and evaluate furrow irrigation performance bautista et al 2015 3 infiltration parameters 3 1 determination of kostiakov lewis parameters the modified kostiakov lewis equation is one of the most useful infiltration equations in surface irrigation hanson et al 1993 in this study the kostiakov lewis equation was used to calculate the infiltration winsrfr software used two point methods elliot and walker 1982 to estimate infiltration coefficients in the present study cumulative infiltration was estimated using the kostiakov lewis equation as follows 1 1 z k t α f 0 t where z is cumulative infiltration in units of volume per length of furrow m3m 1 t represents elapse time of infiltration min f0 is the basic infiltration rate m3m 1min 1 and finally k and α are empirical coefficients a dimensionless k m3 minα m 1 the basic infiltration rate is determined using the following eq 2 walker and skogerboe 1987 2 f 0 q i n q o u t l where l is the length of furrow m qin and qout are inflow and runoff rate m3 min respectively the advance curve is simple power function found using the following eq 3 elliot and walker 1982 walker and skogerboe 1987 3 x p t r where x is water front advance m t is time from the start of inflow min and r and p are fitting parameters kostiakov lewis parameters a and k were determined as follows 4 α l o g v l v 0 5 l l o g t l t 0 5 l 5 k v l σ z t l α 6 v 0 5 l q 0 t 0 5 l 0 5 l σ y a 0 f 0 t 0 5 l 1 r 7 v l q 0 t l l σ y a 0 f 0 t l 1 r where σ y is surface profile shape factor 0 77 σ z is subsurface profile shape factor a0 is wetted area at the upstream m2 and t0 5l and tl are the advance times min at two points x1 0 5 l and x2 l respectively for determining σ z the following equation is used 8 σ z α r 1 α 1 1 α 1 r 3 2 calibration of infiltration parameters due to the sensitivity of furrow irrigation performance to infiltration parameters it is necessary to calibrate them in this paper kostiakov lewis coefficients were calibrated using the event analysis world and merriam and keller 1978 method in the winsrfr software it is worth noting that the merriam keller method is used for estimating the final infiltration depth profile and the average infiltration characteristics of the evaluated furrow from a post irrigation volume balance merriam and keller 1978 the precision of the estimated parameters can be achieved via a trial and error method which is used to calculate the infiltration function bautista et al 2012 initial measured values of n a and f0 were put to winsrfr as infiltration coefficients and then the initial estimation for the k parameter was calculated using the winsrfr the simulated advance and recession trajectory curves were compared with the measured curves and if the fit was poor new combinations of n a and f0 were tested over an approximate range this procedure was repeated until a good fit between the measured and simulated curve was achieved finally based on this manner the best combinations of n a k and f0 were obtained 3 3 irrigation performance parameters in this study three parameters were used to estimate performance of irrigation for this purpose soil moisture samples were taken using auger core sampler before and after 48 h irrigation at the three first mid and end points along the furrow and in the three depths 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm finally three performance parameters were used in this study including application efficiency ae distribution uniformity du and deep percolation dp 9 a e d a d d a p 100 10 d u z m i n z a v 100 11 d p d d p d a p 100 where dad dap zmin zav and ddp are the depth of water added to the root zone mm depth of water applied to the furrow mm minimum infiltrated depth mm the mean of depths infiltrated over the furrow length mm and depth of deep percolated water mm determined from root zone water balance respectively 3 4 objective function the inflow rate cut off time and field characteristics are the most important parameters affecting performance of furrow irrigation bautista et al 2009 the performance contours were generated using the winsrfr software to optimize performance in this paper inflow rate and cut off time and geometric parameters were evaluated using operation analysis and physical design worlds via winsrfr respectively finally the objective function of was employed to optimize the performance of furrow irrigation system 12 o f α a e β d u γ d p which α β γ 0 33 to optimize the performance three alternatives were evaluated at the first alternative physical parameters field geometry were assumed constant and inflow rate and cut off time were changed in the second alternative inflow rate and cut off time were constant and physical parameters were changed finally inflow rate cut off time and physical parameters were altered 3 5 statistical analysis the advance recession curve was simulated by the winsrfr in this study three evalution criteria were used to analyze the software s accuracy these evalution criteria were 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse jamieson et al 1991 2 distribution to 45 line λ and 3 wilmot agreement d willmott et al 2012 in the current study the relative error re criterion normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae were also used to evaluate the precision of simulation for performance indicators lower values of nrmse and mae indicate a perfect fit as follows 13 to 17 13 n r m s e 1 o 1 n o i p i 2 n 100 14 p i λ o i 15 d 1 1 n o i p i 2 1 n o i o p i o 2 16 r e p i o i o i 100 17 m a e i 1 n p i o i n where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values of the advance recession times respectively n is the number of measurements and finally o is the average measurement if λ 1 it s means oi is more than pi and if λ 1 means pi is more than oi also the high accuracy in simulation in when d 1 in addition the relative error re criterion was used to compare the field and simulated performance parameters 18 r e v s v s v s 100 where vs and vo are the simulated and observed values respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of infiltration parameters data summery for the experimental furrows in all irrigation events are given in table 1 variation of calibrated infiltration parameters for the irrigation events in the sugarcane field were summarized in table 2 as seen in table 2 the value of a varied from 0 15 to 0 34 in the first event from 0 15 to 0 25 in the second event and from 0 10 to 0 20 in the last event furman et al 2006 suggested that there was no reason to treat the exponent of an infiltration power law as α variable quantity based on xu et al 2019 reports soil structure is periodically disturbed and destroyed due to cultivation irrigation and rainfall likely causing varied values of α table 2 also xu et al 2019 showed that a range of variation for a in the first event was greater than other events these results were following the results of the current study there was a high variation in k values in all irrigation events the range of changing k was from 42 to 120 mm hr 50 143 mm hr and 86 176 mm hr in the first second and third irrigation events respectively li et al 2009 and xu et al 2019 also report similar results that could be achieved by temporal variability in soil bulk density and moisture and cut off time value of f0 had high variation similar to coefficient k 4 2 advance and recession times the accuracy of the winsrfr software in simulating advance and recession trajectory curves was evaluated using the measured data it should be noted that advance trajectory depends on several parameters such as furrow slope and length inflow rate soil infiltration characteristics and roughness coefficient for example the influence of manning s roughness on the advance trajectory curve is significant table 3 presents the results of advance trajectory curves based on three evaluation criteria nrmse d and λ under standard conditions three inflow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 l s field slope of 0 04 and length of 250 m water advance trajectory varied from 749 to 1053 min for the first event 749 to 1751 min for the second event and 994 to 1700 min for the third event the different slope inflow rate and soil characteristics were translated into the variability of the advance trajectory curve araujo et al 2019 reported that the inflow rate must be sufficient to ensure that advance trajectory reaches to the end of the furrows in a reasonable time to allow sufficient water infiltration and distribution uniformity throughout the field according to table 3 nrmse d and λ values varied in the range 6 50 22 36 0 97 0 99 and 0 84 0 98 in the first event in the range 7 61 20 70 0 98 0 99 and 0 90 1 04 in the second event and in the range 11 97 30 99 0 96 0 99 and 0 93 1 00 in the third event respectively the average values of nrmse d and λ are 6 76 0 98 and 0 94 in the first irrigation event 15 58 0 98 and 0 98 in the second event 17 45 0 98 and 0 97 in the third event respectively by increasing inflow rate to 2 l sec the simulation accuracy decreased regarding the values of the evaluation criteria in general the results showed that advance trajectory curves were simulated with appropriate accuracy under inflow rate of 1 l s than under inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s araujo et al 2019 found that the inflow rate had a direct effect on the advance trajectory curve and it is s more sensitive to the inflow rate in its lower range table 4 shows the results of recession trajectory curves relative to different inflow rates and various irrigation events recession trajectory depends on how the k value is influenced by the water infiltration rate and irrigation time xu et al 2019 it should be noted that due to low slope about 0 04 and subsurface drainage system recession times in all stations were recorded with short intervals the results of the recession trajectory curve showed that recession time varied from 133 min to 285 min for the first event 180 min to 330 min for the second event and 160 min to 280 min for the last event the simulated recession trajectories in the different events were in good agreement with the measured values and the average values of nrmse d and λ values varied from 6 07 to 9 05 0 5 to 0 76 and 0 97 to 1 01 for the first irrigation event 3 57 to 10 91 0 23 to 0 95 and 0 98 to 1 03 for the second irrigation event 1 57 to 30 99 0 44 to 0 90 and 0 98 to 1 04 for the third irrigation event which showed negligible differences according to table 4 we observed high simulation accuracy for inflow rate of 1 l s in the first event nrmse and d were 6 07 and 0 76 respectively according to the values of nrmse and d for inflow rate of 2 l s winsrfr had satisfactory performance in simulating recession trajectory although the simulation accuracy was less under the inflow rate of 1 l s overall the average values of nrmse d and λ were 6 1 0 71 and 0 98 in simulating recession times respectively showing a high accuracy of winsrfr these results are an agreement with abbasi et al 2003 chen et al 2012 anwar et al 2016 sayari et al 2017 and xu et al 2019 who reported that winsrfr accuracy is reasonable for simulation of advance and recession trajectory curves also nie et al 2019 reported that the accuracy of simulated values of the water advance and recession trajectories can be improved by considering variations of soil infiltration nie et al 2019 the results indicated that the performance of winsrfr was satisfactory for the prediction of the advance and recession trajectory curves 4 3 performance analysis fig 3 shows the results of ae du and dp for three irrigation events for an application depth of 100 mm the highest ae 74 and of 40 3 was determined at the first event given the suitable slope and no compact soil more volume of water was applied to root zone which would decrease dp 26 the minimum value of ae 48 5 and of 12 2 was obtained for the third irrigation event this could be because of longer cut off time and unsuitable topography because of traffic of agricultural machinery of the second and third event the ae and du values in second irrigation event 74 and 77 05 and first event 60 22 and 74 02 were higher than those obtained from third event 48 56 and 39 78 which the lower values of du in third event is due to high inflow volume and insufficient water stored in root zone the values of dp in first and second events were lower than third irrigation event this finding could be because of cut off time and inflow volume in different irrigation events the average values of cut off time and inflow volume in first event were 855 7 min and 70 6 m3 in the second event were 1109 5 min and 90 1 m3 which these values were lower than those obtained from third event 1292 5 min and 107 3 m3 this results indicated that the acceptable irrigation performance parameters were achieved in reasonable cut off time and inflow volume xu et al 2019 also reported that variation in inflow volumes affecting irrigation performance was mainly caused by variation in infiltration and manning roughness coefficient finally average values of ae du and dp were 60 9 76 4 and 39 1 respectively different studies reported similar results such as izadi et al 1991 dalton et al 2001 smith et al 2005 reddy et al 2015 and kifle et al 2017 salahou et al 2018 xu et al 2019 and nie et al 2019 the irrigation performance parameters under different inflow rates in field conditions were compared in table 5 these studies showed that ae was ranged from 50 to 70 as seen in table 5 field data the highest and lowest values of of were obtained for an inflow rate of 1 l s 35 9 and 2 l s 25 4 respectively low slope about 0 04 heavy soil texture clay loam and longer opportunity time led to the highest of for 1 l s compared to other inflow rates based on the simulation results the highest performance indicators ae du and dp occurred in 3 l s and cut off times of 324 7 383 5 and 429 5 min for the first second and third irrigation events respectively fig 3 fig 3 shows that under the first irrigation the average values of ae du and dp are 75 5 74 0 and 24 5 respectively in the second event the average values of ae du and dp were 60 2 76 6 and 39 8 respectively finally in the third event 48 6 74 6 and 51 4 were obtained for average values of ae du and dp respectively 4 4 simulating the performance parameters with winsrfr a comparison between measured and simulated performance indicators including ae du and dp are summarized for all irrigation events in fig 4 the values of nrmse mae and re indicators indicate there are very good fits fig 4 for simulating the performance indicators the values of nrmse mae and re for the ae were 8 19 6 00 and 6 26 for the first event 7 77 6 78 and 5 15 for the second event and 8 19 6 00 and 13 35 for the last event respectively also for du the values of nrmse mae and re between simulated and measured data are 12 12 10 49 and 16 02 in the first event 14 94 13 78 and 13 50 in the second event and 12 72 11 27 and 20 44 in third event respectively with respect to evaluation criteria winsrfr had good performance in estimating ae lower accuracy in estimating du is because of many reasons and the most important reason may be that the infiltrated volume and cut off time in all irrigation events were greater than required values which these reasons led to the applied water depths were more than required water depth zreq 100 mm and these results are agreements with nie et al 2019 to simulate dp the average values of nrmse and mae for the three irrigation events were 5 61 and 4 98 respectively the lower values of nrmse and mae indicate a perfect fit in the first irrigation event reasonable cut off time and suitable topography led to acceptable performance indicators 4 5 optimal inflow variables according to bautista et al 2009 report inflow rate qin and cut off time tco are the most effective parameters compared to furrow length and slope and can lead to improve irrigation performance it is simple for farmers to modify inflow discharge and cutoff time as compared to modifying soil characteristics and field geometry in the current section the operation analysis in winsrfr is used to simulate different inflow rates and cut off times to improve irrigation performance the optimization is conducted with the help of performance contours which depict the variation of selected performance measures as a function of inflow rate and cut off time bautista et al 2009 note that in this world the shape factors need to be calibrated to better match volume balance results to unsteady flow predictions the calibration uses unsteady simulation results from a single point in the solution region bautista et al 2012 which we employed field conditions such as inflow rate of 1 1 5 and 2 l s and field measured for cut off times also to identify an acceptable combination of qin and tco we simulated the range of 1 to 3 l s for the inflow rate however in this study different furrow lengths of 200 250 and 300 m and slope of 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 were evaluated to improve the performance indicators based on the results of this study compared to furrow length and slope optimal combinations of qin and tco will help to improve irrigation performance all results are summarized in table 6 as indicated in table 6 for larger changing in inflow rate the ae du and dp were less sensitive increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 l s increased ae by 7 8 11 9 14 6 and 16 5 du by 8 1 11 9 14 6 and 16 6 of by 7 8 11 9 14 6 and 16 5 and decreased dp by 7 9 12 1 14 9 and 16 8 respectively according to this results changing inflow rate from 1 0 l s to 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l s increased ae and du more than 20 and decreased dp up to 30 changing inflow to the range of 1 5 3 l s could improve of about 25 the optimal performance indicators were obtained when the inflow rate increased to 3 l s values of 74 92 75 09 and 24 92 for ae du and dp respectively it should be noted that increasing qin to 3 l s will lead to a higher irrigation performance if tco decreases to less than 500 min it would be suggested that by a good leveling and controlling of the traffic of agricultural machinery the irrigation performance will be improved with inflow rate of 3 l s salahou et al 2019 also reported that by increasing and decreasing the inflow rate the irrigation performance indicators increased and decreased respectively the results are similar to other studies such as morris et al 2015 anwar et al 2016 akbar et al 2016 and nie et al 2019 showing that reasonable combination of qin and cut off time increased ae to 75 90 and this results indicated that an optimal inflow variables can be used for design of furrow irrigation in sugarcane fields which can increase irrigation performance 4 6 changing geometric parameters for studying the effect of geometric parameters on furrow irrigation performance values of 1 l s 250 m and 0 04 were considered for qin length and slope respectively as field conditions in this study different furrow lengths such as 200 250 and 300 m were employed to improve the performance indicators according to table 7 changing slope from 0 04 to 0 03 decreased ae du and of by 0 55 0 58 and 0 49 respectively and increased dp by 0 33 when the slope was 0 05 the values of ae du and of increased to 0 45 0 53 0 49 respectively however dp decreased by 0 50 note that because of wide furrows and heavy soil texture in sugarcane fields the slope of 0 05 did not lead to erosion in length of furrows these results indicated that the three performance indicators increased as the slope increased which this is because of the decreasing of the volume stored in the furrow the results of the current study are agreements with salahou et al 2019 the results indicated that the slope had a low effect on the performance of furrow irrigation as seen in table 7 when field length decreased from 250 m to 200 m ae and du respectively increased by 4 33 and 4 33 and dp reduced by 4 42 these results led to improving of by 4 43 on the other hand when furrow length was 300 m ae and du decreased by 4 14 and 3 68 respectively and dp increased by 4 12 because of this change the value of the objective function was improved by about 3 95 xu et al 2019 also reported that ae values reduce by increasing field length also they showed the total amount of water that percolated deeply increased with increasing border length other researchers such as bai et al 2010 and chen et al 2012 reported similar results these studies suggested that geometric parameters i e field length width and slope affect the irrigation performance 4 7 optimal combinations of design parameters in this study parameters affecting the performance analysis were classified in two cases the first case is qin and cut off time and other case is furrow length and slope to evaluate the performance 1 l s 250 m and 0 04 respectively for inflow rate length and slope were considered as standard condition in this study the physical design world of the winsrfr software was used to optimize length and slope fig 3 shows that the maximum values of ae and du and minimum value of dp were obtained for inflow rate of 3 l s length of 200 m for and slope of 0 05 when design parameters were changed the ae and du was increased more than 25 and dp was decreased by 39 consequently of was improved more than 30 because of changing design parameters therefore reasonable combinations of design parameters led to 6 increase of of compared to the of value under only changing inflow variables 5 conclusion in this study to improve irrigation performance with limited freshwater resources for sugarcane fields optimum inflow rate cut off time and physical parameters were determined different irrigation performance indicators were evaluated under field and simulation studies the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 the evaluation of winsrfr in simulating the advance and recession times indicated that this software has good accuracy regarding the field measurements 2 based on the field study the average values of application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation were 75 5 74 0 and 24 5 in the first event 60 2 76 6 and 39 8 in the second event 48 6 74 6 and 51 4 in the third event respectively finally the high objective function in the first irrigation 52 6 the second irrigation 42 5 and the third irrigation 34 2 in the field s conditions could be achieved using inflow rate of 1 l s 3 the results showed the average relative error of winsrfr to estimate application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation was 8 3 16 7 and 15 6 respectively as a consequence winsrfr simulated application efficiency with higher accuracy relative to distribution uniformity and deep percolation 4 optimizing inflow rate could increase application efficiency and distribution uniformity more than 20 decrease deep percolation up to 30 and finally improve of about 25 5 changing furrow slope from 0 04 to 0 03 and 0 05 led to decreasing and increasing objective function by 0 95 and 0 80 respectively also when furrow length was changed from 250 m to 200 and 300 m the value of the objective function increased by 9 39 and 7 7 respectively 6 using winsrfr the optimal inflow rate and cut off time are recommended as 3 l s and 379 5 min for sugarcane fields when the filed length and slope are 200 m and 0 05 respectively also the optimum application efficiency 77 6 distribution uniformity 77 9 deep percolation 22 4 and objective function 43 9 could be achieved using optimal inflow rate cut off time and field length and slope 7 it is recommended that winsrfr can be used for designing and managing surface irrigation systems to reduce irrigation water losses and increase distribution uniformity crop yield declaration of interests the authors declare that

10802,accurate design suitable management and optimization of irrigation design parameters play an important role in increasing the performance of furrow irrigation the main objective of this study was to optimize the performance of furrow irrigation using winsrfr in the fields of salman farsi agro industry sugarcane located in the southwest of iran for this purpose field experiments were conducted under nine blocked ended furrows with the length of 250 m the top width of 1 83 m and slope of 0 04 and in three inflow treatments 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 l s with three repetitions the winsrfr software was employed to optimize the combination of irrigation parameters such as inflow rate cut off time and field geometry objective function of including application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation was also employed to optimize the performance the results showed that using 1 0 l s inflow rate could increase of by 35 99 which was the best performance compared to 1 5 and 2 0 l s changing furrow length from 250 m to 200 m showed that of value increased by 39 8 however changing it to 300 m of decreased by 7 7 in addition changing slope from 0 04 to 0 03 decreased of by 0 9 while changing it to 0 05 of was improved by 1 on the other hand changing the inflow and cut off time field length and combinations of them led to the increased of by 25 8 39 and 31 respectively finally to obtain the maximum performance in sugarcane fields inflow rate of 3 l s and cut off time of 379 5 min were suggested keywords furrow irrigation winsrfr 4 1 3 sugarcane

and drip irrigation thus many studies have been carried out to increase the efficiency of surface irrigation systems walker and skogerboe 1987 surface irrigation covers about 80 of the total irrigated lands in iran moreover suitable design and logical management of the surface irrigation can led to increased water use efficiency and cultivated area ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 lalehzari and boroomand nasab 2017 because of suitable aeration in the root zone furrow irrigation is the best method in surface irrigation wu et al 2017 however furrow irrigation has some problems such as low efficiency poor distribution uniformity and high deep percolation elliott et al 1993 moravejalahkami et al 2009 the inappropriate management design and implementation are the important reasons for poor performance of surface irrigation systems ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 it is possible to design and evaluate furrow irrigation systems using different simulation models in past years many researchers used some models to improve the performance of surface irrigation gillies et al 2010 koech et al 2014 morris et al 2015 it is necessary to use simulation models such as surdev jurriens et al 2001 sirmod walker 2003 winsrfr bautista et al 2012 sides adamala et al 2014 surcos burguete et al 2014 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 to reduce costs and design time mahdizadeh khasraghi et al 2015 bautista et al 2009 used winsrfr software to evaluate field events characterize infiltration and optimize the combination of irrigation parameters in addition gonzlez et al 2011 2016 evaluated performance of surface irrigation and applied a new method to improve field topography the results of this study showed that optimum slope depends on the infiltration length and inflow rate finally this method could be used to calculate the optimal slope it is difficult to manage surface irrigation because of large number of effective parameters therefore it is necessary to use the most effective parameters for improvement of irrigation performance according to raine et al 1997 smith et al 2005 bautista et al 2009 morris et al 2015 studies inflow rate and cut off time are the most effective parameters morris et al 2015 suggested that inflow rate of the range of 2 7 l s and cut off time from 50 to 300 min were suitable for the best performance according to walker and skogerboe 1987 clemmens et al 1999 and chen et al 2012 geometric parameters such as slope length and cross section are effective parameters as well according to chen et al 2012 suitable field geometry could increase irrigation application efficiency up to 26 7 anwar et al 2016 reported that application efficiency and distribution uniformity are the common indicators for evaluation of surface irrigation while gonzlez et al 2011 used distribution uniformity as performance indicator chen et al 2012 used application efficiency average depth applied and distribution uniformity reddy et al 2013 used application efficiency and water requirements morris et al 2015 used application efficiency requirement efficiency and deep percolation finally kifle et al 2017 used different indicators such as application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation and runoff volume as indicators sugarcane fields seven plantation sites are the major agricultural activities in the southwest of iran cover an area about 100 000 ha which have become the largest sources of water consumption veysi et al 2017 also accurate estimation of infiltration parameters appropriate inflow rate and cut off time suitable physical design are essential to improve irrigation management of this area hamzeh et al 2013 2016 on the other hand inappropriate design and unsuitable optimizations of irrigation parameters lead to decrease efficiency and non uniform distribution of water in the furrow so to optimize irrigation parameters and suggest accurate approach the aim of current study were defined as follows a the first objective of this study is to evaluate winsrfr ability for simulating furrow irrigation b the second objective is to achieve the best combination of inflow rate and cut off time c the third objective in the current study is to suggest the best combination of inflow rate cut off time and field length and slope in fact the last goal is to analyze different inflow rates cut off time field layout and combination of them for improving furrow irrigation performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area data used in the current study were collected from salman farsi agro industry sugarcane fields on a clay loam soil texture sugarcane fields located in southwest of iran latitudes 31 00ʹ30ʺ 32 30ʹ00ʺn and longitudes 48 15ʹ00ʺ 48 40ʹ40ʺe as shown in fig 1 the average rainfall of the study area is 266 mm and the annual evaporation is 2788 mm total area of the salman farsi agro industry is over 14 000 ha however its cultivated area is 12 000 ha all fields were divided into rectangular fields of 25 ha 250 m 1000 area all of which have subsurface drainage in the depth of 1 8 m in this district all fields are irrigated using furrow irrigation and low pressure hydro flume irrigation usually starts in may and continues until early november during the sugarcane growth period in this area the applied irrigation water is 3000 mm with peak crop water use of 10 13 mm d veysi et al 2017 2 2 field measurements field experiments were carried out on r5 22 fields of sugarcane with the age of raton 2 and there were three different irrigation events from 14 september to 31 october 2016 it should be noted that in this study we investigated three important irrigation events i e first second and third in surface irrigation the performance of these events are different because of temporal changes of soil infiltration after third irrigation soil infiltration variation is not significant during the growing season to evaluate the irrigation system all experiments were conducted on the furrows of 250 m in length 1 83 m in space and 0 04 in slope in this study nine block ended furrows were irrigated under three repetitions and values of 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 l s for inflow rate first inflow rate was measured by w s c flume type 2 the furrows were divided into 10 stations that advance and recession time were recorded at each of the stations fig 2 because of better control and management of the inflow treatments we considered the same layout for each repetition the sipar id model was used to estimate the roughness coefficient rodriguez and martos 2010 2 3 winsrfr software winsrfr is a new software for evaluating and simulating the surface irrigation winsrfr integrates the earlier software such as srfr strelkoff et al 1998 border strelkoff et al 1996 and basin clemmens et al 1995 winsrfr needs different data to analyse irrigation performance data required for software include inflow geometric properties and depth of water application in the current study the event analysis world was used to estimate and calibrate the infiltration parameters in addition the advance and recession trajectory and irrigation performance under different inflow rates in three irrigation events were simulated using simulation world also the physical design world were used to evaluate different geometric scenarios such as changing field length and slope finally the operations analysis world is used to determine the best combination of inflow rate and cut off time which the analysis is conducted with the help of performance contours as a function of inflow rate and cut off time bautista et al 2009 it should be noted that we considered three inflow rates i e 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 l s in the filed study and five inflow rates 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l s in the simulation study the winsrfr software consists of zero inertia and kinematic wave models in this study we used the zero inertia model to simulate and evaluate furrow irrigation performance bautista et al 2015 3 infiltration parameters 3 1 determination of kostiakov lewis parameters the modified kostiakov lewis equation is one of the most useful infiltration equations in surface irrigation hanson et al 1993 in this study the kostiakov lewis equation was used to calculate the infiltration winsrfr software used two point methods elliot and walker 1982 to estimate infiltration coefficients in the present study cumulative infiltration was estimated using the kostiakov lewis equation as follows 1 1 z k t α f 0 t where z is cumulative infiltration in units of volume per length of furrow m3m 1 t represents elapse time of infiltration min f0 is the basic infiltration rate m3m 1min 1 and finally k and α are empirical coefficients a dimensionless k m3 minα m 1 the basic infiltration rate is determined using the following eq 2 walker and skogerboe 1987 2 f 0 q i n q o u t l where l is the length of furrow m qin and qout are inflow and runoff rate m3 min respectively the advance curve is simple power function found using the following eq 3 elliot and walker 1982 walker and skogerboe 1987 3 x p t r where x is water front advance m t is time from the start of inflow min and r and p are fitting parameters kostiakov lewis parameters a and k were determined as follows 4 α l o g v l v 0 5 l l o g t l t 0 5 l 5 k v l σ z t l α 6 v 0 5 l q 0 t 0 5 l 0 5 l σ y a 0 f 0 t 0 5 l 1 r 7 v l q 0 t l l σ y a 0 f 0 t l 1 r where σ y is surface profile shape factor 0 77 σ z is subsurface profile shape factor a0 is wetted area at the upstream m2 and t0 5l and tl are the advance times min at two points x1 0 5 l and x2 l respectively for determining σ z the following equation is used 8 σ z α r 1 α 1 1 α 1 r 3 2 calibration of infiltration parameters due to the sensitivity of furrow irrigation performance to infiltration parameters it is necessary to calibrate them in this paper kostiakov lewis coefficients were calibrated using the event analysis world and merriam and keller 1978 method in the winsrfr software it is worth noting that the merriam keller method is used for estimating the final infiltration depth profile and the average infiltration characteristics of the evaluated furrow from a post irrigation volume balance merriam and keller 1978 the precision of the estimated parameters can be achieved via a trial and error method which is used to calculate the infiltration function bautista et al 2012 initial measured values of n a and f0 were put to winsrfr as infiltration coefficients and then the initial estimation for the k parameter was calculated using the winsrfr the simulated advance and recession trajectory curves were compared with the measured curves and if the fit was poor new combinations of n a and f0 were tested over an approximate range this procedure was repeated until a good fit between the measured and simulated curve was achieved finally based on this manner the best combinations of n a k and f0 were obtained 3 3 irrigation performance parameters in this study three parameters were used to estimate performance of irrigation for this purpose soil moisture samples were taken using auger core sampler before and after 48 h irrigation at the three first mid and end points along the furrow and in the three depths 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm finally three performance parameters were used in this study including application efficiency ae distribution uniformity du and deep percolation dp 9 a e d a d d a p 100 10 d u z m i n z a v 100 11 d p d d p d a p 100 where dad dap zmin zav and ddp are the depth of water added to the root zone mm depth of water applied to the furrow mm minimum infiltrated depth mm the mean of depths infiltrated over the furrow length mm and depth of deep percolated water mm determined from root zone water balance respectively 3 4 objective function the inflow rate cut off time and field characteristics are the most important parameters affecting performance of furrow irrigation bautista et al 2009 the performance contours were generated using the winsrfr software to optimize performance in this paper inflow rate and cut off time and geometric parameters were evaluated using operation analysis and physical design worlds via winsrfr respectively finally the objective function of was employed to optimize the performance of furrow irrigation system 12 o f α a e β d u γ d p which α β γ 0 33 to optimize the performance three alternatives were evaluated at the first alternative physical parameters field geometry were assumed constant and inflow rate and cut off time were changed in the second alternative inflow rate and cut off time were constant and physical parameters were changed finally inflow rate cut off time and physical parameters were altered 3 5 statistical analysis the advance recession curve was simulated by the winsrfr in this study three evalution criteria were used to analyze the software s accuracy these evalution criteria were 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse jamieson et al 1991 2 distribution to 45 line λ and 3 wilmot agreement d willmott et al 2012 in the current study the relative error re criterion normalized root mean square error nrmse and mean absolute error mae were also used to evaluate the precision of simulation for performance indicators lower values of nrmse and mae indicate a perfect fit as follows 13 to 17 13 n r m s e 1 o 1 n o i p i 2 n 100 14 p i λ o i 15 d 1 1 n o i p i 2 1 n o i o p i o 2 16 r e p i o i o i 100 17 m a e i 1 n p i o i n where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values of the advance recession times respectively n is the number of measurements and finally o is the average measurement if λ 1 it s means oi is more than pi and if λ 1 means pi is more than oi also the high accuracy in simulation in when d 1 in addition the relative error re criterion was used to compare the field and simulated performance parameters 18 r e v s v s v s 100 where vs and vo are the simulated and observed values respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of infiltration parameters data summery for the experimental furrows in all irrigation events are given in table 1 variation of calibrated infiltration parameters for the irrigation events in the sugarcane field were summarized in table 2 as seen in table 2 the value of a varied from 0 15 to 0 34 in the first event from 0 15 to 0 25 in the second event and from 0 10 to 0 20 in the last event furman et al 2006 suggested that there was no reason to treat the exponent of an infiltration power law as α variable quantity based on xu et al 2019 reports soil structure is periodically disturbed and destroyed due to cultivation irrigation and rainfall likely causing varied values of α table 2 also xu et al 2019 showed that a range of variation for a in the first event was greater than other events these results were following the results of the current study there was a high variation in k values in all irrigation events the range of changing k was from 42 to 120 mm hr 50 143 mm hr and 86 176 mm hr in the first second and third irrigation events respectively li et al 2009 and xu et al 2019 also report similar results that could be achieved by temporal variability in soil bulk density and moisture and cut off time value of f0 had high variation similar to coefficient k 4 2 advance and recession times the accuracy of the winsrfr software in simulating advance and recession trajectory curves was evaluated using the measured data it should be noted that advance trajectory depends on several parameters such as furrow slope and length inflow rate soil infiltration characteristics and roughness coefficient for example the influence of manning s roughness on the advance trajectory curve is significant table 3 presents the results of advance trajectory curves based on three evaluation criteria nrmse d and λ under standard conditions three inflow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 l s field slope of 0 04 and length of 250 m water advance trajectory varied from 749 to 1053 min for the first event 749 to 1751 min for the second event and 994 to 1700 min for the third event the different slope inflow rate and soil characteristics were translated into the variability of the advance trajectory curve araujo et al 2019 reported that the inflow rate must be sufficient to ensure that advance trajectory reaches to the end of the furrows in a reasonable time to allow sufficient water infiltration and distribution uniformity throughout the field according to table 3 nrmse d and λ values varied in the range 6 50 22 36 0 97 0 99 and 0 84 0 98 in the first event in the range 7 61 20 70 0 98 0 99 and 0 90 1 04 in the second event and in the range 11 97 30 99 0 96 0 99 and 0 93 1 00 in the third event respectively the average values of nrmse d and λ are 6 76 0 98 and 0 94 in the first irrigation event 15 58 0 98 and 0 98 in the second event 17 45 0 98 and 0 97 in the third event respectively by increasing inflow rate to 2 l sec the simulation accuracy decreased regarding the values of the evaluation criteria in general the results showed that advance trajectory curves were simulated with appropriate accuracy under inflow rate of 1 l s than under inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s araujo et al 2019 found that the inflow rate had a direct effect on the advance trajectory curve and it is s more sensitive to the inflow rate in its lower range table 4 shows the results of recession trajectory curves relative to different inflow rates and various irrigation events recession trajectory depends on how the k value is influenced by the water infiltration rate and irrigation time xu et al 2019 it should be noted that due to low slope about 0 04 and subsurface drainage system recession times in all stations were recorded with short intervals the results of the recession trajectory curve showed that recession time varied from 133 min to 285 min for the first event 180 min to 330 min for the second event and 160 min to 280 min for the last event the simulated recession trajectories in the different events were in good agreement with the measured values and the average values of nrmse d and λ values varied from 6 07 to 9 05 0 5 to 0 76 and 0 97 to 1 01 for the first irrigation event 3 57 to 10 91 0 23 to 0 95 and 0 98 to 1 03 for the second irrigation event 1 57 to 30 99 0 44 to 0 90 and 0 98 to 1 04 for the third irrigation event which showed negligible differences according to table 4 we observed high simulation accuracy for inflow rate of 1 l s in the first event nrmse and d were 6 07 and 0 76 respectively according to the values of nrmse and d for inflow rate of 2 l s winsrfr had satisfactory performance in simulating recession trajectory although the simulation accuracy was less under the inflow rate of 1 l s overall the average values of nrmse d and λ were 6 1 0 71 and 0 98 in simulating recession times respectively showing a high accuracy of winsrfr these results are an agreement with abbasi et al 2003 chen et al 2012 anwar et al 2016 sayari et al 2017 and xu et al 2019 who reported that winsrfr accuracy is reasonable for simulation of advance and recession trajectory curves also nie et al 2019 reported that the accuracy of simulated values of the water advance and recession trajectories can be improved by considering variations of soil infiltration nie et al 2019 the results indicated that the performance of winsrfr was satisfactory for the prediction of the advance and recession trajectory curves 4 3 performance analysis fig 3 shows the results of ae du and dp for three irrigation events for an application depth of 100 mm the highest ae 74 and of 40 3 was determined at the first event given the suitable slope and no compact soil more volume of water was applied to root zone which would decrease dp 26 the minimum value of ae 48 5 and of 12 2 was obtained for the third irrigation event this could be because of longer cut off time and unsuitable topography because of traffic of agricultural machinery of the second and third event the ae and du values in second irrigation event 74 and 77 05 and first event 60 22 and 74 02 were higher than those obtained from third event 48 56 and 39 78 which the lower values of du in third event is due to high inflow volume and insufficient water stored in root zone the values of dp in first and second events were lower than third irrigation event this finding could be because of cut off time and inflow volume in different irrigation events the average values of cut off time and inflow volume in first event were 855 7 min and 70 6 m3 in the second event were 1109 5 min and 90 1 m3 which these values were lower than those obtained from third event 1292 5 min and 107 3 m3 this results indicated that the acceptable irrigation performance parameters were achieved in reasonable cut off time and inflow volume xu et al 2019 also reported that variation in inflow volumes affecting irrigation performance was mainly caused by variation in infiltration and manning roughness coefficient finally average values of ae du and dp were 60 9 76 4 and 39 1 respectively different studies reported similar results such as izadi et al 1991 dalton et al 2001 smith et al 2005 reddy et al 2015 and kifle et al 2017 salahou et al 2018 xu et al 2019 and nie et al 2019 the irrigation performance parameters under different inflow rates in field conditions were compared in table 5 these studies showed that ae was ranged from 50 to 70 as seen in table 5 field data the highest and lowest values of of were obtained for an inflow rate of 1 l s 35 9 and 2 l s 25 4 respectively low slope about 0 04 heavy soil texture clay loam and longer opportunity time led to the highest of for 1 l s compared to other inflow rates based on the simulation results the highest performance indicators ae du and dp occurred in 3 l s and cut off times of 324 7 383 5 and 429 5 min for the first second and third irrigation events respectively fig 3 fig 3 shows that under the first irrigation the average values of ae du and dp are 75 5 74 0 and 24 5 respectively in the second event the average values of ae du and dp were 60 2 76 6 and 39 8 respectively finally in the third event 48 6 74 6 and 51 4 were obtained for average values of ae du and dp respectively 4 4 simulating the performance parameters with winsrfr a comparison between measured and simulated performance indicators including ae du and dp are summarized for all irrigation events in fig 4 the values of nrmse mae and re indicators indicate there are very good fits fig 4 for simulating the performance indicators the values of nrmse mae and re for the ae were 8 19 6 00 and 6 26 for the first event 7 77 6 78 and 5 15 for the second event and 8 19 6 00 and 13 35 for the last event respectively also for du the values of nrmse mae and re between simulated and measured data are 12 12 10 49 and 16 02 in the first event 14 94 13 78 and 13 50 in the second event and 12 72 11 27 and 20 44 in third event respectively with respect to evaluation criteria winsrfr had good performance in estimating ae lower accuracy in estimating du is because of many reasons and the most important reason may be that the infiltrated volume and cut off time in all irrigation events were greater than required values which these reasons led to the applied water depths were more than required water depth zreq 100 mm and these results are agreements with nie et al 2019 to simulate dp the average values of nrmse and mae for the three irrigation events were 5 61 and 4 98 respectively the lower values of nrmse and mae indicate a perfect fit in the first irrigation event reasonable cut off time and suitable topography led to acceptable performance indicators 4 5 optimal inflow variables according to bautista et al 2009 report inflow rate qin and cut off time tco are the most effective parameters compared to furrow length and slope and can lead to improve irrigation performance it is simple for farmers to modify inflow discharge and cutoff time as compared to modifying soil characteristics and field geometry in the current section the operation analysis in winsrfr is used to simulate different inflow rates and cut off times to improve irrigation performance the optimization is conducted with the help of performance contours which depict the variation of selected performance measures as a function of inflow rate and cut off time bautista et al 2009 note that in this world the shape factors need to be calibrated to better match volume balance results to unsteady flow predictions the calibration uses unsteady simulation results from a single point in the solution region bautista et al 2012 which we employed field conditions such as inflow rate of 1 1 5 and 2 l s and field measured for cut off times also to identify an acceptable combination of qin and tco we simulated the range of 1 to 3 l s for the inflow rate however in this study different furrow lengths of 200 250 and 300 m and slope of 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 were evaluated to improve the performance indicators based on the results of this study compared to furrow length and slope optimal combinations of qin and tco will help to improve irrigation performance all results are summarized in table 6 as indicated in table 6 for larger changing in inflow rate the ae du and dp were less sensitive increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 l s increased ae by 7 8 11 9 14 6 and 16 5 du by 8 1 11 9 14 6 and 16 6 of by 7 8 11 9 14 6 and 16 5 and decreased dp by 7 9 12 1 14 9 and 16 8 respectively according to this results changing inflow rate from 1 0 l s to 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l s increased ae and du more than 20 and decreased dp up to 30 changing inflow to the range of 1 5 3 l s could improve of about 25 the optimal performance indicators were obtained when the inflow rate increased to 3 l s values of 74 92 75 09 and 24 92 for ae du and dp respectively it should be noted that increasing qin to 3 l s will lead to a higher irrigation performance if tco decreases to less than 500 min it would be suggested that by a good leveling and controlling of the traffic of agricultural machinery the irrigation performance will be improved with inflow rate of 3 l s salahou et al 2019 also reported that by increasing and decreasing the inflow rate the irrigation performance indicators increased and decreased respectively the results are similar to other studies such as morris et al 2015 anwar et al 2016 akbar et al 2016 and nie et al 2019 showing that reasonable combination of qin and cut off time increased ae to 75 90 and this results indicated that an optimal inflow variables can be used for design of furrow irrigation in sugarcane fields which can increase irrigation performance 4 6 changing geometric parameters for studying the effect of geometric parameters on furrow irrigation performance values of 1 l s 250 m and 0 04 were considered for qin length and slope respectively as field conditions in this study different furrow lengths such as 200 250 and 300 m were employed to improve the performance indicators according to table 7 changing slope from 0 04 to 0 03 decreased ae du and of by 0 55 0 58 and 0 49 respectively and increased dp by 0 33 when the slope was 0 05 the values of ae du and of increased to 0 45 0 53 0 49 respectively however dp decreased by 0 50 note that because of wide furrows and heavy soil texture in sugarcane fields the slope of 0 05 did not lead to erosion in length of furrows these results indicated that the three performance indicators increased as the slope increased which this is because of the decreasing of the volume stored in the furrow the results of the current study are agreements with salahou et al 2019 the results indicated that the slope had a low effect on the performance of furrow irrigation as seen in table 7 when field length decreased from 250 m to 200 m ae and du respectively increased by 4 33 and 4 33 and dp reduced by 4 42 these results led to improving of by 4 43 on the other hand when furrow length was 300 m ae and du decreased by 4 14 and 3 68 respectively and dp increased by 4 12 because of this change the value of the objective function was improved by about 3 95 xu et al 2019 also reported that ae values reduce by increasing field length also they showed the total amount of water that percolated deeply increased with increasing border length other researchers such as bai et al 2010 and chen et al 2012 reported similar results these studies suggested that geometric parameters i e field length width and slope affect the irrigation performance 4 7 optimal combinations of design parameters in this study parameters affecting the performance analysis were classified in two cases the first case is qin and cut off time and other case is furrow length and slope to evaluate the performance 1 l s 250 m and 0 04 respectively for inflow rate length and slope were considered as standard condition in this study the physical design world of the winsrfr software was used to optimize length and slope fig 3 shows that the maximum values of ae and du and minimum value of dp were obtained for inflow rate of 3 l s length of 200 m for and slope of 0 05 when design parameters were changed the ae and du was increased more than 25 and dp was decreased by 39 consequently of was improved more than 30 because of changing design parameters therefore reasonable combinations of design parameters led to 6 increase of of compared to the of value under only changing inflow variables 5 conclusion in this study to improve irrigation performance with limited freshwater resources for sugarcane fields optimum inflow rate cut off time and physical parameters were determined different irrigation performance indicators were evaluated under field and simulation studies the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 the evaluation of winsrfr in simulating the advance and recession times indicated that this software has good accuracy regarding the field measurements 2 based on the field study the average values of application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation were 75 5 74 0 and 24 5 in the first event 60 2 76 6 and 39 8 in the second event 48 6 74 6 and 51 4 in the third event respectively finally the high objective function in the first irrigation 52 6 the second irrigation 42 5 and the third irrigation 34 2 in the field s conditions could be achieved using inflow rate of 1 l s 3 the results showed the average relative error of winsrfr to estimate application efficiency distribution uniformity and deep percolation was 8 3 16 7 and 15 6 respectively as a consequence winsrfr simulated application efficiency with higher accuracy relative to distribution uniformity and deep percolation 4 optimizing inflow rate could increase application efficiency and distribution uniformity more than 20 decrease deep percolation up to 30 and finally improve of about 25 5 changing furrow slope from 0 04 to 0 03 and 0 05 led to decreasing and increasing objective function by 0 95 and 0 80 respectively also when furrow length was changed from 250 m to 200 and 300 m the value of the objective function increased by 9 39 and 7 7 respectively 6 using winsrfr the optimal inflow rate and cut off time are recommended as 3 l s and 379 5 min for sugarcane fields when the filed length and slope are 200 m and 0 05 respectively also the optimum application efficiency 77 6 distribution uniformity 77 9 deep percolation 22 4 and objective function 43 9 could be achieved using optimal inflow rate cut off time and field length and slope 7 it is recommended that winsrfr can be used for designing and managing surface irrigation systems to reduce irrigation water losses and increase distribution uniformity crop yield declaration of interests the authors declare that

10803,manure application in agricultural systems has demonstrated improvement on physical chemical and biological soil properties as well as on crop production however it may generate environmental problems such as transport of pollutants associated with surface runoff the aim of this work was to evaluate if the improvement on soil properties with the long term liquid dairy manure ldm application can reduce the water soil and nutrients losses by surface runoff under intense simulated rainfall the intense simulated rainfall 60 mm h 1 was applied once before winter sowing over maize harvested residue straw three months after the harvest and eight months after the last application of ldm 0 60 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 which was continually applied on the surface mulch with no incorporation no till system during twelve years twice a year in the summer and winter crops with three replicates the surface runoff was evaluated up to 90 min at different time intervals and sediments nitrogen phosphorus and carbon were analyzed in general the results indicated an increase on runoff and sediment losses and on nutrient concentrations and losses with ldm application 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 the expected positive effect on soil physical chemical and biological properties by long term ldm application was not enough to reduce the losses through runoff in heavy rainfall even with the presence of straw and the absence of surface sealing simulated rainfall was applied eight months after ldm application however the expected high concentration of nutrients on the soil surface increased the concentration of nutrients in runoff the high proportion of bioavailable phosphorus indicates a major contribution on losses of readily available phosphorus for aquatic life these results suggest the need for complementary conservation practices in no till to prevent the input of runoff in watercourses during events of intense precipitation even in the unmanured soil keywords surface runoff manure nutrients water quality 1 introduction dairy farming activities generate manure which can be used as a source of nutrients in agricultural production joshi and wang 2018 zavattaro et al 2017 however the over application of manure in agriculture can cause pollution of water bodies especially by phosphorus and nitrogen which are essential to crop growth but pollutants in water hooda et al 2000 high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in water are associated with eutrophication dodds and smith 2017 although phosphorus has been considered the limiting nutrient in freshwater because nitrogen can be fixed from the atmosphere sharpley et al 2013 nitrogen is also associated with human health and aquatic life problems fan et al 2017 yang et al 2015 phosphorus is often transported by surface runoff while nitrogen is highly soluble and readily leached by subsurface flow sharpley and wang 2014 several studies demonstrate that long term application of manure improves soil physical properties and consequently decreases runoff and soil erosion allen e mallarino 2008 gilley and risse 2000 mellek et al 2010 tomer et al 2016 wei et al 2017 on the other hand others show that rainfall following recent manure application increases runoff soil and nutrient losses bertol et al 2007b cherobim et al 2017 mori et al 2009 the negative effect of manure on decreasing infiltration and consequently increasing runoff is possibly related to the surface sealing azeez and van averbeke 2010 roberts and clanton 2001 cherobim et al 2018 studied the process of soil surface sealing formation with application of liquid dairy manure in a no till system and they recommended an interval of at least seven days between the manure application and the rainfall event to reduce the effect of the surface sealing the positive effect of long term manure application on reducing runoff and soil erosion is related to the soil physical attributes improvement such as soil structure and consequently infiltration rate gilley et al 2007 mazur and mazur 2015 kulhánek et al 2014 tomer et al 2016 these effects are associated directly by the input from the ldm of carbon organic matter and nutrients soluble and organic and indirectly by the increase of crop production körschens et al 2014 maltas et al 2013 the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the long term application of manure increases nutrient concentration in runoff due to the input of nutrients by ldm on the soil surface but on the other hand it could reduce runoff and sediment losses by the improvement on soil physical properties even in heavy rainfall thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of long term twelve years application of ldm on losses of runoff and sediment and on concentrations and losses of nutrients phosphorus nitrogen and carbon in no till system under high intensity simulated rainfall after eight months of the last ldm application and three months after maize crop harvesting therefore the experimental condition was high soil cover with maize harvested residue 0 4 to 0 5 kg m 2 straw and no soil surface sealing simulated rainfall eight months after the last ldm application we hope to contribute to the recommendation of soil best management practices by answering the following question can the positive effect on soil attributes by manure application at long term reduce the losses of runoff sediment and nutrients under high rainfall intensity 2 material and methods 2 1 field experimental area the study was performed in the abc

average annual rainfall of 1554 mm caviglione et al 2000 the long term field experiment with dlm was installed in november 2005 with the objective to monitor the runoff under natural rainfall as the soil physical chemical and biological properties and the crop production over time as part of a research project to recommend best management practices with liquid dairy manure application on the no till system the long term field experiment was carried out from 2005 to 2017 under no till and crop rotation with soybean glycine max or maize zea mays in the summer and oats avena spp or wheat

simulated rainfall study was carried out in june 2017 in the field experiment in all treatments and three replicates before winter sowing under maize straw three months after the maize harvesting and eight months after the last application of ldm at soil surface in the maize sowing for the simulated rainfall on each field plot of 29 8 m2 was delimited a subplot of 1 0 m2 1 0 m x 1 0 m with a zinc plate of 0 1 m height and introduced at 0 05 m deep soil kinnell 2016 with a collector channel of the surface runoff at its bottom installed with pvc pipes on each plot at a height of 2 4 m from the soil surface the portable rainfall simulator was installed the rainfall simulator used was the veejet 80 100 nozzle type meyer and mccune 1958 simulated rainfall was applied at 60 mm h 1 intensity which corresponds to a return period 20 year and duration 60 min rainfall intensity for the region of ponta grossa fendrich 2003 at the beginning of each rainfall simulation event three rainfall samples were collected at three different times to verify the real rainfall intensity then the rainfall simulated was adjusted to apply the intensity of 60 mm h 1 in all events 2 3 characterization of the simulated rainfall plots the soil attributes were obtained inside of each simulated rainfall subplot 1 m2 1 day after the rainfall application the data are presented in table 1 the slope was determined with graded ruler and level through the difference from the surface of the terrain in relation to the horizontal plane the dry matter of the residue cover crop dmrcc was measured by removing the crop residue in two subsamples of 0 04 m2 each the samples were oven dried at 60 c until constant weight the visual evaluation of the soil structure vess was performed in a soil monolith 0 2 m wide 0 15 m thick and 0 25 m deep the soil was broken manually along the fracture lines and separated in layers being assigned notes using visual key ball et al 2007 which varies from 1 to 5 and the higher the score the worse the structural quality of the soil for soil chemical analysis samples at 0 0 5 m were collected and analyzed by ca2 mg2 k and p extracted by the resin method al3 extracted by kcl total organic carbon determined by dry combustion and ph obtained by cacl2 raij et al 1997 2 4 runoff sampling and analysis the runoff volume was evaluated up to 90 min at time intervals of 1 2 3 4 5 7 9 11 13 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 min after runoff starts runoff volume was evaluated at each collection interval but the runoff was analyzed in the composite samples 10 20 30 60 and 90 min the runoff volume was measured with graduated buckets and in low volumes with a small graduated beaker a runoff subsample was taken in 500 ml for further analysis and immediately frozen to preserve their chemical composition apha 1995 the concentration of total solids obtained from a 50 ml aliquot dried at 105 c was multiplied by the runoff volume to determine the sediment loss the soluble fraction of nutrients was determined in a filtered sample 0 45 μm membrane nitrogen as nitrate no3 n was determined by spectrophotometry of ultraviolet with reduction by addition of metallic zinc heinzmann et al 1984 norman and stucki 1981 nitrogen as ammonium nh4 n was determined by the phenol method using spectrophotometry apha 1995 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp was obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes apha 1995 non filtered samples were used to determine the total fraction total n tn was determined using the kjeldahl digestion tkn apha 1995 and the detection was by phenol method using spectrophotometry apha 1995 the kjeldahl digestion method does not include nitrate so tn was obtained by the sum of n obtained by kjeldahl digestion and the soluble no3 n subtraction of nh4 n from tkn resulted in the particulate nitrogen pn total phosphorus tp was extracted by digestion with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a microwave usepa 2007 bioavailable phosphorus was extracted by iron oxide impregnated filter paper method myers and pierzynski 2000 sharpley 1993 phosphorus determination in all analyses was by icp oes to obtain particulate phosphorus pp drp was subtracted from tp the particulate bioavailable phosphorus pbp was obtained by the difference from bp and drp the particulate non bioavailable phosphorus pnbp was obtained by subtracting the pbp from the pp total organic carbon toc was determined by the unheated dichromate oxidation method walkley black adapted from the chemical oxygen demand boyd and tucker 1992 the weighted average concentration of nutrients was calculated considering the nutrient concentration and the runoff volume at each sampling the soil and nutrients losses were also obtained at each sampling and the accumulated losses by adding the entire simulated rainfall period 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance and tukey s test p 0 05 for average comparisons were performed using the sisvar 5 6 software ferreira 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 runoff and sediment loss runoff and sediment loss increased with rainfall time which is expected fig 1 but a significant difference among ldm rates was found only for runoff at a rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 the treatment without application of ldm resulted in the lowest amount of accumulated runoff 19 97 mm table 2 indicating the no positive effect and even worst the negative effect of ldm application on water infiltration with high intensity rainfall considering that the simulated rainfall was applied eight months after the ldm application the no negative effect of surface sealing on water infiltration was expected cherobim et al 2017 however it seems that the positive effect of the manure on soil physical properties at long term twelve years and the wide interval between ldm application and precipitation event was possibly lower than the negative effect in high rainfall intensity applied on soil cover residue with maize straw after three months of harvesting the positive effect of long term ldm on soil physical attributes is mainly related to the improvement of soil structure such as density porosity and aggregate stability and consequently the increase of the water infiltration and the decrease of runoff and sediment losses allen and mallarino 2008 gilley et al 2007 tomer et al 2016 mellek et al 2010 studying soil physical attributes and organic matter status in the same area of our study found improvements in soil structure and increments of soil organic matter status in the top 5 cm soil with the highest ldm rate 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 applied over a two year period however in our study with simulated high intensity rainfall the positive effect of long term ldm on soil physical properties mellek et al 2010 on decreasing runoff allen and mallarino 2008 gilley et al 2007 tomer et al 2016 was not observed at the rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 which had the highest runoff values indicating a no positive effect or even worst a negative effect of ldm under heavy rainfall the negative effect of ldm on soil surface sealing is quite known and several authors have found lower infiltration and consequently greater runoff with ldm application tabbara 2003 cherobim et al 2017 cherobim et al 2017 in a study with runoff sediment and nutrients losses under short term ldm application demonstrated that the sealing effect tends to decrease after seven days of ldm application therefore the longer interval between the application of the manure and the rain the manure tends to dry and it becomes strongly adhered to the soil cover crop residues avoiding the clogging of soil pores and consequently decreasing the negative effect of sealing on reducing water infiltration cherobim et al 2018 in an experiment on surface sealing and hydraulic conductivity also demonstrated that the application of ldm under straw prevents the direct contact of the waste with the porous spaces of the soil and consequently prevents the formation of the soil surface seal so in our study the soil cover with maize straw 0 4 to 0 5 kg m 2 and the wide interval between the application of manure and rainfall event eight months would justify the lower runoff with manure application also the positive effect of manure on soil quality and plant growth would justify the lower runoff with manure application however this was not observed at the rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 of ldm fig 1 and table 2 several factors can be related to this negative effect of the manure on runoff among them are the hydrophobicity of the organic compounds of the ldm itself or of the soil organic matter formed by the addition of manure water repellency or hydrophobicity in soils reduces their affinity for water in such a way that soils resist wetting for periods that may range from seconds to weeks maia et al 2005 buczko et al 2005 this phenomenon may lead to a reduction of the infiltration rate increasing the surface flow and contributing to non uniform infiltration patterns as observed in our study several hydrophobic organic material causes water repellency and types of vegetation are associated with the production of hydrophobic substances doerr et al 2005 there are evidences of hydrophobicity of some crop straws li et al 2012 liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 studied the evolution of the chemical structure of the maize straw and they verified that the maize straw presents hydrophobic properties thus besides the hydrophobicity of the applied ldm and of the maize straw the formation of connections between maize stalks can increase the surface runoff hong et al 2016 in our study the treatment with a greater dry matter of soil cover 0 5 kg m 2 at 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 of ldm also presented a greater surface runoff however all these possible negative effects of ldm with intense rainfall do not appear in the rate of 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 which identifies an incoherence our explanation is that the reduction in runoff and sediment losses in the rate of 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 can be associated with higher biochannel formation by the soil macrofauna and root growth leading to a high subsurface water flow and consequently low surface runoff abudi et al 2012 the presence of macrofauna earthworms termites soil insects produces galleries and nests in the subsoil forming preferential channels that increase water infiltration as observed by jouquet et al 2012 the sediment losses varied from 0 02 to 0 17 g m 2 min 1 fig 1 and had the same trend of runoff however it can be considered very low compared with mori et al 2009 these authors evaluated sediment losses on the same soil of our study however with simulated rainfall immediately after the application of manure they observed a sediment loss of 5 5 g m 2 min 1 in the first fifteen minutes of simulated rainfall with an intensity of 60 mm h 1 and 90 m3 ha 1 of ldm merten et al 2015 in a field study with natural rainfall and different soil management systems in paraná state found very low soil losses in the no till system compared to conventional tillage however even a small amount of sediment loss can cause an imbalance in the aquatic system the sediment elevates turbidity causing problems for aquatic organisms and if enriched with mineral and organic elements causes problems for aquatic life and human health sharpley and wang 2014 3 2 phosphorus concentration and loss the application of ldm increased the concentration of phosphorus in the different fractions in general after 90 min of simulated rainfall the highest concentrations occurred in the highest ldm rates 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 fig 2 however there was not statically difference in the weighted average concentrations and in the cumulative loss of phosphorus in all fractions table 3 except for the weighted average concentration of total phosphorus tp the increase on concentration of nutrients in runoff with manure application was observed by several authors cherobim et al 2017 mori et al 2009 bertol et al 2007b the decrease in phosphorus concentration during the rainfall event was also observed by other authors cherobim et al 2017 mori et al 2009 these authors found a greater concentration of phosphorus in the greater ldm rates in general surface sealing results in a high concentration and accumulated losses of phosphorus in runoff when rainfall occurs just after manure application hooda et al 2000 while in long term experiments where rainfall does not occur just after manure application it is common to have high concentration of phosphorus in runoff due to the high concentration in the soil surface however even with a greater concentration of phosphorus with manure application reduction of phosphorus losses is expected due to the lower runoff and sediment loss allen and mallarino 2006 tomer et al 2016 the particulate phosphorus pp constituted 18 of the total phosphorus on average but with a greater value in the 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 ldm rate table 4 the particulate non bioavailable phosphorus pnbp is a fraction of the particulate phosphorus that is not readily available to plants and organisms kleinman et al 2011 sharpley et al 2013 so it represents the particulate phosphorus that remains for a long time in the water bodies sharpley et al 1994 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp the readily available to aquatic plants and organisms was found in greater concentration compared to particulate phosphorus 82 of total phosphorus on average table 4 indicating a major potential of water pollution the lower proportion of particulate phosphorus compared to dissolved reactive phosphorus is related to the fact that ldm was applied in the no till system which presented lower sediment generation and consequently low associated particulate phosphorus bertol et al 2007b in a simulated rainfall study in no till after 24 h of manure application observed a high proportion of particulate phosphorus mori et al 2009 in the same soil of our study found values close to 15 mg l 1 of particulate phosphorus and 6 mg l 1 of dissolved reactive phosphorus with rainfall simulation immediately after application of 90 m3 ha 1 ldm in our study the highest ldm rate had values below 0 3 mg l 1 of particulate phosphorus and 0 8 mg l 1 of dissolved reactive phosphorus this lower concentration observed in our study compared with mori et al 2009 is expected since our study is with simulated rainfall after eight months of the ldm application and mori et al 2009 worked with simulated rainfall immediately after ldm applications bioavailable phosphorus bp is constituted by drp and particulate bioavailable phosphorus pbp and represents the potential for short term eutrophication because it is readily available to aquatic plants and organisms sharpley 1993 zhu et al 2013 shown that an accumulation of bioavailable particulate phosphorus may occur in the finer sediment particles and therefore if the concentration of fine sediments increases it can be an important source of pbp in general bioavailable phosphorus constituted 91 of total phosphorus being 82 from drp and 9 from pbp table 4 ramos et al 2014 also found 91 of total phosphorus as bioavailable phosphorus in horticultural organic systems sharpley et al 1992 found a greater proportion of bioavailable phosphorus in the no till system compared to the conventional system the results of the present study confirm that the no till system with organic fertilizer application ldm increases the fraction of the bioavailable phosphorus and it represents a risk of water pollution in general the results show that long term twelve years continuous application of ldm in no till shows increases phosphorus concentration and losses in runoff under high intensity rainfall indicating special care with 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 rates to avoid water bodies contamination 3 3 nitrogen concentration and loss in general there was a trend of greater tn and pn concentrations at greater rates 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 however for no3 n and nh4 n there was a trend of greater concentrations in the treatment without application of ldm fig 3 the weighted average concentration did not vary among the treatments table 5 for all nitrogen fractions as far as accumulated loss is concerned there is a difference for total and particulate nitrogen at a rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 nitrogen is a moving element in the soil profile and its loss is related to the subsurface flow mainly as nitrate no3 n sharpley et al 1994 however nitrogen can also be transported by surface runoff in both soluble and particulate fraction lal and stewart 1994 of the total nitrogen tn much of it was particulate nitrogen pn which can be considered the organic nitrogen since there is basically no mineral nitrogen in the soil particles except nitrogen in the form of ammonium nh4 n that is in the cation exchange sites schmidt 1982 in our study at the highest rates 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 the pn were 54 and 41 respectively table 4 nitrate together with particulate nitrogen were the main fractions transported by surface runoff the nitrate was 42 and the particulate nitrogen was 41 of the total nitrogen on average of all treatments nitrate at high concentrations has a detrimental effect on the ecological conditions of rivers and lakes such as eutrophication and also can cause damage to human health hill 1991 although ammonium had the smallest proportion and in the ionic form is non toxic to organisms attention should be paid to this ion because under conditions of high ph it predominates in the non ionized form nh3 that has toxic effects on aquatic organisms xing et al 2016 nitrate is usually the main fraction of mineral nitrogen in soils nitrifying bacteria convert ammonium rapidly into nitrate marconi et al 2017 basso et al 2005 which justifies the major concentration of no3 n when compared to nh4 n the predominance of negative charges in most tropical and subtropical soils becomes its adsorption insignificant which increases the potential for subsurface and surface runoff transport in our study the effect of intense nitrification is evident resulting in lower values of nh4 n compared to no3 n smith et al 2001 in a study with nitrogen loss by runoff after application of organic fertilizers pointed out that the total losses of nh4 n and no3 n during four year were not agronomically significant however concentrations of soluble nitrogen nitrate and ammonium in the runoff represented concern in river basins silveira et al 2011 studying ldm application two and half years period and natural rainfall in the same area of our study observed high concentrations but lower losses of no3 n and nh4 n in the surface runoff with increasing rates of ldm these authors also found weighted average concentrations of no3 n below the limit allowed by brazilian legislation in water bodies but those of nh4 n was above the allowed value indicating the need for control and retention of the surface runoff to avoid possible pollution in the water bodies even in areas unmanured and under no till 3 4 carbon concentration and loss the weighted average concentration of total organic carbon was about 55 greater for the highest rates of ldm 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 while the accumulated loss of toc was around 43 greater compared to unmanured treatment these values indicate increasing concentrations and losses of total organic carbon with ldm application fig 4 and table 5 the high soil carbon at the surface with the use of manure can favor the transport of this element from agricultural areas to waterways implying negative effects carbon is a source of energy for the development of aquatic organisms decreasing the dissolved oxygen bertol et al 2007a hooda et al 2000 wei et al 2017 and zhang et al 2009 investigated the long term effects of manure and they found that repeated application of animal manure increased the soil organic carbon the purpose of a good management system is to maintain or increase carbon stocks in the soil dieckow et al 2005 and not to lose it by runoff silveira et al 2011 in the same area of our study but with natural rainfall and carried out for two and half years observed high concentration but lower losses of toc in the surface runoff with ldm application these authors found values of toc greater than 300 mg l 1 at a rate of 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 ldm in our study it was found 20 mg l 1 as the weighted average concentrations of toc at 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 however different from our results silveira et al 2011 found lower accumulated losses of toc with the application of ldm and this was attributed to the lower runoff and sediment loss with manure application the accumulated losses of toc obtained by silveira et al 2011 even with greater concentration of toc and a longer period of study two year and half were lower than our results with 90 min of rainfall indicating the risk of high intensity rainfall on runoff and sediment losses and consequently on associated pollutants transport 4 conclusion in general the results indicate an increase in runoff sediment and nutrient losses up to 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 with high intensity rainfall 60 mm h 1 in the no till system under long term ldm application phosphorus nitrogen and carbon concentrations in runoff indicate a greater water pollution potential with 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 the bioavailable phosphorus and the soluble phosphorus in runoff were the main fractions 91 and 82 respectively of the total phosphorus even in the unmanured soil evidencing a contribution of the no till system on phosphorus readily available to aquatic plants and organisms most of the total nitrogen in the runoff on average of all treatments were in the particulate organic nitrogen 41 and in the nitrogen as nitrate 42 indicating the low contribution to nitrogen as ammonium even with high rates of ldm the expected improvement on soil physical chemical and biological properties with ldm application at the long term was not enough to reduce the losses through runoff from heavy rainfall even with the presence of straw and absence of surface sealing indicating a no positive effect or even worst a negative effect of ldm under high intensity rainfall overall the results suggest the need for complementary conservation practices such as terraces in the no till system to avoid the runoff into watercourses and thus avoid

10803,manure application in agricultural systems has demonstrated improvement on physical chemical and biological soil properties as well as on crop production however it may generate environmental problems such as transport of pollutants associated with surface runoff the aim of this work was to evaluate if the improvement on soil properties with the long term liquid dairy manure ldm application can reduce the water soil and nutrients losses by surface runoff under intense simulated rainfall the intense simulated rainfall 60 mm h 1 was applied once before winter sowing over maize harvested residue straw three months after the harvest and eight months after the last application of ldm 0 60 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 which was continually applied on the surface mulch with no incorporation no till system during twelve years twice a year in the summer and winter crops with three replicates the surface runoff was evaluated up to 90 min at different time intervals and sediments nitrogen phosphorus and carbon were analyzed in general the results indicated an increase on runoff and sediment losses and on nutrient concentrations and losses with ldm application 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 the expected positive effect on soil physical chemical and biological properties by long term ldm application was not enough to reduce the losses through runoff in heavy rainfall even with the presence of straw and the absence of surface sealing simulated rainfall was applied eight months after ldm application however the expected high concentration of nutrients on the soil surface increased the concentration of nutrients in runoff the high proportion of bioavailable phosphorus indicates a major contribution on losses of readily available phosphorus for aquatic life these results suggest the need for complementary conservation practices in no till to prevent the input of runoff in watercourses during events of intense precipitation even in the unmanured soil keywords

plate of 0 1 m height and introduced at 0 05 m deep soil kinnell 2016 with a collector channel of the surface runoff at its bottom installed with pvc pipes on each plot at a height of 2 4 m from the soil surface the portable rainfall simulator was installed the rainfall simulator used was the veejet 80 100 nozzle type meyer and mccune 1958 simulated rainfall was applied at 60 mm h 1 intensity which corresponds to a return period 20 year and duration 60 min rainfall intensity for the region of ponta grossa fendrich 2003 at the beginning of each rainfall simulation event three rainfall samples were collected at three different times to verify the real rainfall intensity then the rainfall simulated was adjusted to apply the intensity of 60 mm h 1 in all events 2 3 characterization of the simulated rainfall plots the soil attributes were obtained inside of each simulated rainfall subplot 1 m2 1 day after the rainfall application the data are presented in table 1 the slope was determined with graded ruler and level through the difference from the surface of the terrain in relation to the horizontal plane the dry matter of the residue cover crop dmrcc was measured by removing the crop residue in two subsamples of 0 04 m2 each the samples were oven dried at 60 c until constant weight the visual evaluation of the soil structure vess was performed in a soil monolith 0 2 m wide 0 15 m thick and 0 25 m deep the soil was broken manually along the fracture lines and separated in layers being assigned notes using visual key ball et al 2007 which varies from 1 to 5 and the higher the score the worse the structural quality of the soil for soil chemical analysis samples at 0 0 5 m were collected and analyzed by ca2 mg2 k and p extracted by the resin method al3 extracted by kcl total organic carbon determined by dry combustion and ph obtained by cacl2 raij et al 1997 2 4 runoff sampling and analysis the runoff volume was evaluated up to 90 min at time intervals of 1 2 3 4 5 7 9 11 13 15 20 25 30 35 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 min after runoff starts runoff volume was evaluated at each collection interval but the runoff was analyzed in the composite samples 10 20 30 60 and 90 min the runoff volume was measured with graduated buckets and in low volumes with a small graduated beaker a runoff subsample was taken in 500 ml for further analysis and immediately frozen to preserve their chemical composition apha 1995 the concentration of total solids obtained from a 50 ml aliquot dried at 105 c was multiplied by the runoff volume to determine the sediment loss the soluble fraction of nutrients was determined in a filtered sample 0 45 μm membrane nitrogen as nitrate no3 n was determined by spectrophotometry of ultraviolet with reduction by addition of metallic zinc heinzmann et al 1984 norman and stucki 1981 nitrogen as ammonium nh4 n was determined by the phenol method using spectrophotometry apha 1995 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp was obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes apha 1995 non filtered samples were used to determine the total fraction total n tn was determined using the kjeldahl digestion tkn apha 1995 and the detection was by phenol method using spectrophotometry apha 1995 the kjeldahl digestion method does not include nitrate so tn was obtained by the sum of n obtained by kjeldahl digestion and the soluble no3 n subtraction of nh4 n from tkn resulted in the particulate nitrogen pn total phosphorus tp was extracted by digestion with nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a microwave usepa 2007 bioavailable phosphorus was extracted by iron oxide impregnated filter paper method myers and pierzynski 2000 sharpley 1993 phosphorus determination in all analyses was by icp oes to obtain particulate phosphorus pp drp was subtracted from tp the particulate bioavailable phosphorus pbp was obtained by the difference from bp and drp the particulate non bioavailable phosphorus pnbp was obtained by subtracting the pbp from the pp total organic carbon toc was determined by the unheated dichromate oxidation method walkley black adapted from the chemical oxygen demand boyd and tucker 1992 the weighted average concentration of nutrients was calculated considering the nutrient concentration and the runoff volume at each sampling the soil and nutrients losses were also obtained at each sampling and the accumulated losses by adding the entire simulated rainfall period 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance and tukey s test p 0 05 for average comparisons were performed using the sisvar 5 6 software ferreira 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 runoff and sediment loss runoff and sediment loss increased with rainfall time which is expected fig 1 but a significant difference among ldm rates was found only for runoff at a rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 the treatment without application of ldm resulted in the lowest amount of accumulated runoff 19 97 mm table 2 indicating the no positive effect and even worst the negative effect of ldm application on water infiltration with high intensity rainfall considering that the simulated rainfall was applied eight months after the ldm application the no negative effect of surface sealing on water infiltration was expected cherobim et al 2017 however it seems that the positive effect of the manure on soil physical properties at long term twelve years and the wide interval between ldm application and precipitation event was possibly lower than the negative effect in high rainfall intensity applied on soil cover residue with maize straw after three months of harvesting the positive effect of long term ldm on soil physical attributes is mainly related to the improvement of soil structure such as density porosity and aggregate stability and consequently the increase of the water infiltration and the decrease of runoff and sediment losses allen and mallarino 2008 gilley et al 2007 tomer et al 2016 mellek et al 2010 studying soil physical attributes and organic matter status in the same area of our study found improvements in soil structure and increments of soil organic matter status in the top 5 cm soil with the highest ldm rate 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 applied over a two year period however in our study with simulated high intensity rainfall the positive effect of long term ldm on soil physical properties mellek et al 2010 on decreasing runoff allen and mallarino 2008 gilley et al 2007 tomer et al 2016 was not observed at the rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 which had the highest runoff values indicating a no positive effect or even worst a negative effect of ldm under heavy rainfall the negative effect of ldm on soil surface sealing is quite known and several authors have found lower infiltration and consequently greater runoff with ldm application tabbara 2003 cherobim et al 2017 cherobim et al 2017 in a study with runoff sediment and nutrients losses under short term ldm application demonstrated that the sealing effect tends to decrease after seven days of ldm application therefore the longer interval between the application of the manure and the rain the manure tends to dry and it becomes strongly adhered to the soil cover crop residues avoiding the clogging of soil pores and consequently decreasing the negative effect of sealing on reducing water infiltration cherobim et al 2018 in an experiment on surface sealing and hydraulic conductivity also demonstrated that the application of ldm under straw prevents the direct contact of the waste with the porous spaces of the soil and consequently prevents the formation of the soil surface seal so in our study the soil cover with maize straw 0 4 to 0 5 kg m 2 and the wide interval between the application of manure and rainfall event eight months would justify the lower runoff with manure application also the positive effect of manure on soil quality and plant growth would justify the lower runoff with manure application however this was not observed at the rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 of ldm fig 1 and table 2 several factors can be related to this negative effect of the manure on runoff among them are the hydrophobicity of the organic compounds of the ldm itself or of the soil organic matter formed by the addition of manure water repellency or hydrophobicity in soils reduces their affinity for water in such a way that soils resist wetting for periods that may range from seconds to weeks maia et al 2005 buczko et al 2005 this phenomenon may lead to a reduction of the infiltration rate increasing the surface flow and contributing to non uniform infiltration patterns as observed in our study several hydrophobic organic material causes water repellency and types of vegetation are associated with the production of hydrophobic substances doerr et al 2005 there are evidences of hydrophobicity of some crop straws li et al 2012 liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 studied the evolution of the chemical structure of the maize straw and they verified that the maize straw presents hydrophobic properties thus besides the hydrophobicity of the applied ldm and of the maize straw the formation of connections between maize stalks can increase the surface runoff hong et al 2016 in our study the treatment with a greater dry matter of soil cover 0 5 kg m 2 at 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 of ldm also presented a greater surface runoff however all these possible negative effects of ldm with intense rainfall do not appear in the rate of 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 which identifies an incoherence our explanation is that the reduction in runoff and sediment losses in the rate of 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 can be associated with higher biochannel formation by the soil macrofauna and root growth leading to a high subsurface water flow and consequently low surface runoff abudi et al 2012 the presence of macrofauna earthworms termites soil insects produces galleries and nests in the subsoil forming preferential channels that increase water infiltration as observed by jouquet et al 2012 the sediment losses varied from 0 02 to 0 17 g m 2 min 1 fig 1 and had the same trend of runoff however it can be considered very low compared with mori et al 2009 these authors evaluated sediment losses on the same soil of our study however with simulated rainfall immediately after the application of manure they observed a sediment loss of 5 5 g m 2 min 1 in the first fifteen minutes of simulated rainfall with an intensity of 60 mm h 1 and 90 m3 ha 1 of ldm merten et al 2015 in a field study with natural rainfall and different soil management systems in paraná state found very low soil losses in the no till system compared to conventional tillage however even a small amount of sediment loss can cause an imbalance in the aquatic system the sediment elevates turbidity causing problems for aquatic organisms and if enriched with mineral and organic elements causes problems for aquatic life and human health sharpley and wang 2014 3 2 phosphorus concentration and loss the application of ldm increased the concentration of phosphorus in the different fractions in general after 90 min of simulated rainfall the highest concentrations occurred in the highest ldm rates 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 fig 2 however there was not statically difference in the weighted average concentrations and in the cumulative loss of phosphorus in all fractions table 3 except for the weighted average concentration of total phosphorus tp the increase on concentration of nutrients in runoff with manure application was observed by several authors cherobim et al 2017 mori et al 2009 bertol et al 2007b the decrease in phosphorus concentration during the rainfall event was also observed by other authors cherobim et al 2017 mori et al 2009 these authors found a greater concentration of phosphorus in the greater ldm rates in general surface sealing results in a high concentration and accumulated losses of phosphorus in runoff when rainfall occurs just after manure application hooda et al 2000 while in long term experiments where rainfall does not occur just after manure application it is common to have high concentration of phosphorus in runoff due to the high concentration in the soil surface however even with a greater concentration of phosphorus with manure application reduction of phosphorus losses is expected due to the lower runoff and sediment loss allen and mallarino 2006 tomer et al 2016 the particulate phosphorus pp constituted 18 of the total phosphorus on average but with a greater value in the 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 ldm rate table 4 the particulate non bioavailable phosphorus pnbp is a fraction of the particulate phosphorus that is not readily available to plants and organisms kleinman et al 2011 sharpley et al 2013 so it represents the particulate phosphorus that remains for a long time in the water bodies sharpley et al 1994 dissolved reactive phosphorus drp the readily available to aquatic plants and organisms was found in greater concentration compared to particulate phosphorus 82 of total phosphorus on average table 4 indicating a major potential of water pollution the lower proportion of particulate phosphorus compared to dissolved reactive phosphorus is related to the fact that ldm was applied in the no till system which presented lower sediment generation and consequently low associated particulate phosphorus bertol et al 2007b in a simulated rainfall study in no till after 24 h of manure application observed a high proportion of particulate phosphorus mori et al 2009 in the same soil of our study found values close to 15 mg l 1 of particulate phosphorus and 6 mg l 1 of dissolved reactive phosphorus with rainfall simulation immediately after application of 90 m3 ha 1 ldm in our study the highest ldm rate had values below 0 3 mg l 1 of particulate phosphorus and 0 8 mg l 1 of dissolved reactive phosphorus this lower concentration observed in our study compared with mori et al 2009 is expected since our study is with simulated rainfall after eight months of the ldm application and mori et al 2009 worked with simulated rainfall immediately after ldm applications bioavailable phosphorus bp is constituted by drp and particulate bioavailable phosphorus pbp and represents the potential for short term eutrophication because it is readily available to aquatic plants and organisms sharpley 1993 zhu et al 2013 shown that an accumulation of bioavailable particulate phosphorus may occur in the finer sediment particles and therefore if the concentration of fine sediments increases it can be an important source of pbp in general bioavailable phosphorus constituted 91 of total phosphorus being 82 from drp and 9 from pbp table 4 ramos et al 2014 also found 91 of total phosphorus as bioavailable phosphorus in horticultural organic systems sharpley et al 1992 found a greater proportion of bioavailable phosphorus in the no till system compared to the conventional system the results of the present study confirm that the no till system with organic fertilizer application ldm increases the fraction of the bioavailable phosphorus and it represents a risk of water pollution in general the results show that long term twelve years continuous application of ldm in no till shows increases phosphorus concentration and losses in runoff under high intensity rainfall indicating special care with 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 rates to avoid water bodies contamination 3 3 nitrogen concentration and loss in general there was a trend of greater tn and pn concentrations at greater rates 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 however for no3 n and nh4 n there was a trend of greater concentrations in the treatment without application of ldm fig 3 the weighted average concentration did not vary among the treatments table 5 for all nitrogen fractions as far as accumulated loss is concerned there is a difference for total and particulate nitrogen at a rate of 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 nitrogen is a moving element in the soil profile and its loss is related to the subsurface flow mainly as nitrate no3 n sharpley et al 1994 however nitrogen can also be transported by surface runoff in both soluble and particulate fraction lal and stewart 1994 of the total nitrogen tn much of it was particulate nitrogen pn which can be considered the organic nitrogen since there is basically no mineral nitrogen in the soil particles except nitrogen in the form of ammonium nh4 n that is in the cation exchange sites schmidt 1982 in our study at the highest rates 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 the pn were 54 and 41 respectively table 4 nitrate together with particulate nitrogen were the main fractions transported by surface runoff the nitrate was 42 and the particulate nitrogen was 41 of the total nitrogen on average of all treatments nitrate at high concentrations has a detrimental effect on the ecological conditions of rivers and lakes such as eutrophication and also can cause damage to human health hill 1991 although ammonium had the smallest proportion and in the ionic form is non toxic to organisms attention should be paid to this ion because under conditions of high ph it predominates in the non ionized form nh3 that has toxic effects on aquatic organisms xing et al 2016 nitrate is usually the main fraction of mineral nitrogen in soils nitrifying bacteria convert ammonium rapidly into nitrate marconi et al 2017 basso et al 2005 which justifies the major concentration of no3 n when compared to nh4 n the predominance of negative charges in most tropical and subtropical soils becomes its adsorption insignificant which increases the potential for subsurface and surface runoff transport in our study the effect of intense nitrification is evident resulting in lower values of nh4 n compared to no3 n smith et al 2001 in a study with nitrogen loss by runoff after application of organic fertilizers pointed out that the total losses of nh4 n and no3 n during four year were not agronomically significant however concentrations of soluble nitrogen nitrate and ammonium in the runoff represented concern in river basins silveira et al 2011 studying ldm application two and half years period and natural rainfall in the same area of our study observed high concentrations but lower losses of no3 n and nh4 n in the surface runoff with increasing rates of ldm these authors also found weighted average concentrations of no3 n below the limit allowed by brazilian legislation in water bodies but those of nh4 n was above the allowed value indicating the need for control and retention of the surface runoff to avoid possible pollution in the water bodies even in areas unmanured and under no till 3 4 carbon concentration and loss the weighted average concentration of total organic carbon was about 55 greater for the highest rates of ldm 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 while the accumulated loss of toc was around 43 greater compared to unmanured treatment these values indicate increasing concentrations and losses of total organic carbon with ldm application fig 4 and table 5 the high soil carbon at the surface with the use of manure can favor the transport of this element from agricultural areas to waterways implying negative effects carbon is a source of energy for the development of aquatic organisms decreasing the dissolved oxygen bertol et al 2007a hooda et al 2000 wei et al 2017 and zhang et al 2009 investigated the long term effects of manure and they found that repeated application of animal manure increased the soil organic carbon the purpose of a good management system is to maintain or increase carbon stocks in the soil dieckow et al 2005 and not to lose it by runoff silveira et al 2011 in the same area of our study but with natural rainfall and carried out for two and half years observed high concentration but lower losses of toc in the surface runoff with ldm application these authors found values of toc greater than 300 mg l 1 at a rate of 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 ldm in our study it was found 20 mg l 1 as the weighted average concentrations of toc at 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 however different from our results silveira et al 2011 found lower accumulated losses of toc with the application of ldm and this was attributed to the lower runoff and sediment loss with manure application the accumulated losses of toc obtained by silveira et al 2011 even with greater concentration of toc and a longer period of study two year and half were lower than our results with 90 min of rainfall indicating the risk of high intensity rainfall on runoff and sediment losses and consequently on associated pollutants transport 4 conclusion in general the results indicate an increase in runoff sediment and nutrient losses up to 120 m3 ha 1 year 1 with high intensity rainfall 60 mm h 1 in the no till system under long term ldm application phosphorus nitrogen and carbon concentrations in runoff indicate a greater water pollution potential with 120 and 180 m3 ha 1 year 1 the bioavailable phosphorus and the soluble phosphorus in runoff were the main fractions 91 and 82 respectively of the total phosphorus even in the unmanured soil evidencing a contribution of the no till system on phosphorus readily available to aquatic plants and organisms most of the total nitrogen in the runoff on average of all treatments were in the particulate organic nitrogen 41 and in the nitrogen as nitrate 42 indicating the low contribution to nitrogen as ammonium even with high rates of ldm the expected improvement on soil physical chemical and biological properties with ldm application at the long term was not enough to reduce the losses through runoff from heavy rainfall even with the presence of straw and absence of surface sealing indicating a no positive effect or even worst a negative effect of ldm under high intensity rainfall overall the results suggest the need for complementary conservation practices such as terraces in the no till system to avoid the runoff into watercourses and thus avoid

10804,the wetting pattern and its components are important factors in the optimum design and operation of a drip irrigation system in this investigation the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which occurred under the surface drip irrigation was described analytically in the laboratory experiment the spatio temporal variation of the wetting pattern was observed during the water application period and the sizes of its components were measured at five minute intervals the components of the pattern were the wetted radius on the soil surface at any time during irrigation and the maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile in addition camera records were taken during the experiment some physical and chemical features of the soil sample which were important for irrigation were analyzed also the infiltration test was performed by double ring infiltrometer in the field where the soil samples were taken the moisture content of the soil was determined at the beginning of the irrigation application in the next stage the wetting pattern was located on the coordinate system and the main movement equations describing the spatio temporal variation of the pattern were obtained the volumetric wetting pattern was determined by processing these functions in the 3d system drip irrigation may be applied on various soil textures with different emitter discharges and application times although wetting patterns in various conditions show different properties of shape from each other the models devised contain the entire main common components of the wetting pattern as a result when the models were run with the data from the experiment the 3d wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system was determined and analyzed comparatively from the points of view of main movement features of water in the soil profile and on the soil surface keywords drip irrigation system volumetric wetting pattern 3d mathematical modelling analytical solution movement of water in soil spatio temporal variation of the wetting pattern in soil 1 introduction drip irrigation system is one of the most important solutions for the efficient use of limited water resources with a good design and correct operation of the system an important level of improvement is attained in irrigation efficiency together with higher crop yields moreover drip irrigation has other advantages like the ability to add fertilizers efficiently through the system and minimizing evaporation deep percolation and runoff in surface drip irrigation the water creates a wetting pattern similar to a truncated sphere or ellipsoid in the soil profile these shapes occur depending on the amount of water applied to the soil the emitter discharge and the hydraulic properties of the soil al ogaidi et al 2016 the wetted soil volume is one of the most important factors in designing drip irrigation systems the wetted depth in the soil profile and the radius on the soil surface are the main components of the volumetric wetting pattern dasberg and or 1999 al ogaidi et al 2016 the maximum width of the wetting pattern in drip irrigation occurs under the soil surface in order to determine the cross sectional area and volumetric size of the wetting pattern more accurately the components of maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and wetted radius on the soil surface occurring at any time during the irrigation must be taken into consideration kilic 2018a b kilic 2018c the wetted depth should be suitable for the root zone depth of the crop also the spacing between emitters and laterals must be designed in accordance with the wetted width of the pattern zur 1996 the shape and dimensions of the components of the wetting pattern must be determined correctly for accordance between the cross section of the wetting pattern and the wetted soil volume fernandez galvez and simmonds 2006 kilic 2018a b the wetting pattern is the main component in optimizing emitter spacing lateral placement and in selecting a suitable drip irrigation system dabral et al 2012 in order to determine the wetting pattern in drip irrigation systems numerous models have been devised they are divided into several types analytical models philip 1984 chu 1994 thorburn et al 2003 cook et al 2003 numerical models simunek et al 1999 lazarovitch et al 2007 and empirical models zur 1996 amin and ekhmaj 2006 elmaloglou and malamos 2006 thabet and zayani 2007 kandelous et al 2008 dabral et al 2012 the numerical and analytical models solve the flow equation for different conditions analytical models provide a quick tool to determine the wetting front location al ogaidi et al 2016 these models are based on the assumption of a point source and special forms for the physical properties of the soil philip 1984 revol et al 1997a 1997b numerical models need considerable computing power and some background to use them the hydrus program was developed to simulate water heat and solute transport in two and three dimensional media it numerically solves richards equation for saturated unsaturated water flow and convection dispersion type equations for heat and solute transport the model includes a parameter optimization algorithm for inverse estimation of a variety of soil hydraulic and or solute transport parameters simunek et al 1999 wang et al 2013 sejna et al 2014 empirical models use regression and dimensional analysis for data from laboratory and field experiments these models predict the depth and width of the wetting patterns as a function of soil hydraulic properties and emitter discharge schwartzman and zur 1986 amin and ekhmaj 2006 malek and peters 2011 naglic et al 2014 al ogaidi et al 2015 elmaloglou and malamos 2007 carried out an investigation of the estimation of the width and depth of the wetted soil volume under a surface emitter considering root water uptake and evaporation a cylindrical flow model that describes local infiltration from a surface point source was used to obtain numerical results an unsteady nonlinearized numerical model was developed by bhatnagar and chauhan 2008 in an oblate spheroidal coordinate system to predict the wetting pattern below an emitter placed on the soil surface relative rates of change of the components of the wetting pattern at different time points were not taken into consideration elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 investigated the infiltration and redistribution of soil moisture under surface drip irrigation considering hysteresis in two soils of different texture loamy sand and silt loam a cylindrical flow model incorporating hysteresis in the soil water retention characteristic curve evaporation from the soil surface and water extraction by roots was used an artificial neural network ann technology was presented by lazarovitch et al 2009 as an alternative to physically based modeling of subsurface water distribution from trickle emitters three options were explored to prepare input output functional relations from a database created using a numerical model hydrus 2d kandelous and simunek 2010 evaluated the accuracy of several approaches used to estimate wetting zone dimensions by comparing their predictions with field and laboratory data including the hydrus 2d numerical model the wet up analytical software and selected empirical models elmaloglou et al 2010 investigated the validity of the assumption that an irrigation event from point sources could be approximated as an infinite line source in this process two existing mathematical models which simulate point and line drip irrigation were used fu qiang et al 2011 developed a numerical model of two dimensional soil water movement under surface drip irrigation conditions the physical process of soil water movement was described by the 2d richards equation and the upper boundary condition was depicted by the improved moving ponded area boundary kooij et al 2013 carried out a systematic review of the literature on the efficiency of a drip irrigation system they showed that the term efficiency means different things to different people and can refer to different elements in the water balance elmaloglou et al 2013 investigated the soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation from equidistant line sources using a simulation model which combines hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve evaporation from the soil surface and water extraction by roots badr and abuarab 2013 carried out an investigation of soil moisture distribution patterns under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems in sandy soil using the neutron scattering technique water distribution uniformity was assessed by applying the surfer model communar and friedman 2013 provided analytical solutions to the unsteady three dimensional infiltration from surface or subsurface point sources these solutions were obtained from a linearized form of richard s equation kuklik and hoang 2014 carried out an investigation of the determination of the principal relationships influencing the distribution of moisture content in a soil profile under an emitter in point irrigation moncef and khemaies 2016 developed an analytical approach for predicting the wetted soil volume underneath an emitter laid on the ground surface the approach was based on 1 the green and ampt assumption 2 the inference of the wetted soil depth from the radius of the humid area at the ground surface and 3 the hypothesis that the bulb keeps a semi elliptical shape whose diagonals are merged with the soil surface and the symmetry axis kilic 2018a carried out an investigation in order to describe the wetting pattern analytically using a new method simultaneous double parabola design in this process some physical and chemical properties of the soil sample which were important for irrigation were determined the wetting pattern and its components were observed in real time conditions and they were measured at five minute intervals during the irrigation application the wetted radius on the soil surface the maximum wetted depth and the maximum wetted width in the soil profile are the main components of the wetting pattern and the model also real time camera records were taken during the experiment the wetting pattern was described analytically in accordance with its spatio temporal location in the soil and the components of the wetting pattern were described as a function of time in the second part of the investigation the models were run with the data from the experiment for different time points during the irrigation application kilic 2018b the models estimate the cross sectional area of the wetting pattern and its variation in the spatio temporal dimension it was determined that the wetting pattern in the drip irrigation could be described accurately by the simultaneous double parabola approach al ogaidi et al 2016 conducted laboratory experiments with surface drip irrigation and developed an empirical model to estimate the whole wetting pattern at different application times the empirical model included estimation of the wetted radius at the soil surface and the depth of the wetting pattern as a function of application time and other affecting factors however the volumetric wetting pattern in a three dimensional system was not determined in the investigation the simulation of wetting patterns under drip irrigation systems have been widely studied using empirical models but these models enable an estimation of only the wetted radius at the soil surface and the wetted depth in the soil al ogaidi et al 2016 therefore the aim of this investigation was to develop an analytical model to describe the 3d volumetric wetting pattern by the spatio temporal relationships between the components of the wetting pattern in the drip irrigation 2 materials and methods analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in a 3d system in drip irrigation was performed in four main stages the first stage was to design the experiment so as to enable reliable measurement of the components of the wetting pattern at consecutive time points at five minute intervals this investigation was carried out under uniform soil texture conditions the second stage consisted of the spatio temporal analysis of the data and real time camera recordings of the experiment the third main stage was to describe the volumetric wetting pattern analytically in the 3d system this process was carried out in two sub stages the first one was to describe the 3d model infrastructure in accordance with the main movement equations of water occurring in the wetting pattern as explained by kilic 2018a b and kilic 2018c the second sub stage consisted of the analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in the 3d system the last stage of the investigation was to run the models with the data from the experiment and to analyze and evaluate the results in the first stage of the investigation the establishment of the experiment soil samples on which the wetting pattern was to be observed were taken from an agricultural area they were analyzed in the laboratory to determine their physical and chemical features which were important for irrigation these were ph 7 71 salinity ds m 0 797 lime 18 12 organic matter 0 86 texture clay loam bulk density g cm3 1 30 and aggregate stability 45 82 also the infiltration test was performed by double ring infiltrometer in the field where the soil samples were taken in preparing the soil sample for the experiment it was first kept until it acquired the characteristics of dry air conditions then it was crumbled meanwhile keeping its natural granular structure next the sample was put under a specially designed glass cover fig 1 watson et al 1995 al ogaidi et al 2016 the sizes of the height width and horizontal depth of the container were 55 cm 65 cm and 7 cm respectively before supplying water to the soil from a point source available soil moisture was determined in the laboratory pv 6 97 water was supplied to the soil surface from the emitter at a discharge rate of 2 4 l h the flow rate of water supplied to the soil was determined by the measured container method in three repetitions in the experiment real time camera records were taken over a period of 125 min and the dimensions of the components constituting the wetting pattern were measured every five minutes over the 125 minute period the wetted diameter on the soil surface maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and depth of this maximum width from the soil surface at any time during the irrigation are the main components of the wetting pattern and the model spatio temporal analysis of the data and the real time camera records from the experiment constituted the second main stage of the investigation the components of the wetting pattern and their features were described in detail in this stage some sample images from the experiment are given in fig 1 in order to state the spatio temporal variations in the wetting pattern more clearly attention was paid to ensuring a large time interval between the sample images in fig 1 when the borders of the wetting patterns in fig 1 were processed on a computer the images given in fig 2 were obtained these describe some of the components of the wetting pattern the components of the wetting pattern show a continuous and unsteady variation in temporal and spatial dimensions these variables can be considered as functions of time the maximum width of the wetting pattern occurred under the soil surface fig 2 the schematic view of the spatio temporal variations of the components is given in fig 3 when the single wetting pattern on the left side of fig 3 is considered i it is seen that the horizontal axes tangent to the points tn and un are perpendicular to the line tnun ii line tnun shows the maximum wetted depth which occurs in the soil profile at any time during the irrigation application iii points ta and tu which are on the right and left sides of the line tnun are the farthest points perpendicular to this line on the right side of fig 3 the wetting patterns which occurred at different time points t1 t2 t3 and t4 are also shown schematically the cross sections of the wetting patterns determined separately for each time point are the only components simultaneously fulfilling all of the three conditions described above as seen in fig 3 the maximum widths of the wetting pattern in the soil profile are represented by the symbols tu and ta the components tn ta tu and un of the wetting pattern show a continuous and unsteady variation in temporal and spatial dimensions each of them is a function of time for instance the line tnun which is perpendicular to the soil surface and which intersects un the deepest point of the wetting pattern in the soil profile is not a symmetry axis also the points tu and ta do not intersect each other symmetrically during the irrigation application all these components showed a continuous and unsteady variation at each time point thus different wetting patterns occurred both on the soil surface and in the soil profile during the water application the wetting pattern occurring at each different time point joins the next one and constitutes a consecutive pattern fig 3 the third main stage of the investigation was to describe the volumetric wetting pattern in the 3d system analytically in accordance with the data from the experiment this part of the study consisted of two sub stages the first was the analytical description of the wetting pattern performed by placing it on the coordinate system in accordance with the features of water movement in soil turning the wetting pattern in fig 3 90 to the right makes it much easier to place it on the coordinate system kilic 2018c this process is shown schematically in fig 4 as seen in fig 4 the line tnun represents the horizontal axis and the soil surface constitutes the vertical axis the area under the horizontal x axis was named cross section i and that above the x axis was named cross section ii the sizes of the components of cross sections i and ii are completely different and independent from each other therefore they do not have to be symmetric or the same size the values of the variables constituting cross sections i and ii in the wetting pattern were entered into the model separately and results were obtained consequently a symmetric or asymmetric wetting pattern does not change the validity of the results this is shown schematically in fig 5 the cross sectional area describing the wetting pattern which occurred at any time t0 in drip irrigation consists of four different functions fig 5 kilic 2018a b the simultaneous curves y1i and y2i which occurred in the zone iii and zone iv of the coordinate system were convex while the simultaneous curves y1ii and y2ii in the zone i and zone ii had concave features the vertex points of the two functions which constituted cross section i were common and took negative values ki 0 fig 5a similarly the other two functions which constituted cross section ii also had a common vertex point which took positive values kii 0 fig 5b in description of the volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system the parabolic functions constituted by four different simultaneous curves were used fig 6 as seen in fig 6a roots of the convex parabolas y1i and y2i which constitute the cross section i are xi1 2 xi1 1 and xi2 2 xi2 1 respectively the roots of the equation y1i have a symmetric feature according to the y axis this is also valid for the roots of the equation y2i the roots of the concave parabolas y1ii and y2ii which constitute cross section ii are xii1 2 xii1 1 and xii2 2 xii2 1 respectively similarly the roots of each equation have symmetric feature according to the y axis fig 6b the value of xi1 2 which is one of the roots of the parabola y1i in cross section i is equal to xii1 2 which is one of the roots of the parabola y1ii occurring in cross section ii fig 6 fig 4 fig 7 both of these roots were described according to the maximum wetted depth which occurred in soil profile at any time t0 the maximum wetted depth which occurs at any time takes only one value and this depth is equal in both simultaneous cross section i and cross section ii fig 2 fig 3 fig 4 this parameter is represented by the symbol e in fig 7 on the other hand the fact that one of the roots xi1 2 of the equation y1i in cross section i and the root xii1 2 of the equationy1ii in cross section ii have equal values does not necessitate these two functions being the same because cross sections i and ii have asymmetric structures according to the x axis fig 7 the components of the wetting pattern for the simultaneous cross sections took different values from each other during the water application period in this state the vertex points ki and kii of the convex and concave parabolic functions of cross sections i and ii respectively are different from each other as to both location and dimension ki 0 and kii 0 this means that although the roots of the functions y1i and y1ii are equal because of the maximum wetted depth which occurred at any time the equations representing y1i and y1ii are different from each other figs 6 and fig 7 in other words functions y1i and y1ii which are located in simultaneous cross sections i and ii are described by different equations with equal roots the main reason for this is that cross sections i and ii have an asymmetric structure the wetting patterns show different properties for the simultaneous cross sections as a result although the maximum wetted depth e which occurred at any time t0 is equal for both cross sections figs 7 2 and 3 the asymmetric structure of cross sections i and ii results in their description by different functions this solution is one of the important components increasing the validity of the model results 2 1 main movement equations of water in the wetting pattern while the big parabola y1i and the small parabola y2i in cross section i have a convex feature fig 6a the big parabola y1ii and the small parabola y2ii in cross section ii show a concave feature fig 6b thus the spatio temporal location of the wetting pattern is described analytically for each time point during the irrigation application and the equations of the four parabolas are obtained for cross sections i and ii figs 6a and 7 b kilic 2018a b the parabolic shape of the wetting pattern in the soil profile in the drip irrigation system is described by a second degree equation with one unknown variable for cross sections i and ii a x 2 b x c the standard equation which was obtained in accordance with the abscissa and ordinate values of the vertex point of the parabola can be formulated as a x r 2 k in the equation above a coefficient r abscissa value of the vertex point of the parabola and k ordinate value of the vertex point of the parabola in this part of the study the equations of parabolas y1i and y2i in cross section i shown in fig 6a will be obtained as a sample in the description of the components of the wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system the same process is also valid for the parabolas in cross section ii the vertex points ki of these two parabolas which constitute cross section i are common and this is located on the negative side of the y axis fig 6a thus the abscissa of the vertex point of parabola y1i r 0 and the ordinate value is ki it must be noted that ki must take negative values ki 0 in the coordinate system for cross section i when these variables are inserted in the standard parabola equation the formula y a x 2 k is obtained the coefficient a is obtained by inserting the coordinate values xi1 2 0 shown in fig 6a into this equation the value of xi1 2 the abscissa of this point is determined by the maximum wetted depth which occurred at any time point t0 in drip irrigation figs 3 and 4 the coefficient a in the equation y a x 2 k for the parabola y2i is determined by taking into consideration two variables which determine the wetting pattern the first is the depth where the maximum wetted width occurs in the soil profile under the soil surface in cross section i in determining the value of this variable the depth from the soil surface is taken into consideration this variable is shown by the symbol di in fig 6a the second variable taken into consideration in determining coefficient a in the parabola y2i is the wetted radius which occurs on the soil surface this variable is shown by the symbol bi in fig 6a the value of coefficient a for parabola y2i is determined by inserting the coordinate values di bi which are on the parabola into the equation a x 2 k in this process it must be noted that the ordinate of the vertex point ki of the parabola for the cross section i which has a convex structure must take negative values ki 0 fig 6a as is understood from fig 7a and b all the variables of the wetting pattern in the soil profile nearly always take different dimensional values from each other the reason is that neither of these two simultaneous cross sections has a symmetric structure the process described above is also valid in determining the values of variables and coefficients of cross section ii which constitutes a part of the wetting pattern and shows a concave feature in the drip irrigation system fig 6b the second sub stage taking place in the third main stage of the investigation is the analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in the 3d system 2 2 description of the 3d volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system the analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in a 3d system will begin from the convex cross section i shown in fig 7a in the first stage this cross section will be separated into two zones described by the functions y1i and y2i the calculations will be carried out separately for the zones iii and iv in the coordinate system where functions y1i and y2i take place respectively thus the main components of the wetting pattern and the model which are the wetted radius on the soil surface the maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and the depth of this maximum width from the soil surface are completely included in the process as seen in fig 7a one part of the wetting pattern of cross section i is represented by the function y1i in zone iii in the coordinate system when this volumetric wetting pattern represented by the curvilinear area of y1i in 3d system is shown by the symbol v1i the equations below are obtained v 1 i π x i 1 2 0 y 1 i 2 d x π x i 1 2 0 a i 1 x 2 k i 2 d x π x i 1 2 0 a i 1 2 x 4 2 a i 1 k i x 2 k i 2 d x v 1 i π a i 1 2 5 x 5 2 a i 1 k i 3 x 3 k i 2 x x i 1 2 0 v 1 i π a i 1 2 5 x i 1 2 5 2 a i 1 k i 3 x i 1 2 3 k i 2 x i 1 2 when the volumetric wetting pattern is described similarly for the function y2i taking place in zone iv of the coordinate system in cross section i the equations below are obtained fig 7a v 2 i π 0 d i y 2 i 2 d x π 0 d i a i 2 x 2 k i 2 d x π a i 2 2 5 x 5 2 a i 2 k i 3 x 3 k i 2 x 0 d i v 2 i π a i 2 2 5 d i 5 2 a i 2 k i 3 d i 3 k i 2 d i in these equations the vertex points of the y1i and y2i functions in cross section i are common and this common point takes negative values ki 0 apart from this as these functions have convex structures it must be noted that ai1 and ai2 must take positive values ai1 0 and ai2 0 figs 6a and 7a thus the 3d volumetric wetting pattern of cross section i was described on both the upper and lower sides of the x axis in the coordinate system fig 8 the pattern obtained has a symmetric structure relative to the x axis the total volume in cross section i was determined as shown below v i t v 1 i v 2 i however this state does not completely represent the wetting pattern which in reality has an asymmetric structure relative to the axes in the coordinate system figs 2 and 4 in other words the 3d volumetric wetting pattern in reality has a symmetric structure according to neither the x axis nor the y axis the volumetric wetting pattern constituted by cross section i can only be represented by the 3d curvilinear zone which is located in the zone iii and zone iv of the coordinate system fig 9 thus the formula which describes the wetting pattern of cross section i in 3d system is given below v i g v i t 2 in the next stage functions y1ii and y2ii which represent the wetting pattern shown in fig 6b and fig 7b were described for the volumetric wetting pattern of cross section ii the equations describing the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which was represented by function y1ii in the zone ii of the coordinate system are given below v 1 i i π x i i 1 2 0 y 1 i i 2 d x π x i i 1 2 0 a i i 1 x 2 k i i 2 d x v 1 i i π a i i 1 2 5 x 5 2 a i i 1 k i i 3 x 3 k i i 2 x x i i 1 2 0 v 1 i i π a i i 1 2 5 x i i 1 2 5 2 a i i 1 k i i 3 x i i 1 2 3 k i i 2 x i i 1 2 the vertex point of function y1ii which is located in the zone ii will always take positive values in accordance with its location in the coordinate system in cross section ii kii 0 apart from this as function y1ii has a concave structure it must be noted that aii1 must always take negative values aii1 0 fig 7b when the calculations were carried out similarly for function y2ii which represented the part of the cross section ii in zone i in the coordinate system the equations below were obtained fig 7b v 2 i i π 0 d i i y 2 i i 2 d x π 0 d i i a i i 2 x 2 k i i 2 d x π a i i 2 2 5 x 5 2 a i i 2 k i i 3 x 3 k i i 2 x 0 d i i v 2 i i π a i i 2 2 5 d i i 5 2 a i i 2 k i i 3 d i i 3 k i i 2 d i i in this equation it must also be noted that kii and aii2 must take positive and negative values respectively kii 0 and aii2 0 which are in accordance with the conditions and valid for function y1ii in cross section ii the vertex points kii of both simultaneous functions y1ii and y2ii are common for the wetting pattern which occur at any time t0 the 3d volumetric wetting pattern representing cross section ii in the drip irrigation system can be obtained from the sum of equations v1ii and v2ii fig 10 this pattern has a symmetric structure relative to the x axis v i i t v 1 i i v 2 i i on the other hand the 3d wetting pattern which occurred in reality in the drip irrigation had a symmetric structure neither according to the x axis nor to the y axis because of this the volumetric wetting pattern of cross section ii is represented by the part which is located in the zones i and ii of the coordinate system fig 11 thus the 3d volumetric wetting pattern of cross section ii can be described by the formula given below v i i g v i i t 2 the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which is constituted by the sum of cross sections i and ii for any time t0 in a drip irrigation system was obtained by the formula given below v v i g v i i g thus the 3d volumetric wetting pattern v which occurred at any time t0 in the drip irrigation system was determined by analytical description of four different functions which had convex and concave features and which were located in four zones in the coordinate system fig 12 drip irrigation applications may be performed in various soil textures with different emitter discharges and different application times thus the volumetric wetting patterns which occur under various conditions may be swollen to different degrees and the size of the wetted depth may also vary depending on the features of the water application medium however the method devised in this investigation involves the main components of the wetting pattern which are the wetting diameter on the soil surface at any time t0 the maximum wetted depth the maximum wetted width in the soil profile and the depth of this maximum width from the soil surface thus in determining the 3d volumetric wetting pattern for various conditions it will be sufficient to enter the necessary parameters and run the model in the next stage of the investigation the models devised were run with the data from the experiment and the results were analyzed 3 results and discussion the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which occurred in the drip irrigation was obtained by description of the two different simultaneous cross sections i and ii in the coordinate system and by description of the four different parabola equations representing these cross sections in the spatio temporal dimension these equations having the convex and concave features were stated as a function of time the values of parameters a and k for cross sections i and ii are given in table 1 for each five minute time point when the measurements were carried out in the investigation the parameters ai1 and ai2 which were obtained for functions y1i and y2i representing cross section i always took positive values ai1 0 and ai2 0 table 1 this is in accordance with the convex structure of the wetting pattern constituting cross section i figs 6a and 7 a apart from this ki which is the vertex point of the simultaneous functions y1i and y2i in cross section i is common parameter ki always took negative values ki 0 in accordance with the location of cross section i in the coordinate system table 1 figs 6a and 7a the parameters aii1 and aii2 which were obtained for the functions y1ii and y2ii in the wetting pattern constituting cross section ii took negative values during the water application period aii1 0 and aii2 0 table 1 this accords with the concave structure of the wetting pattern constituting cross section ii figs 6b and 7b in addition kii which is the vertex point of parabolas y2ii and y1ii located in the zones i and ii of the coordinate system respectively in cross section ii is also common in other words cross section ii consists of two simultaneous concave parabolas the vertex points of which are common kii always took positive values kii 0 in accordance with the location of cross section ii in the coordinate system table 1 fig 7b spatio temporal variation of the sizes of the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which occurred in cross sections i and ii by running the models for five minute time periods is given in table 2 volumetric increment occurred in cross section i and ii which was represented by the values of vig and viig respectively at each consecutive time point together with the increment in water application period table 2 the volumetric increment in size which occurred at each cross section level together with the increment in the amount of water which infiltrated the soil is compatible with the natural movement features of water in the soil cross sections i and ii which constitute the wetting pattern have asymmetric structures thus a linear relationship did not occur between the volumetric increments of the cross sections according to time these results are also in accordance with the natural movement features of water in the soil momentary spatio temporal rate of change of the volumetric wetting pattern of cross sections i and ii in 3d system are shown in fig 13 momentary volumetric rate of change of cross sections i and ii showed a continuous and nonlinear variation in temporal and spatial dimensions fig 13 the soil profile naturally contains grains with different diameters also the pores in this medium have different shapes and volumes as these grains and pores with various features show an irregular and asymmetric distribution in the soil profile the components of cross sections i and ii also showed an asymmetric structure this also affected directly the irregularity of the momentary volumetric rate of change of the cross sections this process accords well with the normal movement features of water in the soil profile the momentary spatio temporal rate of change of the entire volumetric wetting pattern v which consists of sum of the cross sections i and ii are shown in fig 14 similarly the momentary volumetric rate of change of the whole wetting pattern also showed a continuous and irregular variation in the spatio temporal dimension this state represents the volumetric variation features of cross sections i and ii together this process also accords the natural movement features of water in soil fig 14 the average rate of volumetric variation which enables an evaluation about the entire process is shown in fig 15 the average velocity of variation of the volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation produced a curvilinear graph with a concave feature as the water application period advanced the average velocity of variation reached a constant value and continued its trend fig 15 this is compatible with the infiltration features of the soil the momentary acceleration of variation of 3d volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system is shown in fig 16 the momentary acceleration of variation of the volumetric wetting pattern showed a continuous and nonlinear variation in accordance with the asymmetric structure of cross sections i and ii in other words the 3d wetting pattern showed an increment in size with the momentary velocities increasing or decreasing irregularly in the spatio temporal dimension this is compatible with the natural movement features of water in the soil the average acceleration of volumetric variation of the 3d wetting pattern which describes the entire process in spatio temporal dimension is shown in fig 17 the size of the volumetric wetting pattern in drip irrigation showed an increment at decreasing velocities fig 17 while the wetting pattern showed an increment in size with higher velocities at the beginning of the water application period the velocity of increment decreased depending on the advance of time and finally it reached a constant value this is compatible with the infiltration characteristics of the soil and the natural movement features of water in the soil profile temporal variation of the wetting volume during the water application period is shown in fig 18 the wetting volume in the soil profile showed an increment in size over time fig 18 the size of the wetting volume increased together with the increment in the amount of water which infiltrated to the soil however the momentary rate of increment of the wetting volume showed a nonlinear trend fig 14 and it was determined that the size of the volumetric wetting pattern showed an increment in decreasing velocities over time fig 17 this accords with the infiltration characteristics of the soil and natural movement features of water in the soil profile 4 conclusions the values of parameters a and k were determined for each five minute time point during the water application period for cross sections i and ii which constitute the volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system both the parameters ai1 and ai2 always took positive values in cross section i ai1 0 and ai2 0 these results are compatible with the convex structure of cross section i representing the wetting pattern which occurs in the zones iii and iv of the coordinate system the vertex points ki of the simultaneous convex parabolas which constitute the wetting pattern in cross section i are common this parameter took always negative values in accordance with its location in the negative side of the y axis ki 0 this gave results which accorded with the analytical description of the wetting pattern in the coordinate system for cross section i the parameters aii1 and aii2 obtained from the model for cross section ii took negative values in accordance with the concave features of the two simultaneous parabolic cross sections which constitute the wetting pattern in the zones i and ii of the coordinate system aii1 0 and aii2 0 the common vertex point kii of the simultaneous parabolas which constitute cross section ii of the wetting pattern took positive values in accordance with its location in the coordinate system kii 0 these parameters are compatible with the features of the wetting pattern constituted by cross section ii momentary rate of change of the volumetric wetting pattern showed a continuous and nonlinear variation in temporal and spatial dimensions the fact that the soil profile contains pores with different shapes and sizes and that it also contains grains with different diameters which show an irregular and asymmetric distribution in the soil profile caused a continuous and nonlinear momentary rate of change of wetting volume this is compatible with the natural movement features of water in the soil the average acceleration of volumetric variation which describes the entire spatio temporal variation of the wetting pattern showed that the 3d pattern increased in size with decreasing velocities this is compatible with the infiltration characteristics of the soil and the natural movement features of water in the soil profile in the drip irrigation system the main components of the volumetric wetting pattern and the model devised are the wetted radius on the soil surface at any time during the water application period the maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and the depth of this maximum wetted width from the soil surface when the model is run for any time point the coordinate values representing the dimensions and location of the components of this wetting pattern are obtained in other words the main components of the wetting pattern in a drip irrigation system constitute the variables and parameters of the models devised in this investigation drip irrigation applications may be performed in soils of different textures with different emitter discharges and over various water application periods volumetric wetting patterns which occur in various conditions may be wide to different degrees from each other and the maximum wetted depth may be greater or less for different applications according to the features of the medium however the main variables and parameters of the models devised consist of the main components of these different wetting patterns as a result in order to determine the volumetric wetting pattern at any time during the drip irrigation application under various conditions it is adequate to input the values of the components of the wetting pattern and run the models devised conflict of interest i do not have conflict of

10804,the wetting pattern and its components are important factors in the optimum design and operation of a drip irrigation system in this investigation the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which occurred under the surface drip irrigation was described analytically in the laboratory experiment the spatio temporal variation of the wetting pattern was observed during the water application period and the sizes of its components were measured at five minute intervals the components of the pattern were the wetted radius on the soil surface at any time during irrigation and the maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile in addition camera records were taken during the experiment some physical and chemical features of the soil sample which were important for irrigation were analyzed also the infiltration test was performed by double ring infiltrometer in the field where the soil samples were taken the moisture content of the soil was determined at the beginning of the irrigation application in the next stage the wetting pattern was located on the coordinate system and the main movement equations describing the spatio temporal variation of the

discharges and application times although wetting patterns in various conditions show different properties of shape from each other the models devised contain the entire main common components of the wetting pattern as a result when the models were run with the data from the experiment the 3d wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system was determined and analyzed comparatively from the points of view of main movement features of water in the soil profile and on the soil surface keywords drip irrigation system volumetric wetting pattern 3d mathematical modelling analytical solution movement of water in soil spatio temporal variation of the wetting pattern in soil 1 introduction drip irrigation system is one of the most important solutions for the efficient use of limited water resources with a good design and correct operation of the system an important level of improvement is attained in irrigation efficiency together with higher crop yields moreover drip irrigation has other advantages like the ability to add fertilizers efficiently through the system and minimizing evaporation deep percolation and runoff in surface drip irrigation the water creates a wetting pattern similar to a truncated sphere or ellipsoid in the soil profile these shapes occur depending on the amount of water applied to the soil the emitter discharge and the hydraulic properties of the soil al ogaidi et al 2016 the wetted soil volume is one of the most important factors in designing drip irrigation systems the wetted depth in the soil profile and the radius on the soil surface are the main components of the volumetric wetting pattern dasberg and or 1999 al ogaidi et al 2016 the maximum width of the wetting pattern in drip irrigation occurs under the soil surface in order to determine the cross sectional area and volumetric size of the wetting pattern more accurately the components of maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and wetted radius on the soil surface occurring at any time during the irrigation must be taken into consideration kilic 2018a b kilic 2018c the wetted depth should be suitable for the root zone depth of the crop also the spacing between emitters and laterals must be designed in accordance with the wetted width of the pattern zur 1996 the shape and dimensions of the components of the wetting pattern must be determined correctly for accordance between the cross section of the wetting pattern and the wetted soil volume fernandez galvez and simmonds 2006 kilic 2018a b the wetting pattern is the main component in optimizing emitter spacing lateral placement and in selecting a suitable drip irrigation system dabral et al 2012 in order to determine the wetting pattern in drip irrigation systems numerous models have been devised they are divided into several types analytical models philip 1984 chu 1994 thorburn et al 2003 cook et al 2003 numerical models simunek et al 1999 lazarovitch et al 2007 and

different conditions analytical models provide a quick tool to determine the wetting front location al ogaidi et al 2016 these models are based on the assumption of a point source and special forms for the physical properties of the soil philip 1984 revol et al 1997a 1997b numerical models need considerable computing power and some background to use them the hydrus program was developed to simulate water heat and solute transport in two and three dimensional media it numerically solves richards equation for saturated unsaturated water flow and convection dispersion type equations for heat and solute transport the model includes a parameter optimization algorithm for inverse estimation of a variety of soil hydraulic and or solute transport parameters simunek et al 1999 wang et al 2013 sejna et al 2014 empirical models use regression and dimensional analysis for data from laboratory and field experiments these models predict the depth and width of the wetting patterns as a function of soil hydraulic properties and emitter discharge schwartzman and zur 1986 amin and ekhmaj 2006 malek and peters 2011 naglic et al 2014 al ogaidi et al 2015 elmaloglou and malamos 2007

describes local infiltration from a surface point source was used to obtain numerical results an unsteady nonlinearized numerical model was developed by bhatnagar and chauhan 2008 in an oblate spheroidal coordinate system to predict the wetting pattern below an emitter placed on the soil surface relative rates of change of the components of the wetting pattern at different time points were not taken into consideration elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 investigated the infiltration and redistribution of soil moisture under surface drip irrigation considering hysteresis in two soils of different texture loamy sand and silt loam a cylindrical flow model incorporating hysteresis in the soil water retention characteristic curve evaporation from the soil surface and water extraction by

three options were explored to prepare input output functional relations from a database created using a numerical model hydrus 2d kandelous and simunek 2010 evaluated the accuracy of several approaches used to estimate wetting zone dimensions by comparing their predictions with field and laboratory data including the hydrus 2d numerical model the wet up analytical software and selected empirical models elmaloglou et al 2010 investigated the validity of the assumption that an irrigation event from point sources could be approximated as an infinite line source in this process two existing mathematical models which simulate point and line drip irrigation were used fu qiang et al 2011 developed a numerical model of two dimensional soil water movement under surface drip irrigation conditions the physical process of soil water movement was described by the 2d richards equation and the upper boundary condition was depicted by the improved moving ponded area boundary kooij et al 2013 carried out a systematic review of the literature on the efficiency of a drip irrigation system they showed that the term efficiency means different things to different people and can refer to different elements in the water balance elmaloglou et al 2013 investigated the soil water dynamics under surface drip irrigation from equidistant line sources using a simulation model which combines hysteresis in the soil water characteristic curve evaporation from the soil surface and water extraction by roots badr and abuarab 2013 carried out an investigation of soil moisture distribution patterns under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems in sandy soil using the neutron scattering technique water distribution uniformity was assessed by applying the surfer model communar and friedman 2013 provided analytical solutions to the unsteady three dimensional infiltration from surface or subsurface point sources these solutions were obtained from a linearized form of richard s equation kuklik and hoang 2014 carried out an investigation of the determination of the principal relationships influencing the distribution of moisture content in a soil profile under an emitter in point irrigation moncef and khemaies 2016 developed an analytical approach for predicting the wetted soil volume underneath an emitter laid on the ground surface the approach was based on 1 the green and ampt assumption 2 the inference of the wetted soil depth from the radius of the humid area at the ground surface and 3 the hypothesis that the bulb keeps a semi elliptical shape whose diagonals are merged with the soil surface and the symmetry axis kilic 2018a carried out an investigation in order to describe the wetting pattern analytically using a new method simultaneous double parabola design in this process some physical and chemical properties of the soil sample which were important for irrigation were determined the wetting pattern and its components were observed in real time conditions and they were measured at five minute intervals during the irrigation application the wetted radius on the soil surface the maximum wetted depth and the maximum wetted width in the soil profile are the main components of the wetting pattern and the model also real time camera records were taken during the experiment the wetting pattern was described analytically in accordance with its spatio temporal location in the soil and the components of the wetting pattern were described as a function of time in the second part of the investigation the models were run with the data from the experiment for different time points during the irrigation application kilic 2018b the models estimate the cross sectional area of the wetting pattern and its variation in the spatio temporal dimension it was determined that the wetting pattern in the drip irrigation could be described accurately by the simultaneous double parabola approach al ogaidi et al 2016 conducted laboratory experiments with surface drip irrigation and developed an empirical model to estimate the whole wetting pattern at different application times the empirical model included estimation of the wetted radius at the soil surface and the depth of the wetting pattern as a function of application time and other affecting factors however the volumetric wetting pattern in a three dimensional system was not determined in the investigation the simulation of wetting patterns under drip irrigation systems have been widely studied using empirical models but these models enable an estimation of only the wetted radius at the soil surface and the wetted depth in the soil al ogaidi et al 2016 therefore the aim of this investigation was to develop an analytical model to describe the 3d volumetric wetting pattern by the spatio temporal relationships between the components of the wetting pattern in the drip irrigation 2 materials and methods analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in a 3d system in drip irrigation was performed in four main stages the first stage was to design the experiment so as to enable reliable measurement of the components of the wetting pattern at consecutive time points at five minute intervals this investigation was carried out under uniform soil texture conditions the second stage consisted of the spatio temporal analysis of the data and real time camera recordings of the experiment the third main stage was to describe the volumetric wetting pattern analytically in the 3d system this process was carried out in two sub stages the first one was to describe the 3d model infrastructure in accordance with the main movement equations of water occurring in the wetting pattern as explained by kilic 2018a b and kilic 2018c the second sub stage consisted of the analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in the 3d system the last stage of the investigation was to run the models with the data from the experiment and to analyze and evaluate the results in the first stage of the investigation the establishment of the experiment soil samples on which the wetting pattern was to be observed were taken from an agricultural area they were analyzed in the laboratory to determine their physical and chemical features which were important for irrigation these were ph 7 71 salinity ds m 0 797 lime 18 12 organic matter 0 86 texture clay loam bulk density g cm3 1 30 and aggregate stability 45 82 also the infiltration test was performed by double ring infiltrometer in the field where the soil samples were taken in preparing the soil sample for the experiment it was first kept until it acquired the characteristics of dry air conditions then it was crumbled meanwhile keeping its natural granular structure next the sample was put under a specially designed glass cover fig 1 watson et al 1995 al ogaidi et al 2016 the sizes of the height width and horizontal depth of the container were 55 cm 65 cm and 7 cm respectively before supplying water to the soil from a point source available soil moisture was determined in the laboratory pv 6 97 water was supplied to the soil surface from the emitter at a discharge rate of 2 4 l h the flow rate of water supplied to the soil was determined by the measured container method in three repetitions in the experiment real time camera records were taken over a period of 125 min and the dimensions of the components constituting the wetting pattern were measured every five minutes over the 125 minute period the wetted diameter on the soil surface maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and depth of this maximum width from the soil surface at any time during the irrigation are the main components of the wetting pattern and the model spatio temporal analysis of the data and the real time camera records from the experiment constituted the second main stage of the investigation the components of the wetting pattern and their features were described in detail in this stage some sample images from the experiment are given in fig 1 in order to state the spatio temporal variations in the wetting pattern more clearly attention was paid to ensuring a large time interval between the sample images in fig 1 when the borders of the wetting patterns in fig 1 were processed on a computer the images given in fig 2 were obtained these describe some of the components of the wetting pattern the components of the wetting pattern show a continuous and unsteady variation in temporal and spatial dimensions these variables can be considered as functions of time the maximum width of the wetting pattern occurred under the soil surface fig 2 the schematic view of the spatio temporal variations of the components is given in fig 3 when the single wetting pattern on the left side of fig 3 is considered i it is seen that the horizontal axes tangent to the points tn and un are perpendicular to the line tnun ii line tnun shows the maximum wetted depth which occurs in the soil profile at any time during the irrigation application iii points ta and tu which are on the right and left sides of the line tnun are the farthest points perpendicular to this line on the right side of fig 3 the wetting patterns which occurred at different time points t1 t2 t3 and t4 are also shown schematically the cross sections of the wetting patterns determined separately for each time point are the only components simultaneously fulfilling all of the three conditions described above as seen in fig 3 the maximum widths of the wetting pattern in the soil profile are represented by the symbols tu and ta the components tn ta tu and un of the wetting pattern show a continuous and unsteady variation in temporal and spatial dimensions each of them is a function of time for instance the line tnun which is perpendicular to the soil surface and which intersects un the deepest point of the wetting pattern in the soil profile is not a symmetry axis also the points tu and ta do not intersect each other symmetrically during the irrigation application all these components showed a continuous and unsteady variation at each time point thus different wetting patterns occurred both on the soil surface and in the soil profile during the water application the wetting pattern occurring at each different time point joins the next one and constitutes a consecutive pattern fig 3 the third main stage of the investigation was to describe the volumetric wetting pattern in the 3d system analytically in accordance with the data from the experiment this part of the study consisted of two sub stages the first was the analytical description of the wetting pattern performed by placing it on the coordinate system in accordance with the features of water movement in soil turning the wetting pattern in fig 3 90 to the right makes it much easier to place it on the coordinate system kilic 2018c this process is shown schematically in fig 4 as seen in fig 4 the line tnun represents the horizontal axis and the soil surface constitutes the vertical axis the area under the horizontal x axis was named cross section i and that above the x axis was named cross section ii the sizes of the components of cross sections i and ii are completely different and independent from each other therefore they do not have to be symmetric or the same size the values of the variables constituting cross sections i and ii in the wetting pattern were entered into the model separately and results were obtained consequently a symmetric or asymmetric wetting pattern does not change the validity of the results this is shown schematically in fig 5 the cross sectional area describing the wetting pattern which occurred at any time t0 in drip irrigation consists of four different functions fig 5 kilic 2018a b the simultaneous curves y1i and y2i which occurred in the zone iii and zone iv of the coordinate system were convex while the simultaneous curves y1ii and y2ii in the zone i and zone ii had concave features the vertex points of the two functions which constituted cross section i were common and took negative values ki 0 fig 5a similarly the other two functions which constituted cross section ii also had a common vertex point which took positive values kii 0 fig 5b in description of the volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system the parabolic functions constituted by four different simultaneous curves were used fig 6 as seen in fig 6a roots of the convex parabolas y1i and y2i which constitute the cross section i are xi1 2 xi1 1 and xi2 2 xi2 1 respectively the roots of the equation y1i have a symmetric feature according to the y axis this is also valid for the roots of the equation y2i the roots of the concave parabolas y1ii and y2ii which constitute cross section ii are xii1 2 xii1 1 and xii2 2 xii2 1 respectively similarly the roots of each equation have symmetric feature according to the y axis fig 6b the value of xi1 2 which is one of the roots of the parabola y1i in cross section i is equal to xii1 2 which is one of the roots of the parabola y1ii occurring in cross section ii fig 6 fig 4 fig 7 both of these roots were described according to the maximum wetted depth which occurred in soil profile at any time t0 the maximum wetted depth which occurs at any time takes only one value and this depth is equal in both simultaneous cross section i and cross section ii fig 2 fig 3 fig 4 this parameter is represented by the symbol e in fig 7 on the other hand the fact that one of the roots xi1 2 of the equation y1i in cross section i and the root xii1 2 of the equationy1ii in cross section ii have equal values does not necessitate these two functions being the same because cross sections i and ii have asymmetric structures according to the x axis fig 7 the components of the wetting pattern for the simultaneous cross sections took different values from each other during the water application period in this state the vertex points ki and kii of the convex and concave parabolic functions of cross sections i and ii respectively are different from each other as to both location and dimension ki 0 and kii 0 this means that although the roots of the functions y1i and y1ii are equal because of the maximum wetted depth which occurred at any time the equations representing y1i and y1ii are different from each other figs 6 and fig 7 in other words functions y1i and y1ii which are located in simultaneous cross sections i and ii are described by different equations with equal roots the main reason for this is that cross sections i and ii have an asymmetric structure the wetting patterns show different properties for the simultaneous cross sections as a result although the maximum wetted depth e which occurred at any time t0 is equal for both cross sections figs 7 2 and 3 the asymmetric structure of cross sections i and ii results in their description by different functions this solution is one of the important components increasing the validity of the model results 2 1 main movement equations of water in the wetting pattern while the big parabola y1i and the small parabola y2i in cross section i have a convex feature fig 6a the big parabola y1ii and the small parabola y2ii in cross section ii show a concave feature fig 6b thus the spatio temporal location of the wetting pattern is described analytically for each time point during the irrigation application and the equations of the four parabolas are obtained for cross sections i and ii figs 6a and 7 b kilic 2018a b the parabolic shape of the wetting pattern in the soil profile in the drip irrigation system is described by a second degree equation with one unknown variable for cross sections i and ii a x 2 b x c the standard equation which was obtained in accordance with the abscissa and ordinate values of the vertex point of the parabola can be formulated as a x r 2 k in the equation above a coefficient r abscissa value of the vertex point of the parabola and k ordinate value of the vertex point of the parabola in this part of the study the equations of parabolas y1i and y2i in cross section i shown in fig 6a will be obtained as a sample in the description of the components of the wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system the same process is also valid for the parabolas in cross section ii the vertex points ki of these two parabolas which constitute cross section i are common and this is located on the negative side of the y axis fig 6a thus the abscissa of the vertex point of parabola y1i r 0 and the ordinate value is ki it must be noted that ki must take negative values ki 0 in the coordinate system for cross section i when these variables are inserted in the standard parabola equation the formula y a x 2 k is obtained the coefficient a is obtained by inserting the coordinate values xi1 2 0 shown in fig 6a into this equation the value of xi1 2 the abscissa of this point is determined by the maximum wetted depth which occurred at any time point t0 in drip irrigation figs 3 and 4 the coefficient a in the equation y a x 2 k for the parabola y2i is determined by taking into consideration two variables which determine the wetting pattern the first is the depth where the maximum wetted width occurs in the soil profile under the soil surface in cross section i in determining the value of this variable the depth from the soil surface is taken into consideration this variable is shown by the symbol di in fig 6a the second variable taken into consideration in determining coefficient a in the parabola y2i is the wetted radius which occurs on the soil surface this variable is shown by the symbol bi in fig 6a the value of coefficient a for parabola y2i is determined by inserting the coordinate values di bi which are on the parabola into the equation a x 2 k in this process it must be noted that the ordinate of the vertex point ki of the parabola for the cross section i which has a convex structure must take negative values ki 0 fig 6a as is understood from fig 7a and b all the variables of the wetting pattern in the soil profile nearly always take different dimensional values from each other the reason is that neither of these two simultaneous cross sections has a symmetric structure the process described above is also valid in determining the values of variables and coefficients of cross section ii which constitutes a part of the wetting pattern and shows a concave feature in the drip irrigation system fig 6b the second sub stage taking place in the third main stage of the investigation is the analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in the 3d system 2 2 description of the 3d volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system the analytical description of the volumetric wetting pattern in a 3d system will begin from the convex cross section i shown in fig 7a in the first stage this cross section will be separated into two zones described by the functions y1i and y2i the calculations will be carried out separately for the zones iii and iv in the coordinate system where functions y1i and y2i take place respectively thus the main components of the wetting pattern and the model which are the wetted radius on the soil surface the maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and the depth of this maximum width from the soil surface are completely included in the process as seen in fig 7a one part of the wetting pattern of cross section i is represented by the function y1i in zone iii in the coordinate system when this volumetric wetting pattern represented by the curvilinear area of y1i in 3d system is shown by the symbol v1i the equations below are obtained v 1 i π x i 1 2 0 y 1 i 2 d x π x i 1 2 0 a i 1 x 2 k i 2 d x π x i 1 2 0 a i 1 2 x 4 2 a i 1 k i x 2 k i 2 d x v 1 i π a i 1 2 5 x 5 2 a i 1 k i 3 x 3 k i 2 x x i 1 2 0 v 1 i π a i 1 2 5 x i 1 2 5 2 a i 1 k i 3 x i 1 2 3 k i 2 x i 1 2 when the volumetric wetting pattern is described similarly for the function y2i taking place in zone iv of the coordinate system in cross section i the equations below are obtained fig 7a v 2 i π 0 d i y 2 i 2 d x π 0 d i a i 2 x 2 k i 2 d x π a i 2 2 5 x 5 2 a i 2 k i 3 x 3 k i 2 x 0 d i v 2 i π a i 2 2 5 d i 5 2 a i 2 k i 3 d i 3 k i 2 d i in these equations the vertex points of the y1i and y2i functions in cross section i are common and this common point takes negative values ki 0 apart from this as these functions have convex structures it must be noted that ai1 and ai2 must take positive values ai1 0 and ai2 0 figs 6a and 7a thus the 3d volumetric wetting pattern of cross section i was described on both the upper and lower sides of the x axis in the coordinate system fig 8 the pattern obtained has a symmetric structure relative to the x axis the total volume in cross section i was determined as shown below v i t v 1 i v 2 i however this state does not completely represent the wetting pattern which in reality has an asymmetric structure relative to the axes in the coordinate system figs 2 and 4 in other words the 3d volumetric wetting pattern in reality has a symmetric structure according to neither the x axis nor the y axis the volumetric wetting pattern constituted by cross section i can only be represented by the 3d curvilinear zone which is located in the zone iii and zone iv of the coordinate system fig 9 thus the formula which describes the wetting pattern of cross section i in 3d system is given below v i g v i t 2 in the next stage functions y1ii and y2ii which represent the wetting pattern shown in fig 6b and fig 7b were described for the volumetric wetting pattern of cross section ii the equations describing the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which was represented by function y1ii in the zone ii of the coordinate system are given below v 1 i i π x i i 1 2 0 y 1 i i 2 d x π x i i 1 2 0 a i i 1 x 2 k i i 2 d x v 1 i i π a i i 1 2 5 x 5 2 a i i 1 k i i 3 x 3 k i i 2 x x i i 1 2 0 v 1 i i π a i i 1 2 5 x i i 1 2 5 2 a i i 1 k i i 3 x i i 1 2 3 k i i 2 x i i 1 2 the vertex point of function y1ii which is located in the zone ii will always take positive values in accordance with its location in the coordinate system in cross section ii kii 0 apart from this as function y1ii has a concave structure it must be noted that aii1 must always take negative values aii1 0 fig 7b when the calculations were carried out similarly for function y2ii which represented the part of the cross section ii in zone i in the coordinate system the equations below were obtained fig 7b v 2 i i π 0 d i i y 2 i i 2 d x π 0 d i i a i i 2 x 2 k i i 2 d x π a i i 2 2 5 x 5 2 a i i 2 k i i 3 x 3 k i i 2 x 0 d i i v 2 i i π a i i 2 2 5 d i i 5 2 a i i 2 k i i 3 d i i 3 k i i 2 d i i in this equation it must also be noted that kii and aii2 must take positive and negative values respectively kii 0 and aii2 0 which are in accordance with the conditions and valid for function y1ii in cross section ii the vertex points kii of both simultaneous functions y1ii and y2ii are common for the wetting pattern which occur at any time t0 the 3d volumetric wetting pattern representing cross section ii in the drip irrigation system can be obtained from the sum of equations v1ii and v2ii fig 10 this pattern has a symmetric structure relative to the x axis v i i t v 1 i i v 2 i i on the other hand the 3d wetting pattern which occurred in reality in the drip irrigation had a symmetric structure neither according to the x axis nor to the y axis because of this the volumetric wetting pattern of cross section ii is represented by the part which is located in the zones i and ii of the coordinate system fig 11 thus the 3d volumetric wetting pattern of cross section ii can be described by the formula given below v i i g v i i t 2 the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which is constituted by the sum of cross sections i and ii for any time t0 in a drip irrigation system was obtained by the formula given below v v i g v i i g thus the 3d volumetric wetting pattern v which occurred at any time t0 in the drip irrigation system was determined by analytical description of four different functions which had convex and concave features and which were located in four zones in the coordinate system fig 12 drip irrigation applications may be performed in various soil textures with different emitter discharges and different application times thus the volumetric wetting patterns which occur under various conditions may be swollen to different degrees and the size of the wetted depth may also vary depending on the features of the water application medium however the method devised in this investigation involves the main components of the wetting pattern which are the wetting diameter on the soil surface at any time t0 the maximum wetted depth the maximum wetted width in the soil profile and the depth of this maximum width from the soil surface thus in determining the 3d volumetric wetting pattern for various conditions it will be sufficient to enter the necessary parameters and run the model in the next stage of the investigation the models devised were run with the data from the experiment and the results were analyzed 3 results and discussion the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which occurred in the drip irrigation was obtained by description of the two different simultaneous cross sections i and ii in the coordinate system and by description of the four different parabola equations representing these cross sections in the spatio temporal dimension these equations having the convex and concave features were stated as a function of time the values of parameters a and k for cross sections i and ii are given in table 1 for each five minute time point when the measurements were carried out in the investigation the parameters ai1 and ai2 which were obtained for functions y1i and y2i representing cross section i always took positive values ai1 0 and ai2 0 table 1 this is in accordance with the convex structure of the wetting pattern constituting cross section i figs 6a and 7 a apart from this ki which is the vertex point of the simultaneous functions y1i and y2i in cross section i is common parameter ki always took negative values ki 0 in accordance with the location of cross section i in the coordinate system table 1 figs 6a and 7a the parameters aii1 and aii2 which were obtained for the functions y1ii and y2ii in the wetting pattern constituting cross section ii took negative values during the water application period aii1 0 and aii2 0 table 1 this accords with the concave structure of the wetting pattern constituting cross section ii figs 6b and 7b in addition kii which is the vertex point of parabolas y2ii and y1ii located in the zones i and ii of the coordinate system respectively in cross section ii is also common in other words cross section ii consists of two simultaneous concave parabolas the vertex points of which are common kii always took positive values kii 0 in accordance with the location of cross section ii in the coordinate system table 1 fig 7b spatio temporal variation of the sizes of the 3d volumetric wetting pattern which occurred in cross sections i and ii by running the models for five minute time periods is given in table 2 volumetric increment occurred in cross section i and ii which was represented by the values of vig and viig respectively at each consecutive time point together with the increment in water application period table 2 the volumetric increment in size which occurred at each cross section level together with the increment in the amount of water which infiltrated the soil is compatible with the natural movement features of water in the soil cross sections i and ii which constitute the wetting pattern have asymmetric structures thus a linear relationship did not occur between the volumetric increments of the cross sections according to time these results are also in accordance with the natural movement features of water in the soil momentary spatio temporal rate of change of the volumetric wetting pattern of cross sections i and ii in 3d system are shown in fig 13 momentary volumetric rate of change of cross sections i and ii showed a continuous and nonlinear variation in temporal and spatial dimensions fig 13 the soil profile naturally contains grains with different diameters also the pores in this medium have different shapes and volumes as these grains and pores with various features show an irregular and asymmetric distribution in the soil profile the components of cross sections i and ii also showed an asymmetric structure this also affected directly the irregularity of the momentary volumetric rate of change of the cross sections this process accords well with the normal movement features of water in the soil profile the momentary spatio temporal rate of change of the entire volumetric wetting pattern v which consists of sum of the cross sections i and ii are shown in fig 14 similarly the momentary volumetric rate of change of the whole wetting pattern also showed a continuous and irregular variation in the spatio temporal dimension this state represents the volumetric variation features of cross sections i and ii together this process also accords the natural movement features of water in soil fig 14 the average rate of volumetric variation which enables an evaluation about the entire process is shown in fig 15 the average velocity of variation of the volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation produced a curvilinear graph with a concave feature as the water application period advanced the average velocity of variation reached a constant value and continued its trend fig 15 this is compatible with the infiltration features of the soil the momentary acceleration of variation of 3d volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system is shown in fig 16 the momentary acceleration of variation of the volumetric wetting pattern showed a continuous and nonlinear variation in accordance with the asymmetric structure of cross sections i and ii in other words the 3d wetting pattern showed an increment in size with the momentary velocities increasing or decreasing irregularly in the spatio temporal dimension this is compatible with the natural movement features of water in the soil the average acceleration of volumetric variation of the 3d wetting pattern which describes the entire process in spatio temporal dimension is shown in fig 17 the size of the volumetric wetting pattern in drip irrigation showed an increment at decreasing velocities fig 17 while the wetting pattern showed an increment in size with higher velocities at the beginning of the water application period the velocity of increment decreased depending on the advance of time and finally it reached a constant value this is compatible with the infiltration characteristics of the soil and the natural movement features of water in the soil profile temporal variation of the wetting volume during the water application period is shown in fig 18 the wetting volume in the soil profile showed an increment in size over time fig 18 the size of the wetting volume increased together with the increment in the amount of water which infiltrated to the soil however the momentary rate of increment of the wetting volume showed a nonlinear trend fig 14 and it was determined that the size of the volumetric wetting pattern showed an increment in decreasing velocities over time fig 17 this accords with the infiltration characteristics of the soil and natural movement features of water in the soil profile 4 conclusions the values of parameters a and k were determined for each five minute time point during the water application period for cross sections i and ii which constitute the volumetric wetting pattern in the drip irrigation system both the parameters ai1 and ai2 always took positive values in cross section i ai1 0 and ai2 0 these results are compatible with the convex structure of cross section i representing the wetting pattern which occurs in the zones iii and iv of the coordinate system the vertex points ki of the simultaneous convex parabolas which constitute the wetting pattern in cross section i are common this parameter took always negative values in accordance with its location in the negative side of the y axis ki 0 this gave results which accorded with the analytical description of the wetting pattern in the coordinate system for cross section i the parameters aii1 and aii2 obtained from the model for cross section ii took negative values in accordance with the concave features of the two simultaneous parabolic cross sections which constitute the wetting pattern in the zones i and ii of the coordinate system aii1 0 and aii2 0 the common vertex point kii of the simultaneous parabolas which constitute cross section ii of the wetting pattern took positive values in accordance with its location in the coordinate system kii 0 these parameters are compatible with the features of the wetting pattern constituted by cross section ii momentary rate of change of the volumetric wetting pattern showed a continuous and nonlinear variation in temporal and spatial dimensions the fact that the soil profile contains pores with different shapes and sizes and that it also contains grains with different diameters which show an irregular and asymmetric distribution in the soil profile caused a continuous and nonlinear momentary rate of change of wetting volume this is compatible with the natural movement features of water in the soil the average acceleration of volumetric variation which describes the entire spatio temporal variation of the wetting pattern showed that the 3d pattern increased in size with decreasing velocities this is compatible with the infiltration characteristics of the soil and the natural movement features of water in the soil profile in the drip irrigation system the main components of the volumetric wetting pattern and the model devised are the wetted radius on the soil surface at any time during the water application period the maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile and the depth of this maximum wetted width from the soil surface when the model is run for any time point the coordinate values representing the dimensions and location of the components of this wetting pattern are obtained in other words the main components of the wetting pattern in a drip irrigation system constitute the variables and parameters of the models devised in this investigation drip irrigation applications may be performed in soils of different textures with different emitter discharges and over various water application periods volumetric wetting patterns which occur in various conditions may be wide to different degrees from each other and the maximum wetted depth may be greater or less for different applications according to the features of the medium however the main variables and parameters of the models devised consist of the main components of these different wetting patterns as a result in order to determine the volumetric wetting pattern at any time during the drip irrigation application under various conditions it is adequate to input the values of the components of the wetting pattern and run the models devised conflict of interest i do not have conflict of
