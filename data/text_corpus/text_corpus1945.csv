9725,water use and efficiency assessment from crop production consumption process provided a new perspective for regional agricultural water management an evaluation framework of water use efficiency wue coupling crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes was established in this paper the impact of virtual water flow on provincial irrigation water use efficiency and its implications for irrigation management were assessed based on the inter provincial virtual irrigation water flow viwf estimation for cereals of china the results showed that national iwu iwp and ie for cereal production in 2018 were 268 89 gm³ 1 815 m³ kg and 0 494 respectively total viwf among 31 provinces was calculated to be 85 25 gm³ with the contributions of 43 8 rice 40 0 wheat and 16 2 maize iwp and ie from the crop consumption perspective in all provinces were different from that observed from production perspective and the effect of crop supply demand mismatch on irrigation wue was comprehensive virtual water flow was conducive to water resource conservation and irrigation wue improvement when judged by iwp however the result was just the opposite when ie was used as the evaluation improving iwp in the north china plain and southeast and optimizing trade structure in northeast and southwest contribute to national irrigation water conservation from both of the production and consumption perspectives the evaluation framework proposed in current paper can inspire the research on agricultural water assessment management and regulation combining the physical and virtual water keywords virtual water irrigation efficiency water productivity agricultural water management food security china 1 introduction water and food shortages are systemic risks globally in the context of rapid population growth and economic development and environmental change hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 since the crops yield can be significantly increased by irrigation developing countries increase food production mainly by expanding the irrigation area and water extraction nazari et al 2018 reducing water input water saving irrigation through irrigation water use efficiency wue improvement contributed to regional food supply economic development and social progress rosa et al 2020 cao et al 2021 therefore efficient management strategies construction based on agricultural water use performance clarity from the both crop production and consumption perspectives was concerned in modern water resources management ngo et al 2018 cao et al 2020a kheir et al 2021 in general irrigation water use iwu is the total amount of water withdrawal from water intake or reservoir into the irrigation system during the whole crop season which is also known as gross irrigation water requirement segovia cardozo et al 2019 part of iwu is lost in the form of water surface evaporation and canal seepage in the process of water transmission and distribution and the other part is delivered into farmland and consumed in the form of field crop evapotranspiration boonwichai pushpalatha et al 2018 2020 the former is called irrigation water loss iwl and the latter irrigation water consumption iwc or blue water consumption bwc ventrella et al 2018 nouri et al 2020 the indices irrigation efficiency ie and irrigation water productivity iwp were used to evaluate the irrigation wue in irrigation facility and agricultural water management practice ie is defined as the proportion of irrigation water consumed in the form of field crop evapotranspiration to total water withdrawal and iwp refers to the crop yield obtained by per unit irrigation water input playán and mateos 2006 xue et al 2018 cao et al 2020b obviously ie evaluates the effective utilization rate and iwp represents the output capacity of the water resources concerned because of the complexity of agricultural hydrological cycle the definition and quantification of agricultural iwu and its efficiency evaluation indexes based on the water balance principle were the main research contents of irrigation water assessment from the crop production perspective jensen 2007 canone et al 2015 on this basis scholars have carried out a large number of researches on irrigation method optimization scott et al 2014 ding et al 2021 irrigation technology improvement multsch et al 2017 golabi et al 2020 and irrigation strategy formulation grafton et al 2018 jha et al 2019 with the purpose of improving ie and iwp at multiple scales in addition the response of environmental change to irrigation wue exploration provided comprehensive information for regional irrigation development and water resources regulation fader et al 2016 wu et al 2021 because of inter regional agricultural products trade and commutation water resources used in crop cultivation process are not always consumed by the inhabitants in the region bazrafshan et al 2020 this involves water balance from a consumption perspective and redistribution of product and water resources among regions in the form of virtual water shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 bazrafshan et al 2020 virtual water of a crop product could be defined as the amount of water per unit of product that is or that would be consumed during crop cycle siebert and döll 2010 bae and dall erba 2018 cai et al 2019 the water resources flow among regions along with the agricultural products trade was called virtual water trade or flow lamastra et al 2017 zhai et al 2021 virtual water flow links the three stages of crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes thus providing a new perspective for water resource performance evaluation on the basis of inter regional virtual water flow quantity accounting a large number of studies on water resource conservation water shortage alleviation and regional industrial layout have been conducted by scholars in the field of water and environment managem wue of the virtual water export region is higher than that of the import region the virtual water flow not only saves water resources for its import region but also contributes to water saving at the national global scale liu et al 2019 in other words the virtual water flow can reduce the water resource scarcity in the import area while it carries the risk of exacerbating the water shortage in the export region therefore agricultural wue promotion qian et al 2019 gao et al 2020 crop planting structure reformation mojtabavi et al 2018 caro et al 2021 and virtual water flow network optimization ye et al 2018 d odorico et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 coupling the processes of crop production and consumption were considered to be effective measures for regional sustainable utilization of water resources achievement the primary and effective measure for regional water saving and water scarcity alleviating in virtue of virtual water flow is to improve the wue indices in the crop cultivation stage however almost all of the existing researches focusing on virtual water flow and its water management implications evaluated water resource use and efficiency based on field crop water consumption estimation comprehensive information could not be provided for separating the water performance of its distribution and consumption processes this is the knowledge gap between virtual water flow and agricultural water management in the crop system equipped irrigation the purposes of this paper are 1 establishing an assessment framework for irrigation performance coupling physical water use and virtual water flow 2 analyzing the spatial and temporal pattern of cereals iwu and its efficiency of china in 2018 and 3 exploring the efficiency performance of water resources coupling crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes and its implications for irrigation and water management 2 methods and data 2 1 irrigation water use efficiency in crop cultivation the indices iwp and ie were calculated for regional irrigation wue assessment iwp in specific crop cultivation is defined as the regional crop product per unit of total irrigation water resources input in current study 1 iwp pro iwu where pro is crop production harvested from cropland in kg and iwu the total irrigation water use in m³ iwu consists of field water evapotranspiration and water loss at the transfer stage 2 iwu iwc ie iwc in eq 2 is the irrigation water consumption via field evapotranspiration regional ie is decided by the condition of irrigation facilities and iwc by crop water requirement and irrigation scale 3 iwc i wr ia where iwr is the crop irrigation water requirement in m and ia the irrigation area in m2 iwr could be quantified as follows 4 iwr et c p e 5 et c k c et 0 where etc is filed crop evapotranspiration in mm pe effective precipitation during crop season in mm kc the crop coefﬁcient dimensionless and et0 the reference crop evapotranspiration in mm pe and et0 could be estimated by the fao cropwat 8 0 model cao et al 2020b regional iwp for integrated cereal iwpcereal is weighted by crop production of wheat maize and rice 6 iwp cereal pro wheat pro maize pro rice iwu wheat iwu maize iwu rice in this calculation prowheat promaize and prorice are amount of wheat maize and rice production in kg and iwuwheat iwumaize and iwurice are irrigation water use for wheat maize and paddy rice cultivation in m³ respectively 2 2 irrigation water use efficiency from the consumption perspective irrigation water productivity from the consumption perspective iwp refers to crop consumption per unit irrigation water use in a specific region and calculated as 7 iwp con iwu where con is the amount of crop product consumed by the inhabitants in the observed region in kg iwu the irrigation water used for the crop product consumed in the region con and iwu could be quantified as follows 8 con pro tra 9 iwu iwu viwf where tra in kg and viwf in m³ are crop trade and virtual irrigation water flow among regions respectively tra and viwf are positive for crop and virtual water exporter and negative for crop and virtual water importer inter provincial trade matrices for cereal crop wheat maize and rice in 2018 were determined by using a linear programming optimization procedure assuming that inter provincial trade flows are such that the overall transport cost of trade is minimized dalin et al 2014 the estimation process of tra among provinces of china was expounded in detail in zhuo et al 2019 inter regional ivwf is calculated by multiplying the related crop trade tra with the irrigation water use for per unit crop product iwup in the exporting region 10 viwf tra iwup iwup in eq 10 is the reciprocal of iwp in the same way irrigation efficiency from the consumption perspective may also be changed due to crop and virtual water flow 11 ie iwe iwu where ie is regional irrigation efficiency quantified from the consumption perspective dimensionless iwe and iwu are irrigation water evapotranspiration and irrigation water use for crop product consumed in the observed region iwe are calculated as eqs 12 and 13 for the crop export and import regions respectively as follows 12 iwe ie iwu viwf 13 iwe iwu ie ie exp viwf where ieexp is irrigation efficiency of the crop export region hence regional irrigation wue indices for integrated cereal could be calculated as 14 i wp con wheat con maize con rice iwu wheat iwu maize iwu rice 15 ie iwe wheat iwe maize iwe rice iwu wheat iwu maize iwu rice based on the indices quantitation the effect of integrated cereal production and consumption dislocation on irrigation wue could be assessed by constructing the following coefficients 16 k iwp iwp 17 q ie ie k and q dimensionless are used for evaluating the effect of virtual water flow on region irrigation productivity and irrigation efficiency respectively k 1 or q 1 indicates that the irrigation wue from the consumption perspective is higher than that from the production perspective in other words the provinces with high wue provide cereal and virtual water to the ones with low wue on the contrary the provinces with high wue obtain cereals and virtual water from the regions with low wue and the virtual water flow reduces the regional irrigation water utilization efficiency 2 3 data resource cereals rice wheat and maize in the 31 provinces fig 1 of mainland of china in the year 2018 were selected for irrigation wue performance assessment in our study meteorological data for iwc estimation were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn provincial ie for irrigated cropland was collected from the china water resources bulletins 2018 the amount of regional crop sow area and production and population were supplied by the china statistical yearbook in 2019 in order to analyze conveniently the 31 provinces were divided into five subregions in fig 1 according to geographic location climatic condition and crop cultivation structure cereals area ranged from 8 9 in northwest to 31 6 m ha in north china plain field cereals evapotranspiration in south china southeast and southwest was around 420 mm which was low than that of 550 mm in other three north subregions crop yield for integrated cereal fallen between 5 0 and 6 0 t ha in all of the subregions except northwest 4 6 t ha 3 results 3 1 irrigation water use efficiency from the production perspective the national pro iwu and iwp of integrated cereals were estimated to be 488 1 mt 268 89 gm³ and 1 815 kg m³ in the observed year wheat maize and rice contributed 23 6 36 3 and 40 1 respectively to crop production of integrated cereal in china cereal iwu varied greatly among region which exceeded 20 gm³ in henan jiangsu heilongjiang and hunan was below 0 5 gm³ in beijing qinghai and tibet iwu and iwp values of the three specific crops in 31 provinces of the country in 2018 were listed in the table 1 the national iwu for paddy rice planting in the observed year was estimated to be 157 95 gm³ accounting for 58 7 of the cereals total rice was the crop with the largest irrigation water resources occupation of in the country however the iwp of rice was only 1 239 kg m³ which was significantly lower than that of wheat and maize table 1 shows that iwu and iwp varied among provinces and subregions for each crop most of the provinces with great iwu for maize and wheat were found in the north china plain and the ones hold rice iwu greater than 10 gm³ concentrated the southwest specifically 16 46 gm³ irrigation water was used for wheat production in henan accounting for 23 2 of the national total and ranking first in all provinces maize iwu in shandong was calculated to be the largest close to 5 00 gm³ the regional difference of rice iwu was greater than that of the previous two crops it was close to 23 00 gm³ in hunan and less than 0 01 in tibet iwp of the three crops showed the same spatial pattern that the south was higher than the north wheat iwp in yunnan and chongqing in southwest china was 3 989 and 3 774 kg m³ respectively and in all of the other provinces was less than 3 000 kg m³ the index in xinjiang was only 0 588 kg m³ which was the lowest value in china the range of maize iwp was 1 550 9 344 kg m³ which was wider than that of wheat and rice maize iwp of guizhou and sichuan exceeded 8 000 kg m³ followed by the values above 7 000 kg m³ in beijing and jiangxi the highest iwp of paddy rice was 2 788 kg m³ and found in chongqing it ranged from 1 000 to 2 000 kg m³ in most provinces 21 iwp is jointly determined by multiple factors such as crop yield irrigation water requirement irrigated area and irrigation efficiency almost no irrigation water was required in most areas of china which made uncertain and variable of maize iwp for example irrigation water requirement of maize was 51 8 mm in beijing the province with highest irrigation efficiency in china in contrast while irrigation water requirement of neighboring provinces tianjin and hebei exceeded 100 mm as a result the iwp of maize in beijing was significantly higher than that in other provinces of north china plain in the observed year with about one third of the area located in the humid yangtze river basin shaanxi received more than 600 mm of precipitation resulting in higher iwp for wheat and rice than other northwest provinces annual precipitation was less than 200 mm in xinjiang the driest region in the country the high crop irrigation water requirement and low irrigation efficiency resulted in low iwp in cereals production provincial iwp and ie for integrated cereal in the year 2018 from the production perspective were mapped in fig 2 fig 2 shows that cereal iwp presents a distribution characteristics of spatial aggregation to be specific the iwp for integrated cereal in shaanxi was about 3 793 kg m³ ranking the highest in china it also exceeded 3 000 kg m³ in shanxi chongqing beijing and yunnan in addition iwp another 11 provinces was higher than the national value of 1 815 kg m³ mostly located in the north china plain and its surrounding areas it bellowed 1 000 kg m³ in five provinces and was only 0 767 kg m³ in xinjiang different from iwp the spatial distribution of ie was decentralized it is generally high in the eastern coastal and low in the central and southern provinces national ie was 0 494 indicating that more than half of irrigation water withdrawal was not consumed in the form of field crop evapotranspiration ie in beijing was 0 665 which was the highest among the 31 provinces in addition the ie of other13 provinces was higher than the national value 0 494 of which gansu tianjin liaoning and jilin exceed 0 560 ie in most 19 provinces fall in between 0 46 and 0 56 the low values of ie were 0 447 0 423 0 417 and 0 379 and found in guangxi jiangxi ningxia and inner mongolia respectively it was illustrated in fig 2 that beijing liaoning jilin and shandong had high iwp and ie while both of the indices in fujian hainan guangdong and guangxi needed to be improved 3 2 irrigation water use efficiency from the consumption perspective iwu iwp and ie were different from those iwp and ie presented in section 3 1 due to the variation of crop trade and irrigation water efficiency fig 2 among provinces national viwf was estimated to be 85 25 gm³ and accounted for 31 7 of iwu all of the provinces participated in the inter provincial cereals commutation and virtual water flow regional iwu for cereal crops in 2018 were listed in table 2 the iwu of north china plain and southeast was about 80 00 gm³ which was higher than that of other subregions significantly it can be seen from table 2 that iwu of each specific crop varied among provinces iwu wheat had a maximum value of 6 41 gm³ in sichuan it was no more than 5 00 gm³ in other provinces except the shandong and henan on the contrary irrigation water appropriation of wheat in tianjin beijing and hainan from the consumption perspective was less than 0 50 gm³ iwu maize in henan was calculated to be 3 26 gm³ accounting for about 8 of the country s value there were four provinces held an iwu maize less than 0 50 gm³ of which beijing was the lowest 0 12 gm³ in the country the highest provincial iwu rice was13 35 gm³ and found in guangdong hunan and jiangsu also issued a large amount of iwu rice which were 13 08 and 12 53 gm³ respectively from the perspective of integrated cereal guangdong occupied the greatest irrigation water in china and followed by 18 02 gm³ in hunan and 17 56 gm³ in henan the iwu of jiangsu sichuan and shandong was also higher than 15 00 gm³ the top six provinces together held about 38 0 of china s irrigation water resources through cereals consumption in contrast ningxia hainan and tianjin were the provinces with the least irrigation water consumption in the country population size and dietary structure rather than crop sowing scale are the main determinants of iwu the populations of guangdong shandong and henan provinces were around 100 million in 2018 surpassing most countries in the world jiangsu and sichuan also had population more than 80 million hunan s population though only 65 million was smaller than that of the preceding provinces however this province lies in south of the yangtze river and its residents depend on the high irrigation demand rice as staple food this is the main reason for hunan s great iwu inter regional cereal crops exchange and virtual water flow resulted the spatial pattern of iwu cereal at the provincial scale at the same time the iwp and ie formed along with the crop exchange and virtual water flow the indices iwp and ie for integrated cereal in each province in the study year are plotted in fig 3 the spatial pattern of irrigation wue indices from the consumption perspective shown in fig 3 is different from that from the production perspective shown in fig 2 indicating that the dislocation of grain production and demand among regions had an impact on the irrigation water utilization performances provinces with high iwp clustered in southwest china and ones with low values were distributed in southeast coastal and northwest inland areas the maximum iwp was 3 203 kg m³ and occurred in chongqing chongqing was the only province with iwp greater than 3 000 kg m³ guizhou and yunnan in the southwest had high iwp values of 2 653 and 2 558 kg m³ respectively in addition iwp exceeded 2 000 kg m³ in another five provinces including hubei shaanxi sichuan xizang and henan this index in all of the rest provinces and regions was ranged 1 000 2 000 kg m³ unlike the iwp no province with iwp lower than 1 000 kg m³ were found it is revealed in fig 3 b that almost all the provinces with high ie are located in the northern coastal areas while the ones with low ie are scattered the highest value of ie was 0 558 which was found in jiangsu and was significantly lower than the maximum value of 0 665 for ie the ie of tianjin jilin and liaoning are 0 556 0 555 and 0 552 respectively which are very close to that of jiangsu this index in most 23 provinces ranged from 0 450 to 0 550 low ie values below 0 450 were found in xizang jiangxi inner mongolia and ningxia the spatial difference of both irrigation water productivity and irrigation efficiency from the consumption perspective of was smaller than that from the production perspective it shows that the exchange of cereal and virtual water narrows the gap of irrigation wue among provinces how it changes the irrigation wue in specific provinces needs to be further analyzed in the following paragraphs 3 3 effect of virtual water flow on irrigation water use efficiency the volume of cereals trade among china s provinces was 164 2 mt in 2018 accounting for about one third of the national crop output the exchange amount of wheat maize and rice were 53 8 64 6 and 45 8 mt respectively the total viwf in the country was estimated to be approximately 85 25 gm³ including 34 14 gm³ of wheat 13 81 gm³ of maize and 37 30 gm³ of rice viwf for the three crop among provinces is shown in figs 4 and 5 as demonstrated in fig 4 that heilongjiang s net cereal virtual irrigation water export reached up to 9 72 gm³ ranking the greatest in the country this value was significantly higher than that of the other 10 provinces with net virtual irrigation water export the minimum amount of net cereals virtual irrigation water export was 0 36 gm³ and was found in the ningxia with small crop planting scale on the other hand guangdong had the largest net crop virtual irrigation water import at 7 53 gm³ of the country followed by 5 28 gm³ in sichuan it can also be seen from fig 4 that virtual irrigation water import for one or more crops could be calculated in all of the net virtual water export provinces heilongjiang contributed a mass of irrigation water to the external region through rice and maize and deprived of it by wheat imports from other provinces henan shandong and xinjiang were the main virtual irrigation water exporting regions in wheat and the main importing regions of rice together the three provinces exported 70 8 of wheat and 35 1 of rice virtual irrigation water hunan and jiangxi exported plentiful irrigation water through rice trade and were compensated through wheat and maize import anhui and jiangsu were the provinces with surplus rice and wheat while there is also a small amount of maize virtual irrigation water resources import virtual water export was found in 12 virtual irrigation water net import provinces and they exchanged irrigation water resources with the outside hebei exported nearly 54 00 gm³ of irrigation water in form of wheat and maize contribution and also introduced a considerable amount of irrigation water from external due to rice trade guangxi and inner mongolia had a similar situation the different from hebei province was the difference in dominant crops the awareness of viwf characteristics and its direction for specific crops combining figs 4 and 5 is conducive to understand the reasons for the irrigation wue change effected by inter provincial virtual water trade the volume of virtual irrigation water export for wheat in henan reached up to 11 30 gm³ much higher than that of any other provinces these viwfs mainly to guangdong 4 22 gm³ hunan 2 93 gm³ and guangxi 2 08 gm³ shandong and xinjiang contributed 6 62 and 6 24 gm³ virtual irrigation water respectively in the form of wheat export the dominate import province of wheat virtual irrigation water from shandong was zhejiang with 2 14 gm³ in addition shandong provided irrigation water in the form of wheat for the residents of guzhou chongqing hubei jilin and liaoning xinjiang s wheat virtual irrigation water was mainly supplied for southwest provinces such as sichuan 3 89 gm³ and yunnan 1 43 gm³ the maximum amount of wheat virtual irrigation water import was 4 22 gm³ found in guangdong and sichuan the greatest export of virtual irrigation water for maize was 2 97 gm³ in heilongjiang followed by 2 48 gm³ in jilin and 2 12 gm³ in shandong maize irrigation water of these three provinces flowed to 14 provinces including hunan guangdong zhejiang and yunnan the peak value of maize virtual irrigation water inflow of was 1 91 gm³ of sichuan which was jointly supplied by hebei shaanxi and shanxi the export of rice virtual irrigation water in hunan and heilongjiang was estimated to be 8 91 and 8 11 gm³ respectively which was obviously higher than that in any other virtual water flow routes the former flow to the most populous provinces henan and guangdong and the northwest provinces shanxi gansu qinghai ningxia and xinjiang the latter mainly meets the rice consumption of beijing tianjin hebei shanxi inner mongolia and other northern provinces the volume of virtual irrigation water export for rice in jiangxi and jiangsu located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin was 5 98 and 4 57 gm³ respectively making significant contributions to the rice consumption in china shandong hebei and henan contributed 46 4 of the rice virtual water inflow which was mainly provided by heilongjiang jiangxi jiangsu hunan and hubei the residents in the net virtual water import area consumed cereal both local and external and the irrigation water utilization efficiency from consumption perspective will not be equal to the value from the production perspective in other words the virtual water flow changes the irrigation wue in the net virtual water inflow regions the evaluation indices k and q for effect of virtual water trade on irrigation wue are shown in fig 6 the indicators k and q quantified the influence of virtual water flow on regional irrigation wue through the production and consumption perspectives compassion so as to judge the rationality of virtual water flow network k and q above 1 000 indicating that the goal of water saving irrigation has been achieved through the redistribution of agricultural products among regions instead it is necessary to improve irrigation wue indices water productivity and irrigation efficiency in crop export area the provincial mean values of k and q were calculated to be 1 068 and 0 983 respectively in the observed year in general the spatial pattern of irrigation water productivity in china was conducive to water use from the perspective of virtual water flow while irrigation efficiency was not fig 6 illustrated that k values of 14 provinces 8 of which are located in southeast were high than 1 000 signifying the iwp from the consumption perspective was higher than that from the production perspective most of the provinces in each subregion held a k less than 1 000 except the southeast the highest k value was 1 890 and calculated in qinghai this indicator in fujian guangdong shanghai hainan and xizang was above 1 500 there were other 7 provinces with k higher than 1 000 including hunan xinjiang guangxi jiangsu jiangsu hebei and anhui k value in beijing which was 0 422 ranking the lowest of the 31 provinces beijing was also the only province with a k value no more than 0 500 about half 16 of the provinces had a q value above 1 000 and the irrigation efficiency from the consumption perspective was higher than that from the production perspective unlike the indicator of k the value of q in all provinces hovered around 1 000 the highest q value in the country was 1 136 found in inner mongolia which was the only record higher than 1 100 in the other hand provinces with a q value less than 0 900 include qinghai tibet and beijing among them beijing has the lowest value which is 0 811 therefore beijing s grain irrigation wue was the most mismatched with china s virtual water flow network k and q values of jiangxi zhejiang guangxi hainan hunan fujian guangdong anhui were both higher than 1 000 the number of provinces with these parameters less than 1 000 is 10 the effect of virtual water flow on irrigation water productivity was greater than irrigation efficiency 4 discussion crop commutation harmonizes the contradiction between overproduction and consumption gap and causes the redistribution of cereals and irrigation water resources which may also change the spatial distribution of wue indices virtual water flow is a medium to link the irrigation water utilization efficiency in the crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes the complexity of agricultural virtual water flow network and wue performance increase when multiple crops are observed therefore it is necessary to evaluate irrigation water use and efficiency from the perspectives of cereals cultivation commutation and consumption processes different from rain green water the utilization and efficiency of irrigation water blue water are directly affected by human factors the iwu and its efficiency are jointly determined by the of water delivery and distribution measures in the water intake stage and the field irrigation techniques methods in the crop planting stage this fact should also be noted when assessment the effect of virtual water flow on water resources irrigation efficiency and irrigation water productivity show different spatial patterns frequently cao et al 2020b fig 2 existing researches on agricultural water performance based on virtual water only evaluates the water consumption in the field lamastra et al 2017 rosa et al 2020 without considering the water distribution process this may result the significance of irrigation efficiency an evaluation index of water saving irrigation technology ignored in other words it may not be able to obtain comprehensive information to evaluate water resources utilization in virtue of virtual water based on field water productivity reciprocal value of water footprint per unit crop product alone and to conduct research on water resources management strategies the research results of this paper related to the impact of virtual water flow on irrigation wue indices fig 6 support this view irrigation wue indices for the cereals involved in inter provincial virtual water flow were calculated and listed in table 3 in order to clearly illustrate this point it was calculated that the irrigation water productivity of the integrated cereal involved in virtual water commutation was 1 926 kg m³ higher than the national value of 1 815 kg m³ in crop production in other words cereal was transported from the provinces with relatively high irrigation water productivity to the provinces with low irrigation water productivity taking irrigation water productivity reciprocal value of blue water footprint per unit crop product as the evaluation index this redistribution pattern of cereal was conducive to the improvement of water saving benefits and water utilization efficiency at the national scale on the other hand the irrigation efficiency of the integrated cereal involved in virtual water trade was 0 489 which was than the national average of 0 494 in crop cultivation cereals was exported from relatively low irrigation efficiency provinces to high ones taking irrigation efficiency as the evaluation index this redistribution pattern of grain and water resources utilization increased irrigation water withdrawals and decreased irrigation water efficiency the opposite conclusions are obtained using irrigation efficiency and water productivity as judgments in fact the results of this paper partially show that such differences exist not only among indexes but also among crops and regions hence it is not only meaningful but also innovative to analyze the performance of wue in the whole process of crop cultivation commutation and consumption based on total irrigation water use quantification therefore it is of great reference value to discuss agricultural water management strategies based on the results of this study virtual water flow has a unique influence on irrigation wue due to the variation of natural conditions dominant products dietary structure and irrigation development among regions at the same time the viwf network has certain differences among the three specific crops which also contributed to the impact of virtual water flow on the water efficiency indices all these results are the basis for of irrigation development and agricultural water management strategies discussion table 3 shows that the iwp 4 674 kg m³ and ie 0 503 of maize involved in virtual water commutation were higher than the national values from the production perspective 4 424 kg m³and 0 494 while the situations were opposite for wheat and rice the wue change was complex at the provincial scale therefore agricultural water conservation management strategies should be explored looking at the irrigation water use and efficiency assessment of specific crop in a given province over the crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes virtual water flow did not improve irrigation wue from the consumption perspective in the main grain producing regions of the north china plain anhui hebei henan jiangsu and shandong which was mainly attributed to low irrigation wue fig 2 and large cereals and water consumption demand these provinces should improve irrigation water productivity and expand the external contribution moderately by increasing crop yield the k and q values in southeast china were both greater than 1 000 fig 6 due to the low irrigation wue fig 2 therefore it is urgent for this subregion to improve the irrigation water efficiency especially the irrigation water productivity by increasing the yield per unit area and reducing the water conveyance loss the four provinces in the northeast exported amount of maize and imported irrigation water resources through wheat fig 4 which reduced the irrigation wue significantly compared the consumption stage to crop planting stage in addition virtual water flow reduced crop irrigation water productivity in the southwest where hardly provided grain for external regions the provinces located northeast and southwest may optimizing the trade structure and choose to import grain from areas with high wue or the foreign countries to provide water saving irrigation services on a national scale irrigation wue evaluation indexes from the crop consumption perspective were lower than that from the production perspective fig 6 in the municipalities beijing shanghai and tianjin with small agricultural production scale and developed economy these regions import virtual irrigation water and do not provide grain to the outside fig 4 therefore improving irrigation wue in the provinces has no considerable practical significance and not to be recommended 5 conclusion irrigation water performance in crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes based on the inter regional virtual water flows measurement hence the establishment of wue assessment combined virtual water flow and irrigation water distribution efficiency was the contribution of this study the amount of total iwu in china s cereals production in 2018 was about 268 89 gm³ 31 7 of which was involved in inter provincial virtual water flow the effect of inter provincial virtual water flow on national ie was contrary to iwp it promoted water saving irrigation in china judging by iwp however the misalignment of cereal production and requirement increased the irrigation water loss in distribution and thus wastes water spatially irrigation wue was reduced in north and promoted in south compared cereal production to consumption perspectives improving water efficiency and optimizing crop commutation structure are reliable for irrigation water regulation coupling physical with virtual water especially in the major grain producing areas located in north china the quantitative assessment of agricultural water saving potential based on the whole process of crop cultivation commutation and consumption should be paid more attention in future studies declaration of competing

9725,water use and efficiency assessment from crop production consumption process provided a new perspective for regional agricultural water management an evaluation framework of water use efficiency wue coupling crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes was established in this paper the impact of virtual water flow on provincial irrigation water use efficiency and its implications for irrigation management were assessed based on the inter provincial virtual irrigation water flow viwf estimation for cereals of china the results showed that national iwu iwp and ie for cereal production in 2018 were 268 89 gm³ 1 815 m³ kg and 0 494 respectively total viwf among 31 provinces was calculated to be 85 25 gm³ with the contributions of 43 8 rice 40 0 wheat and 16 2 maize iwp and ie from the crop consumption perspective in all provinces were different from that observed from production perspective and the effect of crop supply demand mismatch on irrigation wue was comprehensive virtual water flow was conducive to water resource conservation and irrigation wue improvement when judged by iwp however the result was just the opposite when ie was used as the evaluation improving iwp in the north china plain and southeast and optimizing trade structure in northeast and southwest contribute to national irrigation water conservation from both of the production and consumption perspectives the evaluation framework proposed in current paper can inspire the research on agricultural water assessment management and regulation combining the physical and virtual water keywords virtual water irrigation efficiency water productivity agricultural water management food security china 1 introduction water and food shortages are systemic risks globally in the context of rapid population growth and economic development and environmental change hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 since the crops yield can be significantly increased by irrigation developing countries increase food production mainly by expanding the irrigation area and water extraction nazari et al 2018 reducing water input water saving irrigation through irrigation water use efficiency wue improvement contributed to regional food supply economic development and social progress rosa et al 2020 cao et al 2021 therefore efficient management strategies construction based on agricultural water use performance clarity from the both crop production and consumption perspectives was concerned in modern water resources management ngo et al 2018 cao et al 2020a kheir et al 2021 in general irrigation water use iwu is the total amount of water withdrawal from water intake or reservoir into the irrigation system during the whole crop season which is also known as gross irrigation water requirement segovia cardozo et al 2019 part of iwu is lost in the form of water surface evaporation and canal seepage in the process of water transmission and distribution and the other part is delivered into farmland and consumed in the form of field crop evapotranspiration boonwichai pushpalatha et al 2018 2020 the former is called irrigation water loss iwl and the latter irrigation water consumption iwc or blue water consumption bwc ventrella et al 2018 nouri et al 2020 the indices irrigation efficiency ie and irrigation water productivity iwp were used to evaluate the irrigation wue in irrigation facility and agricultural water management practice ie is defined as the proportion of irrigation water consumed in the form of field crop evapotranspiration to total water withdrawal and iwp refers to the crop yield obtained by per unit irrigation water input playán and mateos 2006 xue et al 2018 cao et al 2020b obviously ie evaluates the effective utilization rate and iwp represents the output capacity of the water resources concerned because of the complexity of agricultural hydrological cycle the definition and quantification of agricultural iwu and its efficiency evaluation indexes based on the water balance principle were the main research contents of irrigation water assessment from the crop production perspective jensen 2007 canone et al 2015 on this basis scholars have carried out a large number of researches on irrigation method optimization scott et al 2014 ding et al 2021 irrigation technology improvement multsch et al 2017 golabi et al 2020 and irrigation strategy formulation grafton et al 2018 jha et al 2019 with the purpose of improving ie and iwp at multiple scales in addition the response of environmental change to irrigation wue exploration provided comprehensive information for regional irrigation development and water resources regulation fader et al 2016 wu et al 2021 because of inter regional agricultural products trade and commutation water resources used in crop cultivation process are not always consumed by the inhabitants in the region bazrafshan et al 2020 this involves water balance from a consumption perspective and redistribution of product and water resources among regions in the form of virtual water shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 bazrafshan et al 2020 virtual water of a crop product could be defined as the amount of water per unit of product that is or that would be consumed during crop cycle siebert and döll 2010 bae and dall erba 2018 cai et al 2019 the water resources flow among regions along with the agricultural products trade was called virtual water trade or flow lamastra et al 2017 zhai et al 2021 virtual water flow links the three stages of crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes thus providing a new perspective for water resource performance evaluation on the basis of inter regional virtual water flow quantity accounting a large number of studies on water resource conservation water shortage alleviation and regional industrial layout have been conducted by scholars in the field of water and environment managem wue of the virtual water export region is higher than that of the import region the virtual water flow not only saves water resources for its import region but also contributes to water saving at the national global scale liu et al 2019 in other words the virtual water flow can reduce the water resource scarcity in the import area while it carries the risk of exacerbating the water shortage in the export region therefore agricultural wue promotion qian et al 2019 gao et al 2020 crop planting structure reformation mojtabavi et al 2018 caro et al 2021 and virtual water flow network optimization ye et al 2018 d odorico et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 coupling the processes of crop production and consumption were considered to be effective measures for regional sustainable utilization of water resources achievement the primary and effective measure for regional water saving and water scarcity alleviating in virtue of virtual water flow is to improve the wue indices in the crop cultivation stage however almost all of the existing researches focusing on virtual water flow and its water management implications evaluated water resource use and efficiency based on field crop water consumption estimation comprehensive information could not be provided for separating the water performance of its distribution and consumption processes this is the knowledge gap between virtual water flow and agricultural water management in the crop system equipped irrigation the purposes of this paper are 1 establishing an assessment framework for irrigation performance coupling physical water use and virtual water flow 2 analyzing the spatial and temporal pattern of cereals iwu and its efficiency of china in 2018 and 3 exploring the efficiency performance of water resources coupling crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes and its implications for irrigation and water management 2 methods and data 2 1 irrigation water use efficiency in crop cultivation the indices iwp and ie were calculated for regional irrigation wue assessment iwp in specific crop cultivation is defined as the regional crop product per unit of total irrigation water resources input in current study 1 iwp pro iwu where pro is crop production harvested from cropland in kg and iwu the total irrigation water use in m³ iwu consists of field water evapotranspiration and water loss at the transfer stage 2 iwu iwc ie iwc in eq 2 is the irrigation water consumption via field evapotranspiration regional ie is decided by the condition of irrigation facilities and iwc by crop water requirement and irrigation scale 3 iwc i wr ia where iwr is the crop irrigation water requirement in m and ia the irrigation area in m2 iwr could be quantified as follows 4 iwr et c p e 5 et c k c et 0 where etc is filed crop evapotranspiration in mm pe effective precipitation during crop season in mm kc the crop coefﬁcient dimensionless and et0 the reference crop evapotranspiration in mm pe and et0 could be estimated by the fao cropwat 8 0 model cao et al 2020b regional iwp for integrated cereal iwpcereal is weighted by crop production of wheat maize and rice 6 iwp cereal pro wheat pro maize pro rice iwu wheat iwu maize iwu rice in this calculation prowheat promaize and prorice are amount of wheat maize and rice production in kg and iwuwheat iwumaize and iwurice are irrigation water use for wheat maize and paddy rice cultivation in m³ respectively 2 2 irrigation water use efficiency from the consumption perspective irrigation water productivity from the consumption perspective iwp refers to crop consumption per unit irrigation water use in a specific region and calculated as 7 iwp con iwu where con is the amount of crop product consumed by the inhabitants in the observed region in kg iwu the irrigation water used for the crop product consumed in the region con and iwu could be quantified as follows 8 con pro tra 9 iwu iwu viwf where tra in kg and viwf in m³ are crop trade and virtual irrigation water flow among regions respectively tra and viwf are positive for crop and virtual water exporter and negative for crop and virtual water importer inter provincial trade matrices for cereal crop wheat maize and rice in 2018 were determined by using a linear programming optimization procedure assuming that inter provincial trade flows are such that the overall transport cost of trade is minimized dalin et al 2014 the estimation process of tra among provinces of china was expounded in detail in zhuo et al 2019 inter regional ivwf is calculated by multiplying the related crop trade tra with the irrigation water use for per unit crop product iwup in the exporting region 10 viwf tra iwup iwup in eq 10 is the reciprocal of iwp in the same way irrigation efficiency from the consumption perspective may also be changed due to crop and virtual water flow 11 ie iwe iwu where ie is regional irrigation efficiency quantified from the consumption perspective dimensionless iwe and iwu are irrigation water evapotranspiration and irrigation water use for crop product consumed in the observed region iwe are calculated as eqs 12 and 13 for the crop export and import regions respectively as follows 12 iwe ie iwu viwf 13 iwe iwu ie ie exp viwf where ieexp is irrigation efficiency of the crop export region hence regional irrigation wue indices for integrated cereal could be calculated as 14 i wp con wheat con maize con rice iwu wheat iwu maize iwu rice 15 ie iwe wheat iwe maize iwe rice iwu wheat iwu maize iwu rice based on the indices quantitation the effect of integrated cereal production and consumption dislocation on irrigation wue could be assessed by constructing the following coefficients 16 k iwp iwp 17 q ie ie k and q dimensionless are used for evaluating the effect of virtual water flow on region irrigation productivity and irrigation efficiency respectively k 1 or q 1 indicates that the irrigation wue from the consumption perspective is higher than that from the production perspective in other words the provinces with high wue provide cereal and virtual water to the ones with low wue on the contrary the provinces with high wue obtain cereals and virtual water from the regions with low wue and the virtual water flow reduces the regional irrigation water utilization efficiency 2 3 data resource cereals rice wheat and maize in the 31 provinces fig 1 of mainland of china in the year 2018 were selected for irrigation wue performance assessment in our study meteorological data for iwc estimation were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn provincial ie for irrigated cropland was collected from the china water resources bulletins 2018 the amount of regional crop sow area and production and population were supplied by the china statistical yearbook in 2019 in order to analyze conveniently the 31 provinces were divided into five subregions in fig 1 according to geographic location climatic condition and crop cultivation structure cereals area ranged from 8 9 in northwest to 31 6 m ha in north china plain field cereals evapotranspiration in south china southeast and southwest was around 420 mm which was low than that of 550 mm in other three north subregions crop yield for integrated cereal fallen between 5 0 and 6 0 t ha in all of the subregions except northwest 4 6 t ha 3 results 3 1 irrigation water use efficiency from the production perspective the national pro iwu and iwp of integrated cereals were estimated to be 488 1 mt 268 89 gm³ and 1 815 kg m³ in the observed year wheat maize and rice contributed 23 6 36 3 and 40 1 respectively to crop production of integrated cereal in china cereal iwu varied greatly among region which exceeded 20 gm³ in henan jiangsu heilongjiang and hunan was below 0 5 gm³ in beijing qinghai and tibet iwu and iwp values of the three specific crops in 31 provinces of the country in 2018 were listed in the table 1 the national iwu for paddy rice planting in the observed year was estimated to be 157 95 gm³ accounting for 58 7 of the cereals total rice was the crop with the largest irrigation water resources occupation of in the country however the iwp of rice was only 1 239 kg m³ which was significantly lower than that of wheat and maize table 1 shows that iwu and iwp varied among provinces and subregions for each crop most of the provinces with great iwu for maize and wheat were found in the north china plain and the ones hold rice iwu greater than 10 gm³ concentrated the southwest specifically 16 46 gm³ irrigation water was used for wheat production in henan accounting for 23 2 of the national total and ranking first in all provinces maize iwu in shandong was calculated to be the largest close to 5 00 gm³ the regional difference of rice iwu was greater than that of the previous two crops it was close to 23 00 gm³ in hunan and less than 0 01 in tibet iwp of the three crops showed the same spatial pattern that the south was higher than the north wheat iwp in yunnan and chongqing in southwest china was 3 989 and 3 774 kg m³ respectively and in all of the other provinces was less than 3 000 kg m³ the index in xinjiang was only 0 588 kg m³ which was the lowest value in china the range of maize iwp was 1 550 9 344 kg m³ which was wider than that of wheat and rice maize iwp of guizhou and sichuan exceeded 8 000 kg m³ followed by the values above 7 000 kg m³ in beijing and jiangxi the highest iwp of paddy rice was 2 788 kg m³ and found in chongqing it ranged from 1 000 to 2 000 kg m³ in most provinces 21 iwp is jointly determined by multiple factors such as crop yield irrigation water requirement irrigated area and irrigation efficiency almost no irrigation water was required in most areas of china which made uncertain and variable of maize iwp for example irrigation water requirement of maize was 51 8 mm in beijing the province with highest irrigation efficiency in china in contrast while irrigation water requirement of neighboring provinces tianjin and hebei exceeded 100 mm as a result the iwp of maize in beijing was significantly higher than that in other provinces of north china plain in the observed year with about one third of the area located in the humid yangtze river basin shaanxi received more than 600 mm of precipitation resulting in higher iwp for wheat and rice than other northwest provinces annual precipitation was less than 200 mm in xinjiang the driest region in the country the high crop irrigation water requirement and low irrigation efficiency resulted in low iwp in cereals production provincial iwp and ie for integrated cereal in the year 2018 from the production perspective were mapped in fig 2 fig 2 shows that cereal iwp presents a distribution characteristics of spatial aggregation to be specific the iwp for integrated cereal in shaanxi was about 3 793 kg m³ ranking the highest in china it also exceeded 3 000 kg m³ in shanxi chongqing beijing and yunnan in addition iwp another 11 provinces was higher than the national value of 1 815 kg m³ mostly located in the north china plain and its surrounding areas it bellowed 1 000 kg m³ in five provinces and was only 0 767 kg m³ in xinjiang different from iwp the spatial distribution of ie was decentralized it is generally high in the eastern coastal and low in the central and southern provinces national ie was 0 494 indicating that more than half of irrigation water withdrawal was not consumed in the form of field crop evapotranspiration ie in beijing was 0 665 which was the highest among the 31 provinces in addition the ie of other13 provinces was higher than the national value 0 494 of which gansu tianjin liaoning and jilin exceed 0 560 ie in most 19 provinces fall in between 0 46 and 0 56 the low values of ie were 0 447 0 423 0 417 and 0 379 and found in guangxi jiangxi ningxia and inner mongolia respectively it was illustrated in fig 2 that beijing liaoning jilin and shandong had high iwp and ie while both of the indices in fujian hainan guangdong and guangxi needed to be improved 3 2 irrigation water use efficiency from the consumption perspective iwu iwp and ie were different from those iwp and ie presented in section 3 1 due to the variation of crop trade and irrigation water efficiency fig 2 among provinces national viwf was estimated to be 85 25 gm³ and accounted for 31 7 of iwu all of the provinces participated in the inter provincial cereals commutation and virtual water flow regional iwu for cereal crops in 2018 were listed in table 2 the iwu of north china plain and southeast was about 80 00 gm³ which was higher than that of other subregions significantly it can be seen from table 2 that iwu of each specific crop varied among provinces iwu wheat had a maximum value of 6 41 gm³ in sichuan it was no more than 5 00 gm³ in other provinces except the shandong and henan on the contrary irrigation water appropriation of wheat in tianjin beijing and hainan from the consumption perspective was less than 0 50 gm³ iwu maize in henan was calculated to be 3 26 gm³ accounting for about 8 of the country s value there were four provinces held an iwu maize less than 0 50 gm³ of which beijing was the lowest 0 12 gm³ in the country the highest provincial iwu rice was13 35 gm³ and found in guangdong hunan and jiangsu also issued a large amount of iwu rice which were 13 08 and 12 53 gm³ respectively from the perspective of integrated cereal guangdong occupied the greatest irrigation water in china and followed by 18 02 gm³ in hunan and 17 56 gm³ in henan the iwu of jiangsu sichuan and shandong was also higher than 15 00 gm³ the top six provinces together held about 38 0 of china s irrigation water resources through cereals consumption in contrast ningxia hainan and tianjin were the provinces with the least irrigation water consumption in the country population size and dietary structure rather than crop sowing scale are the main determinants of iwu the populations of guangdong shandong and henan provinces were around 100 million in 2018 surpassing most countries in the world jiangsu and sichuan also had population more than 80 million hunan s population though only 65 million was smaller than that of the preceding provinces however this province lies in south of the yangtze river and its residents depend on the high irrigation demand rice as staple food this is the main reason for hunan s great iwu inter regional cereal crops exchange and virtual water flow resulted the spatial pattern of iwu cereal at the provincial scale at the same time the iwp and ie formed along with the crop exchange and virtual water flow the indices iwp and ie for integrated cereal in each province in the study year are plotted in fig 3 the spatial pattern of irrigation wue indices from the consumption perspective shown in fig 3 is different from that from the production perspective shown in fig 2 indicating that the dislocation of grain production and demand among regions had an impact on the irrigation water utilization performances provinces with high iwp clustered in southwest china and ones with low values were distributed in southeast coastal and northwest inland areas the maximum iwp was 3 203 kg m³ and occurred in chongqing chongqing was the only province with iwp greater than 3 000 kg m³ guizhou and yunnan in the southwest had high iwp values of 2 653 and 2 558 kg m³ respectively in addition iwp exceeded 2 000 kg m³ in another five provinces including hubei shaanxi sichuan xizang and henan this index in all of the rest provinces and regions was ranged 1 000 2 000 kg m³ unlike the iwp no province with iwp lower than 1 000 kg m³ were found it is revealed in fig 3 b that almost all the provinces with high ie are located in the northern coastal areas while the ones with low ie are scattered the highest value of ie was 0 558 which was found in jiangsu and was significantly lower than the maximum value of 0 665 for ie the ie of tianjin jilin and liaoning are 0 556 0 555 and 0 552 respectively which are very close to that of jiangsu this index in most 23 provinces ranged from 0 450 to 0 550 low ie values below 0 450 were found in xizang jiangxi inner mongolia and ningxia the spatial difference of both irrigation water productivity and irrigation efficiency from the consumption perspective of was smaller than that from the production perspective it shows that the exchange of cereal and virtual water narrows the gap of irrigation wue among provinces how it changes the irrigation wue in specific provinces needs to be further analyzed in the following paragraphs 3 3 effect of virtual water flow on irrigation water use efficiency the volume of cereals trade among china s provinces was 164 2 mt in 2018 accounting for about one third of the national crop output the exchange amount of wheat maize and rice were 53 8 64 6 and 45 8 mt respectively the total viwf in the country was estimated to be approximately 85 25 gm³ including 34 14 gm³ of wheat 13 81 gm³ of maize and 37 30 gm³ of rice viwf for the three crop among provinces is shown in figs 4 and 5 as demonstrated in fig 4 that heilongjiang s net cereal virtual irrigation water export reached up to 9 72 gm³ ranking the greatest in the country this value was significantly higher than that of the other 10 provinces with net virtual irrigation water export the minimum amount of net cereals virtual irrigation water export was 0 36 gm³ and was found in the ningxia with small crop planting scale on the other hand guangdong had the largest net crop virtual irrigation water import at 7 53 gm³ of the country followed by 5 28 gm³ in sichuan it can also be seen from fig 4 that virtual irrigation water import for one or more crops could be calculated in all of the net virtual water export provinces heilongjiang contributed a mass of irrigation water to the external region through rice and maize and deprived of it by wheat imports from other provinces henan shandong and xinjiang were the main virtual irrigation water exporting regions in wheat and the main importing regions of rice together the three provinces exported 70 8 of wheat and 35 1 of rice virtual irrigation water hunan and jiangxi exported plentiful irrigation water through rice trade and were compensated through wheat and maize import anhui and jiangsu were the provinces with surplus rice and wheat while there is also a small amount of maize virtual irrigation water resources import virtual water export was found in 12 virtual irrigation water net import provinces and they exchanged irrigation water resources with the outside hebei exported nearly 54 00 gm³ of irrigation water in form of wheat and maize contribution and also introduced a considerable amount of irrigation water from external due to rice trade guangxi and inner mongolia had a similar situation the different from hebei province was the difference in dominant crops the awareness of viwf characteristics and its direction for specific crops combining figs 4 and 5 is conducive to understand the reasons for the irrigation wue change effected by inter provincial virtual water trade the volume of virtual irrigation water export for wheat in henan reached up to 11 30 gm³ much higher than that of any other provinces these viwfs mainly to guangdong 4 22 gm³ hunan 2 93 gm³ and guangxi 2 08 gm³ shandong and xinjiang contributed 6 62 and 6 24 gm³ virtual irrigation water respectively in the form of wheat export the dominate import province of wheat virtual irrigation water from shandong was zhejiang with 2 14 gm³ in addition shandong provided irrigation water in the form of wheat for the residents of guzhou chongqing hubei jilin and liaoning xinjiang s wheat virtual irrigation water was mainly supplied for southwest provinces such as sichuan 3 89 gm³ and yunnan 1 43 gm³ the maximum amount of wheat virtual irrigation water import was 4 22 gm³ found in guangdong and sichuan the greatest export of virtual irrigation water for maize was 2 97 gm³ in heilongjiang followed by 2 48 gm³ in jilin and 2 12 gm³ in shandong maize irrigation water of these three provinces flowed to 14 provinces including hunan guangdong zhejiang and yunnan the peak value of maize virtual irrigation water inflow of was 1 91 gm³ of sichuan which was jointly supplied by hebei shaanxi and shanxi the export of rice virtual irrigation water in hunan and heilongjiang was estimated to be 8 91 and 8 11 gm³ respectively which was obviously higher than that in any other virtual water flow routes the former flow to the most populous provinces henan and guangdong and the northwest provinces shanxi gansu qinghai ningxia and xinjiang the latter mainly meets the rice consumption of beijing tianjin hebei shanxi inner mongolia and other northern provinces the volume of virtual irrigation water export for rice in jiangxi and jiangsu located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin was 5 98 and 4 57 gm³ respectively making significant contributions to the rice consumption in china shandong hebei and henan contributed 46 4 of the rice virtual water inflow which was mainly provided by heilongjiang jiangxi jiangsu hunan and hubei the residents in the net virtual water import area consumed cereal both local and external and the irrigation water utilization efficiency from consumption perspective will not be equal to the value from the production perspective in other words the virtual water flow changes the irrigation wue in the net virtual water inflow regions the evaluation indices k and q for effect of virtual water trade on irrigation wue are shown in fig 6 the indicators k and q quantified the influence of virtual water flow on regional irrigation wue through the production and consumption perspectives compassion so as to judge the rationality of virtual water flow network k and q above 1 000 indicating that the goal of water saving irrigation has been achieved through the redistribution of agricultural products among regions instead it is necessary to improve irrigation wue indices water productivity and irrigation efficiency in crop export area the provincial mean values of k and q were calculated to be 1 068 and 0 983 respectively in the observed year in general the spatial pattern of irrigation water productivity in china was conducive to water use from the perspective of virtual water flow while irrigation efficiency was not fig 6 illustrated that k values of 14 provinces 8 of which are located in southeast were high than 1 000 signifying the iwp from the consumption perspective was higher than that from the production perspective most of the provinces in each subregion held a k less than 1 000 except the southeast the highest k value was 1 890 and calculated in qinghai this indicator in fujian guangdong shanghai hainan and xizang was above 1 500 there were other 7 provinces with k higher than 1 000 including hunan xinjiang guangxi jiangsu jiangsu hebei and anhui k value in beijing which was 0 422 ranking the lowest of the 31 provinces beijing was also the only province with a k value no more than 0 500 about half 16 of the provinces had a q value above 1 000 and the irrigation efficiency from the consumption perspective was higher than that from the production perspective unlike the indicator of k the value of q in all provinces hovered around 1 000 the highest q value in the country was 1 136 found in inner mongolia which was the only record higher than 1 100 in the other hand provinces with a q value less than 0 900 include qinghai tibet and beijing among them beijing has the lowest value which is 0 811 therefore beijing s grain irrigation wue was the most mismatched with china s virtual water flow network k and q values of jiangxi zhejiang guangxi hainan hunan fujian guangdong anhui were both higher than 1 000 the number of provinces with these parameters less than 1 000 is 10 the effect of virtual water flow on irrigation water productivity was greater than irrigation efficiency 4 discussion crop commutation harmonizes the contradiction between overproduction and consumption gap and causes the redistribution of cereals and irrigation water resources which may also change the spatial distribution of wue indices virtual water flow is a medium to link the irrigation water utilization efficiency in the crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes the complexity of agricultural virtual water flow network and wue performance increase when multiple crops are observed therefore it is necessary to evaluate irrigation water use and efficiency from the perspectives of cereals cultivation commutation and consumption processes different from rain green water the utilization and efficiency of irrigation water blue water are directly affected by human factors the iwu and its efficiency are jointly determined by the of water delivery and distribution measures in the water intake stage and the field irrigation techniques methods in the crop planting stage this fact should also be noted when assessment the effect of virtual water flow on water resources irrigation efficiency and irrigation water productivity show different spatial patterns frequently cao et al 2020b fig 2 existing researches on agricultural water performance based on virtual water only evaluates the water consumption in the field lamastra et al 2017 rosa et al 2020 without considering the water distribution process this may result the significance of irrigation efficiency an evaluation index of water saving irrigation technology ignored in other words it may not be able to obtain comprehensive information to evaluate water resources utilization in virtue of virtual water based on field water productivity reciprocal value of water footprint per unit crop product alone and to conduct research on water resources management strategies the research results of this paper related to the impact of virtual water flow on irrigation wue indices fig 6 support this view irrigation wue indices for the cereals involved in inter provincial virtual water flow were calculated and listed in table 3 in order to clearly illustrate this point it was calculated that the irrigation water productivity of the integrated cereal involved in virtual water commutation was 1 926 kg m³ higher than the national value of 1 815 kg m³ in crop production in other words cereal was transported from the provinces with relatively high irrigation water productivity to the provinces with low irrigation water productivity taking irrigation water productivity reciprocal value of blue water footprint per unit crop product as the evaluation index this redistribution pattern of cereal was conducive to the improvement of water saving benefits and water utilization efficiency at the national scale on the other hand the irrigation efficiency of the integrated cereal involved in virtual water trade was 0 489 which was than the national average of 0 494 in crop cultivation cereals was exported from relatively low irrigation efficiency provinces to high ones taking irrigation efficiency as the evaluation index this redistribution pattern of grain and water resources utilization increased irrigation water withdrawals and decreased irrigation water efficiency the opposite conclusions are obtained using irrigation efficiency and water productivity as judgments in fact the results of this paper partially show that such differences exist not only among indexes but also among crops and regions hence it is not only meaningful but also innovative to analyze the performance of wue in the whole process of crop cultivation commutation and consumption based on total irrigation water use quantification therefore it is of great reference value to discuss agricultural water management strategies based on the results of this study virtual water flow has a unique influence on irrigation wue due to the variation of natural conditions dominant products dietary structure and irrigation development among regions at the same time the viwf network has certain differences among the three specific crops which also contributed to the impact of virtual water flow on the water efficiency indices all these results are the basis for of irrigation development and agricultural water management strategies discussion table 3 shows that the iwp 4 674 kg m³ and ie 0 503 of maize involved in virtual water commutation were higher than the national values from the production perspective 4 424 kg m³and 0 494 while the situations were opposite for wheat and rice the wue change was complex at the provincial scale therefore agricultural water conservation management strategies should be explored looking at the irrigation water use and efficiency assessment of specific crop in a given province over the crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes virtual water flow did not improve irrigation wue from the consumption perspective in the main grain producing regions of the north china plain anhui hebei henan jiangsu and shandong which was mainly attributed to low irrigation wue fig 2 and large cereals and water consumption demand these provinces should improve irrigation water productivity and expand the external contribution moderately by increasing crop yield the k and q values in southeast china were both greater than 1 000 fig 6 due to the low irrigation wue fig 2 therefore it is urgent for this subregion to improve the irrigation water efficiency especially the irrigation water productivity by increasing the yield per unit area and reducing the water conveyance loss the four provinces in the northeast exported amount of maize and imported irrigation water resources through wheat fig 4 which reduced the irrigation wue significantly compared the consumption stage to crop planting stage in addition virtual water flow reduced crop irrigation water productivity in the southwest where hardly provided grain for external regions the provinces located northeast and southwest may optimizing the trade structure and choose to import grain from areas with high wue or the foreign countries to provide water saving irrigation services on a national scale irrigation wue evaluation indexes from the crop consumption perspective were lower than that from the production perspective fig 6 in the municipalities beijing shanghai and tianjin with small agricultural production scale and developed economy these regions import virtual irrigation water and do not provide grain to the outside fig 4 therefore improving irrigation wue in the provinces has no considerable practical significance and not to be recommended 5 conclusion irrigation water performance in crop cultivation commutation and consumption processes based on the inter regional virtual water flows measurement hence the establishment of wue assessment combined virtual water flow and irrigation water distribution efficiency was the contribution of this study the amount of total iwu in china s cereals production in 2018 was about 268 89 gm³ 31 7 of which was involved in inter provincial virtual water flow the effect of inter provincial virtual water flow on national ie was contrary to iwp it promoted water saving irrigation in china judging by iwp however the misalignment of cereal production and requirement increased the irrigation water loss in distribution and thus wastes water spatially irrigation wue was reduced in north and promoted in south compared cereal production to consumption perspectives improving water efficiency and optimizing crop commutation structure are reliable for irrigation water regulation coupling physical with virtual water especially in the major grain producing areas located in north china the quantitative assessment of agricultural water saving potential based on the whole process of crop cultivation commutation and consumption should be paid more attention in future studies declaration of competing

9726,lysimeter experiments were conducted under a rain shelter to investigate the effects of waterlogging imposing at different stages and with different durations on maize growth grain yield and yield components in 2017 2019 seasons the waterlogging treatments were implemented for different durations 2 4 6 8 and 10 days respectively at the seedling v3 jointing v6 tasseling vt and milk maturity r3 stages with non waterlogging treatment as control ck results shown that waterlogging stage duration and the interaction of stage and duration have significant affects p 0 01 on all growth index all yield index and nearly all yield components indexes in the three seasons the waterlogging stress decreased plant height leaf area index chlorophyll content index ear length ear diameter grain row number per ear 100 grain weight grain number per ear aboveground biomass and harvest index and increased the bald tip length and eventually a significant reduction in the grain yield of summer maize in addition the severity of the adverse effects increased generally with the lengthening of waterlogging duration the results of dominant influencing factors indicated that waterlogging occurred at v6 stage have the greatest effects on maize growth and grain yield followed by v3 vt and r3 stages and that the 100 grain weight and grains per ear had the largest effect on grain yield and other indexes affected maize yield by affecting the 100 grain weight and grains per ear keywords maize waterlogging stress stage and duration growth index grain yield and its components 1 introduction global climate changes are causing unexpected and increasingly frequent extreme weather events more frequent extreme precipitations lead to waterlogging stress and the duration changes with rainfall intensity drainage and soil structure malik et al 2002 waterlogging may affect 12 of global cultivation areas possibly causing up to 20 yield loss xu et al 2013 shabala 2011 the adverse effects have been observed not only under the prolonged period of waterlogging weeks but also under the short term waterlogging hours or days malik et al 2002 arduini et al 2016 during waterlogging excess water saturates the soil pores giving rise to a rapid decrease in oxygen level in root zone as well as the activities of aerobic soil microorganisms pezeshki 1994 smethurst et al 2005 tian et al 2019b this could lead to the anoxia of crop roots and inhibition of root respiration for example the wheat seminal root system stopped growing under waterlogging malik et al 2002 resulting in stomatal closure reduction in transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate and finally crop yield waterlogging decreased the number of spikelets per spike and kernels per spike of barley which ultimately leads to a decreased in yield masoni et al 2016 waterlogging significantly reduced maize grain yield by decreasing ear length and width and increasing the bald tip length tian et al 2019b the stress of waterlogging slowed down spikelet formation of wheat consequently reducing the number of spikelets per spike and reduced floret formation per spikelet thus reducing the number of kernels per spike arduini et al 2016 pampana et al 2016 performance of plants in response to waterlogging depends closely on plant growth stage the depth of water level and the duration of waterlogging events davies et al 2000 malik et al 2001 2002 for maize waterlogging for 4 d in early growing stage limited the seedling growth azahar et al 2020 reduced plant height ear and internode length and stem diameter li et al 2019 and decrease leaf area index lai and cci of maize leaves to varying degrees ren et al 2016a 2020 moreover waterlogging had more significant limitation on lai at v3 stage than that at v6 stage which further affected maize photosynthesis and plant growth ren et al 2017a mo et al 2017 maize yield was decreased by 58 8 69 8 under waterlogging stress at v3 stage yu et al 2015 ren et al 2013 and yu et al 2015 reported that waterlogging at v6 and vt stage reduced the number of filling days further reduced the grains number per ear and 1000 grain weight resulting in a decline in yield waterlogging lasting for 7 d markedly limited stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 concentration in maize leaves decreased photosynthetic rate by 15 4 compared with the non stress treatment then reduced crop grain yields ren et al 2015 aboveground biomass and harvest index of maize were significantly reduced with waterlogging for 3 7 d at v6 and vt stage yu et al 2015 the negative impact of waterlogging at v6 stage on maize yield was less than that at v3 stage and the impact at vt stage was the least ren et al 2013 tian et al 2019b the longer the waterlogging duration lasts the more serious the impact becomes ren et al 2013 yu et al 2015 summer maize production in the north china plain ncp benefits from simultaneous heat and precipitation however due to the unpredictability of monsoon rain and global climate changes waterlogging will still pose a serious threat to maize production in the ncp previous studies focused on physiological and agronomic performance of maize plants in response to waterlogging at certain growth stages and with different durations malik et al 2002 ren et al 2013 yu et al 2015 whereas there were few information on the inter influence of waterlogging at multiple growth stages and with different waterlogging durations on maize growth and yields therefore the waterlogging stress lasting for 2 4 6 8 and 10 days at v3 v6 vt and r3 stages respectively were designed in this study the objective of present study was to determine effects of waterlogging stress at different stages with different durations on maize growth and yield using experimental data from the three consecutive growing seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description lysimeter experiments were conducted under a rain shelter at guangli irrigation experimental station qinyang china 35 60 n 112 45 e 150 m a s l in 2017 2019 all lysimeters were non weighing style made of steel sheets and measured 3 33 m in length 2 0 m width 1 8 m in depth the bottom layer of 20 cm of each lysimeter was filled with mixed very coarse sands and gravels and acted as a filter layer to prevent soil loss from 150 cm of soil layer above it while permitting normal leakage water through the top side of the steel outer frame of the lysimeter is 10 cm higher than the soil surface in the lysimeter to prevent runoff during rain or irrigation events fig 1 the region has a continent temperate monsoon climate annual mean temperature is 14 5 c frost free period is 216 240 d annual mean total sunshine hour is 2300 h precipitation 554 mm and accumulative evaporation d20 pan 1775 mm soil in the lysimeters is an aquic ustochrept soil according to the chinese soil classification system national standards of china nsc 2009 soil texture is sandy loam 57 3 sand 4 05 clay 38 6 silt with an average bulk density of 1 45 g cm 3 and field capacity of 26 mass basis in the 0 100 cm soil profile 2 2 experimental design two experimental factors are set for investigating the effects of waterlogging stress on maize growth and yield formation one is the stage that waterlogging occurs at and four levels are arranged as seedling v3 jointing v6 tasseling vt and milk maturity r3 stages respectively another factor is waterlogging duration and 5 levels are arranged as 2 d 4 d 6 d 8 d and 10 d with flooding respectively a normally irrigated treatment without any waterlogging stress in whole growing season is taken as the control ck thus a total of 21 treatments with 3 replicates are laid out with the completely randomized block design in the lysimeters table 1 and the detail content of all treatments are shown in table 2 a maize hybrid xianyu 335 growth period about 110 d was sown in early june in 2017 2019 with a density of 60 000 plants ha 1 40 plants on each plot row spacing 60 cm and plant spacing 27 8 cm lysimeters were fertilized with 750 kg ha 1 of compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 18 10 6 during the seed bed preparation and no fertilizer for topdressing application hereafter for full and uniform seedling 75 mm water was irrigated to all experimental plots after sowing immediately a precision flow meter shanghai water meter manufacturing ltd co shanghai china was installed to measure and control irrigation water amount for each experimental plot a water layer of 5 8 cm was kept during all designed waterlogging durations at the end of the designed waterlogging duration the drainage valves installed at the bottom of the lysimeters were opened until excessive water hold by the soil profile in the lysimeter was drained off for the rest growing periods without waterlogging stress including ck an irrigation of 75 mm was applied when mean soil moisture of 0 100 cm soil layer decreased to 50 55 of the field capacity maize plants were harvested while completely matured the harvest date varied with different treatments and were investigated and recorded separately weeds and pests controlling and other agronomic managements were applied while necessary and kept the same to all treatments 2 3 measured items and methods 2 3 1 soil water content soil water content was measured manually at 20 cm increment to a depth of 100 cm every 7 d during the maize growing seasons except the waterlogging periods soil samples were taken manually with an auger 120 cm in length 3 5 cm in diameter for soil sample hold section and their gravimetric water contents were calculated with eq 1 1 s w c w 1 w 2 w 2 100 where swc is the soil water content w 1 is the original weight g of a soil sample w 2 is the weight g of the same soil sample dried out in an oven of 105 c for more than 24 h and reached a constant weight 2 3 2 leaf area index plant height and chlorophyll content index to determine leaf area index lai of maize population 3 plants with consistent and representative growth status were selected and labeled for each plot at v3 stage the length and largest width of every leaf on the three plants were measured with ruler at the end of the waterlogging event of r3 stage and then lai for each plot was calculated using eq 2 ren et al 2017b 2 lai 0 75 i 1 m j 1 n l i j w ij m n s where lai is the leaf area index l ij is the leaf length cm of the jth leaf on ith plant w ij is the largest width cm of the jth leaf on ith plant m is the measured number of plants n is the number of leaves per plant n is the plant numbers of a plots s is land area of a plot cm2 both plant height ph and chlorophyll content index cci also was measured on the same date with the lai measurement the ph and cci of ear positioned leaf were measured on the three labeled plants and the average values of three samples were used for further analysis the ph was measured using a ruler and cci was measured by chlorophyll meter ccm200 usa from 09 00 12 00 2 3 3 aboveground biomass grains yield and yield components on the same date with harvesting 5 plants were randomly selected and cut down at the position close to soil surface as sample on every plot and the weight of dried sample was taken as aboveground biomass agb 10 plants were randomly selected from each plot for investigating yield components to determine the grain yield all ears on the remaining 25 maize plants in each plot were harvested and solar dried for 2 weeks and then the grain was separated cleaned and weighed grain yield was adjusted according the moisture content determined using a portable moisture meter pm 8188 kett electric lab tokyo japan and expressed as standard yield at 14 moisture content 2 4 statistical analysis data were analyzed using analysis of variance with spss version 19 0 ibm inc chicago il usa principal component analysis was used to determine the comprehensive impact of waterlogging and path analysis was used to determine the main factors affecting the grain yield of maize under different waterlogging conditions means were compared using duncan s least significance difference lsd tests significance was declared at the probability level of 0 05 unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 effects of different waterlogging stresses on maize growth the effects of waterlogging stress occurred at different stages and with different durations on ph lai and cci of maize in the three growing seasons are shown in fig 3 and the anova results listed in table 3 the anova results indicated that the effects of waterlogging stages s and durations d on ph lai and cci were all significant at p 0 01 level in all three experimental years and the interaction effects of waterlogging stages and durations s d were also significant on most situations waterlogging imposed at v6 stage have more remarkable effects on maize ph and lai than those imposed at v3 and vt stages and the waterlogging at r3 stage effected little on ph but significantly reduced lal the effect severities of the waterlogging events at different stages on cci may be ordered as v3 v6 vt r3 ph decreased significantly with the increase of waterlogging duration in early growing stages of v3 and v6 and the effects weakened obviously in late growing stages of vt and r3 fig 3 the decreases of ph in v6 stage were the most serious and reached about 36 at the v6 10 treatment the waterlogging at vt still has a few effects on ph and causes a small scale of decrease as the duration increased the similar trends also were investigated about the effects on lai lai decreased dramatically with the increase of waterlogging durations at v3 v6 and vt stages and the greatest decrease value of 88 5 occurred at v6 10 treatment the effects on lai of waterlogging at r3 stage became visible after the duration was more than 4 days and then lai decreased relative slowly with the duration increase and reached a 12 3 lose at the treatment of r3 10 the waterlogging at all stages caused significant decreases of ear positioned leaf cci and the severity also rise remarkably with the lengthening of duration comparing to ck the values of cci at v3 10 v6 10 vt 10 and r3 10 decreased 28 4 23 0 21 4 and 16 6 p 0 05 respectively 3 2 effects of waterlogging stress on biomass and grain yield the effects of waterlogging stage s duration d and the interaction effects of stage and duration s d on maize grain yield gy aboveground biomass agb and harvest index hi in the three seasons were also significant at p 0 01 level table 3 the waterlogging effects were very similar across the three maize growing seasons gy agb and hi all decreased significantly with the lengthening of the waterlogging duration the most serious effects occurred at v6 stage and followed by v3 vt and r3 stage fig 4 when duration was no more than 4 days the gy loss was less than 25 at v3 v6 and vt stages but the gy loss become more and more serious while durations over 6 days yg loss on the treatment of v3 6 v6 6 and vt 6 was 32 7 44 9 and 28 3 p 0 05 respectively but at duration of 8 days and 10 days the gy loss increased to 44 1 66 5 37 0 16 3 and 50 1 95 2 42 8 25 0 at v3 v6 vt and r3 stage respectively p 0 05 fig 5 the effects of waterlogging on agb were nearly similar with those on gy agb began to decrease when waterlogging duration was more than 2 d at v3 v6 and vt stages but the agb loss become more and more serious while durations over 6 days the largest agb decreases of 40 2 78 7 31 3 and 18 2 were investigated in v3 10 v6 10 vt 10 and r3 10 treatments respectively p 0 05 fig 4b there were little effects on hi when waterlogging duration was not more than 6 days at v3 v6 and vt stages when the durations were over 6 days the hi decreased gradually and the greatest hi loss of 32 2 occurred in the v6 10 treatment however for the waterlogging treatments at r3 stage waterlogging the greatest reduction hi of 8 was measured in r3 10 treatment fig 4c 3 3 effects of waterlogging at different stages and durations on grain yield components waterlogging stress decreased significantly ear length ear diameter grain row number per ear the 100 grain weight and grain number per ear and the interaction of stage and duration s d also was significant at p 0 01 level as shown in table 3 the effects of waterlogging on the ear length ear diameter bald tip length and grain row number per ear similarly in the three maize growing seasons the influence degrees of waterlogging at v6 stage were the greatest and followed by those at v3 vt and r3 table 4 the ear length began decreasing while waterlogging duration over 6 days at v3 and v6 stage and the greatest loss of 22 9 and 23 7 occurred at the v3 10 and v6 10 treatments respectively the waterlogging at v6 and vt stages caused an ear diameter decrease after duration over 8 days and the greatest loss of 10 0 and 9 1 occurred at the v6 10 and vt 10 treatments respectively when waterlogging duration reached 10 d at v6 stage the ear row number per ear decreased significantly with a loss of 16 1 under waterlogging stress at v3 v6 and vt stages the bald tip lengths increased obviously while duration was over 4 days and the greatest increases of 123 1 57 5 and 108 5 were measured at the v3 10 v6 10 and vt 10 treatments respectively the severity of effects caused by waterlogging at v6 stage on grain number per ear was the highest and followed by those at v3 vt and r3 stages when the duration of the waterlogging at v3 v6 and vt stage was over 4 days the grain number per ear began to decrease and the most loss of 67 1 was investigated at the v6 10 treatment for the 100 grain weight the effects of the waterlogging at v3 stage was the most serious and followed by those at v6 vt and r3 stage the waterlogging duration that caused obvious decrease of the 100 grain weight was about 2 d under v3 vt and r3 stages but 6 days for v6 stage the greatest 100 grain weight loss of 20 8 appeared at the v3 10 treatment 3 4 analysis of dominant influencing factors 3 4 1 principal component analysis two principal components pc1 and pc2 were extracted table 5 the eigenvalues λ of principal component1 pc1 in 2017 2018 and 2019 were 9 350 6 932 and 7 089 and explained 77 9 57 8 64 4 of the total variation respectively λ of pc2 in 2017 2018 and 2019 were 2 333 3 111 and 3 443 and explained 19 4 25 9 31 3 of the total variation respectively comprehensive evaluation for each treatment was conducted using principal component analysis fig 6 with the increase of waterlogging duration the comprehensive score of each stage showed a downward trend and the comprehensive score of waterlogging at v6 stage was the lowest followed by v3 and vt and the comprehensive score of r3 was the highest therefore waterlogging at v6 stage had the greatest effect on maize growth followed by v3 and vt and waterlogging at r3 stage had the least effect 3 4 2 path analysis the conventional path coefficient analysis was employed to determine the contribution of various factors by partitioning the correlation coefficients into components of direct and indirect effects and the results are shown in fig 7 it was indicated that the direct effects of x 3 and x 4 on grain yield were significant table 6 p 0 01 meanwhile x 1 x 2 x 5 x 6 x 8 x 9 and x 10 had a large indirect effect on yield through x 3 and x 4 in 2017 in 2018 the direct effect of x 3 x 4 and x 10 on grain yield was significantly p 0 01 and x 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 x 6 x 8 x 9 had a large indirect effect on grain yield through x 4 and x 10 in 2019 the x 7 and x 10 had significantly direct effect on yield p 0 05 and x 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 x 6 x 8 had a large indirect effect on yield through x 10 therefore the 100 grain weight and grains per ear had the largest effect on grain yield and other indexes affected maize yield by affecting the 100 grain weight and grains per ear 4 discussion waterlogging generally result in physiological and morphological changes in plants arduini et al 2016 the present experiments indicated that the effects of different waterlogging stages and durations on maize growth and yield and the interaction effects of waterlogging stages and durations were significant tu et al 2017 and yu et al 2019 suggested that root growth of summer maize was suppressed under waterlogging stress leading to the limitation of shoot growth previous studies reported that significant reductions in plant height lai and cci occurred in response to waterlogging xu et al 2018 ren et al 2016a 2020 our results showed that maize ph were significantly decreased by waterlogging stress at v3 and v6 stages and the limitation was increased with the increase in waterlogging duration fig 3a in addition lai was significantly decreased with waterlogging duration over 2 d at v3 v6 and vt stages moreover our results indicated that waterlogging at r3 stage for 10 d decreased lai significantly fig 3b waterlogging at all scheduled stages were significantly decreased cci and the reduction was increased with waterlogging duration extending fig 3c however panozzo et al 2019 reported that maize ph generally increased in waterlogging stressed plants this is because of genotypic differences between varieties both lai and cci were significantly decreased after waterlogging fig 3b c of which reduction induced by waterlogging resulted in the decrease of leaf effective photosynthetic area and p n leaded to the disturbance of dry matter accumulation and ultimately leaded to decreased yields ren et al 2016b crop growth was inhibited by waterlogging leading to the difference of yield traits and the reduction in yield of crops xu et al 2018 our results indicated that under waterlogging at v6 stage the ear length and diameter decreased the most and the longer the waterlogging duration lasted the greater the reduction of ear length and ear diameter was table 4 which was similar to results in maize by ren et al 2016c i e waterlogging significantly decreased maize ear length ear width moreover the present results revealed that grain number per ear and the 100 grain weight decreased to varying degrees under different waterlogging stages and durations these results are in agreement with feng et al 2013 previous results showed that the longer the waterlogging duration lasted at v6 stage the greater the reduction of ear length and ear diameter of maize was xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 musgrave et al 1998 also found in the waterlogging research of wheat that waterlogging caused decrease in number of kernels and kernel weight our work also revealed that the 100 grain weight was lowest in the v3 10 treatment decreased of 20 8 while the grain number per ear was lowest in the r6 10 and vt 10 treatments decreased of 67 1 and 28 8 respectively and the longer the waterlogging duration lasted the greater the reduction of grains per ear and the 100 grain weight was which was consistent with tian et al 2019b this was because the long term waterlogging significantly affected the normal growth of maize seedling azahar et al 2020 and cci decreased the most fig 3c which affected photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation yu et al 2019 2015 resulting in insufficient grain filling and the 100 grain weight reduction at late growth stage waterlogging also affected spikelet formation and floret formation of crop reducing the number of kernels per spike masoni et al 2016 arduini et al 2016 pampana et al 2016 previous studies pointed out that waterlogging at v6 stage inhibited significantly the vegetative growth of maize zhou et al 2014 and also limited the normal flowering and silking of plants zaidi et al 2004 our results shown that the waterlogging at v6 stage led to the reduction of total aboveground biomass and the number of grains per ear was also significantly reduced due to the limitation of flowering and pollination table 4 and finally the significant reduction of harvest index and grain yield fig 4 in addition the literatures also pointed out that high air temperature at v6 stage may accelerated vegetative and reproductive growth promoted heading pollen abscission and prolong silking interval wang et al 2019 and finally shorten the growth period lizaso et al 2018 reduced the number of grains per ear and reduced the grain yield shao et al 2021 in our experiment high air temperature 35 occurred for several consecutive days during or just after the waterlogging in v6 stage fig 2 waterlogging and high temperature stress maybe create a synergistic effect then resulted in the greatest reduction of total biomass grain number per ear harvest index and finally the greatest grain yield loss under waterlogging stress at v6 stage in addition the present results also indicated that waterlogging for 2 10 d at r3 resulted in a decrease in the 100 grain weight and waterlogging for more than 8 d also resulted in a significant decrease in grain number per ear this was due to premature maize aging resulting from waterlogging at r3 stage resulting in lower lai fig 3b and cci fig 3c and insufficient grain filling grain yield under waterlogging reduced along with reductions in the 100 grain weight and grains per ear yu et al 2015 tian et al 2019a our study showed that the greatest impact of waterlogging on summer maize yield was observed at v6 followed by v3 and vt while that at r3 stage was the least the grain yield and aboveground biomass of waterlogged summer maize decreased with the prolongation of waterlogging duration which are basically consistent with feng et al 2013 however ren et al 2014 2017a and tian et al 2019a suggested that waterlogging at v3 having the greatest impact on maize there were inconsistent with our findings which may be due to the genotypic differences of crop varieties in waterlogging tolerance musgrave and ding 1998 in the study of wheat also showed that cultivars differed for grain yield under waterlogged conditions in the present work the yield of maize decreased nearly 50 after 10 d of waterlogging at v3 and vt and the yield decreased by more than 20 with waterlogging at r3 waterlogging at v6 for 10 d even resulted in yield failure fig 5 in our results the yield of summer maize varied among different years fig 4a this was caused by differences in grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of maize across different years although the grain number per ear in 2017 was higher than that in 2018 and 2019 but the 100 grain weight in 2017 was much lower than that in 2018 and 2019 table 4 resulted in lower yield in 2017 than that in 2018 and 2019 our study indicated that waterlogging not only at v3 and v6 but also at vt and r3 limited maize growth and yield production markedly as there are frequent rainfall events during summer maize growing season the results of this study can guide field management and reduce maize yield reduction caused by water accumulation however further research is needed on this basis on the one hand there are genotypic differences in waterlogging tolerance among different varieties but our study lacks comparison of waterlogging tolerance among different varieties on the other hand maize is mainly used in feed production and fresh food which requires high quality and changes in maize grain quality may lead to further decrease in economic benefits of maize therefore there is a lack of researched on the change of maize quality after waterlogging and field management was not perfect thus we will further study the differences in waterlogging tolerance of different maize varieties as well as the changes in physiology and grain quality under different waterlogging stresses 5 conclusion waterlogging stress caused a decrease in ph lai cci ear length ear diameter grain row number per ear 100 grain weight grain number per ear and aboveground biomass and an increase in the bald tip length and eventually a significant reduction in the grain yield of summer maize summer maize was most sensitive to waterlogging stress imposed at v6 stage followed by v3 and vt stages and the least was r3 stage in addition the adverse effects increased with an increase in the waterlogging duration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9726,lysimeter experiments were conducted under a rain shelter to investigate the effects of waterlogging imposing at different stages and with different durations on maize growth grain yield and yield components in 2017 2019 seasons the waterlogging treatments were implemented for different durations 2 4 6 8 and 10 days respectively at the seedling v3 jointing v6 tasseling vt and milk maturity r3 stages with non waterlogging treatment as control ck results shown that waterlogging stage duration and the interaction of stage and duration have significant affects p 0 01 on all growth

grain row number per ear 100 grain weight grain number per ear aboveground biomass and harvest index and increased the bald tip length and eventually a significant reduction in the grain yield of summer maize in addition the severity of the adverse effects increased generally with the lengthening of waterlogging duration the results of dominant influencing factors indicated that waterlogging occurred at v6 stage have the greatest effects on maize growth and grain yield followed by v3 vt and r3 stages and that the 100 grain weight and grains per ear had the largest effect on grain yield

introduction global climate changes are causing unexpected and increasingly frequent extreme weather events more frequent extreme precipitations lead to waterlogging stress and the duration changes with rainfall intensity drainage and soil structure malik et al 2002 waterlogging may affect 12 of global cultivation areas possibly causing up to 20 yield loss xu et al 2013 shabala 2011 the adverse effects have been observed not only under the prolonged period of waterlogging weeks but also under the short term waterlogging hours or days malik et al 2002 arduini et al 2016 during waterlogging excess water saturates the soil pores giving rise to a rapid decrease in oxygen level in root zone as well as the activities of aerobic soil microorganisms pezeshki 1994 smethurst et al 2005 tian et al 2019b this could lead to the anoxia of crop roots and inhibition of root respiration for example the wheat seminal root system stopped growing under waterlogging malik et al 2002 resulting in stomatal closure reduction in transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate and finally crop yield waterlogging decreased the number of spikelets per spike and kernels per spike of barley which ultimately leads to a decreased in yield masoni et al 2016 waterlogging significantly reduced maize grain yield by decreasing ear length and width and increasing the bald tip length tian et al 2019b the stress of waterlogging slowed down spikelet formation of wheat consequently reducing the number of spikelets per spike and reduced floret formation per spikelet thus reducing the number of kernels per spike arduini et al 2016 pampana et al 2016 performance of plants in response to waterlogging depends closely on plant growth stage the depth of water level and the duration of waterlogging events davies et al 2000 malik et al 2001 2002 for maize waterlogging for 4 d in early growing stage limited the seedling growth azahar et al 2020 reduced plant height ear and internode length and stem diameter li et al 2019 and decrease leaf area index lai and cci of maize leaves to varying degrees ren et al 2016a 2020 moreover waterlogging had more significant limitation on lai at v3 stage than that at v6 stage which further affected maize photosynthesis and plant growth ren et al 2017a mo et al 2017 maize yield was decreased by 58 8 69 8 under waterlogging stress at v3 stage yu et al 2015 ren et al 2013 and yu et al 2015 reported that waterlogging at v6 and vt stage reduced the number of filling days further reduced the grains number per ear and 1000 grain weight resulting in a decline in yield waterlogging lasting for 7 d markedly limited stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 concentration in maize leaves decreased photosynthetic rate by 15 4 compared with the non stress treatment then reduced crop grain yields ren et al 2015 aboveground biomass and harvest index of maize were significantly reduced with waterlogging for 3 7 d at v6 and vt stage yu et al 2015 the negative impact of waterlogging at v6 stage on maize yield was less than that at v3 stage and the impact at vt stage was the least ren et al 2013 tian et al 2019b the longer the waterlogging duration lasts the more serious the impact becomes ren et al 2013 yu et al 2015 summer maize production in the north china plain ncp benefits from simultaneous heat and precipitation however due to the unpredictability of monsoon rain and global climate changes waterlogging will still pose a serious threat to maize production in the ncp previous studies focused on physiological and agronomic performance of maize plants in response to waterlogging at certain growth stages and with different durations malik et al 2002 ren et al 2013 yu et al 2015 whereas there were few information on the inter influence of waterlogging at multiple growth stages and with different waterlogging durations on maize growth and yields therefore the waterlogging stress lasting for 2 4 6 8 and 10 days at v3 v6 vt and r3 stages respectively were designed in this study the objective of present study was to determine effects of waterlogging stress at different stages with different durations on maize growth and yield using experimental data from the three consecutive growing seasons 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description lysimeter experiments were conducted under a rain shelter at guangli irrigation experimental station qinyang china 35 60 n 112 45 e 150 m a s l in 2017 2019 all lysimeters were non weighing style made of steel sheets and measured 3 33 m in length 2 0 m width 1 8 m in depth the bottom layer of 20 cm of each lysimeter was filled with mixed very coarse sands and gravels and acted as a filter layer to prevent soil loss from 150 cm of soil layer above it while permitting normal leakage water through the top side of the steel outer frame of the lysimeter is 10 cm higher than the soil surface in the lysimeter to prevent runoff during rain or irrigation events fig 1 the region has a continent temperate monsoon climate annual mean temperature is 14 5 c frost free period is 216 240 d annual mean total sunshine hour is 2300 h precipitation 554 mm and accumulative evaporation d20 pan 1775 mm soil in the lysimeters is an aquic ustochrept soil according to the chinese soil classification system national standards of china nsc 2009 soil texture is sandy loam 57 3 sand 4 05 clay 38 6 silt with an average bulk density of 1 45 g cm 3 and field capacity of 26 mass basis in the 0 100 cm soil profile 2 2 experimental design two experimental factors are set for investigating the effects of waterlogging stress on maize growth and yield formation one is the stage that waterlogging occurs at and four levels are arranged as seedling v3 jointing v6 tasseling vt and milk maturity r3 stages respectively another factor is waterlogging duration and 5 levels are arranged as 2 d 4 d 6 d 8 d and 10 d with flooding respectively a normally irrigated treatment without any waterlogging stress in whole growing season is taken as the control ck thus a total of 21 treatments with 3 replicates are laid out with the completely randomized block design in the lysimeters table 1 and the detail content of all treatments are shown in table 2 a maize hybrid xianyu 335 growth period about 110 d was sown in early june in 2017 2019 with a density of 60 000 plants ha 1 40 plants on each plot row spacing 60 cm and plant spacing 27 8 cm lysimeters were fertilized with 750 kg ha 1 of compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 18 10 6 during the seed bed preparation and no fertilizer for topdressing application hereafter for full and uniform seedling 75 mm water was irrigated to all experimental plots after sowing immediately a precision flow meter shanghai water meter manufacturing ltd co shanghai china was installed to measure and control irrigation water amount for each experimental plot a water layer of 5 8 cm was kept during all designed waterlogging durations at the end of the designed waterlogging duration the drainage valves installed at the bottom of the lysimeters were opened until excessive water hold by the soil profile in the lysimeter was drained off for the rest growing periods without waterlogging stress including ck an irrigation of 75 mm was applied when mean soil moisture of 0 100 cm soil layer decreased to 50 55 of the field capacity maize plants were harvested while completely matured the harvest date varied with different treatments and were investigated and recorded separately weeds and pests controlling and other agronomic managements were applied while necessary and kept the same to all treatments 2 3 measured items and methods 2 3 1 soil water content soil water content was measured manually at 20 cm increment to a depth of 100 cm every 7 d during the maize growing seasons except the waterlogging periods soil samples were taken manually with an auger 120 cm in length 3 5 cm in diameter for soil sample hold section and their gravimetric water contents were calculated with eq 1 1 s w c w 1 w 2 w 2 100 where swc is the soil water content w 1 is the original weight g of a soil sample w 2 is the weight g of the same soil sample dried out in an oven of 105 c for more than 24 h and reached a constant weight 2 3 2 leaf area index plant height and chlorophyll content index to determine leaf area index lai of maize population 3 plants with consistent and representative growth status were selected and labeled for each plot at v3 stage the length and largest width of every leaf on the three plants were measured with ruler at the end of the waterlogging event of r3 stage and then lai for each plot was calculated using eq 2 ren et al 2017b 2 lai 0 75 i 1 m j 1 n l i j w ij m n s where lai is the leaf area index l ij is the leaf length cm of the jth leaf on ith plant w ij is the largest width cm of the jth leaf on ith plant m is the measured number of plants n is the number of leaves per plant n is the plant numbers of a plots s is land area of a plot cm2 both plant height ph and chlorophyll content index cci also was measured on the same date with the lai measurement the ph and cci of ear positioned leaf were measured on the three labeled plants and the average values of three samples were used for further analysis the ph was measured using a ruler and cci was measured by chlorophyll meter ccm200 usa from 09 00 12 00 2 3 3 aboveground biomass grains yield and yield components on the same date with harvesting 5 plants were randomly selected and cut down at the position close to soil surface as sample on every plot and the weight of dried sample was taken as aboveground biomass agb 10 plants were randomly selected from each plot for investigating yield components to determine the grain yield all ears on the remaining 25 maize plants in each plot were harvested and solar dried for 2 weeks and then the grain was separated cleaned and weighed grain yield was adjusted according the moisture content determined using a portable moisture meter pm 8188 kett electric lab tokyo japan and expressed as standard yield at 14 moisture content 2 4 statistical analysis data were analyzed using analysis of variance with spss version 19 0 ibm inc chicago il usa principal component analysis was used to determine the comprehensive impact of waterlogging and path analysis was used to determine the main factors affecting the grain yield of maize under different waterlogging conditions means were compared using duncan s least significance difference lsd tests significance was declared at the probability level of 0 05 unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 effects of different waterlogging stresses on maize growth the effects of waterlogging stress occurred at different stages and with different durations on ph lai and cci of maize in the three growing seasons are shown in fig 3 and the anova results listed in table 3 the anova results indicated that the effects of waterlogging stages s and durations d on ph lai and cci were all significant at p 0 01 level in all three experimental years and the interaction effects of waterlogging stages and durations s d were also significant on most situations waterlogging imposed at v6 stage have more remarkable effects on maize ph and lai than those imposed at v3 and vt stages and the waterlogging at r3 stage effected little on ph but significantly reduced lal the effect severities of the waterlogging events at different stages on cci may be ordered as v3 v6 vt r3 ph decreased significantly with the increase of waterlogging duration in early growing stages of v3 and v6 and the effects weakened obviously in late growing stages of vt and r3 fig 3 the decreases of ph in v6 stage were the most serious and reached about 36 at the v6 10 treatment the waterlogging at vt still has a few effects on ph and causes a small scale of decrease as the duration increased the similar trends also were investigated about the effects on lai lai decreased dramatically with the increase of waterlogging durations at v3 v6 and vt stages and the greatest decrease value of 88 5 occurred at v6 10 treatment the effects on lai of waterlogging at r3 stage became visible after the duration was more than 4 days and then lai decreased relative slowly with the duration increase and reached a 12 3 lose at the treatment of r3 10 the waterlogging at all stages caused significant decreases of ear positioned leaf cci and the severity also rise remarkably with the lengthening of duration comparing to ck the values of cci at v3 10 v6 10 vt 10 and r3 10 decreased 28 4 23 0 21 4 and 16 6 p 0 05 respectively 3 2 effects of waterlogging stress on biomass and grain yield the effects of waterlogging stage s duration d and the interaction effects of stage and duration s d on maize grain yield gy aboveground biomass agb and harvest index hi in the three seasons were also significant at p 0 01 level table 3 the waterlogging effects were very similar across the three maize growing seasons gy agb and hi all decreased significantly with the lengthening of the waterlogging duration the most serious effects occurred at v6 stage and followed by v3 vt and r3 stage fig 4 when duration was no more than 4 days the gy loss was less than 25 at v3 v6 and vt stages but the gy loss become more and more serious while durations over 6 days yg loss on the treatment of v3 6 v6 6 and vt 6 was 32 7 44 9 and 28 3 p 0 05 respectively but at duration of 8 days and 10 days the gy loss increased to 44 1 66 5 37 0 16 3 and 50 1 95 2 42 8 25 0 at v3 v6 vt and r3 stage respectively p 0 05 fig 5 the effects of waterlogging on agb were nearly similar with those on gy agb began to decrease when waterlogging duration was more than 2 d at v3 v6 and vt stages but the agb loss become more and more serious while durations over 6 days the largest agb decreases of 40 2 78 7 31 3 and 18 2 were investigated in v3 10 v6 10 vt 10 and r3 10 treatments respectively p 0 05 fig 4b there were little effects on hi when waterlogging duration was not more than 6 days at v3 v6 and vt stages when the durations were over 6 days the hi decreased gradually and the greatest hi loss of 32 2 occurred in the v6 10 treatment however for the waterlogging treatments at r3 stage waterlogging the greatest reduction hi of 8 was measured in r3 10 treatment fig 4c 3 3 effects of waterlogging at different stages and durations on grain yield components waterlogging stress decreased significantly ear length ear diameter grain row number per ear the 100 grain weight and grain number per ear and the interaction of stage and duration s d also was significant at p 0 01 level as shown in table 3 the effects of waterlogging on the ear length ear diameter bald tip length and grain row number per ear similarly in the three maize growing seasons the influence degrees of waterlogging at v6 stage were the greatest and followed by those at v3 vt and r3 table 4 the ear length began decreasing while waterlogging duration over 6 days at v3 and v6 stage and the greatest loss of 22 9 and 23 7 occurred at the v3 10 and v6 10 treatments respectively the waterlogging at v6 and vt stages caused an ear diameter decrease after duration over 8 days and the greatest loss of 10 0 and 9 1 occurred at the v6 10 and vt 10 treatments respectively when waterlogging duration reached 10 d at v6 stage the ear row number per ear decreased significantly with a loss of 16 1 under waterlogging stress at v3 v6 and vt stages the bald tip lengths increased obviously while duration was over 4 days and the greatest increases of 123 1 57 5 and 108 5 were measured at the v3 10 v6 10 and vt 10 treatments respectively the severity of effects caused by waterlogging at v6 stage on grain number per ear was the highest and followed by those at v3 vt and r3 stages when the duration of the waterlogging at v3 v6 and vt stage was over 4 days the grain number per ear began to decrease and the most loss of 67 1 was investigated at the v6 10 treatment for the 100 grain weight the effects of the waterlogging at v3 stage was the most serious and followed by those at v6 vt and r3 stage the waterlogging duration that caused obvious decrease of the 100 grain weight was about 2 d under v3 vt and r3 stages but 6 days for v6 stage the greatest 100 grain weight loss of 20 8 appeared at the v3 10 treatment 3 4 analysis of dominant influencing factors 3 4 1 principal component analysis two principal components pc1 and pc2 were extracted table 5 the eigenvalues λ of principal component1 pc1 in 2017 2018 and 2019 were 9 350 6 932 and 7 089 and explained 77 9 57 8 64 4 of the total variation respectively λ of pc2 in 2017 2018 and 2019 were 2 333 3 111 and 3 443 and explained 19 4 25 9 31 3 of the total variation respectively comprehensive evaluation for each treatment was conducted using principal component analysis fig 6 with the increase of waterlogging duration the comprehensive score of each stage showed a downward trend and the comprehensive score of waterlogging at v6 stage was the lowest followed by v3 and vt and the comprehensive score of r3 was the highest therefore waterlogging at v6 stage had the greatest effect on maize growth followed by v3 and vt and waterlogging at r3 stage had the least effect 3 4 2 path analysis the conventional path coefficient analysis was employed to determine the contribution of various factors by partitioning the correlation coefficients into components of direct and indirect effects and the results are shown in fig 7 it was indicated that the direct effects of x 3 and x 4 on grain yield were significant table 6 p 0 01 meanwhile x 1 x 2 x 5 x 6 x 8 x 9 and x 10 had a large indirect effect on yield through x 3 and x 4 in 2017 in 2018 the direct effect of x 3 x 4 and x 10 on grain yield was significantly p 0 01 and x 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 x 6 x 8 x 9 had a large indirect effect on grain yield through x 4 and x 10 in 2019 the x 7 and x 10 had significantly direct effect on yield p 0 05 and x 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 x 6 x 8 had a large indirect effect on yield through x 10 therefore the 100 grain weight and grains per ear had the largest effect on grain yield and other indexes affected maize yield by affecting the 100 grain weight and grains per ear 4 discussion waterlogging generally result in physiological and morphological changes in plants arduini et al 2016 the present experiments indicated that the effects of different waterlogging stages and durations on maize growth and yield and the interaction effects of waterlogging stages and durations were significant tu et al 2017 and yu et al 2019 suggested that root growth of summer maize was suppressed under waterlogging stress leading to the limitation of shoot growth previous studies reported that significant reductions in plant height lai and cci occurred in response to waterlogging xu et al 2018 ren et al 2016a 2020 our results showed that maize ph were significantly decreased by waterlogging stress at v3 and v6 stages and the limitation was increased with the increase in waterlogging duration fig 3a in addition lai was significantly decreased with waterlogging duration over 2 d at v3 v6 and vt stages moreover our results indicated that waterlogging at r3 stage for 10 d decreased lai significantly fig 3b waterlogging at all scheduled stages were significantly decreased cci and the reduction was increased with waterlogging duration extending fig 3c however panozzo et al 2019 reported that maize ph generally increased in waterlogging stressed plants this is because of genotypic differences between varieties both lai and cci were significantly decreased after waterlogging fig 3b c of which reduction induced by waterlogging resulted in the decrease of leaf effective photosynthetic area and p n leaded to the disturbance of dry matter accumulation and ultimately leaded to decreased yields ren et al 2016b crop growth was inhibited by waterlogging leading to the difference of yield traits and the reduction in yield of crops xu et al 2018 our results indicated that under waterlogging at v6 stage the ear length and diameter decreased the most and the longer the waterlogging duration lasted the greater the reduction of ear length and ear diameter was table 4 which was similar to results in maize by ren et al 2016c i e waterlogging significantly decreased maize ear length ear width moreover the present results revealed that grain number per ear and the 100 grain weight decreased to varying degrees under different waterlogging stages and durations these results are in agreement with feng et al 2013 previous results showed that the longer the waterlogging duration lasted at v6 stage the greater the reduction of ear length and ear diameter of maize was xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 musgrave et al 1998 also found in the waterlogging research of wheat that waterlogging caused decrease in number of kernels and kernel weight our work also revealed that the 100 grain weight was lowest in the v3 10 treatment decreased of 20 8 while the grain number per ear was lowest in the r6 10 and vt 10 treatments decreased of 67 1 and 28 8 respectively and the longer the waterlogging duration lasted the greater the reduction of grains per ear and the 100 grain weight was which was consistent with tian et al 2019b this was because the long term waterlogging significantly affected the normal growth of maize seedling azahar et al 2020 and cci decreased the most fig 3c which affected photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation yu et al 2019 2015 resulting in insufficient grain filling and the 100 grain weight reduction at late growth stage waterlogging also affected spikelet formation and floret formation of crop reducing the number of kernels per spike masoni et al 2016 arduini et al 2016 pampana et al 2016 previous studies pointed out that waterlogging at v6 stage inhibited significantly the vegetative growth of maize zhou et al 2014 and also limited the normal flowering and silking of plants zaidi et al 2004 our results shown that the waterlogging at v6 stage led to the reduction of total aboveground biomass and the number of grains per ear was also significantly reduced due to the limitation of flowering and pollination table 4 and finally the significant reduction of harvest index and grain yield fig 4 in addition the literatures also pointed out that high air temperature at v6 stage may accelerated vegetative and reproductive growth promoted heading pollen abscission and prolong silking interval wang et al 2019 and finally shorten the growth period lizaso et al 2018 reduced the number of grains per ear and reduced the grain yield shao et al 2021 in our experiment high air temperature 35 occurred for several consecutive days during or just after the waterlogging in v6 stage fig 2 waterlogging and high temperature stress maybe create a synergistic effect then resulted in the greatest reduction of total biomass grain number per ear harvest index and finally the greatest grain yield loss under waterlogging stress at v6 stage in addition the present results also indicated that waterlogging for 2 10 d at r3 resulted in a decrease in the 100 grain weight and waterlogging for more than 8 d also resulted in a significant decrease in grain number per ear this was due to premature maize aging resulting from waterlogging at r3 stage resulting in lower lai fig 3b and cci fig 3c and insufficient grain filling grain yield under waterlogging reduced along with reductions in the 100 grain weight and grains per ear yu et al 2015 tian et al 2019a our study showed that the greatest impact of waterlogging on summer maize yield was observed at v6 followed by v3 and vt while that at r3 stage was the least the grain yield and aboveground biomass of waterlogged summer maize decreased with the prolongation of waterlogging duration which are basically consistent with feng et al 2013 however ren et al 2014 2017a and tian et al 2019a suggested that waterlogging at v3 having the greatest impact on maize there were inconsistent with our findings which may be due to the genotypic differences of crop varieties in waterlogging tolerance musgrave and ding 1998 in the study of wheat also showed that cultivars differed for grain yield under waterlogged conditions in the present work the yield of maize decreased nearly 50 after 10 d of waterlogging at v3 and vt and the yield decreased by more than 20 with waterlogging at r3 waterlogging at v6 for 10 d even resulted in yield failure fig 5 in our results the yield of summer maize varied among different years fig 4a this was caused by differences in grain number per ear and 100 grain weight of maize across different years although the grain number per ear in 2017 was higher than that in 2018 and 2019 but the 100 grain weight in 2017 was much lower than that in 2018 and 2019 table 4 resulted in lower yield in 2017 than that in 2018 and 2019 our study indicated that waterlogging not only at v3 and v6 but also at vt and r3 limited maize growth and yield production markedly as there are frequent rainfall events during summer maize growing season the results of this study can guide field management and reduce maize yield reduction caused by water accumulation however further research is needed on this basis on the one hand there are genotypic differences in waterlogging tolerance among different varieties but our study lacks comparison of waterlogging tolerance among different varieties on the other hand maize is mainly used in feed production and fresh food which requires high quality and changes in maize grain quality may lead to further decrease in economic benefits of maize therefore there is a lack of researched on the change of maize quality after waterlogging and field management was not perfect thus we will further study the differences in waterlogging tolerance of different maize varieties as well as the changes in physiology and grain quality under different waterlogging stresses 5 conclusion waterlogging stress caused a decrease in ph lai cci ear length ear diameter grain row number per ear 100 grain weight grain number per ear and aboveground biomass and an increase in the bald tip length and eventually a significant reduction in the grain yield of summer maize summer maize was most sensitive to waterlogging stress imposed at v6 stage followed by v3 and vt stages and the least was r3 stage in addition the adverse effects increased with an increase in the waterlogging duration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9727,deep soil water management is important for agroforests to combat frequent droughts however little is known about how deep soil water up to 15 0 m and its deep drainage after trees fell evolves with time 20 years in deep vadose zone therefore this study was aimed at evaluating the impact of orchards removal on the replenishment of deep soil water and its deep drainage in a sub humid region on the loess plateau china lpc we established paired experimental plots between cultivated farmlands after deforested land and mature aged orchards soil water storage and deep drainage were calculated from the measured soil water contents based on deep soil sampling down to 6 15 0 m then the time evolution of soil water storage and deep drainage rates were obtained based on the space for time substitution results showed that the replenishing front indicated by the increase of soil water deepened with time after orchard removal which progressively increased deep soil water content the drainage rates increased suddenly right after orchard removal and attained a constant value of 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 after the conversion with this deep drainage rate deep soil water deficit created by prior mature orchards would require 48 69 years of annual crop cultivation therefore this study helps improve the further understanding of ecohydrological process under land use and management of deep soil water storage for increasing resiliency of agroforests to climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords deforestation soil water replenishment deep drainage temporal change deep vadose zone 1 introduction expansion of agricultural frontier drive primarily the deforestation to maintain their productivity and resilience to climate change the afforested economical and agro forests require felling and possible rotation in arid and semi arid regions most of native tree species and afforested trees are deep rooted to take advantage of deep soil water reserve li et al 2018 2019b rempe and dietrich 2018 therefore deforestation and felling agro forested trees often result in converting deep rooted vegetation to shallow rooted croplands as a result water yields in water cycle increases substantially altering soil water runoff streamflow and groundwater conte et al 2019 gatti et al 2021 straaten et al 2015 conversion from deep rooted forests into shallow rooted croplands lead to increased soil water storage particularly in deep soil due to reduced evapotranspiration seyfried and wilcox 2010 zhang et al 2020b however in arid and semi arid zones deep soil is generally desiccated due to excessive water demand from the deep rooted vegetation once depleted soil water is difficult to replenish and may take a long time to replenish because little excess water passed through the rooting zone of shallow rooted vegetation li et al 2018 for example wang et al 2007 reported that it took at least 40 150 years to fully replenish the depleted soil water after artificial forest was cut down or dead meanwhile huang et al 2006 simulated the replenishment of soil water after aged orchard removal indicating longer time 6 5 19 5 years for the 0 10 m soil profile than 0 3 m profile zhang et al 2020b estimated that 26 years are required to replenish the deep soil water after apple trees are felled these three studies were all conducted on the loess plateau yet the time it takes for a full replenishment of deep soil water differ by a large margin accurately accounting for the time it takes for the deep soil water to be replenished is critical to proper management of deep soil water but remain uncertain the reason is that previous studies did not sample either deep enough or frequent enough to capture the salient feature of deep soil water replenishment processes deforestation also increases deep drainage or and groundwater recharge favreau et al 2009 scanlon et al 2007 in deep vadose zone the increase of deep drainage was estimated as the average values over decades after clearing cook et al 2001 santoni et al 2010 this is because in reported cleared cases native vegetation for the expansion of agriculture was cleared at least 30 years ago even up to 100 years however it would take more time some decades to hundred years to attain a new steady state dependent on the depth of water table drainage rates and initial water content in unsaturated zone jolly et al 1989 moore et al 2012 therefore previous studies only provided long term average outcomes about the leaching of unsaturated salt inventories and soil water increase and its fluxes since native vegetation removal over past decades to century cook et al 2001 santoni et al 2010 scanlon et al 2007 such estimated deep drainage provides limited information on the evolution of groundwater recharge after deforestation hence short term temporal 20 years changes of deep drainage or and groundwater recharge after deep root vegetation removal remains unclear for us the loess plateau china lpc is located in the northwest inland of china mostly semi arid and sub humid regions and registered the largest afforestation efforts on earth sustainability of these forests provide guidance for similar efforts on earth to mitigate climate change as is known afforested vegetation roots deeper and deeper to extract deeper soil water leading to wide spread deep soil desiccation wang et al 2011a 2011b the consequence of this continued deep soil desiccation is the decreased productivity and frequent occurrence of drought stress and diseases feng et al 2016 mendham et al 2011 shao et al 2018 the yield of apple orchards dropped continually with deep soil desiccation aggravation feng et al 2016 shao et al 2018 as a result this economic vegetation they are often cut or cleared in order to replenish the deep soil water huang and gallichand 2006 wang et al 2011a 2011b wang et al 2008 however how the clearing affects soil water in deep soil and its deep drainage rate remain uncertain moreover understanding the impact of this land use change from deep rooted to shallow rooted vegetation have great significance in the sustainable management of water and land resources locally further given the increasingly frequent and severe drought occurrence proper management of deep soil water to combat droughts dictates the success of afforestation efforts and income of farmers on the loess plateau therefore to understand how soil water and its storage are replenished is also urgent given ecological economic and social benefits especially economic vegetation mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020b therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to examine the change of deep soil water content and its storage beneath croplands on previously deep rooted orchards and 2 to identify the temporal evolution 20 years in deep drainage after orchard removal through deep soil sampling we capture the change of soil water in deep soil from vertical profiles 0 15 m and estimates its drainage rates under croplands after apple orchards removal paired experimental plots between cultivated farmlands after removal treatment plots and mature orchards before removal control plots were set up capitalizing on the space for time substitution design we will investigate the time evolution of soil moisture and its deep drainage following felling an orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the proximity to the changwu agro ecological station located in the southeastern portion typical tableland and gully region of the lpc 35 12 n 107 40 e fig 1 the experimental site is relatively flat in topography with an elevation of 1225 m above sea level this region is subject to warm temperate semi humid and continental monsoon climate with a long term 1957 2017 mean precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of 578 and 893 mm respectively http cwa cern ac cn meta metadata the precipitation is non uniformly distributed over different seasons about 55 of which falls between july and september the soil is developed on eolian deposits with predominantly silt loamy soil with a silt content at least 0 5 g g 1 the field capacity is about 0 28 m3 m 3 and permanent wilting point is 0 11 m3 m 3 the deep loess profile is relatively even and porous which is conducive to plant root penetration the land use almost all rain fed includes farmland wheat maize and orchards apple on the plateau and mostly grasslands with some bush encroachment or woody species apricot robinia on hillslopes the water table is very deep ranging from 30 to 100 m below surface and thus groundwater is not involved in transpiration due to favorable conditions such as temperature mean annual temperature 9 4 c sunshine and rainfall this area was found suitable for producing high quality apples therefore since 1980s farmers have gradually converted most agricultural crop into apple orchards in this region when the orchard is older than 20 years deep soil water is depleted leaving little deep soil water to supplement transpiration in dry seasons and to combat frequent drought occurrence as a result those orchards are prone to diseases and canopy dieback leading to poor productivity and economic income clearance of these orchards and return to annual crop become a popular practice in the regions 2 2 filed experimental design and soil sampling to study the long term change of deep soil water 10 m and its drainage after plantation removal observations in situ in the field are a long term endeavor and time consuming considering the soil is horizontally uniformly distributed on the plateau the method of space for time substitution was adopted we adopt paired experimental plot design consisted of six treatment removal sites and two types of control sites on the flat plateau these sites had identical topography and elevation due to paired sampling the horizontal variation of soil texture especially within eolian loess regions was negligible li et al 2018 2019a these treatment sites had been cultivated with shallow rooted cropland maize or wheat since deep rooted apple orchards was removed before removal these apple orchards were all planted in 1983 and then were individually cut down respectively in 2015 2014 2013 2009 2005 and 2000 for convenience they are referred to as ch1 ch2 ch3 ch7 ch10 11 and ch15 16 respectively thus the ages of all the cleared apple orchards were at least 17 years 17 32 years due to less water demand and shallow roots of maize and wheat deep soil water began to be replenished following felling apple orchards the ch15 profile was sampled in november 2015 in the same plot with ch16 profile with a distance of 5 0 m from each other and in 2015 the plot ch1 was cultivated with vegetables for each of the other six treatment sites 2 4 deep cores were taken at each plot as replicates in total 15 deep cores 6 13 m were obtained in the field we have two types of control plots one is the long term annual crop field where a total of three cores were taken between 2015 and 2017 referred to as cp2015 cp2016 and cp2017 thereafter the other type of control plots are the mature orchards we took one core was taken in 2017 from each of the standing apple orchards of 16 19 23 and 33 years old referred to as ap16 ap19 ap23 and ap33 years these two types of control sites served as the upper and lower limit for the deep soil water storage respectively therefore in addition to the 15 cores taken in the treatment plots additional seven deep cores 15 m sampled in control plots for comparisons with the treatment plots the deep soil cores were obtained with a hollow stem auger with stem extension at a sampling interval of 0 20 m to a depth of 6 15 m each sample about 40 g was put into an aluminum box and oven dried at 105 c for 12 h to determine soil water content the detailed information about the sampling in the field was listed in table 1 2 3 soil water storage increase and its deep drainage after orchard removal for shallow rooted maize field in our study area the rooting depth root zone defined as the depth above which 95 of roots are located was 2 m shao et al 2019 in the present study soil above the rooting depth is defined as shallow soil and below is deep soil therefore in reconverted croplands the deep soil water storage increase 2 0 m after orchard removal was calculated as follow 1 δ s 2 r d θ ch z θ ap z dz i n θ i ch θ i ap d i where s is the deep soil water increase after orchard reconverted into croplands mm θ ch z and θ ap z are the soil water contents beneath shallow rooted croplands treatment plots and deep rooted apple orchards control plots at depth z and r d is the maximum depth of replenishing front or sampling depth for each reconverted cropland m θ i ch and θ i ap are the soil water contents m3 m 3 in the depth increment i below 2 0 m for shallow rooted croplands and deep rooted apple orchards control plots respectively d i is the thickness m of depth increment i and is equal to 0 2 m in this study assuming all the water entered into deep soil remain in the deep soil the deep drainage rate d mm yr 1 after deep rooted vegetation removal can be calculated as the derivative of deep soil water storage increase s with respect to time t yr since the orchard removal for the reconverted croplands 2 d ds dt 2 4 analyzing variation in estimated deep drainage as is evident from eqs 1 and 2 we know that the variation in estimated d is mainly from the variation in θ i ch based on the first order perturbation analysis of eqs 1 and 2 the standard deviation of the estimated d after orchard removal σ d can be calculated as 3 σ d d i t i n σ θ i ch 2 2 5 statistical analyses two variable x and y given respective standard errors σ x and σ y and respective means x and y the difference between the means can be tested using the student t test sedgwick 2015 for a significant level of 0 05 using spss version 19 3 results 3 1 deep soil water beneath long term croplands and mature orchards for the seven deep soil water profiles fig 2 under both long term croplands and orchards there are large variations in soil water contents in the shallow layer in each of the plots reflecting the collective influence of evaporation transpiration and precipitation infiltration the shallow soils of ap33 and cp2015 had particularly lower soil water contents likely because sampling at these sites occurred at a dry period conversely deep soil water content showed the minor variation below the root zone 2 15 0 m in the three long term cultivated croplands fig 2 p 0 05 with the average soil water content for the three croplands 2 0 15 0 m being 0 273 0 007 m3 m 3 moreover there was also no significant difference in deep soil water content at the depth between 2 0 and 12 0 m among the four different stand aged orchards fig 2 p 0 05 the four mature orchards had the average value soil water content of 0 187 0 008 m3 m 3 from the depth of 2 0 12 0 m however at depth of 12 0 15 0 m soil water contents for ap16 and ap19 were slightly larger than those for ap23 and ap33 fig 2 p 0 05 this suggests that mature orchards like ap16 and ap19 were still extracting soil water at the depth of 12 0 15 0 m furthermore deep soil water content in the four orchards were significantly smaller than those in the three farmlands fig 2 p 0 05 and total water loss 2 0 12 0 m was up to 1135 33 mm between the four orchards and long term cropland the deep soil water loss is purely due to transpiration because of the greater depth which amounts for 2 years of annual precipitation 3 2 deep soil water increase and its variation following orchard removal for all croplands reconverted from apple orchards we observed the increase of soil water in deep soil relative to that of the apple orchards but the increase occurred only in the top 10 m fig 3 moreover relative to the long term crop land there were large variations in soil water contents between the replicated soil cores within the same crop land reconverted from apple orchards and the variations are particularly evident during the first seven years p 0 05 fig 2 fig 3 table 2 further these large variations were mainly manifested above 7 0 m below 7 0 m in deep soil the variation in soil water content were much smaller fig 3 an exception is the ch15 16 plot where there was larger variation due mainly to lower soil water contents 2 0 7 0 m in ch16 profile one possible explanation is that vegetables grown in the ch16 plot had higher water demand than other croplands fig 3 fig 4 shows the soil water content profile averaged over the three replicated soil cores for each crop land with the removal time increasing the replenishing front defined as wetting front tended to develop into greater depth for the first three years after orchards removal the replenishing front was displaced downward to the depth of about 7 0 m fig 4 and there was a significant increase in the average soil water content relative to that under apple orchards p 0 05 fig 4 table 2 from three to 10 5 years after the conversion the replenishment front continued to deepen to about 10 0 m and the average soil water content 2 10 0 m increasing from 0 198 0 012 m3 m 3 to 0 216 0 014 m3 m 3 for cropland table 2 then 10 5 years after an orchard was felled replenishing front began to broaden while advancing further into deep soil fig 4 this resulted in significant soil water content increase p 0 05 table 2 however the deepening depth was still limited above 10 0 m fig 4 3 3 linear increase of water storage in deep soil following orchard removal deep soil water content and its storage continually increased with the advancement of the replenishing front fig 3 and 4 as expected water storage in deep soil 2 10 0 m suddenly increased in the first year after being felled then the soil water storage increases ranged from 139 15 mm at year 1 to 504 23 mm at 15 16 years after orchard removal fig 5 table 2 the increases have a positive linear relationship with time after deep rooted orchards removal p 0 05 r2 0 92 with a slope of 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 and an intercept of 104 3 23 8 mm this suggests that the sudden increase in soil water storage is 104 3 mm right after felling the apple trees more importantly linear increase of water storage in deep soil per unit time defining drainage rate eq 2 was 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 after orchard removal and remained largely constant after the first year we calculated the deep drainage rate between two consecutive years after felling an orchard table 2 the calculated deep drainage rates varied from 25 0 to 139 3 mm yr 1 table 2 with an arithmetic average of 38 7 mm yr 1 and the time weighted average of 32 5 mm yr 1 the large variation in calculated deep drainage rates is likely a result of yearly variation of annual precipitation if we subtract the intercept fig 5 from the first year s drainage rate 139 3 mm yr 1 then the arithmetic and time weighted averages of deep drainage rates are 21 3 and 25 8 mm yr 1 respectively these two values are much closer to the slope 22 0 mm yr 1 from fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 field variation of deep soil water after orchard removal the average soil water contents at the depth between 2 0 and 12 0 m did not differ between the apple orchards from 16 to 33 years old with the average soil water content of about 0 187 m3 m 3 for the four orchards p 0 05 fig 2 this indicates that the average soil water content in deep soil was at the lower limit of available water content to deep roots moreover despite of the different stand ages strikingly uniformity of soil water content in 2 12 0 m profiles make it reasonable to assume the initial soil water contents at the depth of 2 0 12 m were the same when an orchard 16 years old was fell regardless of the stand ages in another word these cleared plots were previously apple orchards with a stand age between 17 and 32 years had similar deep soil water contents and storage at the depth of 2 12 0 m at the beginning of deep soil water recovery despite of being reconverted into croplands at different years this uniformity over stand age and depth allows accurate calculated deep drainage from the increase of deep soil water storage after orchard removal eq 2 however after conversion into croplands deep soil water contents displayed larger variations fig 3 table 2 the causes for such an elevated variability can be spatial variability of soil texture and water input however the loess deposit though having a striking stratigraphy is relatively uniform horizontally variation in soil texture li et al 2019a in the same study area as the present study li et al 2019b measured the vertical profiles 0 20 m of soil particle composition under five apple orchards and three farmlands and found no significant difference in soil texture among the eight soil profiles p 0 05 moreover in this study deep soil water contents did not differ significantly between the three long term cultivated lands p 0 05 fig 2 therefore soil texture could not lead to the larger variation in deep soil water content after deforestation land use changes may have altered the soil physical properties and thus affected soil infiltration rates veldkamp et al 2020 sun et al 2018 yimer et al 2010 for example increased bulk density and penetration resistance decreased infiltration rates and saturated conductivity occurred after reported tree clearing lal 1996 lal and cummings 1979 neris et al 2012 this is because removing deep rooted tree often leave many roots in soil and their subsequent decomposition could create macro pores locally ghuman et al 1991 hulugalle 1994 in our study we observed during our sampling that many roots remain in the field after apple orchards removal by an excavator creating channels for water infiltration but the spatial locations vertical and horizontal of these roots are rather random leading to large variation of in soil physical properties and soil water contents ghuman et al 1991 lal 1996 these differences in soil physical properties and macroporosity may alter the partition of precipitation into deep soil water storage and shallow soil water storage at different sites creating spatial variation ali et al 2018 found that infiltration rate was higher in the abandoned apple orchards than that in normal apple orchard which was due to more macro pores in the abandoned apple orchards ali et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 thus high deep soil water contents can be expected in the taproot area fig s1 the greater soil water content profile in ch1 2 3 7 plots may be a result of preferential flow in the taproot zone 4 2 a sudden increase in soil water storage and then a constant deep drainage after orchard removal a leaky bucket model for deep soil water recharge there was dramatic increase in deep soil water storage right after the tree being felled fig 5 this increase could be a result of sudden change of evapotranspiration rate thus the water demand by the vegetation the apple trees had a deeper root system shao et al 2019 moreover the area is characterized by large precipitation events in the summer and often there is a brief period when the rainfall amount is large than the evapotranspiration in a crop field having a shallower root zone large rainfall events was easier to pass the root zone and becomes deep soil recharge than that in an apple orchard our results show that soil water storage increased linearly with time 1 year after orchards were felled fig 4 this suggests that there is a rather constant deep drainage rate to the deep soil from shallow soil following trees being felled this is different from previous studies that found that after deep rooted shrub or bush clearing a high deep drainage rate appeared initially after removal followed by a sharp declining moore et al 2010 2012 silburn et al 2009 similarly moore et al 2010 reported that the hydrologic change following bush removal was evident in the first five years with the peak of leaching chloride attained the maximium depth subsequently deep drainage decreased sharply after five years this was atributed to the gradual reestablishment of some native shrub moore et al 2010 2012 the difference between our study and the previous studies lies in that after deforestation annual crop is normally cultivated and fertilized making the establishment of a successful crop rather rapidly in the first year while previous study focuses on a natural reestablishment of vegetation through plant succession which often takes time table 2 shows large variation of deep drainage rates within the 16 years after felling the orchards even with the intercept removed from the first year s data the deep drainage rates still varied from 25 to 42 4 mm yr 1 this large variability may be related to climatic variations and soil management as shown by hu et al 2019 precipitation is the dominant factor affecting deep drainage rate and the precipitation varied from 490 to 954 from 2000 to 2016 http cwa cern ac cn meta metadata it is reasonable to assume the precipitation contribute largely to the variability in deep drainage rates shown in table 2 the temporal variation of deep drainage in the field can also result from the temporal change of soil physical property ghuman et al 1991 reported the higher infiltration rates in the first two years after tree clearing due to the channels from remaining roots decomposition in the soil profile however after four years of cropping following clearing these roots channels collapsed and was compressed which caused declining infiltration rate with increasing cropping time in our study the loess soil is loose by nature and disturbance such as felling a orchard only has a short term effect on soil physical properties therefore it only affect the initial change of deep soil water storage as shown as the intercept of the linear relationship between soil water storage and time since felling the orchards fig 5 based on the discussion above we can conceptualize the deep drainage or deep soil water recharge as a leaky bucket fig 6a in a crop field the shallow root zone as the bucket having a relatively large hole has a large deep drainage rate and the measured deep drainage rate under a long term crop land is around 33 1 3 mm yr 1 li et al 2018 when an orchard is established on a previously crop field the deep drainage rate does not change in the first few years as the evapotranpiration rate does not change much when the trees are young 8 years old li et al 2019a b subsequently as tree ages roots deepens and lai increases resulting in a large et and smaller deep drainage rate analogous to a leacky bucket the hole in the bucket becomes smaller resulting in smaller and smaller deep drainage rate when the tree age is around 15 year or older the hole in the bucket becomes so smaller that the deep drainage rate become zero this is exactly shown in li et al 2018 in this study we show that when the trees are felled and an annual crop is cultivated the hole in the bucket is bigger than the orchard resulting an increased deep drainage rate 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 and the deep drainage rate remains unchanged as the time increased since the conversion fig 6b 4 3 implications of water replenishment in deep soil after deep roots removal previous studies show that for the mature orchards 15 years in the same study area the deep soil water depletion reached 1051 1530 mm with the maximum rooting depth deficit zone ranging from 18 4 m to 23 2 m li et al 2019b the deep soil water deficit could greatly reduce the resiliency and sustainability of the orchards and other agroforests perhaps proper orchards grain crops rotation should be adopted wang et al 2012 2011a 2011b given the measured deep drainage rate of 22 mm yr 1 after orchard removal fig 4 it would take 48 69 years to fully replenish the soil water deficit in deep soil table 2 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a therefore our result provides guidance for planning a reasonable rotation system of agro forest economic plants obviously suitable fallow periods may allow deep soil water to be replenished fast to maintain the crop yields for the agro forest rotation furthermore research has shown the greatly increased groundwater recharge or deep drainage after deep rooted vegetation removal cook et al 2001 favreau et al 2009 scanlon et al 2006 for example in australia the estimated deep drainage after replacement of native vegetation by crops ranged between 0 1 and 50 mm yr 1 with an average value of 10 mm yr 1 which is 100 times larger than that prior to cultivation cook et al 2001 however their estimated recharge or drainage rates assuming the steady sate right after the conversion are averaged over 30 years after tree or shrub removal the temporal change of deep drainage after deep rooted vegetation removal received little attention in vadose zone which is needed to understand the change of water yield after deforestation brown et al 2005 our results show that for annual crops the deep drainage rates jump to a high value immediately after the conversion and then retains a smaller value after this provides another case scenario for deep drainage rate after deforestation a sudden increase in soil water storage and then a constant deep drainage after orchard removal fig 6 therefore this helps enhance understanding the transient process of deep drainage in vadose zone after disturbances deforestation wildfires insects etc 5 conclusions in this study we applied the space for time method to investigate the short term 20 years impact of duration of cultivation of crop land after deep rooted vegetation removal on soil water storage and deep drainage rates our results show that the conversion leads to replenishment of desiccated deep soil and the replenishing front progressively move into deep soil as a result deep soil water storage increased linearly with time after removal deep soil water storage jumps to a high values 104 mm shortly after the conversion and then retain a constant value of 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 our results disclosed new insight about the transient process of soil water replenishment in deep soil after felling deep rooted vegetation our results have important implications for managing deep soil water under an ever increasing occurrence of droughts with rotation of deep rooted and shallow rooted vegetation it also provides valuable information for

9727,deep soil water management is important for agroforests to combat frequent droughts however little is known about how deep soil water up to 15 0 m and its deep drainage after trees fell evolves with time 20 years in deep vadose zone therefore this study was aimed at evaluating the impact of orchards removal on the replenishment of deep soil water and its deep drainage in a sub humid region on the loess plateau china lpc we established paired experimental plots between cultivated farmlands after deforested land and mature aged orchards soil water storage and deep drainage were calculated from the measured soil water contents based on deep soil sampling down to 6 15 0 m then the time evolution of soil water storage and deep drainage rates were obtained based on the space for time substitution results showed that the replenishing front indicated by the increase of soil water deepened with time after orchard removal which progressively increased deep soil water content the drainage rates increased suddenly right after orchard removal and attained a constant value of 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 after the conversion with this deep drainage rate deep soil water deficit created by prior mature orchards would require 48 69 years of annual crop cultivation therefore this study helps improve the further understanding of ecohydrological process under land use and management of deep soil water storage for increasing resiliency of agroforests to climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords deforestation soil water replenishment deep drainage temporal change deep vadose zone 1 introduction expansion of agricultural frontier drive primarily the deforestation to maintain their productivity and resilience to climate change the afforested economical and agro forests require felling and possible rotation in arid and semi arid regions most of native tree species and afforested trees are deep rooted to take advantage of deep soil water reserve li et al 2018 2019b rempe and dietrich 2018 therefore deforestation and felling agro forested trees often result in converting deep rooted vegetation to shallow rooted croplands as a result water yields in water cycle increases substantially altering soil water runoff streamflow and groundwater conte et al 2019 gatti et al 2021 straaten et al 2015 conversion from deep rooted forests into shallow rooted croplands lead to increased soil water storage particularly in deep soil due to reduced evapotranspiration seyfried and wilcox 2010 zhang et al 2020b however in arid and semi arid zones deep soil is generally desiccated due to excessive water demand from the deep rooted vegetation once depleted soil water is difficult to replenish and may take a long time to replenish because little excess water passed through the rooting zone of shallow rooted vegetation li et al 2018 for example wang et al 2007 reported that it took at least 40 150 years to fully replenish the depleted soil water after artificial forest was cut down or dead meanwhile huang et al 2006 simulated the replenishment of soil water after aged orchard removal indicating longer time 6 5 19 5 years for the 0 10 m soil profile than 0 3 m profile zhang et al 2020b estimated that 26 years are required to replenish the deep soil water after apple trees are felled these three studies were all conducted on the loess plateau yet the time it takes for a full replenishment of deep soil water differ by a large margin accurately accounting for the time it takes for the deep soil water to be replenished is critical to proper management of deep soil water but remain uncertain the reason is that previous studies did not sample either deep enough or frequent enough to capture the salient feature of deep soil water replenishment processes deforestation also increases deep drainage or and groundwater recharge favreau et al 2009 scanlon et al 2007 in deep vadose zone the increase of deep drainage was estimated as the average values over decades after clearing cook et al 2001 santoni et al 2010 this is because in reported cleared cases native vegetation for the expansion of agriculture was cleared at least 30 years ago even up to 100 years however it would take more time some decades to hundred years to attain a new steady state dependent on the depth of water table drainage rates and initial water content in unsaturated zone jolly et al 1989 moore et al 2012 therefore previous studies only provided long term average outcomes about the leaching of unsaturated salt inventories and soil water increase and its fluxes since native vegetation removal over past decades to century cook et al 2001 santoni et al 2010 scanlon et al 2007 such estimated deep drainage provides limited information on the evolution of groundwater recharge after deforestation hence short term temporal 20 years changes of deep drainage or and groundwater recharge after deep root vegetation removal remains unclear for us the loess plateau china lpc is located in the northwest inland of china mostly semi arid and sub humid regions and registered the largest afforestation efforts on earth sustainability of these forests provide guidance for similar efforts on earth to mitigate climate change as is known afforested vegetation roots deeper and deeper to extract deeper soil water leading to wide spread deep soil desiccation wang et al 2011a 2011b the consequence of this continued deep soil desiccation is the decreased productivity and frequent occurrence of drought stress and diseases feng et al 2016 mendham et al 2011 shao et al 2018 the yield of apple orchards dropped continually with deep soil desiccation aggravation feng et al 2016 shao et al 2018 as a result this economic vegetation they are often cut or cleared in order to replenish the deep soil water huang and gallichand 2006 wang et al 2011a 2011b wang et al 2008 however how the clearing affects soil water in deep soil and its deep drainage rate remain uncertain moreover understanding the impact of this land use change from deep rooted to shallow rooted vegetation have great significance in the sustainable management of water and land resources locally further given the increasingly frequent and severe drought occurrence proper management of deep soil water to combat droughts dictates the success of afforestation efforts and income of farmers on the loess plateau therefore to understand how soil water and its storage are replenished is also urgent given ecological economic and social benefits especially economic vegetation mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2020b therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to examine the change of deep soil water content and its storage beneath croplands on previously deep rooted orchards and 2 to identify the temporal evolution 20 years in deep drainage after orchard removal through deep soil sampling we capture the change of soil water in deep soil from vertical profiles 0 15 m and estimates its drainage rates under croplands after apple orchards removal paired experimental plots between cultivated farmlands after removal treatment plots and mature orchards before removal control plots were set up capitalizing on the space for time substitution design we will investigate the time evolution of soil moisture and its deep drainage following felling an orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the proximity to the changwu agro ecological station located in the southeastern portion typical tableland and gully region of the lpc 35 12 n 107 40 e fig 1 the experimental site is relatively flat in topography with an elevation of 1225 m above sea level this region is subject to warm temperate semi humid and continental monsoon climate with a long term 1957 2017 mean precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of 578 and 893 mm respectively http cwa cern ac cn meta metadata the precipitation is non uniformly distributed over different seasons about 55 of which falls between july and september the soil is developed on eolian deposits with predominantly silt loamy soil with a silt content at least 0 5 g g 1 the field capacity is about 0 28 m3 m 3 and permanent wilting point is 0 11 m3 m 3 the deep loess profile is relatively even and porous which is conducive to plant root penetration the land use almost all rain fed includes farmland wheat maize and orchards apple on the plateau and mostly grasslands with some bush encroachment or woody species apricot robinia on hillslopes the water table is very deep ranging from 30 to 100 m below surface and thus groundwater is not involved in transpiration due to favorable conditions such as temperature mean annual temperature 9 4 c sunshine and rainfall this area was found suitable for producing high quality apples therefore since 1980s farmers have gradually converted most agricultural crop into apple orchards in this region when the orchard is older than 20 years deep soil water is depleted leaving little deep soil water to supplement transpiration in dry seasons and to combat frequent drought occurrence as a result those orchards are prone to diseases and canopy dieback leading to poor productivity and economic income clearance of these orchards and return to annual crop become a popular practice in the regions 2 2 filed experimental design and soil sampling to study the long term change of deep soil water 10 m and its drainage after plantation removal observations in situ in the field are a long term endeavor and time consuming considering the soil is horizontally uniformly distributed on the plateau the method of space for time substitution was adopted we adopt paired experimental plot design consisted of six treatment removal sites and two types of control sites on the flat plateau these sites had identical topography and elevation due to paired sampling the horizontal variation of soil texture especially within eolian loess regions was negligible li et al 2018 2019a these treatment sites had been cultivated with shallow rooted cropland maize or wheat since deep rooted apple orchards was removed before removal these apple orchards were all planted in 1983 and then were individually cut down respectively in 2015 2014 2013 2009 2005 and 2000 for convenience they are referred to as ch1 ch2 ch3 ch7 ch10 11 and ch15 16 respectively thus the ages of all the cleared apple orchards were at least 17 years 17 32 years due to less water demand and shallow roots of maize and wheat deep soil water began to be replenished following felling apple orchards the ch15 profile was sampled in november 2015 in the same plot with ch16 profile with a distance of 5 0 m from each other and in 2015 the plot ch1 was cultivated with vegetables for each of the other six treatment sites 2 4 deep cores were taken at each plot as replicates in total 15 deep cores 6 13 m were obtained in the field we have two types of control plots one is the long term annual crop field where a total of three cores were taken between 2015 and 2017 referred to as cp2015 cp2016 and cp2017 thereafter the other type of control plots are the mature orchards we took one core was taken in 2017 from each of the standing apple orchards of 16 19 23 and 33 years old referred to as ap16 ap19 ap23 and ap33 years these two types of control sites served as the upper and lower limit for the deep soil water storage respectively therefore in addition to the 15 cores taken in the treatment plots additional seven deep cores 15 m sampled in control plots for comparisons with the treatment plots the deep soil cores were obtained with a hollow stem auger with stem extension at a sampling interval of 0 20 m to a depth of 6 15 m each sample about 40 g was put into an aluminum box and oven dried at 105 c for 12 h to determine soil water content the detailed information about the sampling in the field was listed in table 1 2 3 soil water storage increase and its deep drainage after orchard removal for shallow rooted maize field in our study area the rooting depth root zone defined as the depth above which 95 of roots are located was 2 m shao et al 2019 in the present study soil above the rooting depth is defined as shallow soil and below is deep soil therefore in reconverted croplands the deep soil water storage increase 2 0 m after orchard removal was calculated as follow 1 δ s 2 r d θ ch z θ ap z dz i n θ i ch θ i ap d i where s is the deep soil water increase after orchard reconverted into croplands mm θ ch z and θ ap z are the soil water contents beneath shallow rooted croplands treatment plots and deep rooted apple orchards control plots at depth z and r d is the maximum depth of replenishing front or sampling depth for each reconverted cropland m θ i ch and θ i ap are the soil water contents m3 m 3 in the depth increment i below 2 0 m for shallow rooted croplands and deep rooted apple orchards control plots respectively d i is the thickness m of depth increment i and is equal to 0 2 m in this study assuming all the water entered into deep soil remain in the deep soil the deep drainage rate d mm yr 1 after deep rooted vegetation removal can be calculated as the derivative of deep soil water storage increase s with respect to time t yr since the orchard removal for the reconverted croplands 2 d ds dt 2 4 analyzing variation in estimated deep drainage as is evident from eqs 1 and 2 we know that the variation in estimated d is mainly from the variation in θ i ch based on the first order perturbation analysis of eqs 1 and 2 the standard

beneath long term croplands and mature orchards for the seven deep soil water profiles fig 2 under both long term croplands and orchards there are large variations in soil water contents in the shallow layer in each of the plots reflecting the collective influence of evaporation transpiration and precipitation infiltration the shallow soils of ap33 and cp2015 had particularly lower soil water contents likely because sampling at these sites occurred at a dry period conversely deep soil water content showed the minor variation below the root zone 2 15 0 m in the three long term cultivated croplands fig 2 p 0 05 with the average soil water content for the three croplands 2 0 15 0 m being 0 273 0 007 m3 m 3 moreover there was also no significant difference in deep soil water content at the depth between 2 0 and 12 0 m among the four different stand aged orchards fig 2 p 0 05 the four mature orchards had the average value soil water content of 0 187 0 008 m3 m 3 from the depth of 2 0 12 0 m however at depth of 12 0 15 0 m soil water contents for ap16 and ap19 were slightly larger than those for ap23 and ap33 fig 2 p 0 05 this suggests that mature orchards like ap16 and ap19 were still extracting soil water at the depth of 12 0 15 0 m furthermore deep soil water content in the four orchards were significantly smaller than those in the three farmlands fig 2 p 0 05 and total water loss 2 0 12 0 m was up to 1135 33 mm between the four orchards and long term cropland the deep soil water loss is purely due to transpiration because of the greater depth which amounts for 2 years of annual precipitation 3 2 deep soil water increase and its variation following orchard removal for all croplands reconverted from apple orchards we observed the increase of soil water in deep soil relative to that of the apple orchards but the increase occurred only in the top 10 m fig 3 moreover relative to the long term crop land there were large variations in soil water contents between the replicated soil cores within the same crop land reconverted from apple orchards and the variations are particularly evident during the first seven years p 0 05 fig 2 fig 3 table 2 further these large variations were mainly manifested above 7 0 m below 7 0 m in deep soil the variation in soil water content were much smaller fig 3 an exception is the ch15 16 plot where there was larger variation due mainly to lower soil water contents 2 0 7 0 m in ch16 profile one possible explanation is that vegetables grown in the ch16 plot had higher water demand than other croplands fig 3 fig 4 shows the soil water content profile averaged over the three replicated soil cores for each crop land with the removal time increasing the replenishing front defined as wetting front tended to develop into greater depth for the first three years after orchards removal the replenishing front was displaced downward to the depth of about 7 0 m fig 4 and there was a significant increase in the average soil water content relative to that under apple orchards p 0 05 fig 4 table 2 from three to 10 5 years after the conversion the replenishment front continued to deepen to about 10 0 m and the average soil water content 2 10 0 m increasing from 0 198 0 012 m3 m 3 to 0 216 0 014 m3 m 3 for cropland table 2 then 10 5 years after an orchard was felled replenishing front began to broaden while advancing further into deep soil fig 4 this resulted in significant soil water content increase p 0 05 table 2 however the deepening depth was still limited above 10 0 m fig 4 3 3 linear increase of water storage in deep soil following orchard removal deep soil water content and its storage continually increased with the advancement of the replenishing front fig 3 and 4 as expected water storage in deep soil 2 10 0 m suddenly increased in the first year after being felled then the soil water storage increases ranged from 139 15 mm at year 1 to 504 23 mm at 15 16 years after orchard removal fig 5 table 2 the increases have a positive linear relationship with time after deep rooted orchards removal p 0 05 r2 0 92 with a slope of 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 and an intercept of 104 3 23 8 mm this suggests that the sudden increase in soil water storage is 104 3 mm right after felling the apple trees more importantly linear increase of water storage in deep soil per unit time defining drainage rate eq 2 was 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 after orchard removal and remained largely constant after the first year we calculated the deep drainage rate between two consecutive years after felling an orchard table 2 the calculated deep drainage rates varied from 25 0 to 139 3 mm yr 1 table 2 with an arithmetic average of 38 7 mm yr 1 and the time weighted average of 32 5 mm yr 1 the large variation in calculated deep drainage rates is likely a result of yearly variation of annual precipitation if we subtract the intercept fig 5 from the first year s drainage rate 139 3 mm yr 1 then the arithmetic and time weighted averages of deep drainage rates are 21 3 and 25 8 mm yr 1 respectively these two values are much closer to the slope 22 0 mm yr 1 from fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 field variation of deep soil water after orchard removal the average soil water contents at the depth between 2 0 and 12 0 m did not differ between the apple orchards from 16 to 33 years old with the average soil water content of about 0 187 m3 m 3 for the four orchards p 0 05 fig 2 this indicates that the average soil water content in deep soil was at the lower limit of available water content to deep roots moreover despite of the different stand ages strikingly uniformity of soil water content in 2 12 0 m profiles make it reasonable to assume the initial soil water contents at the depth of 2 0 12 m were the same when an orchard 16 years old was fell regardless of the stand ages in another word these cleared plots were previously apple orchards with a stand age between 17 and 32 years had similar deep soil water contents and storage at the depth of 2 12 0 m at the beginning of deep soil water recovery despite of being reconverted into croplands at different years this uniformity over stand age and depth allows accurate calculated deep drainage from the increase of deep soil water storage after orchard removal eq 2 however after conversion into croplands deep soil water contents displayed larger variations fig 3 table 2 the causes for such an elevated variability can be spatial variability of soil texture and water input however the loess deposit though having a striking stratigraphy is relatively uniform horizontally variation in soil texture li et al 2019a in the same study area as the present study li et al 2019b measured the vertical profiles 0 20 m of soil particle composition under five apple orchards and three farmlands and found no significant difference in soil texture among the eight soil profiles p 0 05 moreover in this study deep soil water contents did not differ significantly between the three long term cultivated lands p 0 05 fig 2 therefore soil texture could not lead to the larger variation in deep soil water content after deforestation land use changes may have altered the soil physical properties and thus affected soil infiltration rates veldkamp et al 2020 sun et al 2018 yimer et al 2010 for example increased bulk density and penetration resistance decreased infiltration rates and saturated conductivity occurred after reported tree clearing lal 1996 lal and cummings 1979 neris et al 2012 this is because removing deep rooted tree often leave many roots in soil and their subsequent decomposition could create macro pores locally ghuman et al 1991 hulugalle 1994 in our study we observed during our sampling that many roots remain in the field after apple orchards removal by an excavator creating channels for water infiltration but the spatial locations vertical and horizontal of these roots are rather random leading to large variation of in soil physical properties and soil water contents ghuman et al 1991 lal 1996 these differences in soil physical properties and macroporosity may alter the partition of precipitation into deep soil water storage and shallow soil water storage at different sites creating spatial variation ali et al 2018 found that infiltration rate was higher in the abandoned apple orchards than that in normal apple orchard which was due to more macro pores in the abandoned apple orchards ali et al 2018 zheng et al 2017 thus high deep soil water contents can be expected in the taproot area fig s1 the greater soil water content profile in ch1 2 3 7 plots may be a result of preferential flow in the taproot zone 4 2 a sudden increase in soil water storage and then a constant deep drainage after orchard removal a leaky bucket model for deep soil water recharge there was dramatic increase in deep soil water storage right after the tree being felled fig 5 this increase could be a result of sudden change of evapotranspiration rate thus the water demand by the vegetation the apple trees had a deeper root system shao et al 2019 moreover the area is characterized by large precipitation events in the summer and often there is a brief period when the rainfall amount is large than the evapotranspiration in a crop field having a shallower root zone large rainfall events was easier to pass the root zone and becomes deep soil recharge than that in an apple orchard our results show that soil water storage increased linearly with time 1 year after orchards were felled fig 4 this suggests that there is a rather constant deep drainage rate to the deep soil from shallow soil following trees being felled this is different from previous studies that found that after deep rooted shrub or bush clearing a high deep drainage rate appeared initially after removal followed by a sharp declining moore et al 2010 2012 silburn et al 2009 similarly moore et al 2010 reported that the hydrologic change following bush removal was evident in the first five years with the peak of leaching chloride attained the maximium depth subsequently deep drainage decreased sharply after five years this was atributed to the gradual reestablishment of some native shrub moore et al 2010 2012 the difference between our study and the previous studies lies in that after deforestation annual crop is normally cultivated and fertilized making the establishment of a successful crop rather rapidly in the first year while previous study focuses on a natural reestablishment of vegetation through plant succession which often takes time table 2 shows large variation of deep drainage rates within the 16 years after felling the orchards even with the intercept removed from the first year s data the deep drainage rates still varied from 25 to 42 4 mm yr 1 this large variability may be related to climatic variations and soil management as shown by hu et al 2019 precipitation is the dominant factor affecting deep drainage rate and the precipitation varied from 490 to 954 from 2000 to 2016 http cwa cern ac cn meta metadata it is reasonable to assume the precipitation contribute largely to the variability in deep drainage rates shown in table 2 the temporal variation of deep drainage in the field can also result from the temporal change of soil physical property ghuman et al 1991 reported the higher infiltration rates in the first two years after tree clearing due to the channels from remaining roots decomposition in the soil profile however after four years of cropping following clearing these roots channels collapsed and was compressed which caused declining infiltration rate with increasing cropping time in our study the loess soil is loose by nature and disturbance such as felling a orchard only has a short term effect on soil physical properties therefore it only affect the initial change of deep soil water storage as shown as the intercept of the linear relationship between soil water storage and time since felling the orchards fig 5 based on the discussion above we can conceptualize the deep drainage or deep soil water recharge as a leaky bucket fig 6a in a crop field the shallow root zone as the bucket having a relatively large hole has a large deep drainage rate and the measured deep drainage rate under a long term crop land is around 33 1 3 mm yr 1 li et al 2018 when an orchard is established on a previously crop field the deep drainage rate does not change in the first few years as the evapotranpiration rate does not change much when the trees are young 8 years old li et al 2019a b subsequently as tree ages roots deepens and lai increases resulting in a large et and smaller deep drainage rate analogous to a leacky bucket the hole in the bucket becomes smaller resulting in smaller and smaller deep drainage rate when the tree age is around 15 year or older the hole in the bucket becomes so smaller that the deep drainage rate become zero this is exactly shown in li et al 2018 in this study we show that when the trees are felled and an annual crop is cultivated the hole in the bucket is bigger than the orchard resulting an increased deep drainage rate 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 and the deep drainage rate remains unchanged as the time increased since the conversion fig 6b 4 3 implications of water replenishment in deep soil after deep roots removal previous studies show that for the mature orchards 15 years in the same study area the deep soil water depletion reached 1051 1530 mm with the maximum rooting depth deficit zone ranging from 18 4 m to 23 2 m li et al 2019b the deep soil water deficit could greatly reduce the resiliency and sustainability of the orchards and other agroforests perhaps proper orchards grain crops rotation should be adopted wang et al 2012 2011a 2011b given the measured deep drainage rate of 22 mm yr 1 after orchard removal fig 4 it would take 48 69 years to fully replenish the soil water deficit in deep soil table 2 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a therefore our result provides guidance for planning a reasonable rotation system of agro forest economic plants obviously suitable fallow periods may allow deep soil water to be replenished fast to maintain the crop yields for the agro forest rotation furthermore research has shown the greatly increased groundwater recharge or deep drainage after deep rooted vegetation removal cook et al 2001 favreau et al 2009 scanlon et al 2006 for example in australia the estimated deep drainage after replacement of native vegetation by crops ranged between 0 1 and 50 mm yr 1 with an average value of 10 mm yr 1 which is 100 times larger than that prior to cultivation cook et al 2001 however their estimated recharge or drainage rates assuming the steady sate right after the conversion are averaged over 30 years after tree or shrub removal the temporal change of deep drainage after deep rooted vegetation removal received little attention in vadose zone which is needed to understand the change of water yield after deforestation brown et al 2005 our results show that for annual crops the deep drainage rates jump to a high value immediately after the conversion and then retains a smaller value after this provides another case scenario for deep drainage rate after deforestation a sudden increase in soil water storage and then a constant deep drainage after orchard removal fig 6 therefore this helps enhance understanding the transient process of deep drainage in vadose zone after disturbances deforestation wildfires insects etc 5 conclusions in this study we applied the space for time method to investigate the short term 20 years impact of duration of cultivation of crop land after deep rooted vegetation removal on soil water storage and deep drainage rates our results show that the conversion leads to replenishment of desiccated deep soil and the replenishing front progressively move into deep soil as a result deep soil water storage increased linearly with time after removal deep soil water storage jumps to a high values 104 mm shortly after the conversion and then retain a constant value of 22 0 3 1 mm yr 1 our results disclosed new insight about the transient process of soil water replenishment in deep soil after felling deep rooted vegetation our results have important implications for managing deep soil water under an ever increasing occurrence of droughts with rotation of deep rooted and shallow rooted vegetation it also provides valuable information for

various industrial applications globally after cassava manihot esculenta sweet potatoes ipomoea batatas and yam dioscorea alata faostat 2019 the starchy tubers are a valuable source of health promoting phytonutrients including carbohydrates minerals i e iron zinc magnesium phosphorus and potassium vitamins i e vitamins c b3 b5 b6 and fibre and proteins with their content ranging from 1 to

flavonols and anthocyanins as well as alkaloids such as glycoalkaloids which promote health and possess antioxidant and anti cancer properties singh and raigond 2014 akyol et al 2016 potatoes are largely produced under rainfed conditions and production is affected by abiotic stress factors mainly drought and heat abd el wahab et al 2016 which result in a low yield output and makes them unsuitable for marketing kiptoo et al 2018 an effort is required to develop well adapted and drought tolerant potato genotypes in order to improve the yield gains and the overall production as well as quality end user potato derived products by the processing industries agronomic traits are a key determinant of the potato tuber yield in water restricted environments and they are useful indicators in the assessment of drought tolerance traits such as plant height leaf number and total above ground biomass are widely used for the selection of drought tolerant potato genotypes tourneux et al 2003a agronomic traits are correlated well with yield and serve as indirect selection criteria for cultivar development mahmud et al 2016 physiological traits including the chlorophyll content index cci the rate of photosynthesis a stomatal conductance gs transpiration tr the relative water content rwc which measure the plant water status and instantaneous water use efficiency iwue or water productivity wp are also useful indicators of drought tolerance tourneux et al 2003b aliche et al 2019 these traits can be targeted in breeding programs to select and identify promising genotypes for production in a targeted environment tourneux et al 2003b ramirez et al 2014 therefore the integration of agronomic and physiological traits is useful for improving the identification and selection of drought tolerant genotypes the growth of potatoes occurs in various stages these include the vegetative tuber initiation tuber bulking and maturity stages all potato growth stages are sensitive to a deficit in irrigation however the most drought sensitive are the tuber initiation and bulking stages whereas the early vegetative and maturity stages are regarded as tolerant to drought stress hirut et al 2017 a deficit of irrigation reduces the total yield across all the potato growth stages as a result the interactive effects of the genotype the developmental stage as well as the environment influence the response of potatoes to drought stress this is important for identifying the growth stage specific or all stage adaptation of genotypes for specific cultivation in dry environments in order to improve yield potential in south africa drought stress is the leading factor that reduce potato yield and quality daff 2017 the potato yield output in this country has slowly increased from 1 2 to 2 5 million tons for the period from 1990 to 2015 potatopro 2017 in addition its production is insufficient due to the high demand for the crop by neighbouring countries such as botswana lesotho namibia swaziland zambia and zimbabwe kapuya and sihlobo 2015 very limited efforts have been made to develop potato genotypes with a high levels of drought tolerance across all growth stages which can be recommended to growers the genotypes that are currently and widely grown in the country could serve as a useful germplasm for developing specific and across stage tolerant potato genotypes in order to improve yield output and quality in a water constrained production environments although extensive research has been carried out to determine the response of potato genotypes to different water regimes alsharari et al 2007 elzner et al 2018 limited information is available on the response of potatoes to different growth stages and how this influences yield performance therefore the objective of this study was to determine the drought tolerance of diverse potato genotypes based on their physiological and morphological responses in order to identify and recommend ideal genotypes for

yield potential under water constrained conditions developing potato genotypes that have drought tolerance during different crop growth stages namely the vegetative tuber initiation tuber bulking and maturity stages extends the season and is key for improving potato yield outputs and gains hassan et al 2002 alsharari et al 2007 the current study evaluated the drought tolerance of potato genotypes at different growth stages based on their physiological and morphological traits that were assessed under well irrigated and deficit irrigation conditions the significant interaction between genotypes x deficit irrigation x growth stage for the studied traits indicated that the genotypes performed differently across the different growth stages table 5 this is useful for identifying and selecting potato genotypes with a specific growth stage adaptation which can be recommended for cultivation for example genotypes such as bikini electra and mondial with a high yield potential under deficit irrigation conditions at the vegetative stage are useful for breeding or cultivation fig 9 deficit irrigation significantly reduced the tuber yield at the tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages the tuber initiation drought tolerant genotypes included sifra and challenger while tyson and sifra were high yielders at tuber bulking stage tyson challenger and electra had good yield performance at the maturity stage under deficit irrigation and are useful for cultivation in an environment with a low water supply physiological and morphological traits are widely targeted in potato enhancement programmes to develop high yielding genotypes with an improved level of abiotic stress tolerance tourneux et al 2003a 2003b alsharari et al 2007 mahmud et al 2016 ramirez et al 2016 hirut et al 2017 elzner et al 2018 the current study revealed a positive and significant correlation between the rate of photosynthesis and transpiration at the vegetative stage table 6 this suggests that the rate of photosynthesis was mostly influenced by the transpiration rate or stomatal conductance after deficit irrigation was imposed at the vegetative stage the total above ground biomass plant height and number of leaves can be selected to improve the rate of photosynthesis during the tuber initiation under deficit irrigation however at the tuber bulking and maturity stages a negative but significant correlation was observed between the rate of photosynthesis plant height and the number of leaves the negative or poor correlation between the agronomic traits such as plant height the number of leaves and total above ground biomass with the tuber yield at the vegetative and the tuber bulking stages suggests that the studied genotypes are capable of producing yield regardless of the high total above ground biomass this also explains the reason why plant height and number of leaves were unaffected by the deficit irrigation at the tuber initiation however the total yield was reduced fig 9 traits such as the plant height transpiration photosynthesis and instantaneous water use efficiency during the tuber initiation and chlorophyll content index are positively correlated with the total yield at maturity and can be used as a selection condition for improving the yield of the genotypes under deficit irrigation 5 conclusion the present study evaluated response of potato genotypes to deficit irrigation that were imposed at different growth stages in order to select drought tolerant genotypes that are best suited to cultivation in environments with restricted accessibility to water genotypes with a higher water productivity and yield were identified as the most tolerant genotypes since they responded consistently at various stages under deficit irrigation therefore it is proposed that the bikini and tyson genotypes are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the vegetative stage electra and tyson are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the tuber initiation stage electra and panamera are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the tuber bulking stage while bikini and challenger are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the maturity stage these genotypes can be recommended for environments with restricted access to water and they can still produce optimum yields meanwhile sababa panamera and mondial were identified as the most sensitive genotypes while challenger sifra and tyson were identified as the all rounder genotypes that are resistant in all stages declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the university of kwazulu natal and foodbev are thanked for financial support of this

deficit irrigation leaf gaseous exchange photosynthesis water productivity yield 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is an economically important tuber crop widely cultivated for food and various industrial applications globally after cassava manihot esculenta sweet potatoes ipomoea batatas and yam dioscorea alata faostat 2019 the starchy tubers are a valuable source of health promoting phytonutrients including carbohydrates minerals i e iron zinc magnesium phosphorus and potassium vitamins i e vitamins c b3 b5 b6 and fibre and proteins with their content ranging from 1 to 1 5 and 8 9 for fresh and processed tubers respectively singh and raigond 2014 wassu 2017 the crop is also a valuable source of phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids and flavonoids which include flavonols and anthocyanins as well as alkaloids such as glycoalkaloids which promote health and possess antioxidant and anti cancer properties singh and raigond 2014 akyol et al 2016 potatoes are largely produced under rainfed conditions and production is affected by abiotic stress factors mainly drought and heat abd el wahab et al 2016 which result in a low yield output and makes them unsuitable for marketing kiptoo et al 2018 an effort is required to develop well adapted and drought tolerant potato genotypes in order to improve the yield gains and the overall production as well as quality end user potato derived products by the processing industries agronomic traits are a key determinant of the potato tuber yield in water restricted environments and they are useful indicators in the assessment of drought tolerance traits such as plant height leaf number and total above ground biomass are widely used for the selection of drought tolerant potato genotypes tourneux et al 2003a agronomic traits are correlated well with yield and serve as indirect selection criteria for cultivar development mahmud et al 2016 physiological traits including the chlorophyll content index cci the rate of photosynthesis a stomatal conductance gs transpiration tr the relative water content rwc which measure the plant water status and instantaneous water use efficiency iwue or water productivity wp are also useful indicators of drought tolerance tourneux et al 2003b aliche et al 2019 these traits can be targeted in breeding programs to select and identify promising genotypes for production in a targeted environment tourneux et al 2003b ramirez et al 2014 therefore the integration of agronomic and physiological traits is useful for improving the identification and selection of drought tolerant genotypes the growth of potatoes occurs in various stages these include the vegetative tuber initiation tuber bulking and maturity stages all potato growth stages are sensitive to a deficit in irrigation however the most drought sensitive are the tuber initiation and bulking stages whereas the early vegetative and maturity stages are regarded as tolerant to drought stress hirut et al 2017 a deficit of irrigation reduces the total yield across all the potato growth stages as a result the interactive effects of the genotype the developmental stage as well as the environment influence the response of potatoes to drought stress this is important for identifying the growth stage specific or all stage adaptation of genotypes for specific cultivation in dry environments in order to improve yield potential in south africa drought stress is the leading factor that reduce potato yield and quality daff 2017 the potato yield output in this country has slowly increased from 1 2 to 2 5 million tons for the period from 1990 to 2015 potatopro 2017 in addition its production is insufficient due to the high demand for the crop by neighbouring countries such as botswana lesotho namibia swaziland zambia and zimbabwe kapuya and sihlobo 2015 very limited efforts have been made to develop potato genotypes with a high levels of drought tolerance across all growth stages which can be recommended to growers the genotypes that are currently and widely grown in the country could serve as a useful germplasm for developing specific and across stage tolerant potato genotypes in order to improve yield output and quality in a water constrained production environments although extensive research has been carried out to determine the response of potato genotypes to different water regimes alsharari et al 2007 elzner et al 2018 limited information is available on the response of potatoes to different growth stages and how this influences yield performance therefore the objective of this study was to determine the drought tolerance of diverse potato genotypes based on their physiological and morphological responses in order to identify and recommend ideal genotypes for production and breeding 2 material and methods 2 1 plant materials the certified seed i e generation 1 3 of eight potato genotypes namely bikini g1 challenger g2 electra g3 mondial g4 panamera g5

principal component biplot analysis for assessed agronomic and physiological traits under well irrigated and deficit irrigation conditions at the various growth stages principal component analysis pca biplot analysis which shows the percent variance for pc1 and pc2 for the studied potato genotypes under wi and di conditions at four growth stages is shown in fig 11 all the evaluated genotypes that performed better in a specific measured trait were grouped nearby and furthest to the vector line under di conditions bikini and challenger were differentiated from the other genotypes based on their

electra and tyson recorded higher cci iwue or wp and nl values and were grouped together fig 11d 4 discussion drought stress that occurs during the critical growth stages in potatoes results in a low yield potential under water constrained conditions developing potato genotypes that have drought tolerance during different crop growth stages namely the vegetative tuber initiation tuber bulking and maturity stages extends the season and is key for improving potato yield outputs and gains hassan et al 2002 alsharari et al 2007 the current study evaluated the drought tolerance of potato genotypes at different growth stages based on their physiological and morphological traits that were assessed under well irrigated and deficit irrigation conditions the significant interaction between genotypes x deficit irrigation x growth stage for the studied traits indicated that the genotypes performed differently across the different growth stages table 5 this is useful for identifying and selecting potato genotypes with a specific growth stage adaptation which can be recommended for cultivation for example genotypes such as bikini electra and mondial with a high yield potential under deficit irrigation conditions at the vegetative stage are useful for breeding or cultivation fig 9 deficit irrigation significantly reduced the tuber yield at the tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages the tuber initiation drought tolerant genotypes included sifra and challenger while tyson and sifra were high yielders at tuber bulking stage tyson challenger and electra had good yield performance at the maturity stage under deficit irrigation and are useful for cultivation in an environment with a low water supply physiological and morphological traits are widely targeted in potato enhancement programmes to develop high yielding genotypes with an improved level of abiotic stress tolerance tourneux et al 2003a 2003b alsharari et al 2007 mahmud et al 2016 ramirez et al 2016 hirut et al 2017 elzner et al 2018 the current study revealed a positive and significant correlation between the rate of photosynthesis and transpiration at the vegetative stage table 6 this suggests that the rate of photosynthesis was mostly influenced by the transpiration rate or stomatal conductance after deficit irrigation was imposed at the vegetative stage the total above ground biomass plant height and number of leaves can be selected to improve the rate of photosynthesis during the tuber initiation under deficit irrigation however at the tuber bulking and maturity stages a negative but significant correlation was observed between the rate of photosynthesis plant height and the number of leaves the negative or poor correlation between the agronomic traits such as plant height the number of leaves and total above ground biomass with the tuber yield at the vegetative and the tuber bulking stages suggests that the studied genotypes are capable of producing yield regardless of the high total above ground biomass this also explains the reason why plant height and number of leaves were unaffected by the deficit irrigation at the tuber initiation however the total yield was reduced fig 9 traits such as the plant height transpiration photosynthesis and instantaneous water use efficiency during the tuber initiation and chlorophyll content index are positively correlated with the total yield at maturity and can be used as a selection condition for improving the yield of the genotypes under deficit irrigation 5 conclusion the present study evaluated response of potato genotypes to deficit irrigation that were imposed at different growth stages in order to select drought tolerant genotypes that are best suited to cultivation in environments with restricted accessibility to water genotypes with a higher water productivity and yield were identified as the most tolerant genotypes since they responded consistently at various stages under deficit irrigation therefore it is proposed that the bikini and tyson genotypes are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the vegetative stage electra and tyson are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the tuber initiation stage electra and panamera are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the tuber bulking stage while bikini and challenger are tolerant to deficit irrigation at the maturity stage these genotypes can be recommended for environments with restricted access to water and they can still produce optimum yields meanwhile sababa panamera and mondial were identified as the most sensitive genotypes while challenger sifra and tyson were identified as the all rounder genotypes that are resistant in all stages declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the university of kwazulu natal and foodbev are thanked for financial support of this

9729,reliability assessment in the allocation of water resources under the changing climate condition has invaluable importance in planning the water demand at the basin scale this study details an integrated framework for evaluation of the reliability between water supply and demand under climate change scenarios in the zarrineh rood river basin in the northwest of iran initially recorded climatic data in six synoptic stations are downscaled and projected for the period 2020 2040 based on the 14 gcms using the lars wg method afterwards the swat model is used to simulate the basin hydrology with consideration to the baseline and future climate periods at six hydrometric stations finally the available water is allocated using the ribasim model based on the current supply demand chain and predefined governmental water allocation rules for different sectors results showed that under climate change the total runoff of the basin and the entrance catchments to the zarrineh rood river dam would decrease about 8 and 28 respectively the reliability of the water supply for joint drinking industrial and agricultural demands would also decrease from 96 4 to 93 4 and 90 2 89 5 respectively as such the average annual streamflow from the zarrineh rood river ending to lake urmia will reduce by 10 if the operational water projects remain active abbreviations dem digital

ribasim river basin simulation swat soil and water assessment tool swat cup swat calibration uncertainty program keywords climate change supply reliability swat ribasim water demand water resources management 1 introduction climate change is a phenomenon that has a great impact on water resources hence hydroclimatic variables such as temperature and rainfall can be deal with a great spatiotemporal change within the concept of a hydrological system jung and chang 2010 the changing climate can also alter the availability of water resources leading to outbreaks of droughts and floods in which has irreversible socio economic drawbacks ipcc et al 2007 it is obvious that the climatic events could not be the only decision criteria in the management of the water resources so that variables such as consumption rate social expectations and economic growth also have great effect on the water allocation plans devkota and gyawali 2015 climate change may exacerbate the failure of water resources management especially when timely and appropriate actions are not considered or the extensive use of water is forced through unplanned water projects zeinadini et al 2019 for this aim based on the general policies of a country and the interest of different stakeholders with different economical social and political backgrounds or the operational water resources projects any development plan can be considered dittrich et al 2016 the performance and efficiency of those projects depends mainly on the events of which are closely related to the micro climate of the region in this respect the identification of the availability of water resources under the current and future climate change scenarios is vital in the evaluation of the water supply reliability when the supply demand chain between sectors e g drinking industry and agriculture are of the interest javidi sabaghyan et al 2009 thus the prioritization of the allocated water based on the demand for available water resources as well as optimization of supply for different periods is considered as an effective strategy to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on future water consumption javidi sabaghyan et al 2009 vaghefi et al 2011 to this end many studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on water resources systems some investigated the impact of climate change on the characteristics of meteorological e g kamal and masah 2011 mathukumalli et al 2016 alexander and arblaster 2017 ishida et al 2017 peng et al 2017 danandeh mehr et al 2020 or hydrological e g kahya 2011 todd et al 2011 komozep and chung 2014 chen et al 2012 devkota and gyawali 2015 shrestha et al 2016 variables that affect the water resources system thus studies such as those conducted by zarezadeh et al 2012 li et al 2015 and zeinadini et al 2019 are suggested for further investigation when the performance of water resources systems under climate change is on the interest the mainframe of water resources management under climate change is about the incorporation of the operational water projects in the planning horizon policies and macro future decisions however when the allocation of water resources by neglecting climate change is performed the results will not have the necessary validity and accuracy in practice ipcc et al 2007 accordingly examining the reliability of water supply in satisfaction of water demand for agricultural industrial drinking and environmental uses in addition to allocation of the available water based on the predefined or dictated governmental rules for different sectors with consideration to the climate change and operational water projects is inevitable such applications are frequently addressed by the applications of the soil and water assessment tool swat and the river basin simulation ribasim that showed promising results swat arnold et al 1998 as a basin wide and well established hydrologic model is frequently used for simulating the streamflow process especially in evaluation of inflows and outflows from the reservoir or the river basin this process oriented model can simulate the hydrological processes based on the soil and water interactions and then develops estimations based on the changes of hydrologic variables in the allocated basin arnold and fohrer 2005 due to the no charge modeling simultaneous simulation of hydrological variables and agricultural management in complex basins with various land use and soil types many studies endorsed the application of swat ahmadzadeh et al 2016 when climate change is concerned the uncertainties associated with the effect of general circulation models gcms on simulation of the hydroclimatic variables are inevitable wilby and harris 2006 the selection of one gcm for analysis of climate change neither can cover the full range of uncertainties nor can guarantee the functionality of results as there is no preference among the superiority of simulated gcms danandeh mehr et al 2020 consequently the application of management and decision making tools to develop the water resources in arid regions like iran which faces water scarcity and an increase in demand is vital in such an environment a supplement of water demands without the consideration of environmental impacts would endanger the ecosystems and results in non compensatory effects on the environment harwood et al 2018 likewise the use of known models that consider simulation optimization or any hybrid model as well as simulated hydrological processes associated with the water resources system enables the aforementioned issues danandeh mehr et al 2020 in the present study the zarrineh rood river basin is addressed which is one of the main sub basin of the lake urmia basin that provides almost half of the total streamflow discharge to the water body of the lake urmia ahmadzadeh et al 2016 fathian et al 2018 vaheddoost and aksoy 2019 2021 recently a relatively large portion of lake urmia has been degraded reportedly due to a large number of water related projects especially in the agricultural sector climatic events and widespread droughts fathian 2019 fathian and vaheddoost 2021b hence various environmental problems take place in the lake s vicinity which are headlines for the debate between researchers and decision makers as well these water projects are either operational under construction or under study while the suggested solutions for saving the lake urges the development of the last two to this end the aim of this study is to examine the supply reliability of water demands under climate change while considering a scenario that relies solely on operational water projects the scope of the study incorporates the 1951 1995 past time 1996 2008 current time and 2020 2040 future time periods in studying the reliability of water supply in the assessment of the related water demands therefore i intensive data analysis is conducted ii future climatic variables are downscaled iii swat is used to evaluate streamflow processes in the basin and finally iv scenarios are used in the evaluation of the reliability of water supply using the ribasim model considering potential water demands for the operational water projects in addition the unique aspect of this study is the implementation of climate change realization in the generation of hydrological scenarios based on the regional climate factors together with the incorporation of governing rules forced by the authorities as the decision making criteria 2 study area and data the zarrineh rood river basin is the largest sub basin of the lake urmia basin 45 47 47 20 n longitudes and 35 41 37 27 e latitudes in northwest of iran fig 1 the total area of the basin is about 12 025 km2 and the length of the main river channel is about 300 km the zarrineh rood river basin provides about 47 of the total streamflow ending to lake urmia fathian et al 2018 vaheddoost and aksoy 2019 2021 the average annual rainfall in the basin is about 390 mm which has a semi arid cold climate vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 there is an active dam named zarrineh rood river dam which provides agricultural and drinking water demands with a rate of 110 mcm per year the total storage capacity of the dam is about 760 mcm and its active storage capacity is roughly 654 mcm in this respect the river basin provides water for miandoab shahin dej tekab and saghez cities which are located across the river basin ahmadzadeh et al 2016 lake urmia was known as the second largest hyper saline lake in the world an international wetland a protected zone and a national park that is home to a wide range of animal and plant species fathian et al 2016 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 the lake has been shrinking for the last decades and its water level has been declining reportedly due to different hydroclimatic and anthropogenic activities fathian 2019 fathian and vaheddoost 2021a to this end the predicament associated with the development of water projects development of agricultural zones and continuous droughts has been degraded a large portion of the lake s surface area leaving a wasteland behind a program called lake urmia integrated management plan was developed by the iranian department of environment in 2008 to develop strategies for reviving the lake therefore the zarrineh rood river basin with a total streamflow contribution of 1460 mcm per year ahmadzadeh et al 2016 is selected as the case of study which can play a pivotal role in reviving lake urmia for this the digital elevation model dem layer with a 30 m 30 m cell size resolution is acquired http www earthexplorer usgs gov demexplorer to produce the network of rivers and sub basins for the study area then the land use fig 1 and fao s soil layers are used to determine the territory of the same hydrologic response units hrus over the river basin afterward climate data including daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and monthly solar radiation in six synoptic stations scattered around the study area fig 1 are acquired from iran meteorological organization www irimo ir and used as inputs to the models then after climatic stations with long term and valid data records located inside or outside the study area are used due to the climate variability and related regional terrain streamflow data recorded in six hydrometric stations fig 1 obtained from the iranian ministry of energy were also implemented in the calibration and validation stages of the swat model it is noteworthy that 22 continuous years of daily hydroclimatic data records starting from january 1 1987 to december 31 2008 are used in the calibration of the swat model afterwards the potential river flow of the basin is estimated by swat to allocate the available water to meet the demands under the climate change conditions with respect to the dictated water rules by the authorities 3 methods the method applied in the present study can be briefed as i generating the climate change scenarios for minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall events ii setting up the swat model and estimation of the generated streamflow from the basin iii calibration of the ribasim model for the study area iv defining the effect of climate change on streamflow in swat environment and v evaluating the supply reliability associated with the rules dictated by the authorities to protect the endangered biota current water demands and the behavior of the operational water projects under climate change scenarios in this respect fig 2 illustrates the flowchart of the methodology used 3 1 generating climate change scenarios to generate temperature and rainfall data climate change scenarios are coupled with gcms ipcc et al 2007 due to the existence of a wide range of future climate simulations the long ashton research station weather generator lars wg model consisting of 14 gcms table 1 along with their related emission scenarios are used to downscale the climatic data the lars wg model is generally a stochastic weather generator that downscales coarse spatial and temporal outputs from gcms to finer scale azari et al 2021 the model generate local scale climate scenarios based on gcms for assessment of climate change by simulating weather data at a single site under both current and future climate conditions semenov and barrow 2002 for this table 1 summarizes the important characteristics of the gcms used in this study nakicenovic and swart 2000 in most gcms there are three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios namely b1 a1b and a2 that are available for the future projections nakicenovic and swart 2000 the outputs of the gcms are the average monthly climatic data including rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation for the periods 2011 2040 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 as detailed above gcms represent different results in the simulation of circulation patterns that consist of seasonal and inter seasonal variations palmer et al 2005 doblas reyes et al 2006 however the low resolution related to the spatial gcm outcomes leads to significant errors and uncertainty on a local scale especially when rainfall is concerned kamal and masah 2011 hence each of the gcm outputs requires different downscaling techniques which can be handled using the lars wg model as a stochastic weather generator model the model generates a daily time series of minimum and maximum temperatures rainfall and solar radiation a random climate generator uses daily data to calculate a set of parameters related to the probability distribution of climatic data and their interrelationships by considering the obtained parameters of distribution for a station and projected climate changes calculated by global or regional climate models daily climatic data is generated for each scenario therefore the given information is used in the simulation of climatic data that are used in the development of the models the mean of the generated values for 14 gcms are then used to evaluate the changes related to each climatic variable in the river basin under climate change during the 2020 2040 period and compared with the baseline period 1996 2008 in the calibration and validation stages of the models daily rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures of six synoptic stations as shown in fig 1 are used 3 2 setting up the swat model swat is a basin scale and physically based continuous hydrological model that is developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 the most important components of the model are respectively agricultural management strategies climate scenarios channel routing hydrological parameters nutrients pesticides reservoir routing erosion surface and groundwater quality factors arnold and fohrer 2005 in the allocated scenarios homogeneous units i e hrus have a key role in simulating the hydrological variables therefore hrus are lumped into the area comprised of unique land use slope and soil layers assuming that the hydrological behavior of the river basin is as pre defined assumptions arnold et al 1998 the river basin is then divided into 511 hrus in order to increase the accuracy of the simulation and computational efficiency the acquired results of the swat model are based on the input from both baseline period data and downscaled values of gcms under different emission scenarios the relationship between the water balance elements of a catchment in the

used to perform calibration and sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2007 as detailed above the swat cup model is found satisfactory in calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the conducted analysis 3 3 setting up the ribasim model the ribasim model is used to conduct water resources management strategies at the basin scale due to its comprehensive ability in performing the physical and hydrological processes simultaneously ribasim is developed by delft hydraulic institute of netherlands and continuously updates its abilities by means of results obtained from the conducted studies van der korgt 2008 it is a comprehensive and flexible tool in conducting water resources management scenarios based on supply reliability and hydrological water balance van der korgt 2008 thereby the limitations of available water resources with consideration to the developing water projects and availability of water can be carried out by ribasim the capabilities of ribasim in selection and prioritization of water resources for water demands van der korgt 2008 relies on the information provided for characteristics of the basin and river network spatial distribution of available water resources such as the location of dams diversion dams canals rivers and aquifers the spatial distribution of water demands for agriculture urban and industrial water users data related to each node and link in the network the rules of water allocation and utilization of surface water reservoirs aquifers and diversion dams the governance rules to protect and revive the biota together with the hydrological information such as streamflow rainfall evaporation water transfers and water requirements time series when ribasim allocates water resources initially all water demands related to different sectors as well as all available water supplies including the location of reservoirs rivers and aquifers should be determined based on the available information for the entire river basin afterward available water resources are estimated based on long term hydrological time series acquired from hydrometric stations finally river basin is simulated using the ribasim model based on the prior information detailed above as well as environmental and reliability associated with the resources in this respect monthly simulations are performed based on the spatiotemporal water demands and supply resources that introduced using nodes and links across the river network fig 3 to determine environmental water requirements from rivers tennant s method also known as the montana method is used tennant 1976 the environmental water requirement is determined based on monthly river flow table 2 it should be noted that a fair level of river flows is considered in the simulation to meet the minimum environmental water requirement in the region additionally based on the water allocation rules established by the iran water resources management company drinking water industrial uses environmental needs and agricultural water demands are respectively the most important sectors that should be prioritized in the allocation of water resources in the river basin for this table 3 details the monthly distribution of agricultural environmental drinking and industrial water requirements in the river basin that will be used in the prioritization of water allocation for this the agricultural water requirements were calculated in different sub basins of the study area under climate change conditions which is higher than the current water consumptions in each sub basin it is noteworthy that according to the water allocation rules of the iranian ministry of energy due to the current environmental situation of lake urmia and water stress in the basin any increase in water withdrawal compared to water rights in all sub basins is prohibited therefore with consideration of this allocation rule water demands under climate change conditions were considered equal to the current consumption rates in other words the water consumptions in the current period is almost equal to the water allocation rules predefined by the authorities yet according to the country s population policies the population rate in the future should be considered constant to this end the geographical position of the water demand sectors mentioned in table 3 including zarrineh river network is total subbasins downstream of the dam i e subbasins no 1 7 see fig 1 malekan region is the upstream part of subbasin no 3 mid region of the river basin is the subbasins no 2 7 tabriz region is a drinking water transmission network from zarrineh rood river to tabriz city saghez region is the subbasins no 8 10 11 and bukan region is the subbasins no 7 and 8 4 results 4 1 climate change scenarios after calibration and validation of the lars wg model daily temperatures and rainfall time series are generated using 14 gcms prediction generated for the 2020 2040 period under the a1b b1 and a2 emission scenarios at each synoptic station hence 32 daily time series i e equal to the total number of scenarios presented in table 1 for temperature and rainfall data are generated to be used in the analysis then an average of 32 generated datasets is obtained in daily scale to be used as input data for swat tables 4 and 5 details the comparison between average seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall against their corresponding baseline period results of the lars wg model indicate an increase in the minima associated with the seasonal temperature compared to the observed temperature in most of the stations between the 2020 2040 period table 4 in maragheh station however the temperature decreased in spring and summer seasons while similar changes in mahabad and bonab stations are observed within the winter temperature records the mean changes associated with the maximum temperature showed increases in all the selected stations and seasons except for the winter records in general the changes in the minima and the maxima of temperature have an increasing trend while the highest and lowest increases are related to the spring and winter seasons respectively when rainfall is concerned as seen in table 5 the mean changes in annual rainfall vary roughly between 7 26 hence results indicate that the changes in rainfall have positive values relating to the summer and autumn while negative changes are observed in spring 4 2 calibration and validation of the swat model the first step in simulating surface runoff is to consider the parameters that are effective on the streamflow generation and it is accomplished through sensitivity analysis conducted for the swat cup model abbaspour 2008 prior to calibrating or validating the model by performing a sensitivity analysis parameters that showed significant impacts on the outflow are recognized table 6 as given in table 6 the most important parameters involved in the simulation of the outflows from the sub basins their priority in modeling rank as well as p chance for the wrong detection and t values i e significance are given any parameter that has a higher t value also depicted a p value close to zero that confirms the credibility and sufficiency of the analysis both calibration and uncertainty analysis of the model is performed with a sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm which is one of the programs integrated with the swat model in the sufi 2 algorithm the uncertainty of each parameter covers all sources of uncertainties e g uncertainty in the input variables conceptual model and parameters of the model the 95ppu is calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 confidence intervals for an output derived through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2008 to calibrate the model 20 hydrological parameters e g soil land use reach groundwater surface runoff snow etc that affect the streamflow are used table 6 shows the first 10 out of 20 parameters that are relatively important in modeling the streamflow with consideration to their p and t values after performing the sensitivity analysis the model is calibrated and validated using monthly streamflow observations recorded at the streamflow gauging stations fig 1 the determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe ns coefficients are used to evaluate the performance of the simulated runoff the calibration results given in table 7 shows the acceptable performance when the allocated evaluation criteria r 2 0 49 0 71 and ns 0 14 0 7 are considered the results of validation also confirmed the good performance of the model according to the r 2 and ns two indices namely p factor and r factor are also used to quantify the goodness reliability of uncertainty analysis these indices are the percentage of the measured data located within the 95ppu band and the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data respectively the range of the p factor varies from zero to 100 while this range for r factor changes between zero to infinity if the p and r factors respectively are equal to 1 and zero it can be understood that the simulations exactly correspond to the observations therefore r factor less than one is most welcome in model development accordingly fig 4 also demonstrates the 95 prediction uncertainty bands for the monthly streamflow simulation at nezamabad station which indicates to reliability of the analysis 4 3 simulation of potential runoff under climate change after calibrating and validating the swat model the average time series of daily downscaled temperature and rainfall obtained from the lars wg model is introduced to the swat model then the impact of climate change on the potential runoff of the basin is evaluated in this respect fig 5 shows the average monthly potential inflow into the zarrineh rood river dam s reservoir for the baseline and climate change periods the results indicate an increase in the potential volume of water inflow to the dam in february and march due to an increase in the rate of river flow associated with the mid region of the river basin i e subbasins no 2 7 as shown in fig 1 between zarrineh rood river dam and nezamabad hydrometric station in autumn and winter and vice versa in spring and summer it is obvious that the results show a decline in the potential runoff of the river basin under climate change 2020 2040 compared to the baseline period 1996 2008 in this regard the potential runoff in both of the entrance zones to the dam and the mid basin will reduce by 28 and 16 respectively in the future period compared to the baseline 4 4 supply reliability of water demands under climate change the effect of water resources development plans on runoff and the supply reliability of water demand under current and climate change conditions are evaluated for the past 1951 1995 current 1996 2008 and future 2020 2040 periods table 8 shows the simulation results for the average supply of water demands over the assigned periods based on the priorities of allocation rules detailed in the previous section yet the water demands are considered constant for all three periods in the present study in a way that the level of supply for current water demand can be assessed under the climate and water resources for past current and climate change periods according to table 8 the total water demand in the basin except for the drinking sector is about 1017 mcm figs 6 and 7 also show the voluminal and temporal reliability of the water supply for drinking industrial and agricultural demands in the assigned periods by taking into account the acceptable threshold of for the water supply the zarrineh rood river basin can supply the current demands for the baseline period according to the water allocation rules established by the iran water resources management company iwrmc the acceptable range for water supply percent in drinking environmental and agricultural demands are 95 100 90 100 and 80 100 respectively thus based on the results of the simulation water demands for each period are satisfactory and efficient hence as seen in table 8 about 90 of the water demands will be supplied under climate change if only the operational projects are kept active and the remaining i e projects under construction or study are abandoned 4 5 assessment of the operational water projects on the lake hydrology under climate change climate conditions in the future periods can affect operational water projects in the basin in this section the impact of utilized projects on the basin s water resources is evaluated in the assigned periods detailed previously table 9 presents the discharge in the zarrineh rood river basin after applying water consumptions during the past current and climate change conditions results indicate that the amount of basin runoff under climate change is reduced by about 136 5 mcm when compared to the current period therefore it can be concluded that under climate change conditions the amount of runoff in the whole basin will reduce by 8 compared to the current period 5 discussion the primary goal of the study was to determine the present and the future states of the water supply reliability in the zarrineh rood river basin under the climate change scenarios the secondary goal however was to test if the governance rules dictated by the authorities to revive the biota around the degrading lake urmia would be successful or not the total share of the entire basin with respect to the required water supply in lake urmia is determined based on the lake urmia integrated management plan which is about 1460 mcm per year to guarantee the survival of the lake morid and moghadasi 2011 the average annual volume of water entering lake urmia from the zarrineh rood river basin is about 1357 mcm for the baseline period according to the conducted analysis it can be concluded that the basin has supplied about an average of 93 of its share for lake urmia environmental requirement in the baseline period the results of modeling with the swat and ribasim models showed that under climate change the average annual volume of water flowing into lake urmia from the river basin would reach up to 1221 mcm about an average of 10 reduction compared to the baseline period if the operational projects in the basin remain constant in the future hence it can be concluded that about 84 of lake urmia s environmental requirement will be met under climate change in the basin if the downstream flow can reach the water body of the lake in addition the average downscaled outputs of the gcms showed that the temperature would increase during the period 2020 2040 compared to the baseline that could lead to the deformation of winter rainfall in the study area from snow to rain results of the downscaled rainfall data also showed a relative decrease in spring rainfalls and increases in summer and autumn rainfalls for the upcoming years hence it was concluded that the future changes will affect the amount and the pattern of rainfall events in the basin the same conclusion can be confirmed by the displacement of the runoff peak of the previous months in the time series in this respect the results of runoff simulation conducted by the swat model showed that under the climate change scenarios the potential runoff in both of the entrance zones of the zarrineh rood river dam and the mid basin region will respectively reduce by 28 and 16 in the future period compared to the baseline period according to the simulations analysis of the ribasim model and the percentage of reliability of volumetric supply for joint drinking industrial and agricultural demands are currently 1996 2008 about 96 4 and 90 2 respectively for operational water projects however for the future period 2020 2040 they would decrease by 93 4 and 89 5 respectively the percent of reliable supply for the joint drinking industry demand under climate change is less than the minimum acceptable supply i e 95 compared to the current condition for agricultural demand however the supply reliability percentage in each period is more than the minimum acceptable supply i e 80 hence it can be concluded that the supply reliability of the total agricultural demands decreased from 91 4 to 90 3 due to the impact of climate change which is not significant yet it should be confirmed through a careful and detailed analysis of the climate scenarios that would be revealed in the future similarly the basin runoff under climate change has reduced to 136 5 mcm compared to the baseline period so about 10 of the average annual volume of water entering lake urmia from the zarrineh rood river basin will be reduced if the active water projects remain operational these foregoing assessments of streamflow changes and the reliability of water supply in different water sectors can be used as a helpful basis for both efficient water policies and the development of a decision making rules for the water resources projects the limitation of the following study however is about using ar4 climate data instead of newly released ar5 data using governance rules in defining future demands relying on the provided data by the authorities and remaining within the framework of the operational projects in this respect the future studies shall incorporate the role of new climate scenarios as well as the set of innovative management rules in the basin what is more and based on the analysis it is extremely important to increase the resilience against the climate change by modernization of the agricultural sector and reducing the losses in the water distribution networks by this the effect of climate born events such as droughts and floods in the region could be moderated 6 conclusion the following conclusions are made within the aspects of this study i climate change will affect the amount and the pattern of the rainfall events in the zarrineh rood river basin in the upcoming years ii the potential runoff in both of the entrance zones of the zarrineh rood river dam and the mid basin region will be reduced in the future iii the percentage of reliability of volumetric supply for the joint drinking industrial and agricultural demands in the region would decrease by 93 4 and 89 5 respectively iv about 10 of the average annual volume of water entering lake urmia from the zarrineh rood river basin will be reduced if the active water projects remain operational v it is important to conduct further analysis to confirm the obtained results

9729,reliability assessment in the allocation of water resources under the changing climate condition has invaluable importance in planning the water demand at the basin scale this study details an integrated framework for evaluation of the reliability between water supply and demand under climate change scenarios in the zarrineh rood river basin in the northwest of iran initially recorded climatic data in six synoptic stations are downscaled and projected for the period 2020 2040 based on the 14 gcms using the lars wg method afterwards the swat model is used to simulate the basin hydrology with consideration to the baseline and future climate periods at six hydrometric stations finally the available water is allocated using the ribasim model based on the current supply demand chain and predefined governmental water allocation rules for different sectors results showed that under climate change the total runoff of the basin and the entrance catchments to the zarrineh rood river dam would decrease about 8 and 28 respectively the reliability of the water supply for joint drinking industrial and agricultural demands would also decrease from 96 4 to 93 4 and 90 2 89 5 respectively as such the average annual streamflow from the zarrineh rood river ending to lake urmia will reduce by 10 if the operational water projects remain active abbreviations dem digital

management 1 introduction climate change is a phenomenon that has a great impact on water resources hence hydroclimatic variables such as temperature and rainfall can be deal with a great spatiotemporal change within the concept of a hydrological system jung and chang 2010 the changing climate can also alter the availability of water resources leading to outbreaks of droughts and floods in which has irreversible socio economic drawbacks ipcc et al 2007 it is obvious that the climatic events could not be the only decision criteria in the management of the water resources so that variables such as consumption rate social expectations and economic growth also have great effect on the water allocation plans devkota and gyawali 2015 climate change may exacerbate the failure of water resources management especially when timely and appropriate actions are not considered or the extensive use of water is forced through unplanned water projects zeinadini et al 2019 for this aim based on the general policies of a country and the interest of different stakeholders with different economical social and political backgrounds or the operational water resources projects any development plan can be considered dittrich et al 2016 the performance and efficiency of those projects depends mainly on the events of which are closely related to the micro climate of the region in this respect the identification of the availability of water resources under the current and future climate change scenarios is vital in the evaluation of the water supply reliability when the supply demand chain between sectors e g drinking industry and agriculture are of the interest javidi sabaghyan et al 2009 thus the prioritization of the allocated water based on the demand for available water resources as well as optimization of supply for different periods is considered as an effective strategy to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on future water consumption javidi sabaghyan et al 2009 vaghefi et al 2011 to this end many studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on water resources systems some investigated the impact of climate change on the characteristics of meteorological e g kamal and masah 2011 mathukumalli et al 2016 alexander and arblaster 2017 ishida et al 2017 peng et al 2017 danandeh mehr et al 2020 or hydrological e g kahya 2011 todd et al 2011 komozep and chung 2014 chen et al 2012 devkota and gyawali 2015 shrestha et al 2016 variables that affect the water resources system thus studies such as those conducted by zarezadeh et al 2012 li et al 2015 and zeinadini et al 2019 are suggested for further investigation when the performance of water resources systems under climate change is on the interest the mainframe of water resources management under climate change is about the incorporation of the operational water projects in the planning horizon policies and macro future decisions however when the allocation of water resources by neglecting climate change is performed the results will not have the necessary validity and accuracy in practice ipcc et al 2007 accordingly examining the reliability of water supply in satisfaction of water demand for agricultural industrial drinking and environmental uses in addition to allocation of the available water based on the predefined or dictated governmental rules for different sectors with consideration to the climate change and operational water projects is inevitable such applications are frequently addressed by the applications of the soil and water assessment tool swat and the river basin simulation ribasim that showed promising results swat arnold et al 1998 as a basin wide and well established hydrologic model is frequently used for simulating the streamflow process especially in evaluation of inflows and outflows from the reservoir or the river basin this process oriented model can simulate the hydrological processes based on the soil and water interactions and then develops estimations based on the changes of hydrologic variables in the allocated basin arnold and fohrer 2005 due to the no charge modeling simultaneous simulation of hydrological variables and agricultural management in complex basins with various land use and soil types many studies endorsed the application of swat ahmadzadeh et al 2016 when climate change is concerned the uncertainties associated with the effect of general circulation models gcms on simulation of the hydroclimatic variables are inevitable wilby and harris 2006 the selection of one gcm for analysis of climate change neither can cover the full range of uncertainties nor can guarantee the functionality of results as there is no preference among the superiority of simulated gcms danandeh mehr et al 2020 consequently the application of management and decision making tools to develop the water resources in arid regions like iran which faces water scarcity and an increase in demand is vital in such an environment a supplement of water demands without the consideration of environmental impacts would endanger the ecosystems and results in non compensatory effects on the environment harwood et al 2018 likewise the use of known models that consider simulation optimization or any hybrid model as well as simulated hydrological processes associated with the water resources system enables the aforementioned issues danandeh mehr et al 2020 in the present study the zarrineh rood river basin is addressed which is one of the main sub basin of the lake urmia basin that provides almost half of the total streamflow discharge to the water body of the lake urmia ahmadzadeh et al 2016 fathian et al 2018 vaheddoost and aksoy 2019 2021 recently a relatively large portion of lake urmia has been degraded reportedly due to a large number of water related projects especially in the agricultural sector climatic events and widespread droughts fathian 2019 fathian and vaheddoost 2021b hence various environmental problems take place in the lake s vicinity which are headlines for the debate between researchers and decision makers as well these water projects are either operational under construction or under study while the suggested solutions for saving the lake urges the development of the last two to this end the aim of this study is to examine the supply reliability of water demands under climate change while considering a scenario that relies solely on operational water projects the scope of the study incorporates the 1951 1995 past time 1996 2008 current time and 2020 2040 future time periods in studying the reliability of water supply in the assessment of the related water demands therefore i intensive data analysis is conducted ii future climatic variables are downscaled iii swat is used to evaluate streamflow processes in the basin and finally iv scenarios are used in the evaluation of the reliability of water supply using the ribasim model considering potential water demands for the operational water projects in addition the unique aspect of this study is the implementation of climate change realization in the generation of hydrological scenarios based on the regional climate factors together with the incorporation of governing rules forced by the authorities as the decision making criteria 2 study area and data the zarrineh rood river basin is the largest sub basin of the lake urmia basin 45 47 47 20 n longitudes and 35 41 37 27 e latitudes in northwest of iran fig 1 the total area of the basin is about 12 025 km2 and the length of the main river channel is about 300 km the zarrineh rood river basin provides about 47 of the total streamflow ending to lake urmia fathian et al 2018 vaheddoost and aksoy 2019 2021 the average annual rainfall in the basin is about 390 mm which has a semi arid cold climate vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 there is an active dam named zarrineh rood river dam which provides agricultural and drinking water demands with a rate of 110 mcm per year the total storage capacity of the dam is about 760 mcm and its active storage capacity is roughly 654 mcm in this respect the river basin provides water for miandoab shahin dej tekab and saghez cities which are located across the river basin ahmadzadeh et al 2016 lake urmia was known as the second largest hyper saline lake in the world an international wetland a protected zone and a national park that is home to a wide range of animal and plant species fathian et al 2016 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 the lake has been shrinking for the last decades and its water level has been declining reportedly due to different hydroclimatic and anthropogenic activities fathian 2019 fathian and vaheddoost 2021a to this end the predicament associated with the development of water projects development of agricultural zones and continuous droughts has been degraded a large portion of the lake s surface area leaving a wasteland behind a program called lake urmia integrated management plan was developed by the iranian department of environment in 2008 to develop strategies for reviving the lake therefore the zarrineh rood river basin with a total streamflow contribution of 1460 mcm per year ahmadzadeh et al 2016 is selected as the case of study which can play a pivotal role in reviving lake urmia for this the digital elevation model dem layer with a 30 m 30 m cell size resolution is acquired http www earthexplorer usgs gov demexplorer to produce the network of rivers and sub basins for the study area then the land use fig 1 and fao s soil layers are used to determine the territory of the same hydrologic response units hrus over the river basin afterward climate data including daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and monthly solar radiation in six synoptic stations scattered around the study area fig 1 are acquired from iran meteorological organization www irimo ir and used as inputs to the models then after climatic stations with long term and valid data records located inside or outside the study area are used due to the climate variability and related regional terrain streamflow data recorded in six hydrometric stations fig 1 obtained from the iranian ministry of energy were also implemented in the calibration and validation stages of the swat model it is noteworthy that 22 continuous years of daily hydroclimatic data records starting from january 1 1987 to december 31 2008 are used in the calibration of the swat model afterwards the potential river flow of the basin is estimated by swat to allocate the available water to meet the demands under the climate change conditions with respect to the dictated water rules by the authorities 3 methods the method applied in the present study can be briefed as i generating the climate change scenarios for minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall events ii setting up the swat model and estimation of the generated streamflow from the basin iii calibration of the ribasim model for the study area iv defining the effect of climate change on streamflow in swat environment and v evaluating the supply reliability associated with the rules dictated by the authorities to protect the endangered biota current water demands and the behavior of the operational water projects under climate change scenarios in this respect fig 2 illustrates the flowchart of the methodology used 3 1 generating climate change scenarios to generate temperature and rainfall data climate change scenarios are coupled with gcms ipcc et al 2007 due to the existence of a wide range of future climate simulations the long ashton research station weather generator lars wg model consisting of 14 gcms table 1 along with their related emission scenarios are used to downscale the climatic data the lars wg model is generally a stochastic weather generator that downscales coarse spatial and temporal outputs from gcms to finer scale azari et al 2021 the model generate local scale climate scenarios based on gcms for assessment of climate change by simulating weather data at a single site under both current and future climate conditions semenov and barrow 2002 for this table 1 summarizes the important characteristics of the gcms used in this study nakicenovic and swart 2000 in most gcms there are three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios namely b1 a1b and a2 that are available for the future projections nakicenovic and swart 2000 the outputs of the gcms are the average monthly climatic data including rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation for the periods 2011 2040 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 as detailed above gcms represent different results in the simulation of circulation patterns that consist of seasonal and inter seasonal variations palmer et al 2005 doblas reyes et al 2006 however the low resolution related to the spatial gcm outcomes leads to significant errors and uncertainty on a local scale especially when rainfall is concerned kamal and masah 2011 hence each of the gcm outputs requires different downscaling techniques which can be handled using the lars wg model as a stochastic weather generator model the model generates a daily time series of minimum and maximum temperatures rainfall and solar radiation a random climate generator uses daily data to calculate a set of parameters related to the probability distribution of climatic data and their interrelationships by considering the obtained parameters of distribution for a station and projected climate changes calculated by global or regional climate models daily climatic data is generated for each scenario therefore the given information is used in the simulation of climatic data that are used in the development of the models the mean of the generated values for 14 gcms are then used to evaluate the changes related to each climatic variable in the river basin under climate change during the 2020 2040 period and compared with the baseline period 1996 2008 in the calibration and validation stages of the models daily rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures of six synoptic stations as shown in fig 1 are used 3 2 setting up the swat model swat is a basin scale and physically based continuous hydrological model that is developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars arnold et al 1998 the most important components of the model are respectively agricultural management strategies climate scenarios channel routing hydrological parameters nutrients pesticides reservoir routing erosion surface and groundwater quality factors arnold and fohrer 2005 in the allocated scenarios homogeneous units i e hrus have a key role in simulating the hydrological variables therefore hrus are lumped into the area comprised of unique land use slope and soil layers assuming that the hydrological behavior of the river basin is as pre defined assumptions arnold et al 1998 the river basin is then divided into 511 hrus in order to increase the accuracy of the simulation and computational efficiency the acquired results of the swat model are based on the input from both baseline period data and downscaled values of gcms under different emission scenarios the relationship between the water balance elements of a catchment in the swat model is given as follows neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw i where is the final soil water content on day t mm respectively are initial soil water content the amount of rainfall the amount of surface runoff the amount of evapotranspiration the amount of water entering the vadose zone i e unsaturated zone from the soil profile and the amount of return flow on the day i mm the volume of the surface runoff from rainfall is one of the main variables of streamflow in the river that is handled by the scs curve number method obtained by land use soil type initial soil moisture rainfall status and morphology of the basin afterward parameters related to the main components including plant dat soil sol water gw management mgt and river rte are introduced for each of the sub models in the swat due to a large number of parameters and simulation of the hydrological and agricultural data simultaneously the swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup is used to perform calibration and sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2007 as detailed above the swat cup model is found satisfactory in calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the conducted analysis 3 3 setting up the ribasim model the ribasim model is used to conduct water resources management strategies at the basin scale due to its comprehensive ability in performing the physical and hydrological processes simultaneously ribasim is developed by delft hydraulic institute of netherlands and continuously updates its abilities by means of results obtained from the conducted studies van der korgt 2008 it is a comprehensive and flexible tool in conducting water resources management scenarios based on supply reliability and hydrological water balance van der korgt 2008 thereby the limitations of available water resources with consideration to the developing water projects and availability of water can be carried out by ribasim the capabilities of ribasim in selection and prioritization of water resources for water demands van der korgt 2008 relies on the information provided for characteristics of the basin and river network spatial distribution of available water resources such as the location of dams diversion dams canals rivers and aquifers the spatial distribution of water demands for agriculture urban and industrial water users data related to each node and link in the network the rules of water allocation and utilization of surface water reservoirs aquifers and diversion dams the governance rules to protect and revive the biota together with the hydrological information such as streamflow rainfall evaporation water transfers and water requirements time series when ribasim allocates water resources initially all water demands related to different sectors as well as all available water supplies including the location of reservoirs rivers and aquifers should be determined based on the available information for the entire river basin afterward available water resources are estimated based on long term hydrological time series acquired from hydrometric stations finally river basin is simulated using the ribasim model based on the prior information detailed above as well as environmental and reliability associated with the resources in this respect monthly simulations are performed based on the spatiotemporal water demands and supply resources that introduced using nodes and links across the river network fig 3 to determine environmental water requirements from rivers tennant s method also known as the montana method is used tennant 1976 the environmental water requirement is determined based on monthly river flow table 2 it should be noted that a fair level of river flows is considered in the simulation to meet the minimum environmental water requirement in the region additionally based on the water allocation rules established by the iran water resources management company drinking water industrial uses environmental needs and agricultural water demands are respectively the most important sectors that should be prioritized in the allocation of water resources in the river basin for this table 3 details the monthly distribution of agricultural environmental drinking and industrial water requirements in the river basin that will be used in the prioritization of water allocation for this the agricultural water requirements were calculated in different sub basins of the study area under climate change conditions which is higher than the current water consumptions in each sub basin it is noteworthy that according to the water allocation rules of the iranian ministry of energy due to the current environmental situation of lake urmia and water stress in the basin any increase in water withdrawal compared to water rights in all sub basins is prohibited therefore with consideration of this allocation rule water demands under climate change conditions were considered equal to the current consumption rates in other words the water consumptions in the current period is almost equal to the water allocation rules predefined by the authorities yet according to the country s population policies the population rate in the future should be considered constant to this end the geographical position of the water demand sectors mentioned in table 3 including zarrineh river network is total subbasins downstream of the dam i e subbasins no 1 7 see fig 1 malekan region is the upstream part of subbasin no 3 mid region of the river basin is the subbasins no 2 7 tabriz region is a drinking water transmission network from zarrineh rood river to tabriz city saghez region is the subbasins no 8 10 11 and bukan region is the subbasins no 7 and 8 4 results 4 1 climate change scenarios after calibration and validation of the lars wg model daily temperatures and rainfall time series are generated using 14 gcms prediction generated for the 2020 2040 period under the a1b b1 and a2 emission scenarios at each synoptic station hence 32 daily time series i e equal to the total number of scenarios presented in table 1 for temperature and rainfall data are generated to be used in the analysis then an average of 32 generated datasets is obtained in daily scale to be used as input data for swat tables 4 and 5 details the comparison between average seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall against their corresponding baseline period results of the lars wg model indicate an increase in the minima associated with the seasonal temperature compared to the observed temperature in most of the stations between the 2020 2040 period table 4 in maragheh station however the temperature decreased in spring and summer seasons while similar changes in mahabad and bonab stations are observed within the winter temperature records the mean changes associated with the maximum temperature showed increases in all the selected stations and seasons except for the winter records in general the changes in the minima and the maxima of temperature have an increasing trend while the highest and lowest increases are related to the spring and winter seasons respectively when rainfall is concerned as seen in table 5 the mean changes in annual rainfall vary roughly between 7 26 hence results indicate that the changes in rainfall have positive values relating to the summer and autumn while negative changes are observed in spring 4 2 calibration and validation of the swat model the first step in simulating surface runoff is to consider the parameters that are effective on the streamflow generation and it is accomplished through sensitivity analysis conducted for the swat cup model abbaspour 2008 prior to calibrating or validating the model by performing a sensitivity analysis parameters that showed significant impacts on the outflow are recognized table 6 as given in table 6 the most important parameters involved in the simulation of the outflows from the sub basins their priority in modeling rank as well as p chance for the wrong detection and t values i e significance are given any parameter that has a higher t value also depicted a p value close to zero that confirms the credibility and sufficiency of the analysis both calibration and uncertainty analysis of the model is performed with a sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm which is one of the programs integrated with the swat model in the sufi 2 algorithm the uncertainty of each parameter covers all sources of uncertainties e g uncertainty in the input variables conceptual model and parameters of the model the 95ppu is calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 confidence intervals for an output derived through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2008 to calibrate the model 20 hydrological parameters e g soil land use reach groundwater surface runoff snow etc that affect the streamflow are used table 6 shows the first 10 out of 20 parameters that are relatively important in modeling the streamflow with consideration to their p and t values after performing the sensitivity analysis the model is calibrated and validated using monthly streamflow observations recorded at the streamflow gauging stations fig 1 the determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe ns coefficients are used to evaluate the performance of the simulated runoff the calibration results given in table 7 shows the acceptable performance when the allocated evaluation criteria r 2 0 49 0 71 and ns 0 14 0 7 are considered the results of validation also confirmed the good performance of the model according to the r 2 and ns two indices namely p factor and r factor are also used to quantify the goodness reliability of uncertainty analysis these indices are the percentage of the measured data located within the 95ppu band and the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data respectively the range of the p factor varies from zero to 100 while this range for r factor changes between zero to infinity if the p and r factors respectively are equal to 1 and zero it can be understood that the simulations exactly correspond to the observations therefore r factor less than one is most welcome in model development accordingly fig 4 also demonstrates the 95 prediction uncertainty bands for the monthly streamflow simulation at nezamabad station which indicates to reliability of the analysis 4 3 simulation of potential runoff under climate change after calibrating and validating the swat model the average time series of daily downscaled temperature and rainfall obtained from the lars wg model is introduced to the swat model then the impact of climate change on the potential runoff of the basin is evaluated in this respect fig 5 shows the average monthly potential inflow into the zarrineh rood river dam s reservoir for the baseline and climate change periods the results indicate an increase in the potential volume of water inflow to the dam in february and march due to an increase in the rate of river flow associated with the mid region of the river basin i e subbasins no 2 7 as shown in fig 1 between zarrineh rood river dam and nezamabad hydrometric station in autumn and winter and vice versa in spring and summer it is obvious that the results show a decline in the potential runoff of the river basin under climate change 2020 2040 compared to the baseline period 1996 2008 in this regard the potential runoff in both of the entrance zones to the dam and the mid basin will reduce by 28 and 16 respectively in the future period compared to the baseline 4 4 supply reliability of water demands under climate change the effect of water resources development plans on runoff and the supply reliability of water demand under current and climate change conditions are evaluated for the past 1951 1995 current 1996 2008 and future 2020 2040 periods table 8 shows the simulation results for the average supply of water demands over the assigned periods based on the priorities of allocation rules detailed in the previous section yet the water demands are considered constant for all three periods in the present study in a way that the level of supply for current water demand can be assessed under the climate and water resources for past current and climate change periods according to table 8 the total water demand in the basin except for the drinking sector is about 1017 mcm figs 6 and 7 also show the voluminal and temporal reliability of the water supply for drinking industrial and agricultural demands in the assigned periods by taking into account the acceptable threshold of for the water supply the zarrineh rood river basin can supply the current demands for the baseline period according to the water allocation rules established by the iran water resources management company iwrmc the acceptable range for water supply percent in drinking environmental and agricultural demands are 95 100 90 100 and 80 100 respectively thus based on the results of the simulation water demands for each period are satisfactory and efficient hence as seen in table 8 about 90 of the water demands will be supplied under climate change if only the operational projects are kept active and the remaining i e projects under construction or study are abandoned 4 5 assessment of the operational water projects on the lake hydrology under climate change climate conditions in the future periods can affect operational water projects in the basin in this section the impact of utilized projects on the basin s water resources is evaluated in the assigned periods detailed previously table 9 presents the discharge in the zarrineh rood river basin after applying water consumptions during the past current and climate change conditions results indicate that the amount of basin runoff under climate change is reduced by about 136 5 mcm when compared to the current period therefore it can be concluded that under climate change conditions the amount of runoff in the whole basin will reduce by 8 compared to the current period 5 discussion the primary goal of the study was to determine the present and the future states of the water supply reliability in the zarrineh rood river basin under the climate change scenarios the secondary goal however was to test if the governance rules dictated by the authorities to revive the biota around the degrading lake urmia would be successful or not the total share of the entire basin with respect to the required water supply in lake urmia is determined based on the lake urmia integrated management plan which is about 1460 mcm per year to guarantee the survival of the lake morid and moghadasi 2011 the average annual volume of water entering lake urmia from the zarrineh rood river basin is about 1357 mcm for the baseline period according to the conducted analysis it can be concluded that the basin has supplied about an average of 93 of its share for lake urmia environmental requirement in the baseline period the results of modeling with the swat and ribasim models showed that under climate change the average annual volume of water flowing into lake urmia from the river basin would reach up to 1221 mcm about an average of 10 reduction compared to the baseline period if the operational projects in the basin remain constant in the future hence it can be concluded that about 84 of lake urmia s environmental requirement will be met under climate change in the basin if the downstream flow can reach the water body of the lake in addition the average downscaled outputs of the gcms showed that the temperature would increase during the period 2020 2040 compared to the baseline that could lead to the deformation of winter rainfall in the study area from snow to rain results of the downscaled rainfall data also showed a relative decrease in spring rainfalls and increases in summer and autumn rainfalls for the upcoming years hence it was concluded that the future changes will affect the amount and the pattern of rainfall events in the basin the same conclusion can be confirmed by the displacement of the runoff peak of the previous months in the time series in this respect the results of runoff simulation conducted by the swat model showed that under the climate change scenarios the potential runoff in both of the entrance zones of the zarrineh rood river dam and the mid basin region will respectively reduce by 28 and 16 in the future period compared to the baseline period according to the simulations analysis of the ribasim model and the percentage of reliability of volumetric supply for joint drinking industrial and agricultural demands are currently 1996 2008 about 96 4 and 90 2 respectively for operational water projects however for the future period 2020 2040 they would decrease by 93 4 and 89 5 respectively the percent of reliable supply for the joint drinking industry demand under climate change is less than the minimum acceptable supply i e 95 compared to the current condition for agricultural demand however the supply reliability percentage in each period is more than the minimum acceptable supply i e 80 hence it can be concluded that the supply reliability of the total agricultural demands decreased from 91 4 to 90 3 due to the impact of climate change which is not significant yet it should be confirmed through a careful and detailed analysis of the climate scenarios that would be revealed in the future similarly the basin runoff under climate change has reduced to 136 5 mcm compared to the baseline period so about 10 of the average annual volume of water entering lake urmia from the zarrineh rood river basin will be reduced if the active water projects remain operational these foregoing assessments of streamflow changes and the reliability of water supply in different water sectors can be used as a helpful basis for both efficient water policies and the development of a decision making rules for the water resources projects the limitation of the following study however is about using ar4 climate data instead of newly released ar5 data using governance rules in defining future demands relying on the provided data by the authorities and remaining within the framework of the operational projects in this respect the future studies shall incorporate the role of new climate scenarios as well as the set of innovative management rules in the basin what is more and based on the analysis it is extremely important to increase the resilience against the climate change by modernization of the agricultural sector and reducing the losses in the water distribution networks by this the effect of climate born events such as droughts and floods in the region could be moderated 6 conclusion the following conclusions are made within the aspects of this study i climate change will affect the amount and the pattern of the rainfall events in the zarrineh rood river basin in the upcoming years ii the potential runoff in both of the entrance zones of the zarrineh rood river dam and the mid basin region will be reduced in the future iii the percentage of reliability of volumetric supply for the joint drinking industrial and agricultural demands in the region would decrease by 93 4 and 89 5 respectively iv about 10 of the average annual volume of water entering lake urmia from the zarrineh rood river basin will be reduced if the active water projects remain operational v it is important to conduct further analysis to confirm the obtained results
