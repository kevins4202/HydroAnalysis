7470,there is a need to model and predict the transfer of phosphorus p from land to water but this is challenging because of the large number of complex physical and biogeochemical processes involved this study presents for the first time a limits of acceptability approach of the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue framework to the soil and water assessment tool swat in an application to a water quality problem in the newby beck catchment 12 5 km2 cumbria united kingdom uk using high frequency outlet data discharge and p individual evaluation criteria limits of acceptability were assigned to observed discharge and p loads for all evaluation time steps identifying where the model was performing well poorly and to infer which processes required improvement in the model structure initial limits of acceptability were required to be relaxed by a substantial amount by factors of between 5 3 and 6 7 on a normalized scale depending on the evaluation criteria used in order to gain a set of behavioral simulations 1001 and 1016 respectively out of 5 000 000 of the 39 model parameters tested the representation of subsurface processes and associated parameters were consistently shown as critical to the model not meeting the evaluation criteria irrespective of the chosen evaluation metric it is therefore concluded that swat is not an appropriate model to guide p management in this catchment this approach highlights the importance of high frequency monitoring data for setting robust model evaluation criteria it also raises the question as to whether it is possible to have sufficient input data available to drive such models so that we can have confidence in their predictions and their ability to inform catchment management strategies to tackle the problem of diffuse pollution from agriculture keywords swat glue phosphorus uncertainty analysis river eden high frequency data 1 introduction in response to water quality targets set under the water framework directive wfd ec 2000 60 ec european union 2000 it is imperative that we understand the sources mobilization and delivery of diffuse pollution from agricultural land in headwater catchments to the river network haygarth et al 2005 perks et al 2015 in order to devise management strategies that reduce the transfer of macronutrients e g phosphorus p and nitrogen n to river networks mcgonigle et al 2014 models are essential tools in predicting how catchments may respond to key pressures in the present and into an uncertain future under climate change winters are expected to become wetter and warmer whilst summers are predicted to be hotter and drier in the united kingdom uk jones et al 2010 coupled with extended periods of drought and an increase in extreme precipitation events for much of the uk kendon et al 2014 these changes are likely to result in increased p transfers to waterways haygarth et al 2005 macleod et al 2012 ockenden et al 2017 process based models are often used to assess the response of river systems to changes in land use and future climate drivers bosch et al 2014 crossman et al 2013 2014 el khoury et al 2015 jin et al 2015 whitehead et al 2013 these models are typically considered over parameterized with large numbers of interacting parameters governing the key physical and biogeochemical processes represented in the model structure beven 2006 dean et al 2009 krueger et al 2007 while the parameters of such models may have some physical significance effective values of those parameters are required to account for variability in the catchment key processes and the model limitations beven 1996 2002 2006 with these frequently estimated through a combination of manual and automated calibration procedures beven 2006 also highlighted that there is often limited information in the model calibration data to effectively identify calibrated values for model parameters for example infrequent water quality data collection which does not fully pick up catchment dynamics can lead to uncertainty in p load calculations johnes 2007 which then impacts on the ability of the models to simulate catchment water quality accurately radcliffe et al 2009 this uncertainty coupled with other sources of uncertainty results in equifinality where multiple and very different parameter sets produce an equally acceptable fit to observations beven 2006 a so called optimum parameter set will not then be robust to a change in the period of calibration data in some cases parts of a data set may not be informative in calibrating and evaluating a model beven and smith 2015 furthermore the concept of equifinality has been exhibited in the observed biogeochemistry of a catchment whereby signals in the observations can be explained by a large number of interacting processes haygarth et al 2012 understanding how well these process based models represent the key processes in the source mobilization and delivery continuum will improve their ability as learning tools in helping to unravel the complex interactions occurring in a catchment this is particularly the case where the processes are often difficult or impossible to measure at the catchment scale e g phosphorus concentrations in different nutrient pools in the soil as a result in recent years the impact of such uncertainties has received increased attention in water quality modelling dean et al 2009 harmel et al 2014 karamouz et al 2015 page et al 2007 vrugt and sadegh 2013 woznicki and nejadhashemi 2014 yen et al 2015 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven and binley 1992 is an uncertainty estimation technique widely applied in the field of environmental modelling including water quality models dean et al 2009 krueger et al 2010 2009 2012 page et al 2003 2007 2004 rankinen et al 2006 glue evaluates model realizations for acceptability in the face of uncertainty in the model structure parameters and input data it accepts the equifinality concept in using a set of acceptable or behavioural models to estimate the uncertainty in model predictions it also provides a framework to evaluate a model as fit for purpose in representing the dynamics of a catchment using a set of evaluation criteria in this study glue is used with a limits of acceptability approach to evaluate a model parameter set which should take into account the inherent error in the calibration data such as errors in discharge data arising from rating curve uncertainties blazkova and beven 2009 krueger et al 2010 mcmillan et al 2012 mcmillan and westerberg 2015 pappenberger et al 2006 westerberg et al 2011 and errors in water quality data krueger et al 2012 page et al 2003 2004 rankinen et al 2006 the advantage of this approach is that it allows varying limits to be set for individual observations as well as combining evaluations based on different types of observations in a consistent way beven 2006 furthermore it has been demonstrated that high frequency coupled hydrochemical data allows short term changes in catchment dynamics to be better captured benettin et al 2015 halliday et al 2015 and a greater understanding of the complex and non linear interactions in the catchment system to be obtained this is particularly the case in flashy catchments where storm events can lead to rapid changes in stream concentrations of p and thus allows more robust and empirically defined model evaluation criteria to be set however the reality of not having such high quality data available can often make it difficult to define appropriate limits dean et al 2009 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 is one such process based model that has been the focus of uncertainty and calibration procedures in recent years arnold et al 2012 karamouz et al 2015 schuol and abbaspour 2006 shen et al 2012a designed to simulate the impacts of management and mitigation on biogeochemistry and water quality in ungauged river basins development of swat began in the early 1990 s gassman et al 2007 the model has been continually improved over the years and has incorporated key components based on those in other established models these include the hydrology component from the chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model knisel 1980 the pesticide component from the groundwater loadings effects on agricultural management systems gleams model leonard et al 1987 and the crop growth component from the environmental impact policy climate model izaurralde et al 2006 which was previously known as the erosion productivity impact calculator epic model williams 1990 finally river routing and instream kinetic routines were incorporated based around the routing options to outlet roto arnold et al 1995 and qual2e brown and barnwell 1987 models respectively the glue framework has been applied to swat before karamouz et al 2015 shen et al 2012a with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse typically used as the likelihood measure a prescribed threshold is used to define behavioural simulations with focus tending to be on how the model performs in the medium to long term typically monthly to yearly these studies demonstrated that high uncertainty exists in the model predictions with a number of key parameters for flow and nutrient processes being unidentifiable due to limitations in the model input and calibration data shen et al 2012a however due to limited computational power these studies sampled only a small area of the parameter space 10 000 iterations for a 20 parameter space and hence could miss sampling potentially behavioural parameter sets further to this previous uncertainty applications to swat focus largely on using summary statistics such as nse to evaluate model performance shen et al 2012a b 2013 and do not focus on those time steps critical to model failure finally whilst there have been previous studies with swat that are concerned with the effects of input data uncertainty on model performance shen et al 2012b 2013 no previous study accounts for uncertainty in the data used to calibrate the model this work provides for the first time a limits of acceptability approach of the glue framework to the swat model in an application to the newby beck sub catchment of the river eden basin in cumbria uk this study takes advantage of the high temporal resolution water quality monitoring data set from the demonstration test catchments dtc project mcgonigle et al 2014 to gain a better understanding of the uncertainty in the predictions of models such as swat by using the limits of acceptability to identify exact time steps critical to model failure this will provide an insight as to whether it is suitable to use swat as a catchment management tool in the newby beck sub catchment we do this by evaluating whether it can adequately represent the key dynamics of p transport to the stream whilst also explicitly accounting for errors in calibration data this study has the following objectives 1 what are the critical time steps causing the model to be classed as not acceptable 2 what can be learned from the uncertainty in the model predictions to better understand the complex interactions occurring at the catchment scale 3 can we identify which processes require further investigation in the model structure and do we have sufficient input data to drive such complex models 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description and observations newby beck fig 1 is a small headwater sub catchment located in the river eden basin in the north west of england in the united kingdom the catchment is approximately 12 5 km2 in size with an average elevation of 234 m above sea level owen et al 2012 perks et al 2015 the underlying geology is dominated by carboniferous limestone which is overlain by low permeability glacial deposits there are well drained fine and loamy soils over limestone waltham soil association 541q in the upper reaches seasonally wet deep loamy soils in drift from paleozoic sandstone and shale in the mid reaches brickfield 3 soil association 713 g and seasonally waterlogged reddish fine and coarse loamy soils in glacial till clifton soil association 711n in the lower reaches of the catchment national soil resources institute nsri cranfield university 2014 the dominant soil unit in the catchment is the 713 g brickfield association which covers approximately 66 of the basin area the primary land use in the catchment is improved grassland approximately 76 by area which is used for a mix of dairy and beef production other land uses are rough grassland 14 arable 6 woodland 2 5 and built over land 0 5 morton et al 2011 the climate of the region is cool temperate maritime with an annual average rainfall of around 1200 mm due to the underlying geology 23 of the catchment area is greater than 5 which results in rapid catchment response time leading to a time to peak of about 3 h perks et al 2015 based on the hydrology of soil types host classifications the catchment has a standard percent runoff of 35 perks et al 2015 resulting in very flashy responses of the hydrograph to rainfall events and high occurrences of saturated overland flow ockenden et al 2016 the catchment outlet was a rated section of channel used to provide high frequency discharge data at 15 min intervals the discharge measurements were calculated from a time series of stage measurements obtained with a sws mini diver using site specific rating curves in addition a high frequency bankside monitoring station was situated at the outlet which recorded nitrate no3 total p tp and total reactive p trp at 30 min intervals outram et al 2014 the tp and trp measurements were conducted using a hach lange combined sigmatax sampling module and phosphax sigma analyzer perks et al 2015 rainfall was recorded at 15 min intervals by three tipping bucket rain gauges other meteorological data was provided by an automatic weather station aws which was located towards the centre of the catchment fig 1 daily rainfall data was also gained from a rain gauge located in the centre of newby beck catchment from the met office integrated data archive system midas network met office 2012 the location of the monitoring stations rain gauges and outlet monitoring station are shown in fig 1 information on fertilizer and manure applications were based around a typical dairy and beef grassland catchment system with guidance from the defra fertilizer handbook rb209 defra 2013 and available farm diary data for the catchment for the years 2011 2014 2 2 implementation of the swat model to newby beck the swat model version 2012 revision 637 is a semi distributed process based model arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 which simulates surface and sub surface hydrology along with various nutrient including p and sediment fluxes at a basin scale the model also incorporates various land management practices along with a crop growth model in order to simulate the impact of agriculture at the catchment scale swat also includes urban area management practices and can incorporate pollution from point sources such as sewage treatment works the model requires spatial information including land use soil type and elevation which are often input as gis layers additional inputs required include any land management practices e g fertilizer application rates and animal stocking densities and weather data including rainfall temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation in order to reduce the computational complexity of swat a semi distributed approach is taken such that the model lumps unique land soil and slope combinations into hydrological response units hrus within each sub basin of the main catchment the hydrological and biogeochemical model processes are calculated for each hru and then lumped to produce a response for each sub basin to implement swat for the newby beck catchment the nextmap 5 m digital elevation model dem dataset intermap technologies 2009 was used to delineate the catchment boundary highlighted in fig 1 land use 25 m resolution was from the centre of ecology and hydrology ceh land cover map lcm 2007 morton et al 2011 which indicates the most likely broad habitat land classification for each 25 m grid square soil properties 1 km resolution were determined from the nsri database cranfield university 2014 in order to keep the simulation as computationally efficient as possible the catchment was divided spatially into 3 sub basins each with a different mean elevation within each sub basin hrus were defined based upon the unique combinations of the lcm land cover class the dominant proportion of coverage in each grid square and the dominant soil association brickfield 713 g resulting in 5 hrus per sub basin and 15 in total fig 1 fertilizer application rates for each land class were lumped up to hru level to provide an average nutrient application rate for each response unit finally the required precipitation and weather data were provided by the rain gauges and the aws fig 1 swat was set up to produce daily predictions of discharge and tp loads a sub daily variant of the model was available gassman et al 2007 however at present it does not produce sub daily output for nutrients therefore in this study we have used the daily time step variant of the model which has been used in numerous previous studies shen et al 2012a 2013 taylor et al 2016 wang and sun 2016 zhang et al 2014 model simulations are evaluated using daily observations of discharge and tp loads which are calculated from the high frequency data at the catchment outlet the modified scs curve number method was used for computing surface runoff volume while often used as a representation of infiltration excess runoff steenhuis et al 1995 have shown that it can also be interpreted in terms of saturation excess contributing areas which is more appropriate for the study catchment the penman monteith monteith 1965 method was used to calculate evapotranspiration and the muskingham routing method brakensiek 1967 overton 1966 to route water in the river network p is cycled through the soil through a combination of leaching mineralization decomposition and immobilization processes and surface runoff is largely assumed to be the primary transport route into the river network neitsch et al 2011 the algorithms for each respective process are solved and p is moved between respective soil stores and into the river network to ensure that mass balance is conserved the model was run with a two year warm up period and was calibrated over the 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 hydrological years and validated over the 2013 2014 hydrological year 2 3 the limits of acceptability glue uncertainty framework the performance of the swat simulations was assessed using the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 beven and binley 2014 glue was extended to use the limits of acceptability approach described by beven 2006 2009 and applied in previous applications to hydrological blazkova and beven 2009 krueger et al 2010 liu et al 2009 and water quality models krueger et al 2012 page et al 2003 2004 rankinen et al 2006 glue recognizes that for any given observational data set and performance criteria there may be multiple model parameter sets and structures that produce acceptable simulations each application is dependent on a number of decisions 1 choose which model parameters to vary 2 choose which model structures to consider e g whether in stream processing of nutrients is switched on or off 3 define prior distributions within which to sample each parameter 4 determine the limits of acceptability used to assess the performance of a model run 5 decide on a likelihood measure for creating the uncertainty prediction bounds given a set of behavioural models in the absence of any knowledge regarding the prior probability distributions of effective parameter values random uniform sampling is utilized between defined prior ranges however if this information is known it can be incorporated into the sampling strategy to assess if a given parameter set is behavioural limits of acceptability are specified for each observation at each time step during the calibration period to take into account the inherent uncertainty in the calibration data model performance score t is determined at each time step t by how well the simulated value satisfies these limits and are normalized as follows to compare limits over different measures 1 score t y t y t y t y min t y t y t y t y t y max t y t y t y t where ŷt is the simulated value yt is the best estimate of the observed value ymin t is the lower limit of acceptability and ymax t is the upper limit of acceptability for a given time step this results in scores that are zero at the best estimate of an observed value 1 at the lower limit and 1 at the upper limit for a model to be considered behavioural all scores must fall within the limits at every time step between 1 and 1 the first step in defining the limits of acceptability is to consider the range of output observational uncertainty for discharges this will depend on both water level measurement uncertainty and rating curve uncertainties e g mcmillan and westerberg 2015 for water quality load variables it will depend on uncertainties in discharge sampling and measurement of determinand concentrations in addition to their aggregation to the temporal and spatial scales of interest mcmillan et al 2012 where such uncertainties are estimated using fuzzy or interval arithmetic then limits of acceptability can be defined directly krueger et al 2010 2009 2012 pappenberger et al 2006 westerberg et al 2011 however where such uncertainties are estimated statistically there are normally no sharp limits on the potential ranges the assumed distributions will have infinite tails in this case it is necessary to truncate the uncertainty normally at the 95 or 99 level where such limits of acceptability are based only on the output observational uncertainties they provide a minimal range of acceptable behavior because no explicit account has been taken of the effect of input uncertainty this is more difficult to do since the nonlinear dynamics of most models make it difficult to assess the impact of input error independently of the model there is however the option of exploring input error propagation within the glue framework krueger et al 2010 2009 2012 page et al 2003 2004 in this paper an indirect approach was taken by relaxing the limits until a given number of behavioural simulations have been accepted we discuss a number of ways of doing so it can be done by imposing the condition that only a certain percentage of the scores must fall within the 1 to 1 scores e g 95 99 or by finding the minimum extension required of the limits for simulations to be considered behavioural this degree of relaxation can then be used to determine at least subjectively whether the model can be considered as fit for purpose once a set of behavioural simulations have been identified a final likelihood weight needs to be calculated for each behavioural model first a weight w is calculated at each evaluation time step t using eq 2 2 w t score t l lwr abs l lwr n l lwr score t 0 l upr score t abs l upr n 0 scores t l upr 0 score t l lwr l upr where score t is the normalized score at time step t and llwr and lupr are the lower and upper criteria to consider the set of models behavioural for the required number of time steps n is a shaping factor which is set at 1 in this case following the approach of liu et al 2009 this is a similar approach to applying a triangular fuzzy weight at each evaluation time step freer et al 2004 liu et al 2009 the weights at each time step are then combined to produce an overall likelihood weighting for each behavioural model 3 l m θ i y t 1 t w t where t is the total number of time steps and w t is a triangular fuzzy weighting at time step t as previously in glue prediction quantiles can then be formulated at any given time step t by calculating the likelihood weighted cumulative density function of a predicted variable over the set of behavioural models 4 p z t z t j 1 j n l m θ j z t j z t where p is the prediction quantile for ẑt the simulated value of variable z at time step t using model m θj being less than z l is the likelihood weighting associated with model m θj θj is the jth parameter set and n is the number of models accepted as behavioural in this study the model was evaluated using daily discharge and tp loads with the constraint imposed that for both discharge and tp loads the simulated value must fall within the limits of acceptability at all time steps throughout the calibration period 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 hydrological years this period totaled 731 time steps and accounting for both upper and lower limits gave 1462 limits to satisfy for discharge for tp loads there were 1210 limits to satisfy due to missing data giving a total of 2672 limits to be met for a model run to be considered behavioural this allows likelihood measures to be calculated for discharge lq and tp ltp respectively for each behavioural model run an overall likelihood lovr can be constructed as follows 5 l ovr l q l tp c where c is a scaling factor such that the sum of likelihoods scales to unity in each case eq 4 can then be applied to determine the uncertainty bounds on the model predictions here thirty two parameters in the swat model considered important for hydrology and water quality processes arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 van griensven et al 2006 were sampled uniformly between the ranges detailed in the model user manual table 1 as some parameters varied with land use a total of 39 were included in the monte carlo simulations in order to preserve the spatial heterogeneity of the soil and curve number parameters across hrus multipliers were applied during the monte carlo simulations table 1 the ranges and parameters chosen in table 1 were based around an initial sensitivity analysis for such a large parameter space many model runs were required and swat was implemented on the lancaster university hec high end computing facility the results presented are based on 5 000 000 iterations of the swat model executable version 2012 revision 637 run within an r wrapper r core team 2016 which sampled the parameters uniformly between the ranges specified in table 1 2 4 sources of uncertainty in the calibration data in order to set initial limits of acceptability for discharge and tp loads the uncertainty in the rating curve and in situ tp concentration measurements were first examined the methodology of deriving these limits is described briefly below with more detail available in hollaway et al submitted to produce a rating curve the velocity area rating extension vare model was used ewen et al 2010 which uses the water balance and an assumed maximum river velocity to constrain the extrapolation of the curve beyond the gauged range an extended version of the voting point likelihood methodology mcmillan and westerberg 2015 was used in a monte carlo framework to calibrate the rating curve in brief the voting point method works by evaluating candidate rating curves from the monte carlo sampling against the observations and in the vare method constrained by the water balance a candidate curve is considered behavioural if it falls within the uncertainty bounds of at least one of the observations and is weighted based upon a the number of measurements it intersects and b how close it lies to the true value in this case we use a triangular weighting finally 95 confidence limits are derived from all behavioural curves and their associated weightings to give the uncertainty limits on the discharge time series the resultant uncertainty based on 95 prediction quantiles on discharge was on average 96 with a range of 24 163 this range is much larger compared to those determined during a recent study on 500 uk catchments coxon et al 2015 which showed that the majority of catchments had 20 40 relative uncertainty intervals though the maximum uncertainty of 163 determined for newby beck here is much lower than the maximum value of 397 quoted by coxon et al 2015 as daily tp loads are determined from both discharge and in stream tp concentrations therefore we need to evaluate potential errors in the bank side analyser measurements to evaluate the uncertainty on the in situ concentrations measurements from the bankside analyser were paired with land analysed grab samples and isco data an empirical power law was then fitted once again using a voting point likelihood in a monte carlo framework in this case the lab analysed sample was assumed representative of the true concentration finally the unique combination of behavioural parameter sets from both the discharge and tp time series were used to estimate the uncertainty on the resultant tp load for the in situ tp concentrations from the bankside analyser uncertainty intervals ranged from 231 for the lower concentrations the bottom 5 to around 81 for the highest concentrations when combined with the discharge uncertainty this resulted in an average 271 for the lowest loads bottom 5 and 76 for the highest loads 3 results 3 1 model performance and rejection for the initial limits of acceptability see section 2 4 none of the 5 000 000 parameter sets sampled produced a model that satisfied the limits at every time step for both discharge and tp loads in order to investigate why the sampled parameter sets were not producing behavioural models a subset of the best parameter sets was chosen on which to perform further analysis in order to identify this subset of models we took two different approaches these two different methods were adopted to evaluate the sensitivity of accepted model parameter sets to the choice of evaluation measure the first approach was to find the minimum relaxation of the normalized limits across all time steps that was required to accept a set of 1000 models the second approach was to only require the model to fall within the limits in the high and low flow time steps in this case the thresholds for high and low flows for both discharge and tp were set as the top and bottom 5 of discharges as defined from the flow duration curve for this second evaluation measure if no parameter sets satisfied the initial limits of acceptability for all the selected time steps they were again relaxed until a set of 1000 models was accepted on which to perform further diagnostics 3 1 1 evaluation across all model time steps when the normalized scores of acceptance were allowed to relax based on normalized scores falling within the limits at all time steps to 6 72 1016 simulations can be considered acceptable in order to gain a better understanding of why such large relaxation of the limits was required a more detailed examination of the scores was made for the accepted simulations to look for systematic deviations between the simulations and observations fig 2 shows a summary of the performance of the 1016 simulations against observations over all time steps for the rising falling limbs of the hydrograph and for the high and low flow periods as defined above fig 2 also shows a comparison of the normalized scores against the observations for both discharge fig 2e and tp loads fig 2g the models tend to show a bias towards over prediction during the low flow periods in contrast there is systematic under prediction shown for both discharge fig 2q and tp fig 2s during the high flow periods although the normalized scores show a tendency to be smaller for these periods which reflects the larger absolute uncertainty intervals on the higher flow observations for both measures fig 2 overall the majority of scores which tend to be outside the original limits occur during the falling limb of the time series particularly for the lower magnitude flows and loads during these periods which could be a constraint on model performance this under prediction of peaks during the high flow periods is reflected in fig 3 which shows the time series of the performance of the 1016 accepted models during the summer autumn and early winter of the 2012 2013 hydrological year overall the model captures the timings of the peaks and low flow periods fairly well however the under prediction of the peaks in december and january is emphasized for both discharge fig 3a and tp loads fig 3b despite relatively high normalized scores shown in fig 2 during the low flow periods the over prediction of observations is less emphasized in fig 3 due to the smaller absolute widths of the uncertainty intervals at these time steps however over prediction is evident during the low flow period in late january 2013 particularly in the discharge time series 3 1 2 evaluation across high and low flow periods only when the model evaluation is constrained to the high and low time steps top and bottom 5 of time steps across the flow duration curve none of the 5 000 000 model runs fall within the original limits of acceptability hence in order to gain a subset of model runs for the calculation of model diagnostics we relaxed the limits to 5 30 to gain a set of 1001 behavioural simulations fig 4 shows a comparison of the model performance versus the observations over all time steps rising falling time steps and high low flow time steps overall the picture is consistent when the models were constrained over all time steps section 3 1 1 with over prediction of both discharge and tp during the low flow periods fig 4f and h and under prediction during the high flow periods fig 4r and t however much higher over predictions are shown for lower discharge and tp loads particularly those classified as falling time steps fig 4n and p respectively where normalized scores approach 15 for discharge and 30 for tp these higher scores compared to fig 2 reflect the fact that we are only constraining the model on a smaller number of time steps albeit these are the high and low flow periods that are often considered important to simulate accurately to best capture catchment dynamics this once again shows that poor performance during the recession periods is a constraint on finding behavioural parameter sets for swat in application to this catchment fig 5 shows the time series of model performance of the 1001 accepted models during the summer autumn and early winter of the 2012 2013 hydrological year in this case as the high and low flow periods that are being used to constrain the model the dynamics of the catchment are captured much better by the accepted simulations with the model capturing both the timing and magnitude of the peaks for both discharge fig 5a and tp loads fig 5b however there is still under prediction of peaks during december and early january and over prediction of low flow periods during late january with this once again most evident in the discharge time series fig 5a 3 2 evaluation of model parameter uncertainty fig 6 shows projections of the sampled points on the likelihood surface as calculated by eq 5 onto single parameter axes for the parameters in table 1 for each of the behavioural simulations these have previously been called dotty plots and can be used to infer sensitivities of the individual parameters using the hornberger spear young method see beven 2009 the points shown are the 1016 simulations which satisfy the relaxed limits of acceptability for both discharge and p when evaluated across all time steps the same plot is shown in fig 7 when the models are evaluated across the high and low flow period only both figs 7 and 8 show consistency in the sensitivity of the parameters varied of the 39 parameters varied only four parameters exhibited any clear identifiability these are gw delay ground water delay rchrg dp deep aquifer percolation fraction lat ttime lateral flow travel time and lat orgp organic p in the baseflow further to this behavioural models are identified at both high and low values of the gw delay parameter which is consistent across both evaluation metrics some levels of identifiability were shown for the cn2 scs runoff curve number and slsoil slope length for lateral subsurface flow however the responses of these parameters differed between the method chosen to evaluate the models for slsoil when the model was evaluated on all time steps higher likelihood values were shown towards the higher end of the sample range the opposite was shown for evaluation over the high and low time steps only with higher likelihood values shown towards the lower end of the sampled parameter range overall the majority of parameters showed no sign of sensitivity and indicated high equifinality across the sampled ranges the parameters that exhibit sensitivity are all linked to runoff and sub surface processes and all interact to affect the time taken for water to reach the river network and thus affect the transport of p however the high equifinality in the other parameters particularly those in relation to the levels of p in the soils sol orgp and sol labp indicates that given the present assumptions and data available for the catchment there is not enough information to calibrate these parameters effectively 3 3 critical time steps for model failure fig 8 shows a breakdown of the classification high low or rising falling of the time steps of the sub sample of models chosen on which to perform model diagnostics that result in model failure lie outside the original limits of acceptability for both evaluation measures used in this study the falling limb time steps contribute the largest proportion of failing time steps for both simulated discharge 37 for all time steps evaluation and 34 for evaluation on high low time steps and tp loads 30 and 50 respectively all other time step classifications contribute roughly the same to model failure with the rising limb and high flow time steps accounting for approximately 10 15 of failures for both discharge and tp for discharge the low flow time steps account for around 10 of failures however for tp loads they provide a much smaller contribution at around 3 4 indicating that model performance at these time steps may be less of a constraint on model performance for tp overall it is shown that despite using two different model evaluation measures to accept behavioural models the falling limb time steps are consistently shown to be a constraint on model performance in this swat application to newby beck 3 4 model validation the 1016 1001 behavioural simulations all time steps evaluation high and low flows evaluation were then used to predict the discharge and p loads for a period not used in calibration winter of the 2013 2014 hydrological year due to data availability in order to validate the model performance figs 9 and 10 for discharge figs 9a and 10a the picture was somewhat similar during the validation period where the model tended to pick out the timings of the peaks and recession periods well overall under prediction of the observed discharge peaks was seen throughout the validation period being most evident during mid december 2013 and early january 2014 as when calibrating the model the under prediction of peaks was more pronounced when the models were evaluated across all time steps fig 9a both the timing and magnitude of the peaks was picked up much better when constraining the models on the high and low flow periods fig 10a as in calibrating the model the low flow periods were typically over predicted by the model on both evaluation measures with this being most evident towards the end of january 2014 for tp loads the picture is the same as during calibration with the model under predicting all peaks particularly when they were constrained using all time steps where the model failed to capture the magnitude of any peak fig 9b and 10b when constrained on the high and low flows time steps only the model reproduced the magnitudes and timings of the majority of the peak loads however there are still cases where the model under predicts a peak by up to 75 15th december 2013 further to this the uncertainty bounds on the model predictions are much wider during the recession limbs of the tp time series and shows over prediction of the observations during this period 4 discussion this work presents for the first time a limits of acceptability glue uncertainty analysis of the widely used swat model using continuous high frequency water quality measurements it was shown that when initial limits of acceptability based upon the uncertainty in the outlet data for the calibration period are accounted for and given the assumptions detailed none of the 5 000 000 simulations provided suitable predictability of the dynamics of the catchment i e none of them were classed as behavioural therefore in order to obtain behavioural simulations to investigate the uncertainty in the swat model predictions a subset of samples was obtained on which to perform further diagnostics with this subset chosen using two different criteria the first was to find the minimum level of relaxation across all model time steps in the calibration period required to consider the models acceptable in this case relaxation of the limits to 6 72 gave a subset of 1016 acceptable models in the second case we only required the models to fall within the relaxed limits during periods of high and low flow here defined as the top and bottom 5 of discharges based on the flow duration curve for these criteria the limits had to be relaxed over the high and low flow periods only 5 30 to give a subset of 1001 accepted models this was across both discharge and tp loads using these two different evaluation measures produced two distinctly different time series when the models were compared with observations figs 5 and 7 and during the validation period figs 9 and 10 when the models were constrained to fit within the limits across all time steps the parameter sets that are considered acceptable consistently under predict the peaks in both discharge and tp loads particularly during the validation period in contrast when we only constrain the model on the low and high flow periods the simulations from the accepted parameter sets produce a much better representation of the catchment dynamics particularly in the magnitudes of the tp load peaks however constraining the model in this way accepts simulations that have poor performance during the rising limb and recession periods where the normalized scores approach 15 in the case of discharge and 30 in the case of tp loads this contrast between the chosen metric to evaluate the model is the result of several different factors and depends on the characteristics and dynamics of the newby beck catchment due to its flashy nature and low baseflow index ockenden et al 2016 outram et al 2014 newby beck is dominated by sub daily processes which may lead to timing errors in the simulated hydrograph from swat due to the use of the daily time step of the model therefore when all time steps are included in the evaluation metric there is a high chance of the model simulations producing high normalized scores however as reported recently by coxon et al 2014 constraining the model using time step measures such as these can be a very critical test of the model particularly due to the strong influence of observational uncertainty on such metrics see section 3 1 this is shown in fig 3 where all of the accepted 1016 simulations when using the all time step metric under predicted the peaks by a large amount for both discharge and tp loads despite being considered acceptable within the relaxed limits of 6 72 this could be because the normalized scores are based upon the relative uncertainty intervals around the observations which allows a larger absolute deviation from the observed value on the peaks this is a case of accepting a model that is not a good representation of the processes but which fits within the errors in the calibration data beven 2012 beven and smith 2015 it should also be noted that the normalized scores are also based on estimates of the 95 limits around each observation see 2 4 and therefore the potential range of uncertainty could be larger in order to test the effect of this on model evaluation we performed the same analysis of relaxing the scores until 1057 simulations were accepted however in this instance we only required the model to fit the limits at 95 of the time steps fig 11 shows the time series of discharge and tp compared to the observations and shows that when accounting for the model only fitting the time steps 95 of the time the model still produces simulations where the peaks are underestimated such as in early january 2013 hence there is the still the risk of poor models being accepted due to uncertainty in the calibration data when the lesser constraint of just high and low flows often the periods of most nutrient transport in flashy catchments haygarth et al 2005 ockenden et al 2016 perks et al 2015 was applied simulations that match the peaks and low flow periods with a greater degree of accuracy were produced this also required less relaxation of the limits of acceptability 5 30 this is in agreement with the recent work of coxon et al 2014 showing that the performance of behavioural models accepted using different diagnostics can be strongly linked to the dominant processes occurring in the catchment in this case we have shown that constraining the models on high and low flow periods only in a flashy catchment produces a model ensemble that captures the peak discharges and tp loads better however the utilization of this diagnostic further highlights the time steps resulting in poor model performance where time steps not used in the evaluation e g the rising and falling time steps return much higher normalized scores in excess of 30 as shown in fig 5 than when the metric across all time steps is used however we have shown here that despite the choice of evaluation metric a consistent picture emerges about which class of time step is contributing most to model failures fig 8 overall the falling limb recession time steps were consistently a constraint on model performance contributing between 30 and 50 of failing time steps for discharge and tp time steps across both evaluation measures this therefore indicates potential errors in the model structure of swat of the representation of sub surface processes an area of the model that has been shown to perform poorly in the past guse et al 2014 for a large number of the parameters it is difficult to identify any sensitivity in fitting the observations and a large amount of equifinality is evident figs 7 and 8 this is particularly the case for the sol orgp soil organic p and sol labp soil labile p parameters which show no clear sensitivity at all using the likelihood measure based on the limits of acceptability both of these parameters have been shown to play an important role in the amount of p in the water course and are often very difficult to measure in any detail at the catchment scale schoumans et al 2009 it is accepted that given a 39 dimension parameter space 5 000 000 swat runs provides only a small sample of the model parameter space albeit many more than any previously published swat calibration exercise and that such a small sample can contribute to the uncertainty thus there is the possibility of missing potentially behavioural models during the sampling process they are clearly however sparsely distributed even with the relaxed limits of acceptability further adding to model parameter uncertainty is the gw delay parameter which exhibits strong identifiability but showing the identification behavioural models at both extremes of the parameter range therefore in this application of swat both high and low groundwater delay times produce equivalent model performance in terms of the relaxed limits of acceptability this infers that there could be compensation processes occurring in the sub surface module of the model or could highlight additional issues in the model structural representation of groundwater attenuation in the catchment the limits of acceptability approach provides advantages over more traditional evaluation metrics such as nse and root mean square error rmse these are global measures which tend to focus on the average error from the data over the calibration period rather than focus on the individual time steps that are causing the model to fail the limits approach utilizes the high frequency data to provide a more detailed evaluation of the model and allows the identification of critical time steps that are causing poor model performance further to this the limits approach goes someway to accounting for uncertainty in the data observations used to calibrate the model however it is impossible to make this method completely objective due to the difficulty in accounting for error in the model inputs in past applications of the glue limits of acceptability approach liu et al 2009 the relaxation of the limits was justified to account for uncertainty in the model input data however in this case the model user must examine the degree of relaxation in the scores and utilize the available knowledge of the inputs to see if the level of relaxation is acceptable given the epistemic nature of the input uncertainties it is difficult to truly assess the effect of input error and its representation needs to be independent of the model structure e g beven 2006 one method is to employ the use of an statistical error model to account for input error in the model e g krueger et al 2010 go some way to accounting for this but it is difficult to create a realistic error model even for rainfall inputs it would also be even more computationally expensive and thus was not implemented in the present work the effects of both input error and model structural errors should be seen in the deviations outside the normalized limits the results show that the limits have to be relaxed by a very large amount up to a factor of 6 72 to gain a set of behavioural simulations that allows the sensitivity of the parameter sets to be explored an examination of the potential input errors to the catchment system has been taken in this study to determine whether a relaxation by factors of up to seven are acceptable in the newby beck catchment there are four rain gauges sited in a relatively small area 12 5 km2 fig 1 it is still possible that some rainfall in the catchment could be missed in the model input particularly during summer convective storms leading to commensurability issues with the rainfall input beven and smith 2015 beven et al 2011 different rainfall input realizations and associated errors have previously been shown to impact model performance blazkova and beven 2009 however due to the relatively good coverage by the rain gauges in the newby beck catchment errors in the rainfall input are likely to be small it can therefore be concluded that it is model structural error rather than input error that is leading to the high relaxation of the limits required to define model realizations of the hydrograph as acceptable with respect to p there is a much larger uncertainty in the overall inputs into the catchment particularly to the exact amounts of fertilizer spread on the land and the amount of dung deposited from grazing lacking more detailed information the inputs used in this application of swat are based upon defra recommendations defra 2013 and local knowledge of the catchment furthermore the lumped nature of the swat model requires average p inputs for each hru which can add further uncertainty in the amount of nutrients added to the system this can therefore lead to the locations of the inputs being smoothed out leading to commensurability issues however the average amount of p added to the catchment per year during the run 2 3 kg ha 1 is much smaller than the levels of p in the soil stores during the course of the run approximately 15 000 kg ha 1 thus errors in p inputs and timing are unlikely to have an effect on the levels of p being transported to the stream compared to uncertainty and errors in the parameters and model structures which govern the mobilisation and transport of p in the soil previous work on similar small sized catchments also suggests that hydrological and biochemical processes have a much larger control on the temporal variations in stream p in the catchment rather than the timings and magnitudes of the agricultural inputs dupas et al 2015 haygarth et al 2012 in this work we explicitly account for the uncertainty in soil p by varying the sol orgp and sol labp organic and labile p soil stores as part of the glue analysis with both of these parameters showing high equifinality it has also been shown in previous analysis on newby beck ockenden et al 2016 that the observed tp loads during storm events in the catchment are highly correlated with peaks in rainfall these storm events account for approximately 83 of the annual tp load indicating that rainfall plays a strong role in controlling the transport of tp into the stream network as discussed above the errors in rainfall are likely to be relatively low in this catchment and given its importance as a driver of tp transport along with the small contribution of p inputs to overall soil p we can conclude that relaxing the limits by a factor of 6 72 is not acceptable in this application of swat to newby beck we can therefore conclude that as with discharge model structural error is the likely cause of this requirement to relax the constraints by such a substantial amount the ability of the model to adequately simulate the observed tp loads is also further compounded by the poor performance of swat in terms of discharge evaluation given that discharge is part of the tp load calculation hence as model structural error has been shown to be such a large constraint in the accurate prediction of discharge and thus tp loads it is unlikely that improvements in input data will greatly improve model predictions in addition to this even in a small experimental catchment gaining sufficient improvement in model input data would require significant expense in the case of tp this would require detailed farmer logs in timings and location of fertilizer applications detailed monitoring of surface and subsurface storage and availability of tp in the catchment along with detailed field scale budgets of the nutrients in the soils this prompts an additional question if we are required to relax the limits which are primarily due to structural error in the model by a factor of 6 72 should we go to the expense of collecting the additional input data required by such a complex model structure it has been shown in previous work dean et al 2009 shen et al 2012a that insufficient input data are a constraint on even the best of models therefore clearly improvement is required on both sides the advantage of using the limits of acceptability approach is that we can use the results of the model evaluation to target which areas of the model structure require improvement and infer which areas are best to target our efforts for additional data collection particularly in situations where funds for such efforts are limited 5 conclusions this study has presented the first limits of acceptability assessment of the swat model using continuous high frequency discharge and water quality monitoring data we highlight that having the availability of high frequency data coupled with the glue limits of acceptability approach the model performance can be assessed taking into account the uncertainty on the calibration data at each time step this provides greater insights into why the model is failing beyond the more traditional global measures of model evaluation such as nse and rmse in the application of swat to the newby beck headwater catchment in the uk it is shown that the limits of acceptability based on output observational uncertainties have to be relaxed by a substantial amount by factors of between 5 3 and 6 72 on a normalized scale depending on the evaluation criteria used in order to produce a set of behavioural simulations 1001 and 1016 respectively out of 5 000 000 realizations on which to perform model diagnostics in this case despite the evaluation metric used the model is shown to consistently perform poorly during periods of recession in both the discharge and tp time series with uncertainty in the representation of subsurface flow pathways identified as a potential cause for this poor performance during the validation period the model was shown to capture the timings of peaks in the river tp load however it was shown to often predict the magnitude of these peaks poorly this work raises an interesting point how much relaxation is allowable in the limits of acceptability before we consider the model as not providing useful predictions of the processes occurring in the catchment on the one hand we have learnt from the model to identify areas where we need to focus future model development and data collection efforts in river catchments on the other we have shown that in this particular case swat is not fit for purpose to be used as a management tool due to the large uncertainty bounds on predictions particularly during the validation period this conclusion agrees with previous applications of swat to other catchments of similar catchment areas and similar geoclimatic circumstances hoang et al 2017 moges et al 2017 schneiderman et al 2007 therefore despite being used in numerous catchments worldwide often with less rigorous evaluation swat may not be fit for purpose as a general management tool particularly in flashy catchments being dominated by overland flow where the model structure may be inadequate to accurately capture the major catchment processes dominating p transfer however there is still a need to advise policy makers on how changes in the environment are likely to affect hydrology and water quality in the future and what mitigation measures to take if any a number of potential options are available such as precautionary methods suggested by beven 2011 or the use of fuzzy modelling methods page et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 or finding another process based model to use though it is highly likely that another model will suffer the same uncertainty issues as shown here with swat a final option is to shift towards more simple p transfer models e g dupas et al 2016 which have been shown to capture p losses well with minimum input data however as highlighted by dupas et al 2016 such models still have uncertainties associated with them and in some cases still require substantial relaxation of the limits of acceptability we acknowledge that process based models may be potentially useful catchment management tools they are often used to quantify the effects of changes in catchment conditions e g climate change on the behavior of nutrients in catchments crossman et al 2014 wang and sun 2016 they are primarily used because they provide a numerical representation of conceptual processes that in theory represent how these processes adapt to changing environmental conditions under different scenarios however the results presented here stress the importance of having the best available input data along with high frequency data from continuous monitoring systems for rigorous model evaluation as highlighted in previous studies benettin et al 2015 dupas et al 2016 halliday et al 2015 ockenden et al 2017 high frequency data allows us to set more robust limits of acceptability particularly in catchments with a flashy response where infrequent grab samples may fail to capture key processes events and may not provide a stringent enough test of the model structure processes the results also imply that more needs to be done to improve the ability of the model to simulate the dynamics of key catchment processes with parameters that are more identifiable in practical applications or more easily estimated in predicting future conditions finally our results also indicate the possibility that even with the best representation of the key processes in the model structure we still may have a long way to go to have sufficient input data to adequately drive such complex model structures the study has not resolved the issue of how far the limits of acceptability should be relaxed to provide a set of models considered useful for predicting outcomes that is a question for individual users to consider for particular types of applications i e can we be objective about the effects of input error on model performance particularly for predicting nutrient responses this study suggests that swat may not be fit for purpose in this particular application however confirmation of its general applicability or not requires critical testing of the method on multiple models and multiple catchment datasets in ways that allow for uncertainty and potential equifinality of model representations acknowledgments this study was funded by the natural

7470,there is a need to model and predict the transfer of phosphorus p from land to water but this is challenging because of the large number of complex physical and biogeochemical processes involved this study presents for the first time a limits of acceptability approach of the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue framework to the soil and water assessment tool swat in an application to a water quality problem in the newby beck catchment 12 5 km2 cumbria united kingdom uk using high frequency outlet data discharge and p individual evaluation criteria limits of acceptability were assigned to observed discharge and p loads for all evaluation time steps identifying where the model was performing well poorly and to infer which processes required improvement in the model structure initial limits of acceptability were required to be relaxed by a substantial amount by factors of between 5 3 and 6 7 on a normalized scale depending on the evaluation criteria used in order to gain a set of behavioral simulations 1001 and 1016 respectively out of 5 000 000 of the 39 model parameters tested the representation of subsurface processes and associated parameters were consistently shown as critical to the model not meeting the evaluation criteria irrespective of the chosen evaluation metric it is therefore concluded that swat is not an appropriate model to guide p management in this catchment this approach highlights the importance of high frequency monitoring data for setting robust model evaluation criteria it also raises the question as to whether it is possible to have sufficient input data available to drive such models so that we can have confidence in their predictions and their ability to inform catchment management strategies to tackle the

these models are typically considered over parameterized with large numbers of interacting parameters governing the key physical and biogeochemical processes represented in the model structure beven 2006 dean et al 2009 krueger et al 2007 while the parameters of such models may have some physical significance effective values of those parameters are required to account for variability in the catchment key processes and the model limitations beven 1996 2002 2006 with these frequently estimated through a combination of manual and automated calibration procedures beven 2006 also highlighted that there is often limited information in the model calibration data to effectively identify calibrated values for model parameters for example infrequent water quality data collection which does not fully pick up catchment dynamics can lead to uncertainty in p load calculations johnes 2007 which then impacts on the ability of the models to simulate catchment water quality accurately radcliffe et al 2009 this uncertainty coupled with other sources of uncertainty results in equifinality where multiple and very different parameter sets produce an equally acceptable fit to observations beven 2006 a so called optimum parameter set will not then be robust to a change in the period of calibration data in some cases parts of a data set may not be informative in calibrating and evaluating a model beven and smith 2015 furthermore the concept of equifinality has been exhibited in the observed biogeochemistry of a catchment whereby signals in the observations can be explained by a large number of interacting processes haygarth et al 2012 understanding how well these process based models represent the key processes in the source mobilization and delivery continuum will improve their ability as learning tools in helping to unravel the complex interactions occurring in a catchment this is particularly the case where the processes are often difficult or impossible to measure at the catchment scale e g phosphorus concentrations in different nutrient pools in the soil as a result in recent years the impact of such uncertainties has received increased attention in water quality modelling

equifinality concept in using a set of acceptable or behavioural models to estimate the uncertainty in model predictions it also provides a framework to evaluate a model as fit for purpose in representing the dynamics of a catchment using a set of evaluation criteria in this study glue is used with a limits of acceptability approach to evaluate a model parameter set which should take into account the inherent error in the calibration data such as errors in discharge data arising from rating curve uncertainties blazkova and beven 2009 krueger et al 2010 mcmillan et al 2012 mcmillan and westerberg 2015 pappenberger et al 2006 westerberg et al 2011 and errors in water quality data krueger et al 2012 page et al 2003 2004 rankinen et al 2006 the advantage of this approach is that it allows varying limits to be set for individual observations as well as combining evaluations based on different types of observations in a consistent way beven 2006 furthermore it has been demonstrated that high frequency coupled hydrochemical data allows short term changes in catchment dynamics to be better captured benettin et al 2015 halliday et al 2015 and a greater understanding of the complex and non linear interactions in the catchment system to be obtained this is particularly the case in flashy catchments where storm events can lead to rapid changes in stream concentrations of p and thus allows more robust and empirically defined model evaluation criteria to be set however the reality of not having such high quality data available can often make it difficult to define appropriate limits dean et al 2009 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 is one such process based model that has been the focus of uncertainty and calibration procedures in recent years arnold et al 2012 karamouz et al 2015 schuol and abbaspour 2006 shen et al 2012a designed to simulate the impacts of management and mitigation on biogeochemistry and water quality in ungauged river basins development of swat began in the early 1990 s gassman et al 2007 the model has been continually improved over the years and has incorporated key components based on those in other established models these include the hydrology component from the chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model knisel 1980 the pesticide component from the groundwater loadings effects on agricultural management systems gleams model leonard et al 1987 and the crop growth component from the environmental impact policy climate model izaurralde et al 2006 which was previously known as the erosion productivity impact calculator epic model williams 1990 finally river routing and instream kinetic routines were incorporated based around the routing options to outlet roto arnold et al 1995 and qual2e brown and barnwell 1987 models respectively the glue framework has been applied to swat before karamouz et al 2015 shen et al 2012a with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse typically used as the likelihood measure a prescribed threshold is used to define behavioural simulations with focus tending to be on how the model performs in the medium to long term typically monthly to yearly these studies demonstrated that high uncertainty exists in the model predictions with a number of key parameters for flow and nutrient processes being unidentifiable due to limitations in the model input and calibration data shen et al 2012a however due to limited computational power these studies sampled only a small area of the parameter space 10 000 iterations for a 20 parameter space and hence could miss sampling potentially behavioural parameter sets further to this previous uncertainty applications to swat focus largely on using summary statistics such as nse to evaluate model performance shen et al 2012a b 2013 and do not focus on those time steps critical to model failure finally whilst there have been previous studies with swat that are concerned with the effects of input data uncertainty on model performance shen et al 2012b 2013 no previous study accounts for uncertainty in the data used to calibrate the model this work provides for the first time a limits of acceptability approach of the glue framework to the swat model in an application to the newby beck sub catchment of the river eden basin in cumbria uk this study takes advantage of the high temporal resolution water quality monitoring data set from the demonstration test catchments dtc project mcgonigle et al 2014 to gain a better understanding of the uncertainty in the predictions of models such as swat by using the limits of acceptability to identify exact time steps critical to model failure this will provide an insight as to whether it is suitable to use swat as a catchment management tool in the newby beck sub catchment we do this by evaluating whether it can adequately represent the key dynamics of p transport to the stream whilst also explicitly accounting for errors in calibration data this study has the following objectives 1 what are the critical time steps causing the model to be classed as not acceptable 2 what can be learned from the uncertainty in the model predictions to better understand the complex interactions occurring at the catchment scale 3 can we identify which processes require further investigation in the model structure and do we have sufficient input data to drive such complex models 2 materials and methods 2 1 catchment description and observations newby beck fig 1 is a small headwater sub catchment located in the river eden basin in the north west of england in the united kingdom the catchment is approximately 12 5 km2 in size with an average elevation of 234 m above sea level owen et al 2012 perks et al 2015 the underlying geology is dominated by carboniferous limestone which is overlain by low permeability glacial deposits there are well drained fine and loamy soils over limestone waltham soil association 541q in the upper reaches seasonally wet deep loamy soils in drift from paleozoic sandstone and shale in the mid reaches brickfield 3 soil association 713 g and seasonally waterlogged reddish fine and coarse loamy soils in glacial till clifton soil association 711n in the lower reaches of the catchment national soil resources institute nsri cranfield university 2014 the dominant soil unit in the catchment is the 713 g brickfield association which covers approximately 66 of the basin area the primary land use in the catchment is improved grassland approximately 76 by area which is used for a mix of dairy and beef production other land uses are rough grassland 14 arable 6 woodland 2 5 and built over land 0 5 morton et al 2011 the climate of the region is cool temperate maritime with an annual average rainfall of around 1200 mm due to the underlying geology 23 of the catchment area is greater than 5 which results in rapid catchment response time leading to a time to peak of about 3 h perks et al 2015 based on the hydrology of soil types host classifications the catchment has a standard percent runoff of 35 perks et al 2015 resulting in very flashy responses of the hydrograph to rainfall events and high occurrences of saturated overland flow ockenden et al 2016 the catchment outlet was a rated section of channel used to provide high frequency discharge data at 15 min intervals the discharge measurements were calculated from a time series of stage measurements obtained with a sws mini diver using site specific rating curves in addition a high frequency bankside monitoring station was situated at the outlet which recorded nitrate no3 total p tp and total reactive p trp at 30 min intervals outram et al 2014 the tp and trp measurements were conducted using a hach lange combined sigmatax sampling module and phosphax sigma analyzer perks et al 2015 rainfall was recorded at 15 min intervals by three tipping bucket rain gauges other meteorological data was provided by an automatic weather station aws which was located towards the centre of the catchment fig 1 daily rainfall data was also gained from a rain gauge located in the centre of newby beck catchment from the met office integrated data archive system midas network met office 2012 the location of the monitoring stations rain gauges and outlet monitoring station are shown in fig 1 information on fertilizer and manure applications were based around a typical dairy and beef grassland catchment system with guidance from the defra fertilizer handbook rb209 defra 2013 and available farm diary data for the catchment for the years 2011 2014 2 2 implementation of the swat model to newby beck the swat model version 2012 revision 637 is a semi distributed process based model arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 which simulates surface and sub surface hydrology along with various nutrient including p and sediment fluxes at a basin scale the model also incorporates various land management practices along with a crop growth model in order to simulate the impact of agriculture at the catchment scale swat also includes urban area management practices and can incorporate pollution from point sources such as sewage treatment works the model requires spatial information including land use soil type and elevation which are often input as gis layers additional inputs required include any land management practices e g fertilizer application rates and animal stocking densities and weather data including rainfall temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation in order to reduce the computational complexity of swat a semi distributed approach is taken such that the model lumps unique land soil and slope combinations into hydrological response units hrus within each sub basin of the main catchment the hydrological and biogeochemical model processes are calculated for each hru and then lumped to produce a response for each sub basin to implement swat for the newby beck catchment the nextmap 5 m digital elevation model dem dataset intermap technologies 2009 was used to delineate the catchment boundary highlighted in fig 1 land use 25 m resolution was from the centre of ecology and hydrology ceh land cover map lcm 2007 morton et al 2011 which indicates the most likely broad habitat land classification for each 25 m grid square soil properties 1 km resolution were determined from the nsri database cranfield university 2014 in order to keep the simulation as computationally efficient as possible the catchment was divided spatially into 3 sub basins each with a different mean elevation within each sub basin hrus were defined based upon the unique combinations of the lcm land cover class the dominant proportion of coverage in each grid square and the dominant soil association brickfield 713 g resulting in 5 hrus per sub basin and 15 in total fig 1 fertilizer application rates for each land class were lumped up to hru level to provide an average nutrient application rate for each response unit finally the required precipitation and weather data were provided by the rain gauges and the aws fig 1 swat was set up to produce daily predictions of discharge and tp loads a sub daily variant of the model was available gassman et al 2007 however at present it does not produce sub daily output for nutrients therefore in this study we have used the daily time step variant of the model which has been used in numerous previous studies shen et al 2012a 2013 taylor et al 2016 wang and sun 2016 zhang et al 2014 model simulations are evaluated using daily observations of discharge and tp loads which are calculated from the high frequency data at the catchment outlet the modified scs curve number method was used for computing surface runoff volume while often used as a representation of infiltration excess runoff steenhuis et al 1995 have shown that it can also be interpreted in terms of saturation excess contributing areas which is more appropriate for the study catchment the penman monteith monteith 1965 method was used to calculate evapotranspiration and the muskingham routing method brakensiek 1967 overton 1966 to route water in the river network p is cycled through the soil through a combination of leaching mineralization decomposition and immobilization processes and surface runoff is largely assumed to be the primary transport route into the river network neitsch et al 2011 the algorithms for each respective process are solved and p is moved between respective soil stores and into the river network to ensure that mass balance is conserved the model was run with a two year warm up period and was calibrated over the 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 hydrological years and validated over the 2013 2014 hydrological year 2 3 the limits of acceptability glue uncertainty framework the performance of the swat simulations was assessed using the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 beven and binley 2014 glue was extended to use the limits of acceptability approach described by beven 2006 2009 and applied in previous applications to hydrological blazkova and beven 2009 krueger et al 2010 liu et al 2009 and water quality models krueger et al 2012 page et al 2003 2004 rankinen et al 2006 glue recognizes that for any given observational data set and performance criteria there may be multiple model parameter sets and structures that produce acceptable simulations each application is dependent on a number of decisions 1 choose which model parameters to vary 2 choose which model structures to consider e g whether in stream processing of nutrients is switched on or off 3 define prior distributions within which to sample each parameter 4 determine the limits of acceptability used to assess the performance of a model run 5 decide on a likelihood measure for creating the uncertainty prediction bounds given a set of behavioural models in the absence of any knowledge regarding the prior probability distributions of effective parameter values random uniform sampling is utilized between defined prior ranges however if this information is known it can be incorporated into the sampling strategy to assess if a given parameter set is behavioural limits of acceptability are specified for each observation at each time step during the calibration period to take into account the inherent uncertainty in the calibration data model performance score t is determined at each time step t by how well the simulated value satisfies these limits and are normalized as follows to compare limits over different measures 1 score t y t y t y t y min t y t y t y t y t y max t y t y t y t where ŷt is the simulated value yt is the best estimate of the observed value ymin t is the lower limit of acceptability and ymax t is the upper limit of acceptability for a given time step this results in scores that are zero at the best estimate of an observed value 1 at the lower limit and 1 at the upper limit for a model to be considered behavioural all scores must fall within the limits at every time step between 1 and 1 the first step in defining the limits of acceptability is to consider the range of output observational uncertainty for discharges this will depend on both water level measurement uncertainty and rating curve uncertainties e g mcmillan and westerberg 2015 for water quality load variables it will depend on uncertainties in discharge sampling and measurement of determinand concentrations in addition to their aggregation to the temporal and spatial scales of interest mcmillan et al 2012 where such uncertainties are estimated using fuzzy or interval arithmetic then limits of acceptability can be defined directly krueger et al 2010 2009 2012 pappenberger et al 2006 westerberg et al 2011 however where such uncertainties are estimated statistically there are normally no sharp limits on the potential ranges the assumed distributions will have infinite tails in this case it is necessary to truncate the uncertainty normally at the 95 or 99 level where such limits of acceptability are based only on the output observational uncertainties they provide a minimal range of acceptable behavior because no explicit account has been taken of the effect of input uncertainty this is more difficult to do since the nonlinear dynamics of most models make it difficult to assess the impact of input error independently of the model there is however the option of exploring input error propagation within the glue framework krueger et al 2010 2009 2012 page et al 2003 2004 in this paper an indirect approach was taken by relaxing the limits until a given number of behavioural simulations have been accepted we discuss a number of ways of doing so it can be done by imposing the condition that only a certain percentage of the scores must fall within the 1 to 1 scores e g 95 99 or by finding the minimum extension required of the limits for simulations to be considered behavioural this degree of relaxation can then be used to determine at least subjectively whether the model can be considered as fit for purpose once a set of behavioural simulations have been identified a final likelihood weight needs to be calculated for each behavioural model first a weight w is calculated at each evaluation time step t using eq 2 2 w t score t l lwr abs l lwr n l lwr score t 0 l upr score t abs l upr n 0 scores t l upr 0 score t l lwr l upr where score t is the normalized score at time step t and llwr and lupr are the lower and upper criteria to consider the set of models behavioural for the required number of time steps n is a shaping factor which is set at 1 in this case following the approach of liu et al 2009 this is a similar approach to applying a triangular fuzzy weight at each evaluation time step freer et al 2004 liu et al 2009 the weights at each time step are then combined to produce an overall likelihood weighting for each behavioural model 3 l m θ i y t 1 t w t where t is the total number of time steps and w t is a triangular fuzzy weighting at time step t as previously in glue prediction quantiles can then be formulated at any given time step t by calculating the likelihood weighted cumulative density function of a predicted variable over the set of behavioural models 4 p z t z t j 1 j n l m θ j z t j z t where p is the prediction quantile for ẑt the simulated value of variable z at time step t using model m θj being less than z l is the likelihood weighting associated with model m θj θj is the jth parameter set and n is the number of models accepted as behavioural in this study the model was evaluated using daily discharge and tp loads with the constraint imposed that for both discharge and tp loads the simulated value must fall within the limits of acceptability at all time steps throughout the calibration period 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 hydrological years this period totaled 731 time steps and accounting for both upper and lower limits gave 1462 limits to satisfy for discharge for tp loads there were 1210 limits to satisfy due to missing data giving a total of 2672 limits to be met for a model run to be considered behavioural this allows likelihood measures to be calculated for discharge lq and tp ltp respectively for each behavioural model run an overall likelihood lovr can be constructed as follows 5 l ovr l q l tp c where c is a scaling factor such that the sum of likelihoods scales to unity in each case eq 4 can then be applied to determine the uncertainty bounds on the model predictions here thirty two parameters in the swat model considered important for hydrology and water quality processes arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 van griensven et al 2006 were sampled uniformly between the ranges detailed in the model user manual table 1 as some parameters varied with land use a total of 39 were included in the monte carlo simulations in order to preserve the spatial heterogeneity of the soil and curve number parameters across hrus multipliers were applied during the monte carlo simulations table 1 the ranges and parameters chosen in table 1 were based around an initial sensitivity analysis for such a large parameter space many model runs were required and swat was implemented on the lancaster university hec high end computing facility the results presented are based on 5 000 000 iterations of the swat model executable version 2012 revision 637 run within an r wrapper r core team 2016 which sampled the parameters uniformly between the ranges specified in table 1 2 4 sources of uncertainty in the calibration data in order to set initial limits of acceptability for discharge and tp loads the uncertainty in the rating curve and in situ tp concentration measurements were first examined the methodology of deriving these limits is described briefly below with more detail available in hollaway et al submitted to produce a rating curve the velocity area rating extension vare model was used ewen et al 2010 which uses the water balance and an assumed maximum river velocity to constrain the extrapolation of the curve beyond the gauged range an extended version of the voting point likelihood methodology mcmillan and westerberg 2015 was used in a monte carlo framework to calibrate the rating curve in brief the voting point method works by evaluating candidate rating curves from the monte carlo sampling against the observations and in the vare method constrained by the water balance a candidate curve is considered behavioural if it falls within the uncertainty bounds of at least one of the observations and is weighted based upon a the number of measurements it intersects and b how close it lies to the true value in this case we use a triangular weighting finally 95 confidence limits are derived from all behavioural curves and their associated weightings to give the uncertainty limits on the discharge time series the resultant uncertainty based on 95 prediction quantiles on discharge was on average 96 with a range of 24 163 this range is much larger compared to those determined during a recent study on 500 uk catchments coxon et al 2015 which showed that the majority of catchments had 20 40 relative uncertainty intervals though the maximum uncertainty of 163 determined for newby beck here is much lower than the maximum value of 397 quoted by coxon et al 2015 as daily tp loads are determined from both discharge and in stream tp concentrations therefore we need to evaluate potential errors in the bank side analyser measurements to evaluate the uncertainty on the in situ concentrations measurements from the bankside analyser were paired with land analysed grab samples and isco data an empirical power law was then fitted once again using a voting point likelihood in a monte carlo framework in this case the lab analysed sample was assumed representative of the true concentration finally the unique combination of behavioural parameter sets from both the discharge and tp time series were used to estimate the uncertainty on the resultant tp load for the in situ tp concentrations from the bankside analyser uncertainty intervals ranged from 231 for the lower concentrations the bottom 5 to around 81 for the highest concentrations when combined with the discharge uncertainty this resulted in an average 271 for the lowest loads bottom 5 and 76 for the highest loads 3 results 3 1 model performance and rejection for the initial limits of acceptability see section 2 4 none of the 5 000 000 parameter sets sampled produced a model that satisfied the limits at every time step for both discharge and tp loads in order to investigate why the sampled parameter sets were not producing behavioural models a subset of the best parameter sets was chosen on which to perform further analysis in order to identify this subset of models we took two different approaches these two different methods were adopted to evaluate the sensitivity of accepted model parameter sets to the choice of evaluation measure the first approach was to find the minimum relaxation of the normalized limits across all time steps that was required to accept a set of 1000 models the second approach was to only require the model to fall within the limits in the high and low flow time steps in this case the thresholds for high and low flows for both discharge and tp were set as the top and bottom 5 of discharges as defined from the flow duration curve for this second evaluation measure if no parameter sets satisfied the initial limits of acceptability for all the selected time steps they were again relaxed until a set of 1000 models was accepted on which to perform further diagnostics 3 1 1 evaluation across all model time steps when the normalized scores of acceptance were allowed to relax based on normalized scores falling within the limits at all time steps to 6 72 1016 simulations can be considered acceptable in order to gain a better understanding of why such large relaxation of the limits was required a more detailed examination of the scores was made for the accepted simulations to look for systematic deviations between the simulations and observations fig 2 shows a summary of the performance of the 1016 simulations against observations over all time steps for the rising falling limbs of the hydrograph and for the high and low flow periods as defined above fig 2 also shows a comparison of the normalized scores against the observations for both discharge fig 2e and tp loads fig 2g the models tend to show a bias towards over prediction during the low flow periods in contrast there is systematic under prediction shown for both discharge fig 2q and tp fig 2s during the high flow periods although the normalized scores show a tendency to be smaller for these periods which reflects the larger absolute uncertainty intervals on the higher flow observations for both measures fig 2 overall the majority of scores which tend to be outside the original limits occur during the falling limb of the time series particularly for the lower magnitude flows and loads during these periods which could be a constraint on model performance this under prediction of peaks during the high flow periods is reflected in fig 3 which shows the time series of the performance of the 1016 accepted models during the summer autumn and early winter of the 2012 2013 hydrological year overall the model captures the timings of the peaks and low flow periods fairly well however the under prediction of the peaks in december and january is emphasized for both discharge fig 3a and tp loads fig 3b despite relatively high normalized scores shown in fig 2 during the low flow periods the over prediction of observations is less emphasized in fig 3 due to the smaller absolute widths of the uncertainty intervals at these time steps however over prediction is evident during the low flow period in late january 2013 particularly in the discharge time series 3 1 2 evaluation across high and low flow periods only when the model evaluation is constrained to the high and low time steps top and bottom 5 of time steps across the flow duration curve none of the 5 000 000 model runs fall within the original limits of acceptability hence in order to gain a subset of model runs for the calculation of model diagnostics we relaxed the limits to 5 30 to gain a set of 1001 behavioural simulations fig 4 shows a comparison of the model performance versus the observations over all time steps rising falling time steps and high low flow time steps overall the picture is consistent when the models were constrained over all time steps section 3 1 1 with over prediction of both discharge and tp during the low flow periods fig 4f and h and under prediction during the high flow periods fig 4r and t however much higher over predictions are shown for lower discharge and tp loads particularly those classified as falling time steps fig 4n and p respectively where normalized scores approach 15 for discharge and 30 for tp these higher scores compared to fig 2 reflect the fact that we are only constraining the model on a smaller number of time steps albeit these are the high and low flow periods that are often considered important to simulate accurately to best capture catchment dynamics this once again shows that poor performance during the recession periods is a constraint on finding behavioural parameter sets for swat in application to this catchment fig 5 shows the time series of model performance of the 1001 accepted models during the summer autumn and early winter of the 2012 2013 hydrological year in this case as the high and low flow periods that are being used to constrain the model the dynamics of the catchment are captured much better by the accepted simulations with the model capturing both the timing and magnitude of the peaks for both discharge fig 5a and tp loads fig 5b however there is still under prediction of peaks during december and early january and over prediction of low flow periods during late january with this once again most evident in the discharge time series fig 5a 3 2 evaluation of model parameter uncertainty fig 6 shows projections of the sampled points on the likelihood surface as calculated by eq 5 onto single parameter axes for the parameters in table 1 for each of the behavioural simulations these have previously been called dotty plots and can be used to infer sensitivities of the individual parameters using the hornberger spear young method see beven 2009 the points shown are the 1016 simulations which satisfy the relaxed limits of acceptability for both discharge and p when evaluated across all time steps the same plot is shown in fig 7 when the models are evaluated across the high and low flow period only both figs 7 and 8 show consistency in the sensitivity of the parameters varied of the 39 parameters varied only four parameters exhibited any clear identifiability these are gw delay ground water delay rchrg dp deep aquifer percolation fraction lat ttime lateral flow travel time and lat orgp organic p in the baseflow further to this behavioural models are identified at both high and low values of the gw delay parameter which is consistent across both evaluation metrics some levels of identifiability were shown for the cn2 scs runoff curve number and slsoil slope length for lateral subsurface flow however the responses of these parameters differed between the method chosen to evaluate the models for slsoil when the model was evaluated on all time steps higher likelihood values were shown towards the higher end of the sample range the opposite was shown for evaluation over the high and low time steps only with higher likelihood values shown towards the lower end of the sampled parameter range overall the majority of parameters showed no sign of sensitivity and indicated high equifinality across the sampled ranges the parameters that exhibit sensitivity are all linked to runoff and sub surface processes and all interact to affect the time taken for water to reach the river network and thus affect the transport of p however the high equifinality in the other parameters particularly those in relation to the levels of p in the soils sol orgp and sol labp indicates that given the present assumptions and data available for the catchment there is not enough information to calibrate these parameters effectively 3 3 critical time steps for model failure fig 8 shows a breakdown of the classification high low or rising falling of the time steps of the sub sample of models chosen on which to perform model diagnostics that result in model failure lie outside the original limits of acceptability for both evaluation measures used in this study the falling limb time steps contribute the largest proportion of failing time steps for both simulated discharge 37 for all time steps evaluation and 34 for evaluation on high low time steps and tp loads 30 and 50 respectively all other time step classifications contribute roughly the same to model failure with the rising limb and high flow time steps accounting for approximately 10 15 of failures for both discharge and tp for discharge the low flow time steps account for around 10 of failures however for tp loads they provide a much smaller contribution at around 3 4 indicating that model performance at these time steps may be less of a constraint on model performance for tp overall it is shown that despite using two different model evaluation measures to accept behavioural models the falling limb time steps are consistently shown to be a constraint on model performance in this swat application to newby beck 3 4 model validation the 1016 1001 behavioural simulations all time steps evaluation high and low flows evaluation were then used to predict the discharge and p loads for a period not used in calibration winter of the 2013 2014 hydrological year due to data availability in order to validate the model performance figs 9 and 10 for discharge figs 9a and 10a the picture was somewhat similar during the validation period where the model tended to pick out the timings of the peaks and recession periods well overall under prediction of the observed discharge peaks was seen throughout the validation period being most evident during mid december 2013 and early january 2014 as when calibrating the model the under prediction of peaks was more pronounced when the models were evaluated across all time steps fig 9a both the timing and magnitude of the peaks was picked up much better when constraining the models on the high and low flow periods fig 10a as in calibrating the model the low flow periods were typically over predicted by the model on both evaluation measures with this being most evident towards the end of january 2014 for tp loads the picture is the same as during calibration with the model under predicting all peaks particularly when they were constrained using all time steps where the model failed to capture the magnitude of any peak fig 9b and 10b when constrained on the high and low flows time steps only the model reproduced the magnitudes and timings of the majority of the peak loads however there are still cases where the model under predicts a peak by up to 75 15th december 2013 further to this the uncertainty bounds on the model predictions are much wider during the recession limbs of the tp time series and shows over prediction of the observations during this period 4 discussion this work presents for the first time a limits of acceptability glue uncertainty analysis of the widely used swat model using continuous high frequency water quality measurements it was shown that when initial limits of acceptability based upon the uncertainty in the outlet data for the calibration period are accounted for and given the assumptions detailed none of the 5 000 000 simulations provided suitable predictability of the dynamics of the catchment i e none of them were classed as behavioural therefore in order to obtain behavioural simulations to investigate the uncertainty in the swat model predictions a subset of samples was obtained on which to perform further diagnostics with this subset chosen using two different criteria the first was to find the minimum level of relaxation across all model time steps in the calibration period required to consider the models acceptable in this case relaxation of the limits to 6 72 gave a subset of 1016 acceptable models in the second case we only required the models to fall within the relaxed limits during periods of high and low flow here defined as the top and bottom 5 of discharges based on the flow duration curve for these criteria the limits had to be relaxed over the high and low flow periods only 5 30 to give a subset of 1001 accepted models this was across both discharge and tp loads using these two different evaluation measures produced two distinctly different time series when the models were compared with observations figs 5 and 7 and during the validation period figs 9 and 10 when the models were constrained to fit within the limits across all time steps the parameter sets that are considered acceptable consistently under predict the peaks in both discharge and tp loads particularly during the validation period in contrast when we only constrain the model on the low and high flow periods the simulations from the accepted parameter sets produce a much better representation of the catchment dynamics particularly in the magnitudes of the tp load peaks however constraining the model in this way accepts simulations that have poor performance during the rising limb and recession periods where the normalized scores approach 15 in the case of discharge and 30 in the case of tp loads this contrast between the chosen metric to evaluate the model is the result of several different factors and depends on the characteristics and dynamics of the newby beck catchment due to its flashy nature and low baseflow index ockenden et al 2016 outram et al 2014 newby beck is dominated by sub daily processes which may lead to timing errors in the simulated hydrograph from swat due to the use of the daily time step of the model therefore when all time steps are included in the evaluation metric there is a high chance of the model simulations producing high normalized scores however as reported recently by coxon et al 2014 constraining the model using time step measures such as these can be a very critical test of the model particularly due to the strong influence of observational uncertainty on such metrics see section 3 1 this is shown in fig 3 where all of the accepted 1016 simulations when using the all time step metric under predicted the peaks by a large amount for both discharge and tp loads despite being considered acceptable within the relaxed limits of 6 72 this could be because the normalized scores are based upon the relative uncertainty intervals around the observations which allows a larger absolute deviation from the observed value on the peaks this is a case of accepting a model that is not a good representation of the processes but which fits within the errors in the calibration data beven 2012 beven and smith 2015 it should also be noted that the normalized scores are also based on estimates of the 95 limits around each observation see 2 4 and therefore the potential range of uncertainty could be larger in order to test the effect of this on model evaluation we performed the same analysis of relaxing the scores until 1057 simulations were accepted however in this instance we only required the model to fit the limits at 95 of the time steps fig 11 shows the time series of discharge and tp compared to the observations and shows that when accounting for the model only fitting the time steps 95 of the time the model still produces simulations where the peaks are underestimated such as in early january 2013 hence there is the still the risk of poor models being accepted due to uncertainty in the calibration data when the lesser constraint of just high and low flows often the periods of most nutrient transport in flashy catchments haygarth et al 2005 ockenden et al 2016 perks et al 2015 was applied simulations that match the peaks and low flow periods with a greater degree of accuracy were produced this also required less relaxation of the limits of acceptability 5 30 this is in agreement with the recent work of coxon et al 2014 showing that the performance of behavioural models accepted using different diagnostics can be strongly linked to the dominant processes occurring in the catchment in this case we have shown that constraining the models on high and low flow periods only in a flashy catchment produces a model ensemble that captures the peak discharges and tp loads better however the utilization of this diagnostic further highlights the time steps resulting in poor model performance where time steps not used in the evaluation e g the rising and falling time steps return much higher normalized scores in excess of 30 as shown in fig 5 than when the metric across all time steps is used however we have shown here that despite the choice of evaluation metric a consistent picture emerges about which class of time step is contributing most to model failures fig 8 overall the falling limb recession time steps were consistently a constraint on model performance contributing between 30 and 50 of failing time steps for discharge and tp time steps across both evaluation measures this therefore indicates potential errors in the model structure of swat of the representation of sub surface processes an area of the model that has been shown to perform poorly in the past guse et al 2014 for a large number of the parameters it is difficult to identify any sensitivity in fitting the observations and a large amount of equifinality is evident figs 7 and 8 this is particularly the case for the sol orgp soil organic p and sol labp soil labile p parameters which show no clear sensitivity at all using the likelihood measure based on the limits of acceptability both of these parameters have been shown to play an important role in the amount of p in the water course and are often very difficult to measure in any detail at the catchment scale schoumans et al 2009 it is accepted that given a 39 dimension parameter space 5 000 000 swat runs provides only a small sample of the model parameter space albeit many more than any previously published swat calibration exercise and that such a small sample can contribute to the uncertainty thus there is the possibility of missing potentially behavioural models during the sampling process they are clearly however sparsely distributed even with the relaxed limits of acceptability further adding to model parameter uncertainty is the gw delay parameter which exhibits strong identifiability but showing the identification behavioural models at both extremes of the parameter range therefore in this application of swat both high and low groundwater delay times produce equivalent model performance in terms of the relaxed limits of acceptability this infers that there could be compensation processes occurring in the sub surface module of the model or could highlight additional issues in the model structural representation of groundwater attenuation in the catchment the limits of acceptability approach provides advantages over more traditional evaluation metrics such as nse and root mean square error rmse these are global measures which tend to focus on the average error from the data over the calibration period rather than focus on the individual time steps that are causing the model to fail the limits approach utilizes the high frequency data to provide a more detailed evaluation of the model and allows the identification of critical time steps that are causing poor model performance further to this the limits approach goes someway to accounting for uncertainty in the data observations used to calibrate the model however it is impossible to make this method completely objective due to the difficulty in accounting for error in the model inputs in past applications of the glue limits of acceptability approach liu et al 2009 the relaxation of the limits was justified to account for uncertainty in the model input data however in this case the model user must examine the degree of relaxation in the scores and utilize the available knowledge of the inputs to see if the level of relaxation is acceptable given the epistemic nature of the input uncertainties it is difficult to truly assess the effect of input error and its representation needs to be independent of the model structure e g beven 2006 one method is to employ the use of an statistical error model to account for input error in the model e g krueger et al 2010 go some way to accounting for this but it is difficult to create a realistic error model even for rainfall inputs it would also be even more computationally expensive and thus was not implemented in the present work the effects of both input error and model structural errors should be seen in the deviations outside the normalized limits the results show that the limits have to be relaxed by a very large amount up to a factor of 6 72 to gain a set of behavioural simulations that allows the sensitivity of the parameter sets to be explored an examination of the potential input errors to the catchment system has been taken in this study to determine whether a relaxation by factors of up to seven are acceptable in the newby beck catchment there are four rain gauges sited in a relatively small area 12 5 km2 fig 1 it is still possible that some rainfall in the catchment could be missed in the model input particularly during summer convective storms leading to commensurability issues with the rainfall input beven and smith 2015 beven et al 2011 different rainfall input realizations and associated errors have previously been shown to impact model performance blazkova and beven 2009 however due to the relatively good coverage by the rain gauges in the newby beck catchment errors in the rainfall input are likely to be small it can therefore be concluded that it is model structural error rather than input error that is leading to the high relaxation of the limits required to define model realizations of the hydrograph as acceptable with respect to p there is a much larger uncertainty in the overall inputs into the catchment particularly to the exact amounts of fertilizer spread on the land and the amount of dung deposited from grazing lacking more detailed information the inputs used in this application of swat are based upon defra recommendations defra 2013 and local knowledge of the catchment furthermore the lumped nature of the swat model requires average p inputs for each hru which can add further uncertainty in the amount of nutrients added to the system this can therefore lead to the locations of the inputs being smoothed out leading to commensurability issues however the average amount of p added to the catchment per year during the run 2 3 kg ha 1 is much smaller than the levels of p in the soil stores during the course of the run approximately 15 000 kg ha 1 thus errors in p inputs and timing are unlikely to have an effect on the levels of p being transported to the stream compared to uncertainty and errors in the parameters and model structures which govern the mobilisation and transport of p in the soil previous work on similar small sized catchments also suggests that hydrological and biochemical processes have a much larger control on the temporal variations in stream p in the catchment rather than the timings and magnitudes of the agricultural inputs dupas et al 2015 haygarth et al 2012 in this work we explicitly account for the uncertainty in soil p by varying the sol orgp and sol labp organic and labile p soil stores as part of the glue analysis with both of these parameters showing high equifinality it has also been shown in previous analysis on newby beck ockenden et al 2016 that the observed tp loads during storm events in the catchment are highly correlated with peaks in rainfall these storm events account for approximately 83 of the annual tp load indicating that rainfall plays a strong role in controlling the transport of tp into the stream network as discussed above the errors in rainfall are likely to be relatively low in this catchment and given its importance as a driver of tp transport along with the small contribution of p inputs to overall soil p we can conclude that relaxing the limits by a factor of 6 72 is not acceptable in this application of swat to newby beck we can therefore conclude that as with discharge model structural error is the likely cause of this requirement to relax the constraints by such a substantial amount the ability of the model to adequately simulate the observed tp loads is also further compounded by the poor performance of swat in terms of discharge evaluation given that discharge is part of the tp load calculation hence as model structural error has been shown to be such a large constraint in the accurate prediction of discharge and thus tp loads it is unlikely that improvements in input data will greatly improve model predictions in addition to this even in a small experimental catchment gaining sufficient improvement in model input data would require significant expense in the case of tp this would require detailed farmer logs in timings and location of fertilizer applications detailed monitoring of surface and subsurface storage and availability of tp in the catchment along with detailed field scale budgets of the nutrients in the soils this prompts an additional question if we are required to relax the limits which are primarily due to structural error in the model by a factor of 6 72 should we go to the expense of collecting the additional input data required by such a complex model structure it has been shown in previous work dean et al 2009 shen et al 2012a that insufficient input data are a constraint on even the best of models therefore clearly improvement is required on both sides the advantage of using the limits of acceptability approach is that we can use the results of the model evaluation to target which areas of the model structure require improvement and infer which areas are best to target our efforts for additional data collection particularly in situations where funds for such efforts are limited 5 conclusions this study has presented the first limits of acceptability assessment of the swat model using continuous high frequency discharge and water quality monitoring data we highlight that having the availability of high frequency data coupled with the glue limits of acceptability approach the model performance can be assessed taking into account the uncertainty on the calibration data at each time step this provides greater insights into why the model is failing beyond the more traditional global measures of model evaluation such as nse and rmse in the application of swat to the newby beck headwater catchment in the uk it is shown that the limits of acceptability based on output observational uncertainties have to be relaxed by a substantial amount by factors of between 5 3 and 6 72 on a normalized scale depending on the evaluation criteria used in order to produce a set of behavioural simulations 1001 and 1016 respectively out of 5 000 000 realizations on which to perform model diagnostics in this case despite the evaluation metric used the model is shown to consistently perform poorly during periods of recession in both the discharge and tp time series with uncertainty in the representation of subsurface flow pathways identified as a potential cause for this poor performance during the validation period the model was shown to capture the timings of peaks in the river tp load however it was shown to often predict the magnitude of these peaks poorly this work raises an interesting point how much relaxation is allowable in the limits of acceptability before we consider the model as not providing useful predictions of the processes occurring in the catchment on the one hand we have learnt from the model to identify areas where we need to focus future model development and data collection efforts in river catchments on the other we have shown that in this particular case swat is not fit for purpose to be used as a management tool due to the large uncertainty bounds on predictions particularly during the validation period this conclusion agrees with previous applications of swat to other catchments of similar catchment areas and similar geoclimatic circumstances hoang et al 2017 moges et al 2017 schneiderman et al 2007 therefore despite being used in numerous catchments worldwide often with less rigorous evaluation swat may not be fit for purpose as a general management tool particularly in flashy catchments being dominated by overland flow where the model structure may be inadequate to accurately capture the major catchment processes dominating p transfer however there is still a need to advise policy makers on how changes in the environment are likely to affect hydrology and water quality in the future and what mitigation measures to take if any a number of potential options are available such as precautionary methods suggested by beven 2011 or the use of fuzzy modelling methods page et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 or finding another process based model to use though it is highly likely that another model will suffer the same uncertainty issues as shown here with swat a final option is to shift towards more simple p transfer models e g dupas et al 2016 which have been shown to capture p losses well with minimum input data however as highlighted by dupas et al 2016 such models still have uncertainties associated with them and in some cases still require substantial relaxation of the limits of acceptability we acknowledge that process based models may be potentially useful catchment management tools they are often used to quantify the effects of changes in catchment conditions e g climate change on the behavior of nutrients in catchments crossman et al 2014 wang and sun 2016 they are primarily used because they provide a numerical representation of conceptual processes that in theory represent how these processes adapt to changing environmental conditions under different scenarios however the results presented here stress the importance of having the best available input data along with high frequency data from continuous monitoring systems for rigorous model evaluation as highlighted in previous studies benettin et al 2015 dupas et al 2016 halliday et al 2015 ockenden et al 2017 high frequency data allows us to set more robust limits of acceptability particularly in catchments with a flashy response where infrequent grab samples may fail to capture key processes events and may not provide a stringent enough test of the model structure processes the results also imply that more needs to be done to improve the ability of the model to simulate the dynamics of key catchment processes with parameters that are more identifiable in practical applications or more easily estimated in predicting future conditions finally our results also indicate the possibility that even with the best representation of the key processes in the model structure we still may have a long way to go to have sufficient input data to adequately drive such complex model structures the study has not resolved the issue of how far the limits of acceptability should be relaxed to provide a set of models considered useful for predicting outcomes that is a question for individual users to consider for particular types of applications i e can we be objective about the effects of input error on model performance particularly for predicting nutrient responses this study suggests that swat may not be fit for purpose in this particular application however confirmation of its general applicability or not requires critical testing of the method on multiple models and multiple catchment datasets in ways that allow for uncertainty and potential equifinality of model representations acknowledgments this study was funded by the natural

surface area during a unit period of time and under the impact of a unit net shear strass to measure or to estimate the maximum detachment rate of an eroding rill scientists have been devoting their great efforts elliot et al 1989 made a series of field experiments on numerous field plots across the us territory involving many soil types gilley et al 1993 reported in details their experimental and computational method to determine soil erodibility they made experiments in cultivated farm fields with plots of 0 46 m wide and 9 0 m long simulated rain was applied to generate rills before concentrated flow was used to initiate rills rain drops have their impacts on rill erosion negatively due to raindrop disturbs to water flow but rainfall positively increases total erosion amount due to added water flow rate lei et al 2009 therefore gilley et al 1993 did not use simulated rainfall but concentrated flow only to generate data sets for computing soil critical shear stress and erodibility parameters by adding water flow to the top of the formed rill at designed rates as reported by elliot et al 1989 lei et al 1998 used the similar experimental method and found that the rill width fluctuated along the rill so did the sediment load therefore zhang and liu 2002 used very small soil samples of 10 cm in diameter to measure detachment capacity reichert and norton 2013 studied the rill erodibility and sediment characteristics of clayey vertosols and ferrosol of australian they compared the rill simulation test data with laboratory and field values their results indicated that there were large discrepancies between the wepp simulation results and experimental values and the wepp model must be improved for tropical australian soils indeed soil erodibility parameters and

time consuming and expensive besides some experiments require special facilities what s more few of these experimental results can be directly adopted by the wepp model many researches have proved that numerical method has a bright prospect for the determination of rill detachment rate gilley et al 1993 yalin and silva 2000 knapen et al 2007 likewise lei et al 2002 established the formulas between rill detachment rate and rill length as well as that between rill detachment rate and sediment concentration and then proposed analytical methods to estimate the rill detachment rate of loess soil and lately chen et al 2017 emphasized that rill detachment rate has a good correlation with the sediment concentration and the rill length in view of these facts soil erodibility parameters can be directly calculated by the regression analysis according to the wepp equation through numerical or analytical method the loess and purple soils are typical zonal soils corresponding to two high risk erodible areas which differ in soil structures nutrients and mineral constituents studying the soil erodibility and critical shear stress of these two soils is beneficial to improve and popularize the wepp model and determine the mechanisms of soil erosion in the subtropical zone of china the objectives of this study focused on 1 calculating the potential soil detachment rates and rill flow shear stress under different hydrodynamic conditions based on different approaches 2 estimating the soil erodibility parameters and critical shear stress of these two soils and 3 comparing erodibilities and critical shear stresses of the two soils estimated with the numerical and analytical method and verifying the method 2 methods and materials the experiments were designed and conducted by chen et al 2015 and carried out at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of science and ministry of water resources yangling shanxi province china the purple soil used in the experiments was obtained from a sloping farm field near the southwest university experimental station of soil and water conservation municipality of chongqing china sample site was a fallow farmland which had been under maize and sweet potato rotation the soil is classified as entisols a typical gray brown neutral purple soil weathered from purplish rocks under the tropical and subtropical climatic conditions consisting of 38 65 clay 0 005 mm 35 74 silt 0 005 0 05 mm and 25 61 sand particles 0 05 mm the loess soil was dug from an experimental cornfield typical slope farmland and under conventional tillage at ansai county of shanxi province this soil includes 15 92 clay 0 005 mm 63 90 silt 0 005 0 05 mm and 20 18 sand particles 0 05 mm which can be classified as ustochnept a silt loamy soil the soil materials were both air dried crushed or ground and then sieved through an 8 mm square sieve before the experiment a steel platform with slope gradient adjustable was adopted in this study to build six rills of 12 m long and 0 1 m wide and 0 5 m deep both sides of the rill board were glued with soil particles of the same soil type to reduce boundary effect and obtain a roughness similar to the soil the bottom of the flume was filled with clay loamy materials 24 9 sand 43 4 silt and 31 8 clay particles to a thickness of 5 cm and a bulk density of 1 5 g cm3 to simulate the plow pan layer above the plow pan layer the purple or loess soil materials were packed in four layers to a total thickness of 20 cm and a bulk density of approximately 1 2 g cm3 the soil surface was roughened with rakes before the next soil layer was filled the last soil layer was packed slightly higher near the sides of the plastic boards to reduce the guiding effect of the plastic board on flow water the experimental soil materials were adequately saturated through the simulated rainfall approximately 24 h before the rill erosion experiments to ensure even initial soil moisture condition at around field capacity and to break as many aggregates as possible the simulated rainfall was used simply to ensure the same initial conditions the experiment involved three flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min and five slope gradients of 5 10 15 20 and 25 at the water inlet a water tank was adopted to feed water flow from a reservoir using an electric pump at designed flow rates a sponge of approximately 0 2 m long was placed at the beginning of the rill to protect the soil surface from being directly flushed the rill flow velocities were estimated by the methylene blue dye tracer method the flow velocity was measured with a stopwatch to determine the time duration for the water flow to traverse a rill segment of 1 m long the measured velocities were corrected by multiplying them with a correcting coefficient of 0 75 lei et al 2009 after each of the tests soil erosion as a function of rill length was measured by volume replacement method chen et al 2015 3 theory to estimate erodibility and critical shear stress 3 1 analytical method in the wepp model rill detachment is expressed as 1 d r k r τ τ c 1 qc t c where dr kg m2 s 1 is the detachment rate kr s m is the rill erodibility τ pa is the shear stress of water flow τc pa is the critical shear stress of soil c kg m 3 is the sediment concentration q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate and tc kg m 1 s 1 is the sediment transport capacity in clear water the sediment concentration is zero the potential detachment of the rill erosion process can be obtained eq 1 can be simplified as 2 d r max k r τ τ c where dr max kg m2 s 1 is the potential detachment rate or the maximum detachment rate according to eq 2 once the maximum detachment rate and the rill flow shear stress under different hydraulic conditions are determined the rill erodibility parameter and critical shear stress can be estimated through regression analysis eq 1 is reduced eq 2 when sediment concentration c 0 this sets the experimental conditions and the computational basis chen et al 2015 presented the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length by 3 c a 1 e β x where c kg m 3 is the sediment concentration a kg m 3 is the maximum sediment concentration β m 1 is the coefficient of decrease rate of sediment increasing with rill length and x m is the rill length rill detachment rate can be analytically estimated 4 d r dc dx q where dr kg m2 s 1 is the detachment rate c kg m 3 is the sediment concentration in water flow x m is the rill length and q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate introducing eq 3 into eq 4 yields the rill detachment rate as 5 d r q β ae β x where dr kg m2 s 1 is the detachment rate q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate β m 1 is a coefficient of decrease rate of sediment increase with rill length a is the maximum sediment concentration and x m is the rill length eq 5 indicates that when the rill length approaches zero the rill detachment rate reaches its potential value 6 d r max q β a introducing eq 2 into eq 6 yields 7 d r max q β a k r τ τ c 3 2 numerical method numerically the average rill detachment rate can be expressed as 8 d r δ c δ x where dr kg m 2 s 1 is the average rill detachment rate of δx segment q m2 s 1 is the flow rate δx m is the increment in rill length and δc m3 kg 1 is the increase in sediment concentration once the dr is estimated through experimental data the detachment rate can be related to sediment concentration as 9 d r d 1 e 1 c where d1 kg m 2 s 1 is the maximum detachment rate when sediment concentration is zero it is dc0 e 1 m s 1 is a proportional coefficient revealing the decrease of detachment rate with increase in sediment concentration a shorter rill length can well approximate the maximum detachment value the flume was in the experiments divided into 11 segments and the first segment was 0 5 m long the detachment rate from this rill segment of 0 5 m long could well approximate the potential value it is dc0 5 another possibility is to fit the numerically computed detachment rate with sediment concentration with eq 9 to get parameter d1 as the potential detachment rate when c 0 in eq 9 these two numerical methods were used to compute the rill detachment rates under different hydrodynamic conditions they will term dc0 5 and dc0 respectively 3 3 calculation of the rill flow shear stress the flow shear stress is estimated by 10 τ γ sh γ s q v where γ 9800 n m 3 is the specific weight of water s is the hydraulic slope sin α α is the slope in degrees q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate v m s 1 is the flow velocity 4 result and discussion 4 1 erodibility and critical shear stress eqs 6 8 and 9 were used to theoretically estimate the detachment rates dra dc0 5 and dc0 under different flow rates and slope gradients by using analytical method and numerical methods respectively the numerical method involves two approaches one used the detachment rate at the rill length of 0 m where sediment concentration is zero dc0 as d1 in eq 9 chen et al 2017 huang et al 1996 concluded that a shorter rill is the prerequisite to obtain a necessary rill detachment rates to estimate soil erodibility and in this study the first data point was obtained at a rill length of 0 5 m long thus the other approach used the detachment rate at the rill length of 0 5 m the first data point of detachment rate sediment concentration function chen et al 2017 termed as dc0 5 the detachment rates of the analytical and numerical methods were plotted against rill flow shear stresses on the purple and loess soils as shown in fig 1 in the cases of a slope of 5 and flow rate of 2 l min and 4 l min as well as a slope of 10 and flow rate of 2 l min the flow velocity of purple soil was too small to be measured and the soil erosion was not obvious therefore data points under these conditions were not included in the data sets and in order to ensure the consistency of data only the common parts of data corresponding to loess and purple soils were used for comparison based on eq 2 once the potential rill detachment rates are plotted against flow shear stress the erodibility parameter is determined by the slope gradient of linear relationship and the critical shear stress is theoretically the intercept of the linear line with the horizontal axis from fig 1a c the slope of the linear lines on the loess soil are all significantly steeper than those of the purple soil under the same experimental conditions these indicate greater erodibility parameter of loess soil than that of the purple soil moreover the horizontal intercepts of the linear lines of the loess soil are significantly smaller than those of the purple soil which indicates that the computed critical shear stresses of the loess soil are smaller than those of the purple soil with increase in flow rates the slopes of the straight lines are basically the same for the cases of analytical and numerical methods which indicate the constancy of the estimated soil erodibility parameter the horizontal intercepts of the line fluctuate a little in some extent as the flow rates changes but still the estimated critical shear stresses were about the same all these seem to imply that the estimated parameters are reasonably sound to indicate the feasibility of the method the estimated erodibility values and the critical shear stresses with different method are listed in table 1 the results indicate that for the two soils the erodibility of each soil is basically unchanged under the three flow rates the soil erodibility parameters can objectively reflect the sensitivity of soil during the erosion process which is related to such soil condition as tillage managements surface cover condition freeze thaw status initial soil moisture lei et al 2009 moreover soil erodibility parameters should be a constant value for a given type of soil liu et al 2010 wang et al 2012 hence the same estimated erodibility for either purple soil or loess soil proved the validity of this conclusion and also verified the rationality of the computational method and procedure analytical and numerical results reveal that the average erodibility of loess soil is almost 2 times of that of purple soil reflecting the higher rill erosion sensitivity of loess soil specifically loess soil is more susceptible to erosion or dispersion than purple soil wang et al 2012 illustrated that a higher content of clay and organic matter indicates smaller erodibility parameters the discrepancy of erodibility parameters of these two soils in the present study is relatively clear and the reasons for this are manifold the loess soil is easily dispersed and eroded by water perhaps due to its high content of silt organic matter insufficiency and loose structure meanwhile the purple soil is more likely to consolidate or cement in water due to its higher clay content soil aggregates and organic matter in this research the potential rill detachment rates estimated by numerical and analytical method are far greater than those reported by elliot et al 1989 consequently the erodibility parameters estimated in this study are one magnitude order greater than the data obtained by gilley et al 1993 indeed the soil texture the contents of clay particles and the organic matter can result in those discrepancies but what needs to be emphasized is that both elliot et al 1989 and gilley et al 1993 computed the average detachment rate by using the outlet sediment concentration of a rill of 9 m long to calculate the potential rill detachment rate that may have caused considerable errors in estimating the potential detachment rate this caused two major problems one is the average detachment rate is much lower than the potential detachment as illustrated in fig 2 the other is that the plot of 49 cm wide they used could have caused sediment load in water flow to fluctuate randomly due to erosion and deposition alternations which agrees with the channel regime theory proposed by yalin and silva 1999 and in line with the previous studies using an infinite short rill is desirable to obtain the potential detachment rates if test conditions would permit huang et al 1996 zhang et al 2009 thus using the average sediment load of a long rill to estimate the potential detachment rates may result in considerably lowered detachment rate than the potential and big discrepancies of wepp erosion parameters the average value of erodibility of loess in this test is smaller than the result of lei et al 2008 the higher content of sand particle of their test soil and the special sampling method volume replacement adopted in this study may give a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy what s more zhang and liu 2002 measured the maximum detachment rate of a kind of loam clay 24 3 using a 10 cm wide circular container and with it the erodibility is 0 204 s m which is comparable to our results the critical shear stress is the resistance of soil to external shear deformation this instance is the quantitative index of soil to withstand the rill flow shear stress the critical shear stress is related to the cementation of soil particles and is affected by the friction force between them before the soil particles are eroded this force is static friction which is associated with the external force in addition the difference between soil pore content and soil particle composition affirmatively affects the soil structure and eventually results in the changes in soil critical shear stress liu et al 2010 wang et al 2012 from table 1 the critical shear stress of loess soil is lower than that of purple soil given its loose particles and poor structure it is reasonable to understand that the critical shear stress value of loess soil is significantly lesser than that of purple soil specifically loess soil is considerably more vulnerable to be eroded and drained compared with purple soil moreover the τc values of these two soils similarly present a slight increasing trend as the flow rates increase many researchers have discussed the influential factors of critical shear stress from different aspects zhang 2004 reported that critical shear stress increases with the change in slope gradients nouwakpo et al 2010 found that the critical shear stress obviously decreases when the vertical hydraulic gradient switch from seepage conditions to drainage conditions in addition singh and thompson 2016 found that that the critical shear stress is not constant for soil rather they change with the content of soil moisture in the context of agricultural watersheds these studies indicate that the critical shear stress is not a fixed value also random errors caused by experimental data and regression can affect the estimated parameters too according to the comparative results of these two soils the erodibility parameter of the purple soil is considerably lower than that of the loess soil and the critical shear stress of the purple soil is obviously higher than that of the loess soil this phenomenon in turn explains why the erosion phenomenon of the purple soil is not evident when the flow rates and slopes are small in the analytical and numerical methods all the coefficient of determination of the fitting equations of the two soils is greater than 0 80 to verify the feasibility of the method and the reliability of the experimental results 4 2 comparison of the erodibilities and critical shear stresses between loess and purple soils according to the table 1 it s not hard to find that the consistency between the analytical values and numerical results of rill length of 0 m dc0 is considerably better than those of rill length of 0 5 m dc0 5 the numerical results of soil erodibility at the rill length of 0 m are slightly larger than the analytical values for both loess and purple soil in fact as for the erodibility parameters of loess soil the deviation is evenly 4 36 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 m whereas the deviation is averagely 13 95 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 5 m those of the purple soil are 5 7 and 14 36 respectively as for the critical shear stress either the loess or purple soil all the numerical results are slightly bigger than the analytical values the deviation is 9 91 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 m dc0 while 15 8 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 5 m dc0 5 those of the purple soil are 1 75 and 3 71 respectively averaged soil erodibilities and critical shear stresses of the two soils were listed in table 2 table 2 clearly showed that erodibility parameter estimated with potential detachment rate at rill length of 0 m dc0 produced highest soil erodibility the analytical method yielded slightly lower soil erodibility parameter though erodibility parameter estimated with potential detachment rate at rill length of 0 5 m dc0 5 produced relatively lowered soil erodibility it is still not significantly lower than the other two the averaged critical shear stresses of the two soils estimated with three different methods are almost identical the critical shear stress of the loess ranged from 2 3 to 2 4 n m 2 and that of the purple soil ranged from 1 1 to 1 2 n m 2 these results indicate the feasibility of the method for estimating soil erodibility and shear stress the discrepancy between the analytical values and numerical results is expected mainly due to the variability of rill detachment rate corresponding to different methods on the one side clear water at the inlet of rill has the greatest potential detachment capacity and hence the soil erodibility estimated at the rill length of 0 m logically should be the maximum value on the other side analytical results are by means of the ideal regression model on the context of large experimental data sets whose results is the most comprehensive representative and reliable the experiment results reveal that numerical results estimated with potential detachment rates at the rill length of 0 m agree well with the analytical result in other words calculating the erodibility parameter with the detachment rate at the rill length of 0 m is feasible based on the calculation equation of detachment rate an infinitely short rill is found to be the prerequisite in obtaining the maximum detachment rate huang et al 1996 lei et al 2009 in fact a 0 5 m long rill is a compromise for the 12 m long flume and the experiment operability and it is the shortest and the first segment in this test apparently a certain deviation occurred between this numerical result and the analytical data the rill detachment estimated at the length of 0 5 m is much lower than the potential resulting in a lower slope gradient of regression line and hence a smaller soil erodibility results show that a 0 5 m long rill cannot fully represent the infinitely short length what should be noted that analytical values are larger than the numerical results of dc0 5 less than the numerical results of dc0 which mathematically accords with the theorem of clamp approximation as for either purple soil or loess soil the average soil erodibility of numerical results at 0 5 m and 0 m is quietly close to the analytical values thus the ideal rill length should range from 0 to 0 5 m in other words the selected rill length might be shorter to obtain a considerably closer numerical result to the analytical value experimental results prove that the analytical and numerical methods seem to be promising approaches in estimating soil erodibility and critical shear stress the results show that using a 0 5 m long rill to measure the maximum detachment rate is not desirable it is strongly recommended that both the analytical and numerical methods can be applicable 5 conclusion according to the experimental data the maximum detachment rates are estimated using analytical method and two numerical methods before their soil erodibility parameters and critical shear stresses are obtained through linear regression of maximum detachment rate to rill flow shear stress the results indicate that the soil erodibility parameters of the loess soil are about two times of the purple soil and its critical shear stress is significantly lower than that of the purple soil the erodibility parameters of the two soils remain unchanged and the critical shear stresses of the two soils fluctuate a little in some extent overall the numerical results agree well with the analytical results when estimated with rill detachment rates at the rill length of 0 m the numerical method produces soil erodibility values and critical shear stresses closer to the analytical values as compared with the values estimated with rill detachment rates at the rill length of 0 5 m in fact the average detachment rate at the rill length of 0 5 m underestimates to some extent the maximum detachment rate and the rill length adopted in experiment might be shorter to obtain a considerably closer numerical result to the analytical value acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national

and computational method to determine soil erodibility they made experiments in cultivated farm fields with plots of 0 46 m wide and 9 0 m long simulated rain was applied to generate rills before concentrated flow was used to initiate rills rain drops have their impacts on rill erosion negatively due to raindrop disturbs to water flow but rainfall positively increases total erosion amount due to added water flow rate lei et al 2009 therefore gilley et al 1993 did not use simulated rainfall but concentrated flow only to generate data sets for computing soil critical shear stress and erodibility parameters by adding water flow to the top of the formed rill at designed rates as reported by elliot et al 1989 lei et al 1998 used the similar experimental method and found that the rill width fluctuated along the rill so did the sediment load therefore zhang and liu 2002 used very small soil samples of 10 cm in diameter to measure detachment capacity reichert and norton 2013 studied the rill erodibility and sediment characteristics of clayey vertosols and ferrosol of australian they compared the rill simulation test data with laboratory and field values their results indicated that there were large discrepancies between the wepp simulation results and experimental values and the wepp model must be improved for tropical australian soils indeed soil erodibility parameters and critical shear stress have been extensively studied through standard plots simulated rainfall experiments monograph method ree tracer method and simulated neural networks model wischmeier et al 1958 wischmeier et al 1971 gilley et al 1993 ravens and gschwend 1999 de oliveira et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 mirzaee et al 2017 to some degree those methods are accurate and effective but unfortunately time consuming and expensive besides some experiments require special facilities what s more few of these experimental results can be directly adopted by the wepp model many researches have proved that numerical method has a bright prospect for the determination of rill detachment rate gilley et al 1993 yalin and silva 2000 knapen et al 2007 likewise lei et al 2002 established the formulas between rill detachment rate and rill length as well as that between rill detachment rate and sediment concentration and then proposed analytical methods to estimate the rill detachment rate of loess soil and lately chen et al 2017 emphasized that rill detachment rate has a good correlation with the sediment concentration and the rill length in view of these facts soil erodibility parameters can be directly calculated by the regression analysis according to the wepp equation through numerical or analytical method the loess and purple soils are typical zonal soils corresponding to two high risk erodible areas which differ in soil structures nutrients and mineral constituents studying the soil erodibility and critical shear stress of these two soils is beneficial to improve and popularize the wepp model and determine the mechanisms of soil erosion in the subtropical zone of china the objectives of this study focused on 1 calculating the potential soil detachment rates and rill flow shear stress under different hydrodynamic conditions based on different approaches 2 estimating the soil erodibility parameters and critical shear stress of these two soils and 3 comparing erodibilities and critical shear stresses of the two soils estimated with the numerical and analytical method and verifying the method 2 methods and materials the experiments were designed and conducted by chen et al 2015 and carried out at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of science and ministry of water resources yangling shanxi province china the purple soil used in the experiments was obtained from a sloping farm field near the southwest university experimental station of soil and water conservation municipality of chongqing china sample site was a fallow farmland which had been under maize and sweet potato rotation the soil is classified as entisols a typical gray brown neutral purple soil weathered from purplish rocks under the tropical and subtropical climatic conditions consisting of 38 65 clay 0 005 mm 35 74 silt 0 005 0 05 mm and 25 61 sand particles 0 05 mm the loess soil was dug from an experimental cornfield typical slope farmland and under conventional tillage at ansai county of shanxi province this soil includes 15 92 clay 0 005 mm 63 90 silt 0 005 0 05 mm and 20 18 sand particles 0 05 mm which can be classified as ustochnept a silt loamy soil the soil materials were both air dried crushed or ground and then sieved through an 8 mm square sieve before the experiment a steel platform with slope gradient adjustable was adopted in this study to build six rills of 12 m long and 0 1 m wide and 0 5 m deep both sides of the rill board were glued with soil particles of the same soil type to reduce boundary effect and obtain a roughness similar to the soil the bottom of the flume was filled with clay loamy materials 24 9 sand 43 4 silt and 31 8 clay particles to a thickness of 5 cm and a bulk density of 1 5 g cm3 to simulate the plow pan layer above the plow pan layer the purple or loess soil materials were packed in four layers to a total thickness of 20 cm and a bulk density of approximately 1 2 g cm3 the soil surface was roughened with rakes before the next soil layer was filled the last soil layer was packed slightly higher near the sides of the plastic boards to reduce the guiding effect of the plastic board on flow water the experimental soil materials were adequately saturated through the simulated rainfall approximately 24 h before the rill erosion experiments to ensure even initial soil moisture condition at around field capacity and to break as many aggregates as possible the simulated rainfall was used simply to ensure the same initial conditions the experiment involved three flow rates of 2 4 and 8 l min and five slope gradients of 5 10 15 20 and 25 at the water inlet a water tank was adopted to feed water flow from a reservoir using an electric pump at designed flow rates a sponge of approximately 0 2 m long was placed at the beginning of the rill to protect the soil surface from being directly flushed the rill flow velocities were estimated by the methylene blue dye tracer method the flow velocity was measured with a stopwatch to determine the time duration for the water flow to traverse a rill segment of 1 m long the measured velocities were corrected by multiplying them with a correcting coefficient of 0 75 lei et al 2009 after each of the tests soil erosion as a function of rill length was measured by volume replacement method chen et al 2015 3 theory to estimate erodibility and critical shear stress 3 1 analytical method in the wepp model rill detachment is expressed as 1 d r k r τ τ c 1 qc t c where dr kg m2 s 1 is the detachment rate kr s m is the rill erodibility τ pa is the shear stress of water flow τc pa is the critical shear stress of soil c kg m 3 is the sediment concentration q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate and tc kg m 1 s 1 is the sediment transport capacity in clear water the sediment concentration is zero the potential detachment of the rill erosion process can be obtained eq 1 can be simplified as 2 d r max k r τ τ c where dr max kg m2 s 1 is the potential detachment rate or the maximum detachment rate according to eq 2 once the maximum detachment rate and the rill flow shear stress under different hydraulic conditions are determined the rill erodibility parameter and critical shear stress can be estimated through regression analysis eq 1 is reduced eq 2 when sediment concentration c 0 this sets the experimental conditions and the computational basis chen et al 2015 presented the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length by 3 c a 1 e β x where c kg m 3 is the sediment concentration a kg m 3 is the maximum sediment concentration β m 1 is the coefficient of decrease rate of sediment increasing with rill length and x m is the rill length rill detachment rate can be analytically estimated 4 d r dc dx q where dr kg m2 s 1 is the detachment rate c kg m 3 is the sediment concentration in water flow x m is the rill length and q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate introducing eq 3 into eq 4 yields the rill detachment rate as 5 d r q β ae β x where dr kg m2 s 1 is the detachment rate q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate β m 1 is a coefficient of decrease rate of sediment increase with rill length a is the maximum sediment concentration and x m is the rill length eq 5 indicates that when the rill length approaches zero the rill detachment rate reaches its potential value 6 d r max q β a introducing eq 2 into eq 6 yields 7 d r max q β a k r τ τ c 3 2 numerical method numerically the average rill detachment rate can be expressed as 8 d r δ c δ x where dr kg m 2 s 1 is the average rill detachment rate of δx segment q m2 s 1 is the flow rate δx m is the increment in rill length and δc m3 kg 1 is the increase in sediment concentration once the dr is estimated through experimental data the detachment rate can be related to sediment concentration as 9 d r d 1 e 1 c where d1 kg m 2 s 1 is the maximum detachment rate when sediment concentration is zero it is dc0 e 1 m s 1 is a proportional coefficient revealing the decrease of detachment rate with increase in sediment concentration a shorter rill length can well approximate the maximum detachment value the flume was in the experiments divided into 11 segments and the first segment was 0 5 m long the detachment rate from this rill segment of 0 5 m long could well approximate the potential value it is dc0 5 another possibility is to fit the numerically computed detachment rate with sediment concentration with eq 9 to get parameter d1 as the potential detachment rate when c 0 in eq 9 these two numerical methods were used to compute the rill detachment rates under different hydrodynamic conditions they will term dc0 5 and dc0 respectively 3 3 calculation of the rill flow shear stress the flow shear stress is estimated by 10 τ γ sh γ s q v where γ 9800 n m 3 is the specific weight of water s is the hydraulic slope sin α α is the slope in degrees q m2 s 1 is the unit width flow rate v m s 1 is the flow velocity 4 result and discussion 4 1 erodibility and critical shear stress eqs 6 8 and 9 were used to theoretically estimate the detachment rates dra dc0 5 and dc0 under different flow rates and slope gradients by using analytical method and numerical methods respectively the numerical method involves two approaches one used the detachment rate at the rill length of 0 m where sediment concentration is zero dc0 as d1 in eq 9 chen et al 2017 huang et al 1996 concluded that a shorter rill is the prerequisite to obtain a necessary rill detachment rates to estimate soil erodibility and in this study the first data point was obtained at a rill length of 0 5 m long thus the other approach used the detachment rate at the rill length of 0 5 m the first data point of detachment rate sediment concentration function chen et al 2017 termed as dc0 5 the detachment rates of the analytical and numerical methods were plotted against rill flow shear stresses on the purple and loess soils as shown in fig 1 in the cases of a slope of 5 and flow rate of 2 l min and 4 l min as well as a slope of 10 and flow rate of 2 l min the flow velocity of purple soil was too small to be measured and the soil erosion was not obvious therefore data points under these conditions were not included in the data sets and in order to ensure the consistency of data only the common parts of data corresponding to loess and purple soils were used for comparison based on eq 2 once the potential rill detachment rates are plotted against flow shear stress the erodibility parameter is determined by the slope gradient of linear relationship and the critical shear stress is theoretically the intercept of the linear line with the horizontal axis from fig 1a c the slope of the linear lines on the loess soil are all significantly steeper than those of the purple soil under the same experimental conditions these indicate greater erodibility parameter of loess soil than that of the purple soil moreover the horizontal intercepts of the linear lines of the loess soil are significantly smaller than those of the purple soil which indicates that the computed critical shear stresses of the loess soil are smaller than those of the purple soil with increase in flow rates the slopes of the straight lines are basically the same for the cases of analytical and numerical methods which indicate the constancy of the estimated soil erodibility parameter the horizontal intercepts of the line fluctuate a little in some extent as the flow rates changes but still the estimated critical shear stresses were about the same all these seem to imply that the estimated parameters are reasonably sound to indicate the feasibility of the method the estimated erodibility values and the critical shear stresses with different method are listed in table 1 the results indicate that for the two soils the erodibility of each soil is basically unchanged under the three flow rates the soil erodibility parameters can objectively reflect the sensitivity of soil during the erosion process which is related to such soil condition as tillage managements surface cover condition freeze thaw status initial soil moisture lei et al 2009 moreover soil erodibility parameters should be a constant value for a given type of soil liu et al 2010 wang et al 2012 hence the same estimated erodibility for either purple soil or loess soil proved the validity of this conclusion and also verified the rationality of the computational method and procedure analytical and numerical results reveal that the average erodibility of loess soil is almost 2 times of that of purple soil reflecting the higher rill erosion sensitivity of loess soil specifically loess soil is more susceptible to erosion or dispersion than purple soil wang et al 2012 illustrated that a higher content of clay and organic matter indicates smaller erodibility parameters the discrepancy of erodibility parameters of these two soils in the present study is relatively clear and the reasons for this are manifold the loess soil is easily dispersed and eroded by water perhaps due to its high content of silt organic matter insufficiency and loose structure meanwhile the purple soil is more likely to consolidate or cement in water due to its higher clay content soil aggregates and organic matter in this research the potential rill detachment rates estimated by numerical and analytical method are far greater than those reported by elliot et al 1989 consequently the erodibility parameters estimated in this study are one magnitude order greater than the data obtained by gilley et al 1993 indeed the soil texture the contents of clay particles and the organic matter can result in those discrepancies but what needs to be emphasized is that both elliot et al 1989 and gilley et al 1993 computed the average detachment rate by using the outlet sediment concentration of a rill of 9 m long to calculate the potential rill detachment rate that may have caused considerable errors in estimating the potential detachment rate this caused two major problems one is the average detachment rate is much lower than the potential detachment as illustrated in fig 2 the other is that the plot of 49 cm wide they used could have caused sediment load in water flow to fluctuate randomly due to erosion and deposition alternations which agrees with the channel regime theory proposed by yalin and silva 1999 and in line with the previous studies using an infinite short rill is desirable to obtain the potential detachment rates if test conditions would permit huang et al 1996 zhang et al 2009 thus using the average sediment load of a long rill to estimate the potential detachment rates may result in considerably lowered detachment rate than the potential and big discrepancies of wepp erosion parameters the average value of erodibility of loess in this test is smaller than the result of lei et al 2008 the higher content of sand particle of their test soil and the special sampling method volume replacement adopted in this study may give a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy what s more zhang and liu 2002 measured the maximum detachment rate of a kind of loam clay 24 3 using a 10 cm wide circular container and with it the erodibility is 0 204 s m which is comparable to our results the critical shear stress is the resistance of soil to external shear deformation this instance is the quantitative index of soil to withstand the rill flow shear stress the critical shear stress is related to the cementation of soil particles and is affected by the friction force between them before the soil particles are eroded this force is static friction which is associated with the external force in addition the difference between soil pore content and soil particle composition affirmatively affects the soil structure and eventually results in the changes in soil critical shear stress liu et al 2010 wang et al 2012 from table 1 the critical shear stress of loess soil is lower than that of purple soil given its loose particles and poor structure it is reasonable to understand that the critical shear stress value of loess soil is significantly lesser than that of purple soil specifically loess soil is considerably more vulnerable to be eroded and drained compared with purple soil moreover the τc values of these two soils similarly present a slight increasing trend as the flow rates increase many researchers have discussed the influential factors of critical shear stress from different aspects zhang 2004 reported that critical shear stress increases with the change in slope gradients nouwakpo et al 2010 found that the critical shear stress obviously decreases when the vertical hydraulic gradient switch from seepage conditions to drainage conditions in addition singh and thompson 2016 found that that the critical shear stress is not constant for soil rather they change with the content of soil moisture in the context of agricultural watersheds these studies indicate that the critical shear stress is not a fixed value also random errors caused by experimental data and regression can affect the estimated parameters too according to the comparative results of these two soils the erodibility parameter of the purple soil is considerably lower than that of the loess soil and the critical shear stress of the purple soil is obviously higher than that of the loess soil this phenomenon in turn explains why the erosion phenomenon of the purple soil is not evident when the flow rates and slopes are small in the analytical and numerical methods all the coefficient of determination of the fitting equations of the two soils is greater than 0 80 to verify the feasibility of the method and the reliability of the experimental results 4 2 comparison of the erodibilities and critical shear stresses between loess and purple soils according to the table 1 it s not hard to find that the consistency between the analytical values and numerical results of rill length of 0 m dc0 is considerably better than those of rill length of 0 5 m dc0 5 the numerical results of soil erodibility at the rill length of 0 m are slightly larger than the analytical values for both loess and purple soil in fact as for the erodibility parameters of loess soil the deviation is evenly 4 36 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 m whereas the deviation is averagely 13 95 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 5 m those of the purple soil are 5 7 and 14 36 respectively as for the critical shear stress either the loess or purple soil all the numerical results are slightly bigger than the analytical values the deviation is 9 91 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 m dc0 while 15 8 between the analytical values and the numerical results at the rill length of 0 5 m dc0 5 those of the purple soil are 1 75 and 3 71 respectively averaged soil erodibilities and critical shear stresses of the two soils were listed in table 2 table 2 clearly showed that erodibility parameter estimated with potential detachment rate at rill length of 0 m dc0 produced highest soil erodibility the analytical method yielded slightly lower soil erodibility parameter though erodibility parameter estimated with potential detachment rate at rill length of 0 5 m dc0 5 produced relatively lowered soil erodibility it is still not significantly lower than the other two the averaged critical shear stresses of the two soils estimated with three different methods are almost identical the critical shear stress of the loess ranged from 2 3 to 2 4 n m 2 and that of the purple soil ranged from 1 1 to 1 2 n m 2 these results indicate the feasibility of the method for estimating soil erodibility and shear stress the discrepancy between the analytical values and numerical results is expected mainly due to the variability of rill detachment rate corresponding to different methods on the one side clear water at the inlet of rill has the greatest potential detachment capacity and hence the soil erodibility estimated at the rill length of 0 m logically should be the maximum value on the other side analytical results are by means of the ideal regression model on the context of large experimental data sets whose results is the most comprehensive representative and reliable the experiment results reveal that numerical results estimated with potential detachment rates at the rill length of 0 m agree well with the analytical result in other words calculating the erodibility parameter with the detachment rate at the rill length of 0 m is feasible based on the calculation equation of detachment rate an infinitely short rill is found to be the prerequisite in obtaining the maximum detachment rate huang et al 1996 lei et al 2009 in fact a 0 5 m long rill is a compromise for the 12 m long flume and the experiment operability and it is the shortest and the first segment in this test apparently a certain deviation occurred between this numerical result and the analytical data the rill detachment estimated at the length of 0 5 m is much lower than the potential resulting in a lower slope gradient of regression line and hence a smaller soil erodibility results show that a 0 5 m long rill cannot fully represent the infinitely short length what should be noted that analytical values are larger than the numerical results of dc0 5 less than the numerical results of dc0 which mathematically accords with the theorem of clamp approximation as for either purple soil or loess soil the average soil erodibility of numerical results at 0 5 m and 0 m is quietly close to the analytical values thus the ideal rill length should range from 0 to 0 5 m in other words the selected rill length might be shorter to obtain a considerably closer numerical result to the analytical value experimental results prove that the analytical and numerical methods seem to be promising approaches in estimating soil erodibility and critical shear stress the results show that using a 0 5 m long rill to measure the maximum detachment rate is not desirable it is strongly recommended that both the analytical and numerical methods can be applicable 5 conclusion according to the experimental data the maximum detachment rates are estimated using analytical method and two numerical methods before their soil erodibility parameters and critical shear stresses are obtained through linear regression of maximum detachment rate to rill flow shear stress the results indicate that the soil erodibility parameters of the loess soil are about two times of the purple soil and its critical shear stress is significantly lower than that of the purple soil the erodibility parameters of the two soils remain unchanged and the critical shear stresses of the two soils fluctuate a little in some extent overall the numerical results agree well with the analytical results when estimated with rill detachment rates at the rill length of 0 m the numerical method produces soil erodibility values and critical shear stresses closer to the analytical values as compared with the values estimated with rill detachment rates at the rill length of 0 5 m in fact the average detachment rate at the rill length of 0 5 m underestimates to some extent the maximum detachment rate and the rill length adopted in experiment might be shorter to obtain a considerably closer numerical result to the analytical value acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national

reconstructions based on paleoclimate proxies provide much longer records than the short instrumental period records on which water resource management plans are currently based in australia there is a lack of in situ high resolution paleoclimate proxy records but remote proxies with teleconnections to australian climate have utility in producing streamflow reconstructions here we investigate via a case study for a catchment in eastern australia the novel use of an antarctic ice core based rainfall reconstruction within a budyko framework to reconstruct 1000 years of annual streamflow the resulting streamflow reconstruction captures interannual to decadal variability in the instrumental streamflow validating both the use of the ice core rainfall proxy record and the budyko framework method in the preinstrumental era the streamflow reconstruction shows longer wet and dry epochs and periods of streamflow variability that are higher than observed in the instrumental era importantly for both the instrumental record and preinstrumental reconstructions the wet dry epochs in the rainfall record are shorter longer in the streamflow record and this non linearity must be considered when inferring hydroclimatic risk or historical water availability directly from rainfall proxy records alone these insights provide a better understanding of present infrastructure vulnerability in the context of past climate variability for eastern australia the streamflow reconstruction presented here also provides a better understanding of the range of hydroclimatic variability possible and therefore represents a more realistic baseline on which to quantify the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on water security keywords drought floods streamflow reconstruction paleoclimate budyko 1 introduction rainfall and streamflow reconstructions from paleoclimate proxies indicate that the instrumental climate record does not capture the full range of climate variability e g meko et al 1995 cook et al 1999 woodhouse and lukas 2006a b allen et al 2015b vance et al 2015 ho et al 2016 tozer et al 2016 importantly thyer et al 2009 showed that instrumental climate records on which water resource management plans are based produce high parameter uncertainty in stochastic models and that longer records are required to reduce uncertainty and enable proper stochastic model identification where paleoclimate data is used longer wet and dry sequences are observed allowing for the development of more realistic statistics on which to design water infrastructure and develop catchment management plans biondi et al 2002 verdon and franks 2007 biondi et al 2008 prairie et al 2008 henley et al 2011 patskoski and sankarasubramanian 2015 as such researchers are investigating the incorporation of paleoclimate reconstructions and more specifically streamflow reconstructions into water management and planning e g thyer et al 2006 woodhouse and lukas 2006b prairie et al 2008 patskoski and sankarasubramanian 2015 however knowledge gaps still exist and in practice the uptake of insights from paleoclimate research remains limited especially in australia where water resources management is primarily based on short 100 years at best instrumental rainfall and streamflow records e g kiem et al 2016 high resolution streamflow reconstructions are traditionally developed from tree ring records given their high temporal resolution and ability to represent local hydroclimatic behaviour elshorbagy et al 2016 razavi et al 2016 in north america a broad network of tree ring records see fig 5 in cook et al 2010 has afforded the development of numerous streamflow reconstructions in water catchments across the region e g meko et al 1995 meko et al 2001 woodhouse and lukas 2006a b ho et al 2016 in australia however there is a lack of in situ high resolution e g at least annual paleoclimate proxy records particularly in the densely populated eastern seaboard of the existing eastern australian based streamflow reconstructions table 1 two from the island of tasmania utilise local proxy tree ring records 4 and 5 fig 1 a allen et al 2015a allen et al 2015b allen et al 2017 the remaining reconstructions use proxy records that are remote from the water catchments of interest and therefore rely on climatic teleconnections between the proxy location and the region of interest mcgowan et al 2009 produced a streamflow reconstruction for the river murray 2 fig 1a based on a reconstruction of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which in turn was developed from flood drought records in eastern china gallant and gergis 2011 produced a streamflow reconstruction for the same location as mcgowan et al 2009 3 fig 1a but used a network of tree ring and coral records from new zealand indonesia the tropical pacific region and australia outside of the river murray catchment finally lough 2007 produced streamflow reconstructions for four rivers in northeastern tropical australia from coral records from the great barrier reef 1 fig 1a a remote climate proxy record that has also been utilised for australia is the millennial length summer sea salt record from the law dome ice core in east antarctica vance et al 2013 2015 tozer et al 2016 law dome annual sea salt concentrations are a function of wind speed over the southern ocean which are connected with large scale climate processes operating at annual to decadal scales that also influence australia s climate souney et al 2002 vance et al 2013 2015 tozer et al 2016 recently used the sea salt proxy record to develop a 1013 year rainfall reconstruction for the williams river wr catchment on the eastern seaboard of australia fig 1b the proxy record is annually resolved and accurately dated discussed in section 3 1 2 enabling precise dating of extreme events this record is also significantly longer than other proxy records and the instrumental period used in existing australian streamflow reconstructions table 1 and has the potential for extension to 2000 years roberts et al 2015 this proxy record is unique for hydroclimate studies where accurate event timing and high data resolution are needed and thus shows potential for future streamflow reconstruction in australia the streamflow reconstructions presented in table 1 are based on regression techniques these techniques may be suitable for rainfall reconstructions given that rainfall is directly linked with atmospheric and oceanic processes or for tree ring based streamflow reconstructions because tree growth is a response to local hydrologic conditions however for streamflow reconstructions using remote proxies regression techniques frequently ignore other processes affecting catchment water balance e g evapotranspiration soil moisture catchment storage vegetation topography groundwater recharge solander et al 2010 gallant and gergis 2011 saito et al 2015 an alternative option is to develop a hydrological model that uses proxy derived inputs to produce a streamflow reconstruction e g saito et al 2008 gray and mccabe 2010 solander et al 2010 saito et al 2015 this approach incorporates catchment processes into the streamflow reconstruction development for example gray and mccabe 2010 and saito et al 2015 reconstructed preinstrumental streamflow in two catchments in the western united states using conceptual hydrological models with tree ring derived precipitation and temperature as inputs however a drawback of this approach is the need to calibrate multiple model parameters e g four and six parameters in the case of gray and mccabe 2010 and saito et al 2015 respectively and the consequent assumption that optimised parameters remain valid over the reconstruction time period i e over multiple centuries a change in mean rainfall can reduce parameter transferability vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 and this issue is likely to magnify when using reconstructed rainfall as a model input where multiple regime shifts occur over the last 1000 years e g tozer et al 2016 the zero parameter non linear budyko 1974 curve provides another option for streamflow reconstruction widely used in the hydrological community the budyko curve is a simple water balance model that describes the partitioning of rainfall into streamflow and evapotranspiration zhang et al 2008 greve et al 2015 the budyko curve is used to model streamflow in australian catchments zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 but to our knowledge has not been used to reconstruct preinstrumental streamflow in eastern australia in this study we use the budyko 1974 curve and an associated single parameter milly s β curve for comparison milly 1993 discussed further in section 4 1 which require rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet inputs to reconstruct preinstrumental streamflow in the wr catchment given that a pet reconstruction is not presently available for the wr catchment we test two pet datasets annual average and annually varying over the instrumental period to determine the necessity in terms of developing a skilful streamflow reconstruction of reconstructing the pet variable we also assess differences in streamflow reconstruction using two australian gridded rainfall data products the scientific information for land owners silo database jeffrey et al 2001 and australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 section 3 1 in addition we produce a regression based reconstruction to compare with the budyko curve and milly s β curve methods to identify differences in the reconstruction methods this study represents a novel combination of ice core science paleoclimatology and catchment scale hydrology importantly the reconstruction provides context to the instrumental flow record and given that a rainfall reconstruction exists for the same catchment allows for investigation into the rainfall runoff relationship during the instrumental and preinstrumental records this information provides a better understanding of present infrastructure vulnerability in the context of past climate variability and allows the inference of climate variability impacts and change in water resources climate extremes flood drought and water security 2 the williams river catchment the wr catchment is a summer autumn rainfall dominated catchment located on the eastern seaboard of australia fig 1b a feature of the catchment is the grahamstown reservoir managed by the hunter water corporation hwc part of the conjunctive use headworks scheme for potable water supply in the newcastle region kiem and franks 2004 fig 1b the grahamstown reservoir catchment area is too small to maintain water levels in the reservoir and hence water is extracted from wr to supplement the reservoir various rules exist governing how much water can be extracted from wr and includes the need to maintain environmental flows and various water constraints one such rule is that no pumping is allowed unless streamflow volumes are above 130 ml day 1 kiem and franks 2004 hwc use streamflow recorded at gauge no 210010 fig 1b to determine when and how much water should be pumped into the reservoir kiem and franks 2004 therefore we reconstructed streamflow for this gauge for the catchment specific october september water year 3 model input data 3 1 rainfall data 3 1 1 instrumental period rainfall the wr catchment rainfall reconstruction presented in tozer et al 2016 was developed based on gridded rainfall from the australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 gridded rainfall data from the scientific information for land owners silo database jeffrey et al 2001 is also commonly used in industry in australia and indeed is used by hwc for input into their water resources systems as such we use both the awap and silo rainfall data in this analysis both awap and silo products provide data resolution of 0 05 approximately 5 5 km and are based on interpolation of gauged rainfall data from australia s bureau of meteorology however awap and silo are produced using different interpolation techniques resulting in differences between the two products for rainfall magnitude frequency spatial variability and temporal variability see tozer et al 2012 for an in depth assessment of differences between and limitations of the awap and silo rainfall products data is available from 1900 and 1889 to present for awap and silo respectively however our comparative analysis ends in september 2009 different spatially integrated input rainfall datasets were tested within the budyko and milly s β curve approaches to determine both the suitability of the different models for simulating flow in the catchment and the most representative rainfall dataset to develop the 210010 catchment rainfall reconstructions the input rainfall datasets assessed were a 24 grid catchment average only grids within the catchment boundary a 58 grid catchment average grids that are both within the catchment and intersect the catchment boundary data extracted for the grid which encompasses the 210010 catchment centroid and data from a high quality rainfall gauge lavery et al 1997 within the catchment gauge 61017 the catchment average rainfall dataset developed from the specified grids located completely within the 210010 catchment boundary i e 24 grids gave improved skill metrics and hence improved flow simulation relative to other input rainfall datasets consequently results for the 24 grid rainfall dataset are presented here and results using the other three input rainfall datasets are presented in the supporting information table s1 3 1 2 reconstructed rainfall tozer et al 2016 reconstructed a 1013 year annual rainfall record for the wr catchment from an ice core record at law dome east antarctica law dome is a small independent icecap in coastal east antarctica just south of australia the reconstruction exploits a relationship between sea salt concentration in snow at law dome and rainfall in eastern australia identified in vance et al 2013 and vance et al 2015 the regions are linked by large scale climate processes in particular the el niño southern oscillation enso and associated interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo enso and ipo have been identified as direct influences of climate variability across eastern australia e g mcbride and nicholls 1983 kiem and franks 2001 kiem et al 2003 kiem and franks 2004 risbey et al 2009 cai et al 2012 cai and van rensch 2013 kiem and verdon kidd 2013 and also indirectly via their relationship with other climate processes such as the indian ocean dipole cai et al 2011 2012 southern annular mode lim et al 2013 and blocking i e mid high latitude processes e g pook et al 2009 enso variations extend to the mid to high latitudes and indeed there is evidence of an enso signature in climate records across antarctica holbrook and bindoff 1997 turner 2004 fogt and bromwich 2006 clem and fogt 2013 welhouse et al 2016 at law dome both enso and ipo signatures are identified in sea salt and snowfall accumulation rate records vance et al 2013 roberts et al 2015 vance et al 2015 more specifically sea salt variability recorded at law dome is related to surface wind speeds across the open ocean and is representative of large scale circulation in the mid latitudes of the indian and southwest pacific oceans souney et al 2002 goodwin et al 2004 van ommen and morgan 2010 vance et al 2013 the law dome summer sea salt record ldsss used here was dated using annual layer counting and known volcanic age ties having an absolute accuracy from 1807 to 2009 common era ce and 1 year error from 894 to 1807 ce plummer et al 2012 the 1 year error results from counting 1 year that had an ambiguous signal in some dating parameters and the non inclusion of another possible year that did not meet the criteria to qualify as an annual layer year curran et al 1998 palmer et al 2001 plummer et al 2012 this highly accurate dating over the last millennium allows for the clear dating of extreme events that are recorded in the hydroclimate reconstructions subsequently developed from the ldsss proxy record tozer et al 2016 reconstructed rainfall for each awap grid within the entire wr catchment fig 1b using linear regression for this study we have developed again using linear regression both awap and silo based reconstructions for the 210010 catchment 24 grids a calibration period of october 1900 to september 2009 was used based on the silo data available for this study the final reconstructions were scaled to have the same mean and standard deviation as the respective awap and silo datasets for the 1929 2009 analysis period in order to recover variance lost during regression and allow comparison with the instrumental record cook et al 2010 allen et al 2015b 3 2 potential evapotranspiration pet data daily pet data from the silo database jeffrey et al 2001 was used for the streamflow reconstruction as this is the dataset used by water management authorities in this region including hwc i e all hydrological reservoir models are calibrated to silo data meaning that at this point in time a reconstruction based on silo data is more practically useful than a reconstruction based on awap tozer et al 2012 also showed that where the spatial coverage of gauged data is reasonable as it is in the williams river that the silo product is closer to the gauged data than the awap product because the silo interpolation technique involves calibrating to the gauged data whereas awap does not the silo pet dataset is developed using morton s wet environment evapotranspiration algorithms vaze et al 2010 the pet data was averaged across the 210010 gauge catchment and aggregated to an annual time step two variations of the pet dataset were investigated an annually varying dataset and an annual average version calculated over the 1929 2009 period to match the availability of streamflow and rainfall data 3 3 streamflow data all available daily streamflow data 1 12 1927 present for gauge 210010 was obtained from the nsw office of water http realtimedata water nsw gov au water stm annual data october to september water year was aggregated from daily streamflow data nine years 1985 1988 1990 1992 1996 1998 2005 with missing daily data were removed from the october 1928 to september 2009 analysis period end date governed by the availability of rainfall data table 2 summarises the datasets used for the budyko milly s β and regression models 4 annual water balance model for the williams river catchment 4 1 budyko and budyko like curves eq 1 developed by budyko 1974 describes the relationship between the mean annual evaporative index ratio of catchment average actual evapotranspiration to rainfall and dryness index ratio of catchment average potential evapotranspiration to mean precipitation 1 aet p f pet p where aet mean actual evapotranspiration pet mean potential evapotranspiration p mean precipitation assuming water storage is negligible actual evapotranspiration aet is the difference between streamflow and precipitation and hence the model can be used to model mean annual streamflow koster and suarez 1999 the functional form of the budyko curve is given in eq 2 2 aet p pet p 1 exp pet p tanh p pet 1 2 for large values of the dryness index pet p the relationship approaches the water limit fig 2 where aet precipitation p and for low values the relationship approaches the energy limit where aet pet potter and zhang 2009 values of the dryness index greater than one indicate a more arid climate and values less than one indicate a humid climate jones et al 2012 beyond mean annual statistics various studies have shown that the budyko framework can be used to model interannual variability of streamflow e g koster and suarez 1999 zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 in this case a key assumption is that interannual variability in surface storage is smaller than interannual rainfall evapotranspiration and streamflow variability koster and suarez 1999 therefore the budyko curve is not optimal for modelling interannual streamflow in all catchments potter and zhang 2009 deviations from the budyko curve occur due to local catchment conditions like soil moisture vegetation catchment storage and topography e g donohue et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 jones et al 2012 greve et al 2015 as such other formulations based on the budyko curve have been derived and include one or more free parameters designed to account for local catchment conditions e g milly 1993 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 zhang et al 2004 one such derivation is the one parameter milly s β curve milly 1993 potter and zhang 2009 given in eq 3 the β parameter is said to represent the reciprocal of the standardised interstorm potential evapotranspiration milly 1993 3 aet p exp β pet p 1 1 exp β pet p 1 p pet potter and zhang 2009 showed that milly s β curve with a β value of 1 98 plotted in fig 2 was optimal relative to the budyko curve and other derivations for summer rainfall dominated catchments in australia fig 2 shows the observed mean and interannual based on silo data values of the evaporative and dryness indices for the 210010 catchment both curves provide a good match to the mean and interannual variables however their suitability for modelling 210010 streamflow needs further investigation 4 2 testing the suitability of budyko curves for simulating williams river streamflow annual streamflow for the 210010 gauge was simulated using both budyko s and milly s β curves with awap and silo gridded rainfall inputs 24 grids and the pet datasets to determine which inputs provide the best streamflow simulation and ultimately whether either model could adequately simulate 210010 streamflow model skill was measured via pearson correlation r and associated r2 metric and percent bias difference between total simulated flow and total gauged flow as a percent of gauged in addition we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency with logarithmic values lnnse eq 4 and kling gupta efficiency kge eq 5 measures logarithmically transforming the streamflow values as in the lnnse means that peak flows are flattened and low flows are given more influence krause et al 2005 this is important because the magnitudes of proxy based rainfall and streamflow reconstructions tend to have a high degree of uncertainty particularly in extreme wet periods e g prairie et al 2008 tozer et al 2016 and the traditional nse i e with untransformed flows overemphasises large flows because any deviations are squared criss and winston 2008 the kge is a more recently developed measure that overcomes inadequacies in the nse these inadequacies include using the observed mean as a baseline schaefli and gupta 2007 gupta et al 2009 and the fact that in order to maximise the nse the variability has to be underestimated gupta et al 2009 westerberg et al 2011 kling et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 the kge incorporates the same components of the nse i e the linear correlation r bias b and variability γ but separates their influence and provides a more robust indication of model skill gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 we use the kge version presented in kling et al 2012 here bias is represented with b as opposed to β as it is presented in kling et al 2012 to avoid confusion with the milly s β parameter 4 lnnse 1 i 1 n lno i lns i 2 i 1 n lno i lno i 2 where o i observedflow s i simulatedflow 5 kge 1 r 1 2 b 1 2 γ 1 2 where γ σ s μ s σ o μ o b μ s μ o with µ and σ referring to mean and standard deviation respectively and subscripts o and s referring to observed and simulated flow respectively skill metrics for the budyko and milly s β models developed with the various input datasets are presented in table 3 with plots provided in supporting information figs s1 s4 the β parameter was optimised through maximising the kge nse values are also presented for comparison the results indicate that both the a budyko and b milly s β models can skilfully simulate annual streamflow at gauge 210010 with high kge nse lnnse r and r2 values and low bias over the 1929 to 2009 analysis period milly s β provided slightly improved skill metrics the optimal β values for both silo β 2 14 and awap β 1 93 rainfall datasets fit well with the generic β value for summer rainfall dominated catchments identified in potter and zhang 2009 β 1 98 section 4 1 the consistency of the calibrated β parameter over different sub periods was also tested for the silo dataset the two periods 1929 1964 1965 2009 were selected as they include 36 years of data each noting that missing data is present in the latter half of record results are presented in table 3c for silo rainfall and silo average pet and show similarly good performance over both sub periods split sample calibration vaze et al 2012 for milly s β model was also undertaken whereby the model was calibrated to the first period and validated in the second and vice versa results were similar to those in table 3 and are presented in the supporting information table s2 in regards to the input datasets silo rainfall provides slightly improved skill metrics relative to awap rainfall for pet skill metrics were similar for annually varying and annual average pet input datasets which other authors have similarly found peel et al 2000 fowler 2002 oudin et al 2005 further discussion on the rainfall and pet input datasets is presented in section 4 3 4 3 streamflow reconstruction missing data in the gauged streamflow record see section 3 3 was infilled using flow simulated by milly s β model with silo rainfall and annually varying pet inputs calibrated to 1929 2009 this was undertaken because of the high skill of the milly s β model in simulating 210010 streamflow table 3b and so that a complete gauged streamflow record could be used for comparison with simulated flows particularly important when investigating non stationarity in the streamflow reconstruction skill the awap and silo rainfall reconstructions discussed in section 3 1 2 were used as the rainfall input for the budyko and milly s β models to reconstruct streamflow for the 1929 2009 period results for the budyko model are presented in table 4 a and show positive kge values and significant correlations between gauged and reconstructed flows using all input data options the negative lnnse and nse results are not desirable however given limitations in the calculation of the nse discussed in section 4 2 a negative value is not necessarily indicative of a poor model schaefli and gupta 2007 criss and winston 2008 especially when magnitude is not as important as the timing and duration of wet or dry epochs as is the case for river basins in general e g van dijk et al 2013 van loon 2015 some variability in the strength of the relationship between the budyko reconstructed streamflow and gauged streamflow as measured by 10 yr moving pearson correlation is evident fig 3 this is likely governed by non stationarity in the relationship between ldsss and rainfall in eastern australia which vance et al 2013 and vance et al 2015 suggest is related to the ipo whereby the link between the regions is strengthened in ipo positive phase due to a more meridional atmospheric pressure pattern relative to the ipo negative phase reconstruction skill over ipo phases for the budyko model was assessed table 4b and it is indeed evident that there is reduced skill in the negative ipo phase and an increase in skill in the second positive ipo phase and combined positive phases tozer et al 2016 noted however that this relationship is further complicated in the wr catchment due to the influence of east coast lows ecl intense storms that contribute around 25 of the region s annual rainfall these storms are thought to contribute to the nonstationarity in the relationship between ldsss and climate variability in the wr catchment and may also explain the reduced skill in the first positive ipo phase i e the clear ipo related variability in the ldsss rainfall link identified in vance et al 2013 and vance et al 2015 for southeast qld does not always hold for the wr catchment tozer et al 2016 this may also be compounded by the relatively short analysis period available for the first positive ipo phase 13 years compared with 19 years for other periods or issues with the gauged flow early in the record of importance is that while there is acknowledged nonstationarity in the link between law dome and the wr catchment the annual correlation remains greater than 0 23 during all phases the milly s β model was initially run with parameter values from the gauged data analysis table 3 however improvement in skill was found with calibrating directly to the reconstructions table 4c results using β values from the gauged data analysis are presented in table s3 in the supporting information the kge was again used as the objective function also shown are the results for a linear least squares regression model the regression based reconstruction was scaled to have the same mean and standard deviation as the streamflow data over the 1929 2009 analysis period hence the bias is 0 table 4f for the two input rainfall reconstructions table 4a the silo based reconstruction provided marginally improved statistics relative to the awap based reconstruction the correlation values r and consequently r2 determined for both reconstructions are very similar because the rainfall reconstructions account for the same amount of variability in the respective gridded rainfall they were developed from 11 5 and 11 8 of the annual awap and silo gridded datasets these results show that the accuracy of the 210010 streamflow reconstruction is not that sensitive to the gridded rainfall data product used a 2 increase in the gauged streamflow variability accounted for is observed for the models using the annually varying pet compared with average pet table 4a for budyko and table 4c for milly s β results annual rainfall variability is the primary driver of annual streamflow variability koster and suarez 1999 arora 2002 potter and zhang 2009 likely due to its high interannual variability relative to pet annual rainfall variability is typically 20 25 compared with 5 for pet peel et al 2000 nonetheless pet and local catchment characteristics like antecedent soil moisture storage conditions are important components of the water balance wooldridge et al 2001 and although based on these results one could conclude that average pet is adequate for modelling preinstrumental streamflow it is not clear whether the 5 interannual variability seen in the gauged pet record was greater in the past if interannual variability in pet was greater or different in the past this may change the influence of pet on the water balance and warrant the development of a pet reconstruction however a pet reconstruction would bring with it the typical uncertainties associated with the reconstruction process e g non stationarity in the relationship between the proxy and gauged climate variable gallant et al 2013 batehup et al 2015 and again it is unclear whether these uncertainties would be lower than uncertainties associated with using annual average values from the instrumental period and applying it back in time as such for the purposes of the study we use average pet to develop our streamflow reconstruction section 5 comparing the two models the milly s β models table 4c provided improved kge and bias statistics relative to the budyko models table 4a but poorer nse and lnnse results this is not unexpected given that the milly s β models were optimised relative to the kge and not the nse and lnnse clearer improvement in the streamflow reconstructions produced using milly s β model relative to budyko is seen in fig 4 a and b for silo rainfall where a closer match to gauged flows is evident particularly for high flow periods though it has only one parameter a potential limitation of using milly s β for reconstructing climate is the assumption of parameter stability over time as discussed in section 1 model parameters are sensitive to the climate during the calibration period saft et al 2016 which might affect their transferability outside of this period vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 kiem and franks 2004 showed for the wr catchment that rainfall and streamflow in ipo positive and negative phases are significantly different whereby higher lower and more less variable rainfall streamflow is recorded in ipo negative positive phase we confirmed these results using the annual 210010 streamflow and silo 24 grid average rainfall and results are presented in figs s7 and s8 and table s4 in the supporting information given the different climate regimes in the ipo phases we tested the transferability of the milly s β parameter by calibrating first to the ipo negative phase 1947 1975 and validating on the remaining data and then calibrating to ipo positive phases 1929 1941 1979 1997 and validating on the remaining data results are presented in table 4d and e firstly there is little variation in parameter values across the three calibration periods tested 1929 2009 ipo negative ipo positive skill metrics for the calibration to ipo negative table 4d and validating to the remainder of the data were generally reduced for the calibration period compared to validation particularly the nse and lnnse this is not surprising given the use of kge as the objective function as opposed to optimising the nse or lnnse that the nse is known to emphasise large flows section 4 2 and ipo negative is a particularly wet period and there is a reduced connection between law dome and eastern australia in ipo negative vance et al 2015 results for calibrating to ipo positive table 4e show improved metrics for the calibration period as one would expect relative to validation this suggests some issues with parameter transferability however this relates less to milly s β model and more to the variability in the strength of the relationship between ldsss and rainfall further discussed in tozer et al 2016 non stationarities in the proxy and gauged climate relationship is a concern for all proxy based climate reconstructions as mentioned above gallant et al 2013 batehup et al 2015 the regression budyko and milly s β model based reconstructions are similar fig 4a and b and have comparable skill metrics which again suggests that rainfall variability is the key driver of streamflow variability at this timeframe however the regression method provides a physically unrealistic streamflow reconstruction i e negative flows and this emphasises the importance of using a method for reconstructing streamflow that is both physically realistic i e able to account for non linearities inherent in converting rainfall to runoff and satisfactory in terms of performance statistics a comparison of reconstructions produced using awap rainfall are presented in figs s5 and s6 in the supporting information the results presented in section 4 3 show that a skilful streamflow reconstruction can be developed for the 210010 gauge using both budyko milly s β models with reconstructed rainfall derived from the ldsss proxy both awap and silo rainfall products are suitable as model inputs annually varying pet provides a slight increase in skill but reconstruction of this variable is associated with additional uncertainties which need to be weighed relative to the potential increase in reconstruction skill the hydrological modelling approach provides for a more physically realistic streamflow reconstruction relative to the linear regression approach reconstruction skill may be further improved with the addition of other proxies including those from the law dome ice core roberts et al 2015 new ice core records from other east antarctica sites vance et al 2016 and from other proxies within or near australia that are influenced by similar climate processes e g gallant and gergis 2011 palmer et al 2015 these are avenues for future research but it should also be acknowledged that inclusion of additional proxy information may not always improve reconstruction skill and can potentially introduce extra uncertainties to the reconstruction process due to inconsistencies in the climate signals represented in the individual proxies e g wilson et al 2010 vance et al 2017 5 millennial length streamflow reconstruction based on the above findings a 1013 year 1000 2012 ce streamflow reconstruction was developed for the 210010 gauge using milly s β model with β 1 88 with the silo based rainfall reconstruction and silo average pet inputs the reconstruction annual and 10 year smoothed is presented in fig 5 along with a timeseries of the 10 year running coefficient of variation cv calculated as the ratio of the running standard deviation to the long term mean for the 1929 2009 period as streamflow variability increases i e cv approaches 1 so too does the vulnerability of infrastructure mcmahon et al 2006 hence the ability to put instrumental period streamflow variability into a long term context is important fig 5 indicates several periods in the preinstrumental period that are characterised by high variability relative to the instrumental record particularly the late 1800s and 1300 1500s importantly fig 5 shows that 210010 streamflow oscillates between periods of low and high variability suggesting that infrastructure vulnerability similarly oscillates over time this indeed highlights the decadal to centennial scale cycles inherent in our climate e g power et al 1999 gallant et al 2013 and the need to look beyond our short instrumental period to fully understand current climate risks the reconstruction fig 5 shows long decadal and longer periods of above and below mean streamflow the duration of these periods are important in water resource management wet and dry epochs in the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions were determined based on eq 6 following tozer et al 2016 6 wet years where reconstruction mean 0 3 standard deviationdry years where reconstruction mean 0 3 standard deviation this threshold is designed to identify periods that are generally wet or generally dry even though some years within that period are slightly below or above the long term average e g one high streamflow year within a particularly dry period may not fill a reservoir the same wet dry epoch definition is used for rainfall and streamflow despite these variables having different annual distributions both in general and as also evident in the two reconstructions see fig s9 in supporting information the use of the same procedure allows us to assess the variability of wet dry epoch duration between the two variables which is important for determining lags in streamflow recovery and meteorological drought for example yang et al 2017 table 5 identifies wet and dry epochs of at least 5 years duration in the a gauged streamflow data b reconstructed streamflow data over the 1929 2009 period and c reconstructed streamflow over the full 1000 2012 year period firstly the wet and dry epochs identified in the reconstructed data table 5b are compared with those identified in the gauged data table 5a over the instrumental period importantly the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions both capture the major world war ii 1935 1942 and millennium 2002 2007 droughts verdon kidd and kiem 2009 some dry events identified in the gauged records are not captured in the reconstructions however there is some ambiguity in the 1991 2000 dry event whereby the gauged record provided partially falls within the wet epoch list the wet epochs are reasonably captured in both the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions acknowledging that the ldsss proxy is least accurate in extreme wet epochs tozer et al 2016 which no annually resolved proxy is likely to capture thus the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions adequately capture the duration of gauged wet and dry epochs which provides further validation beyond the skill metrics presented in table 4 for the use of the ldsss proxy in reconstructing eastern australian hydroclimate next the differences in epoch lengths in the streamflow and rainfall records are assessed to gain further insights into the rainfall runoff relationship during preinstrumental and instrumental periods in comparing the gauged streamflow record with gauged rainfall record table 5a it is apparent that differences exists between the number and length of epochs identified for example an additional dry epoch is identified in the gauged streamflow record 1957 1961 and a corresponding dry rainfall epoch is longer in the streamflow record i e 1979 1983 in the rainfall record compared with 1979 1987 in the streamflow record in the wet epochs there were no wet streamflow epochs that met the criteria of at least 5 years in length these results indicate that dry wet periods are longer shorter in the gauged rainfall than in the gauged streamflow record for the reconstructed data over the gauged period table 5b there are additional dry epochs in the streamflow record that are not present in the rainfall record though no differences are seen in wet epochs that are identified in the reconstructed rainfall and streamflow over the instrumental period assessing the reconstruction over the full 1000 2012 period table 5c further supports the trend identified above that is more dry epochs are present in the streamflow record relative to rainfall record 11 epochs of at least 5 years in the rainfall record and 16 in the streamflow record in addition longer epochs are present in the streamflow record relative to rainfall e g the longest epoch in streamflow record is 12 years 1193 1204 compared with 9 years in the rainfall record 1215 1223 and the 1193 1204 dry streamflow period is not identified as a dry epoch in the rainfall record given the large number of wet epochs of 5 years and greater identified only those greater than 10 years are presented in table 5c all epochs are provided in table s5 in the supporting information there are 58 5 year wet epochs identified in the rainfall record relative to 52 in the streamflow record supporting information furthermore several wet epochs are shorter in the streamflow record relative to the rainfall record for example the wet epoch commencing in 1539 is 21 years long in the rainfall record but only 18 years in the streamflow record and similarly the epoch commencing in 1452 is 12 years long in the rainfall record but not present in the reconstructed streamflow record table 5c because it is only 8 years long these results suggest that a long wet dry rainfall period will not necessarily translate to the same length wet dry period in streamflow despite rainfall variability being the primary driver of streamflow variability at the annual scale discussed in section 4 2 non linearity in the rainfall streamflow relationship is also influenced by pet and local catchment characteristics like antecedent soil moisture conditions as mentioned e g wooldridge et al 2001 saft et al 2015 yang et al 2017 and this has implications for interpreting rainfall proxies as indicators of water availability or water security these findings also highlight the importance of distinguishing between extreme rainfall and flooding e g johnson et al 2016 and the different types of drought e g meteorological hydrological agricultural droughts e g kiem et al 2016 when assessing impacts and looking to manage current and future hydroclimatic risks the results in table 5 also indicate that different centuries are dominated by different climate regimes and that the frequency of these epochs varies from century to century for example the 1100s to mid 1200s was a predominantly dry epoch along with the post 1900s period conversely the 1300s to late 1600s and 1800s were predominantly wet epochs this suggests that the reliance on statistics from one century e g the instrumental period as is the current practice will likely underestimate or at least misrepresent the true hydroclimatic risk in a given catchment or region tozer et al 2016 epoch duration is also presented as probability of exceedance curves for wet epochs fig 6 a and dry epochs fig 6b these figures both confirm the tendency for shorter longer duration wet dry epochs in the streamflow compared with the rainfall record discussed above importantly these figures show that wet dry epoch duration in the instrumental period is markedly shorter longer than wet dry epoch duration in the preinstrumental period for example statistics from the instrumental record suggest that for dry epochs fig 6b there is no chance of experiencing a dry period of longer than 8 years yet this is clearly possible when the preinstrumental record is considered similarly the statistics from the instrumental period suggest that there is no chance of experiencing a wet epoch longer than 10 years but the preinstrumental streamflow record suggest a probability of at least 15 fig 6a and that wet epochs up to 40 years duration are feasible this is a concern given that these extended periods of wet dry regimes are a major cause of suboptimal operations in water supply reservoirs turner and galelli 2016 in addition the long duration events observed in the preinstrumental period may have implications for pet and the meteorological variables that go into its estimation e g temperature humidity wind speed solar radiation and the assumption that average pet is adequate for modelling streamflow in the preinstrumental era though fowler 2002 identified comparable performance in a 13 year daily water balance model using a range of pet inputs from climatological pet to more sophisticated daily estimations and across extreme dry and wet periods it is not certain that these results can be extrapolated to the timeframe and annual resolution investigated here this needs further investigation but the outputs presented here i e the knowledge of when and for how long wet dry epochs occur will be useful in undertaking investigations into long term pet changes and their influence or not on streamflow variability 6 conclusions this study presents the use of the budyko framework to produce streamflow reconstructions as a means to overcome potential issues with regression and multi parameter hydrological modelling approaches the method presented and insights in regards to pet input data requirements are transferable to other catchments in australia and elsewhere in addition for the first time we have shown the utility of an ice core based proxy in producing a skilful millennial length and annually resolved streamflow reconstruction in an australian catchment interrogation of the streamflow reconstruction has shown that not only are longer dry wet periods present in the preinstrumental period relative to instrumental they are frequent where there is no probability of certain duration events occurring in the instrumental record this probability exists in the preinstrumental record there have been periods of higher streamflow variability in the preinstrumental which if similar occurred today relates to increased infrastructure vulnerability the dominant climate regime wet or dry changes from century to century wet dry epochs in the rainfall record are shorter longer in the streamflow record which highlights the need for specific reconstructions of water availability instead of inferring it from rainfall proxies our reliance on statistics from the instrumental period therefore means that our infrastructure design and management plans do not properly account for hydroclimatic risk in water catchments the streamflow reconstruction better captures the range of hydroclimatic variability possible and represents a more realistic baseline to quantify the impacts of climate variability and potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on water security the features identified in the reconstruction that are not evident in the instrumental period and which we are currently not equipped to deal with provide the first step to answering the call

reconstructions based on paleoclimate proxies provide much longer records than the short instrumental period records on which water resource management plans are currently based in australia there is a lack of in situ high resolution paleoclimate proxy records but remote proxies with teleconnections to australian climate have utility in producing streamflow reconstructions here we investigate via a case study for a catchment in eastern australia the novel use of an antarctic ice core based rainfall reconstruction within a budyko framework to reconstruct 1000 years of annual streamflow the resulting streamflow reconstruction captures interannual to decadal variability in the instrumental streamflow validating both the use of the ice core rainfall proxy record and the budyko framework method in the preinstrumental era the streamflow reconstruction shows longer wet and dry epochs and periods of streamflow variability that are higher than observed in the instrumental era importantly for both the instrumental record and preinstrumental reconstructions the wet dry epochs in the rainfall record are shorter longer in the streamflow record and this non linearity must be considered when inferring hydroclimatic risk or historical water availability directly from rainfall proxy records alone these insights provide a better understanding of present infrastructure vulnerability in the context of past climate variability for eastern australia the streamflow reconstruction presented here also provides a better understanding of the range of hydroclimatic variability possible and therefore represents a more realistic baseline on which to quantify the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on water security keywords drought floods streamflow reconstruction paleoclimate budyko 1 introduction rainfall and streamflow reconstructions from paleoclimate proxies indicate that the instrumental climate record does not capture the full range of climate variability e g meko et al 1995 cook et al 1999 woodhouse and lukas 2006a b allen et al 2015b vance et al 2015 ho et al 2016 tozer et al 2016 importantly thyer et al 2009 showed that instrumental climate records on which water resource management plans are based produce high parameter uncertainty in stochastic models and that longer records are required to reduce uncertainty and enable proper stochastic model identification where paleoclimate data is used longer wet and dry sequences are observed allowing for the development of more realistic statistics on which to design water infrastructure and develop catchment management plans biondi et al 2002 verdon and franks 2007 biondi et al 2008 prairie et al 2008 henley et al 2011 patskoski and sankarasubramanian 2015 as such researchers are investigating the incorporation of paleoclimate reconstructions and more specifically streamflow reconstructions into water management and planning e g thyer et al 2006 woodhouse and lukas 2006b prairie et al 2008 patskoski and sankarasubramanian 2015 however knowledge gaps still exist and in practice the uptake of insights from paleoclimate research remains limited especially in australia where water resources management is primarily based on short 100 years at best instrumental rainfall and streamflow records e g kiem et al 2016 high resolution streamflow reconstructions are traditionally developed from tree ring records given their high temporal resolution and ability to represent local hydroclimatic behaviour elshorbagy et al 2016 razavi et al 2016 in north america a broad network of tree ring records see fig 5 in cook et al 2010 has afforded the development of numerous streamflow reconstructions in water catchments across the region e g meko et al 1995 meko et al 2001 woodhouse and lukas 2006a b ho et al 2016 in australia however there is a lack of in situ high resolution e g at least annual paleoclimate proxy records particularly in the densely populated eastern seaboard of the existing eastern australian based streamflow reconstructions table 1 two from the island of tasmania utilise local proxy tree ring records 4 and 5 fig 1 a allen et al 2015a allen et al 2015b allen et al 2017 the remaining reconstructions use proxy records that are remote from the water catchments of interest and therefore rely on climatic teleconnections between the proxy location and the region of interest mcgowan et al 2009 produced a streamflow reconstruction for the river murray 2 fig 1a based on a reconstruction of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which in turn was developed from flood drought records in eastern china gallant and gergis 2011 produced a streamflow reconstruction for the same location as mcgowan et al 2009 3 fig 1a but used a network of tree ring and coral records from new zealand indonesia the tropical pacific region and australia outside of the river murray catchment finally lough 2007 produced streamflow reconstructions for four rivers in northeastern tropical australia from coral records from the great barrier reef 1 fig 1a a remote climate proxy record that has also been utilised for australia is the millennial length summer sea salt record from the law dome ice core in east antarctica vance et al 2013 2015 tozer et al 2016 law dome annual sea salt concentrations are a function of wind speed over the southern ocean which are connected with large scale climate processes operating at annual to decadal scales that also influence australia s climate souney et al 2002 vance et al 2013 2015 tozer et al 2016 recently used the sea salt proxy record to develop a 1013 year rainfall reconstruction for the williams river wr catchment on the eastern seaboard of australia fig 1b the proxy record is annually resolved and accurately dated discussed in section 3 1 2 enabling precise dating of extreme events this record is also significantly longer than other proxy records and the instrumental period used in existing australian streamflow reconstructions table 1 and has the potential for extension to 2000 years roberts et al 2015 this proxy record is unique for hydroclimate studies where accurate event timing and high data resolution are needed and thus shows potential for future streamflow reconstruction in australia the streamflow reconstructions presented in table 1 are based on regression techniques these techniques may be suitable for rainfall reconstructions given that rainfall is directly linked with atmospheric and oceanic processes or for tree ring based streamflow reconstructions because tree growth is a response to local hydrologic conditions however for streamflow reconstructions using remote proxies regression techniques frequently ignore other processes affecting catchment water balance e g evapotranspiration soil moisture catchment storage vegetation topography groundwater recharge solander et al 2010 gallant and gergis 2011 saito et al 2015 an alternative option is to develop a hydrological model that uses proxy derived inputs to produce a streamflow reconstruction e g saito et al 2008 gray and mccabe 2010 solander et al 2010 saito et al 2015 this approach incorporates catchment processes into the streamflow reconstruction development for example gray and mccabe 2010 and saito et al 2015 reconstructed preinstrumental streamflow in two catchments in the western united states using conceptual hydrological models with tree ring derived precipitation and temperature as inputs however a drawback of this approach is the need to calibrate multiple model parameters e g four and six parameters in the case of gray and mccabe 2010 and saito et al 2015 respectively and the consequent assumption that optimised parameters remain valid over the reconstruction time period i e over multiple centuries a change in mean rainfall can reduce parameter transferability vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 and this issue is likely to magnify when using reconstructed rainfall as a model input where multiple regime shifts occur over the last 1000 years e g tozer et al 2016 the zero parameter non linear budyko 1974 curve provides another option for streamflow reconstruction widely used in the hydrological community the budyko curve is a simple water balance model that describes the partitioning of rainfall into streamflow and evapotranspiration zhang et al 2008 greve et al 2015 the budyko curve is used to model streamflow in australian catchments zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 but to our knowledge has not been used to reconstruct preinstrumental streamflow in eastern australia in this study we use the budyko 1974 curve and an associated single parameter milly s β curve for comparison milly 1993 discussed further in section 4 1 which require rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet inputs to reconstruct preinstrumental streamflow in the wr catchment given that a pet reconstruction is not presently available for the wr catchment we test two pet datasets annual average and annually varying over the instrumental period to determine the necessity in terms of developing a skilful streamflow reconstruction of reconstructing the pet variable we also assess differences in streamflow reconstruction using two australian gridded rainfall data products the scientific information for land owners silo database jeffrey et al 2001 and australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 section 3 1 in addition we produce a regression based reconstruction to compare with the budyko curve and milly s β curve methods to identify differences in the reconstruction methods this study represents a novel combination of ice core science paleoclimatology and catchment scale hydrology importantly the reconstruction provides context to the instrumental flow record and given that a rainfall reconstruction exists for the same catchment allows for investigation into the rainfall runoff relationship during the instrumental and preinstrumental records this information provides a better understanding of present infrastructure vulnerability in the context of past climate variability and allows the inference of climate variability impacts and change in water resources climate extremes flood drought and water security 2 the williams river catchment the wr catchment is a summer autumn rainfall dominated catchment located on the eastern seaboard of australia fig 1b a feature of the catchment is the grahamstown reservoir managed by the hunter water corporation hwc part of the conjunctive use headworks scheme for potable water supply in the newcastle region kiem and franks 2004 fig 1b the grahamstown reservoir catchment area is too small to maintain water levels in the reservoir and hence water is extracted from wr to supplement the reservoir various rules exist governing how much water can be extracted from wr and includes the need to maintain environmental flows and various water constraints one such rule is that no pumping is allowed unless streamflow volumes are above 130 ml day 1 kiem and franks 2004 hwc use streamflow recorded at gauge no 210010 fig 1b to determine when and how much water should be pumped into the reservoir kiem and franks 2004 therefore we reconstructed streamflow for this gauge for the catchment specific october september water year 3 model input data 3 1 rainfall data 3 1 1 instrumental period rainfall the wr catchment rainfall reconstruction presented in tozer et al 2016 was developed based on gridded rainfall from the australian water availability project awap jones et al 2009 gridded rainfall data from the scientific information for land owners silo database jeffrey et al 2001 is also commonly used in industry in australia and indeed is used by hwc for input into their water resources systems as such we use both the awap and silo rainfall data in this analysis both awap and silo products provide data resolution of 0 05 approximately 5 5 km and are based on interpolation of gauged rainfall data from australia s bureau of meteorology however awap and silo are produced using different interpolation techniques resulting in differences between the two products for rainfall magnitude frequency spatial variability and temporal variability see tozer et al 2012 for an in depth assessment of differences between and limitations of the awap and silo rainfall products data is available from 1900 and 1889 to present for awap and silo respectively however our comparative analysis ends in september 2009 different spatially integrated input rainfall datasets were tested within the budyko and milly s β curve approaches to determine both the suitability of the different models for simulating flow in the catchment and the most representative rainfall dataset to develop the 210010 catchment rainfall reconstructions the input rainfall datasets assessed were a 24 grid catchment average only grids within the catchment boundary a 58 grid catchment average grids that are both within the catchment and intersect the catchment boundary data extracted for the grid which encompasses the 210010 catchment centroid and data from a high quality rainfall gauge lavery et al 1997 within the catchment gauge 61017 the catchment average rainfall dataset developed from the specified grids located completely within the 210010 catchment boundary i e 24 grids gave improved skill metrics and hence improved flow simulation relative to other input rainfall datasets consequently results for the 24 grid rainfall dataset are presented here and results using the other three input rainfall datasets are presented in the supporting information table s1 3 1 2 reconstructed rainfall tozer et al 2016 reconstructed a 1013 year annual rainfall record for the wr catchment from an ice core record at law dome east antarctica law dome is a small independent icecap in coastal east antarctica just south of australia the reconstruction exploits a relationship between sea salt concentration in snow at law dome and rainfall in eastern australia identified in vance et al 2013 and vance et al 2015 the regions are linked by large scale climate processes in particular the el niño southern oscillation enso and associated interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo enso and ipo have been identified as direct influences of climate variability across eastern australia e g mcbride and nicholls 1983 kiem and franks 2001 kiem et al 2003 kiem and franks 2004 risbey et al 2009 cai et al 2012 cai and van rensch 2013 kiem and verdon kidd 2013 and also indirectly via their relationship with other climate processes such as the indian ocean dipole cai et al 2011 2012 southern annular mode lim et al 2013 and blocking i e mid high latitude processes e g pook et al 2009 enso variations extend to the mid to high latitudes and indeed there is evidence of an enso signature in climate records across antarctica holbrook and bindoff 1997 turner 2004 fogt and bromwich 2006 clem and fogt 2013 welhouse et al 2016 at law dome both enso and ipo signatures are identified in sea salt and snowfall accumulation rate records vance et al 2013 roberts et al 2015 vance et al 2015 more specifically sea salt variability recorded at law dome is related to surface wind speeds across the open ocean and is representative of large scale circulation in the mid latitudes of the indian and southwest pacific oceans souney et al 2002 goodwin et al 2004 van ommen and morgan 2010 vance et al 2013 the law dome summer sea salt record ldsss used here was dated using annual layer counting and known volcanic age ties having an absolute accuracy from 1807 to 2009 common era ce and 1 year error from 894 to 1807 ce plummer et al 2012 the 1 year error results from counting 1 year that had an ambiguous signal in some dating parameters and the non inclusion of another possible year that did not meet the criteria to qualify as an annual layer year curran et al 1998 palmer et al 2001 plummer et al 2012 this highly accurate dating over the last millennium allows for the clear dating of extreme events that are recorded in the hydroclimate reconstructions subsequently developed from the ldsss proxy record tozer et al 2016 reconstructed rainfall for each awap grid within the entire wr catchment fig 1b using linear regression for this study we have developed again using linear regression both awap and silo based reconstructions for the 210010 catchment 24 grids a calibration period of october 1900 to september 2009 was used based on the silo data available for this study the final reconstructions were scaled to have the same mean and standard deviation as the respective awap and silo datasets for the 1929 2009 analysis period in order to recover variance lost during regression and allow comparison with the instrumental record cook et al 2010 allen et al 2015b 3 2 potential evapotranspiration pet data daily pet data from the silo database jeffrey et al 2001 was used for the streamflow reconstruction as this is the dataset used by water management authorities in this region including hwc i e all hydrological reservoir models are calibrated to silo data meaning that at this point in time a reconstruction based on silo data is more practically useful than a reconstruction based on awap tozer et al 2012 also showed that where the spatial coverage of gauged data is reasonable as it is in the williams river that the silo product is closer to the gauged data than the awap product because the silo interpolation technique involves calibrating to the gauged data whereas awap does not the silo pet dataset is developed using morton s wet environment evapotranspiration algorithms vaze et al 2010 the pet data was averaged across the 210010 gauge catchment and aggregated to an annual time step two variations of the pet dataset were investigated an annually varying dataset and an annual average version calculated over the 1929 2009 period to match the availability of streamflow and rainfall data 3 3 streamflow data all available daily streamflow data 1 12 1927 present for gauge 210010 was obtained from the nsw office of water http realtimedata water nsw gov au water stm annual data october to september water year was aggregated from daily streamflow data nine years 1985 1988 1990 1992 1996 1998 2005 with missing daily data were removed from the october 1928 to september 2009 analysis period end date governed by the availability of rainfall data table 2 summarises the datasets used for the budyko milly s β and regression models 4 annual water balance model for the williams river catchment 4 1 budyko and budyko like curves eq 1 developed by budyko 1974 describes the relationship between the mean annual evaporative index ratio of catchment average actual evapotranspiration to rainfall and dryness index ratio of catchment average potential evapotranspiration to mean precipitation 1 aet p f pet p where aet mean actual evapotranspiration pet mean potential evapotranspiration p mean precipitation assuming water storage is negligible actual evapotranspiration aet is the difference between streamflow and precipitation and hence the model can be used to model mean annual streamflow koster and suarez 1999 the functional form of the budyko curve is given in eq 2 2 aet p pet p 1 exp pet p tanh p pet 1 2 for large values of the dryness index pet p the relationship approaches the water limit fig 2 where aet precipitation p and for low values the relationship approaches the energy limit where aet pet potter and zhang 2009 values of the dryness index greater than one indicate a more arid climate and values less than one indicate a humid climate jones et al 2012 beyond mean annual statistics various studies have shown that the budyko framework can be used to model interannual variability of streamflow e g koster and suarez 1999 zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 in this case a key assumption is that interannual variability in surface storage is smaller than interannual rainfall evapotranspiration and streamflow variability koster and suarez 1999 therefore the budyko curve is not optimal for modelling interannual streamflow in all catchments potter and zhang 2009 deviations from the budyko curve occur due to local catchment conditions like soil moisture vegetation catchment storage and topography e g donohue et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 jones et al 2012 greve et al 2015 as such other formulations based on the budyko curve have been derived and include one or more free parameters designed to account for local catchment conditions e g milly 1993 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 zhang et al 2004 one such derivation is the one parameter milly s β curve milly 1993 potter and zhang 2009 given in eq 3 the β parameter is said to represent the reciprocal of the standardised interstorm potential evapotranspiration milly 1993 3 aet p exp β pet p 1 1 exp β pet p 1 p pet potter and zhang 2009 showed that milly s β curve with a β value of 1 98 plotted in fig 2 was optimal relative to the budyko curve and other derivations for summer rainfall dominated catchments in australia fig 2 shows the observed mean and interannual based on silo data values of the evaporative and dryness indices for the 210010 catchment both curves provide a good match to the mean and interannual variables however their suitability for modelling 210010 streamflow needs further investigation 4 2 testing the suitability of budyko curves for simulating williams river streamflow annual streamflow for the 210010 gauge was simulated using both budyko s and milly s β curves with awap and silo gridded rainfall inputs 24 grids and the pet datasets to determine which inputs provide the best streamflow simulation and ultimately whether either model could adequately simulate 210010 streamflow model skill was measured via pearson correlation r and associated r2 metric and percent bias difference between total simulated flow and total gauged flow as a percent of gauged in addition we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency with logarithmic values lnnse eq 4 and kling gupta efficiency kge eq 5 measures logarithmically transforming the streamflow values as in the lnnse means that peak flows are flattened and low flows are given more influence krause et al 2005 this is important because the magnitudes of proxy based rainfall and streamflow reconstructions tend to have a high degree of uncertainty particularly in extreme wet periods e g prairie et al 2008 tozer et al 2016 and the traditional nse i e with untransformed flows overemphasises large flows because any deviations are squared criss and winston 2008 the kge is a more recently developed measure that overcomes inadequacies in the nse these inadequacies include using the observed mean as a baseline schaefli and gupta 2007 gupta et al 2009 and the fact that in order to maximise the nse the variability has to be underestimated gupta et al 2009 westerberg et al 2011 kling et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 the kge incorporates the same components of the nse i e the linear correlation r bias b and variability γ but separates their influence and provides a more robust indication of model skill gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 fowler et al 2016 we use the kge version presented in kling et al 2012 here bias is represented with b as opposed to β as it is presented in kling et al 2012 to avoid confusion with the milly s β parameter 4

presented in table 3 with plots provided in supporting information figs s1 s4 the β parameter was optimised through maximising the kge nse values are also presented for comparison the results indicate that both the a budyko and b milly s β models can skilfully simulate annual streamflow at gauge 210010 with high kge nse lnnse r and r2 values and low bias over the 1929 to 2009 analysis period milly s β provided slightly improved skill metrics the optimal β values for both silo β 2 14 and awap β 1 93 rainfall datasets fit well with the generic β value for summer rainfall dominated catchments identified in potter and zhang 2009 β 1 98 section 4 1 the consistency of the calibrated β parameter over different sub periods was also tested for the silo dataset the two periods 1929 1964 1965 2009 were selected as they include 36 years of data each noting that missing data is present in the latter half of record results are presented in table 3c for silo rainfall and silo average pet and show similarly good performance over both sub periods split sample calibration vaze et al 2012 for milly s β model was also undertaken whereby the model was calibrated to the first period and validated in the second and vice versa results were similar to those in table 3 and are presented in the supporting information table s2 in regards to the input datasets silo rainfall provides slightly improved skill metrics relative to awap rainfall for pet skill metrics were similar for annually varying and annual average pet input datasets which other authors have similarly found peel et al 2000 fowler 2002 oudin et al 2005 further discussion on the rainfall and pet input datasets is presented in section 4 3 4 3 streamflow reconstruction missing data in the gauged streamflow record see section 3 3 was infilled using flow simulated by milly s β model with silo rainfall and annually varying pet inputs calibrated to 1929 2009 this was undertaken because of the high skill of the milly s β model in simulating 210010 streamflow table 3b and so that a complete gauged streamflow record could be used for comparison with simulated flows particularly important when investigating non stationarity in the streamflow reconstruction skill the awap and silo rainfall reconstructions discussed in section 3 1 2 were used as the rainfall input for the budyko and milly s β models to reconstruct streamflow for the 1929 2009 period results for the budyko model are presented in table 4 a and show positive kge values and significant correlations between gauged and reconstructed flows using all input data options the negative lnnse and nse results are not desirable however given limitations in the calculation of the nse discussed in section 4 2 a negative value is not necessarily indicative of a poor model schaefli and gupta 2007 criss and winston 2008 especially when magnitude is not as important as the timing and duration of wet or dry epochs as is the case for river basins in general e g van dijk et al 2013 van loon 2015 some variability in the strength of the relationship between the budyko reconstructed streamflow and gauged streamflow as measured by 10 yr moving pearson correlation is evident fig 3 this is likely governed by non stationarity in the relationship between ldsss and rainfall in eastern australia which vance et al 2013 and vance et al 2015 suggest is related to the ipo whereby the link between the regions is strengthened in ipo positive phase due to a more meridional atmospheric pressure pattern relative to the ipo negative phase reconstruction skill over ipo phases for the budyko model was assessed table 4b and it is indeed evident that there is reduced skill in the negative ipo phase and an increase in skill in the second positive ipo phase and combined positive phases tozer et al 2016 noted however that this relationship is further complicated in the wr catchment due to the influence of east coast lows ecl intense storms that contribute around 25 of the region s annual rainfall these storms are thought to contribute to the nonstationarity in the relationship between ldsss and climate variability in the wr catchment and may also explain the reduced skill in the first positive ipo phase i e the clear ipo related variability in the ldsss rainfall link identified in vance et al 2013 and vance et al 2015 for southeast qld does not always hold for the wr catchment tozer et al 2016 this may also be compounded by the relatively short analysis period available for the first positive ipo phase 13 years compared with 19 years for other periods or issues with the gauged flow early in the record of importance is that while there is acknowledged nonstationarity in the link between law dome and the wr catchment the annual correlation remains greater than 0 23 during all phases the milly s β model was initially run with parameter values from the gauged data analysis table 3 however improvement in skill was found with calibrating directly to the reconstructions table 4c results using β values from the gauged data analysis are presented in table s3 in the supporting information the kge was again used as the objective function also shown are the results for a linear least squares regression model the regression based reconstruction was scaled to have the same mean and standard deviation as the streamflow data over the 1929 2009 analysis period hence the bias is 0 table 4f for the two input rainfall reconstructions table 4a the silo based reconstruction provided marginally improved statistics relative to the awap based reconstruction the correlation values r and consequently r2 determined for both reconstructions are very similar because the rainfall reconstructions account for the same amount of variability in the respective gridded rainfall they were developed from 11 5 and 11 8 of the annual awap and silo gridded datasets these results show that the accuracy of the 210010 streamflow reconstruction is not that sensitive to the gridded rainfall data product used a 2 increase in the gauged streamflow variability accounted for is observed for the models using the annually varying pet compared with average pet table 4a for budyko and table 4c for milly s β results annual rainfall variability is the primary driver of annual streamflow variability koster and suarez 1999 arora 2002 potter and zhang 2009 likely due to its high interannual variability relative to pet annual rainfall variability is typically 20 25 compared with 5 for pet peel et al 2000 nonetheless pet and local catchment characteristics like antecedent soil moisture storage conditions are important components of the water balance wooldridge et al 2001 and although based on these results one could conclude that average pet is adequate for modelling preinstrumental streamflow it is not clear whether the 5 interannual variability seen in the gauged pet record was greater in the past if interannual variability in pet was greater or different in the past this may change the influence of pet on the water balance and warrant the development of a pet reconstruction however a pet reconstruction would bring with it the typical uncertainties associated with the reconstruction process e g non stationarity in the relationship between the proxy and gauged climate variable gallant et al 2013 batehup et al 2015 and again it is unclear whether these uncertainties would be lower than uncertainties associated with using annual average values from the instrumental period and applying it back in time as such for the purposes of the study we use average pet to develop our streamflow reconstruction section 5 comparing the two models the milly s β models table 4c provided improved kge and bias statistics relative to the budyko models table 4a but poorer nse and lnnse results this is not unexpected given that the milly s β models were optimised relative to the kge and not the nse and lnnse clearer improvement in the streamflow reconstructions produced using milly s β model relative to budyko is seen in fig 4 a and b for silo rainfall where a closer match to gauged flows is evident particularly for high flow periods though it has only one parameter a potential limitation of using milly s β for reconstructing climate is the assumption of parameter stability over time as discussed in section 1 model parameters are sensitive to the climate during the calibration period saft et al 2016 which might affect their transferability outside of this period vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 kiem and franks 2004 showed for the wr catchment that rainfall and streamflow in ipo positive and negative phases are significantly different whereby higher lower and more less variable rainfall streamflow is recorded in ipo negative positive phase we confirmed these results using the annual 210010 streamflow and silo 24 grid average rainfall and results are presented in figs s7 and s8 and table s4 in the supporting information given the different climate regimes in the ipo phases we tested the transferability of the milly s β parameter by calibrating first to the ipo negative phase 1947 1975 and validating on the remaining data and then calibrating to ipo positive phases 1929 1941 1979 1997 and validating on the remaining data results are presented in table 4d and e firstly there is little variation in parameter values across the three calibration periods tested 1929 2009 ipo negative ipo positive skill metrics for the calibration to ipo negative table 4d and validating to the remainder of the data were generally reduced for the calibration period compared to validation particularly the nse and lnnse this is not surprising given the use of kge as the objective function as opposed to optimising the nse or lnnse that the nse is known to emphasise large flows section 4 2 and ipo negative is a particularly wet period and there is a reduced connection between law dome and eastern australia in ipo negative vance et al 2015 results for calibrating to ipo positive table 4e show improved metrics for the calibration period as one would expect relative to validation this suggests some issues with parameter transferability however this relates less to milly s β model and more to the variability in the strength of the relationship between ldsss and rainfall further discussed in tozer et al 2016 non stationarities in the proxy and gauged climate relationship is a concern for all proxy based climate reconstructions as mentioned above gallant et al 2013 batehup et al 2015 the regression budyko and milly s β model based reconstructions are similar fig 4a and b and have comparable skill metrics which again suggests that rainfall variability is the key driver of streamflow variability at this timeframe however the regression method provides a physically unrealistic streamflow reconstruction i e negative flows and this emphasises the importance of using a method for reconstructing streamflow that is both physically realistic i e able to account for non linearities inherent in converting rainfall to runoff and satisfactory in terms of performance statistics a comparison of reconstructions produced using awap rainfall are presented in figs s5 and s6 in the supporting information the results presented in section 4 3 show that a skilful streamflow reconstruction can be developed for the 210010 gauge using both budyko milly s β models with reconstructed rainfall derived from the ldsss proxy both awap and silo rainfall products are suitable as model inputs annually varying pet provides a slight increase in skill but reconstruction of this variable is associated with additional uncertainties which need to be weighed relative to the potential increase in reconstruction skill the hydrological modelling approach provides for a more physically realistic streamflow reconstruction relative to the linear regression approach reconstruction skill may be further improved with the addition of other proxies including those from the law dome ice core roberts et al 2015 new ice core records from other east antarctica sites vance et al 2016 and from other proxies within or near australia that are influenced by similar climate processes e g gallant and gergis 2011 palmer et al 2015 these are avenues for future research but it should also be acknowledged that inclusion of additional proxy information may not always improve reconstruction skill and can potentially introduce extra uncertainties to the reconstruction process due to inconsistencies in the climate signals represented in the individual proxies e g wilson et al 2010 vance et al 2017 5 millennial length streamflow reconstruction based on the above findings a 1013 year 1000 2012 ce streamflow reconstruction was developed for the 210010 gauge using milly s β model with β 1 88 with the silo based rainfall reconstruction and silo average pet inputs the reconstruction annual and 10 year smoothed is presented in fig 5 along with a timeseries of the 10 year running coefficient of variation cv calculated as the ratio of the running standard deviation to the long term mean for the 1929 2009 period as streamflow variability increases i e cv approaches 1 so too does the vulnerability of infrastructure mcmahon et al 2006 hence the ability to put instrumental period streamflow variability into a long term context is important fig 5 indicates several periods in the preinstrumental period that are characterised by high variability relative to the instrumental record particularly the late 1800s and 1300 1500s importantly fig 5 shows that 210010 streamflow oscillates between periods of low and high variability suggesting that infrastructure vulnerability similarly oscillates over time this indeed highlights the decadal to centennial scale cycles inherent in our climate e g power et al 1999 gallant et al 2013 and the need to look beyond our short instrumental period to fully understand current climate risks the reconstruction fig 5 shows long decadal and longer periods of above and below mean streamflow the duration of these periods are important in water resource management wet and dry epochs in the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions were determined based on eq 6 following tozer et al 2016 6 wet years where reconstruction mean 0 3 standard deviationdry years where reconstruction mean 0 3 standard deviation this threshold is designed to identify periods that are generally wet or generally dry even though some years within that period are slightly below or above the long term average e g one high streamflow year within a particularly dry period may not fill a reservoir the same wet dry epoch definition is used for rainfall and streamflow despite these variables having different annual distributions both in general and as also evident in the two reconstructions see fig s9 in supporting information the use of the same procedure allows us to assess the variability of wet dry epoch duration between the two variables which is important for determining lags in streamflow recovery and meteorological drought for example yang et al 2017 table 5 identifies wet and dry epochs of at least 5 years duration in the a gauged streamflow data b reconstructed streamflow data over the 1929 2009 period and c reconstructed streamflow over the full 1000 2012 year period firstly the wet and dry epochs identified in the reconstructed data table 5b are compared with those identified in the gauged data table 5a over the instrumental period importantly the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions both capture the major world war ii 1935 1942 and millennium 2002 2007 droughts verdon kidd and kiem 2009 some dry events identified in the gauged records are not captured in the reconstructions however there is some ambiguity in the 1991 2000 dry event whereby the gauged record provided partially falls within the wet epoch list the wet epochs are reasonably captured in both the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions acknowledging that the ldsss proxy is least accurate in extreme wet epochs tozer et al 2016 which no annually resolved proxy is likely to capture thus the rainfall and streamflow reconstructions adequately capture the duration of gauged wet and dry epochs which provides further validation beyond the skill metrics presented in table 4 for the use of the ldsss proxy in reconstructing eastern australian hydroclimate next the differences in epoch lengths in the streamflow and rainfall records are assessed to gain further insights into the rainfall runoff relationship during preinstrumental and instrumental periods in comparing the gauged streamflow record with gauged rainfall record table 5a it is apparent that differences exists between the number and length of epochs identified for example an additional dry epoch is identified in the gauged streamflow record 1957 1961 and a corresponding dry rainfall epoch is longer in the streamflow record i e 1979 1983 in the rainfall record compared with 1979 1987 in the streamflow record in the wet epochs there were no wet streamflow epochs that met the criteria of at least 5 years in length these results indicate that dry wet periods are longer shorter in the gauged rainfall than in the gauged streamflow record for the reconstructed data over the gauged period table 5b there are additional dry epochs in the streamflow record that are not present in the rainfall record though no differences are seen in wet epochs that are identified in the reconstructed rainfall and streamflow over the instrumental period assessing the reconstruction over the full 1000 2012 period table 5c further supports the trend identified above that is more dry epochs are present in the streamflow record relative to rainfall record 11 epochs of at least 5 years in the rainfall record and 16 in the streamflow record in addition longer epochs are present in the streamflow record relative to rainfall e g the longest epoch in streamflow record is 12 years 1193 1204 compared with 9 years in the rainfall record 1215 1223 and the 1193 1204 dry streamflow period is not identified as a dry epoch in the rainfall record given the large number of wet epochs of 5 years and greater identified only those greater than 10 years are presented in table 5c all epochs are provided in table s5 in the supporting information there are 58 5 year wet epochs identified in the rainfall record relative to 52 in the streamflow record supporting information furthermore several wet epochs are shorter in the streamflow record relative to the rainfall record for example the wet epoch commencing in 1539 is 21 years long in the rainfall record but only 18 years in the streamflow record and similarly the epoch commencing in 1452 is 12 years long in the rainfall record but not present in the reconstructed streamflow record table 5c because it is only 8 years long these results suggest that a long wet dry rainfall period will not necessarily translate to the same length wet dry period in streamflow despite rainfall variability being the primary driver of streamflow variability at the annual scale discussed in section 4 2 non linearity in the rainfall streamflow relationship is also influenced by pet and local catchment characteristics like antecedent soil moisture conditions as mentioned e g wooldridge et al 2001 saft et al 2015 yang et al 2017 and this has implications for interpreting rainfall proxies as indicators of water availability or water security these findings also highlight the importance of distinguishing between extreme rainfall and flooding e g johnson et al 2016 and the different types of drought e g meteorological hydrological agricultural droughts e g kiem et al 2016 when assessing impacts and looking to manage current and future hydroclimatic risks the results in table 5 also indicate that different centuries are dominated by different climate regimes and that the frequency of these epochs varies from century to century for example the 1100s to mid 1200s was a predominantly dry epoch along with the post 1900s period conversely the 1300s to late 1600s and 1800s were predominantly wet epochs this suggests that the reliance on statistics from one century e g the instrumental period as is the current practice will likely underestimate or at least misrepresent the true hydroclimatic risk in a given catchment or region tozer et al 2016 epoch duration is also presented as probability of exceedance curves for wet epochs fig 6 a and dry epochs fig 6b these figures both confirm the tendency for shorter longer duration wet dry epochs in the streamflow compared with the rainfall record discussed above importantly these figures show that wet dry epoch duration in the instrumental period is markedly shorter longer than wet dry epoch duration in the preinstrumental period for example statistics from the instrumental record suggest that for dry epochs fig 6b there is no chance of experiencing a dry period of longer than 8 years yet this is clearly possible when the preinstrumental record is considered similarly the statistics from the instrumental period suggest that there is no chance of experiencing a wet epoch longer than 10 years but the preinstrumental streamflow record suggest a probability of at least 15 fig 6a and that wet epochs up to 40 years duration are feasible this is a concern given that these extended periods of wet dry regimes are a major cause of suboptimal operations in water supply reservoirs turner and galelli 2016 in addition the long duration events observed in the preinstrumental period may have implications for pet and the meteorological variables that go into its estimation e g temperature humidity wind speed solar radiation and the assumption that average pet is adequate for modelling streamflow in the preinstrumental era though fowler 2002 identified comparable performance in a 13 year daily water balance model using a range of pet inputs from climatological pet to more sophisticated daily estimations and across extreme dry and wet periods it is not certain that these results can be extrapolated to the timeframe and annual resolution investigated here this needs further investigation but the outputs presented here i e the knowledge of when and for how long wet dry epochs occur will be useful in undertaking investigations into long term pet changes and their influence or not on streamflow variability 6 conclusions this study presents the use of the budyko framework to produce streamflow reconstructions as a means to overcome potential issues with regression and multi parameter hydrological modelling approaches the method presented and insights in regards to pet input data requirements are transferable to other catchments in australia and elsewhere in addition for the first time we have shown the utility of an ice core based proxy in producing a skilful millennial length and annually resolved streamflow reconstruction in an australian catchment interrogation of the streamflow reconstruction has shown that not only are longer dry wet periods present in the preinstrumental period relative to instrumental they are frequent where there is no probability of certain duration events occurring in the instrumental record this probability exists in the preinstrumental record there have been periods of higher streamflow variability in the preinstrumental which if similar occurred today relates to increased infrastructure vulnerability the dominant climate regime wet or dry changes from century to century wet dry epochs in the rainfall record are shorter longer in the streamflow record which highlights the need for specific reconstructions of water availability instead of inferring it from rainfall proxies our reliance on statistics from the instrumental period therefore means that our infrastructure design and management plans do not properly account for hydroclimatic risk in water catchments the streamflow reconstruction better captures the range of hydroclimatic variability possible and represents a more realistic baseline to quantify the impacts of climate variability and potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on water security the features identified in the reconstruction that are not evident in the instrumental period and which we are currently not equipped to deal with provide the first step to answering the call

7473,prediction of ground water level gwl is extremely important for sustainable use and management of ground water resource the motivations for this work is to understand the relationship between gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water change δtws data and gwl so that δtws could be used as a proxy measurement for gwl in our study we have selected five observation wells from different geographic regions in india the datasets are unevenly spaced time series data which restricts us from applying standard time series methodologies and therefore in order to model and predict gwl with the help of δtws we have built linear regression model lrm support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann comparative performances of lrm svr and ann have been evaluated with the help of correlation coefficient ρ and root mean square error rmse between the actual and fitted for training dataset or predicted for test dataset values of gwl it has been observed in our study that δtws is highly significant variable to model gwl and the amount of total variations in gwl that could be explained with the help of δtws varies from 36 48 to 74 28 0 3648 r 2 0 7428 we have found that for the model gwl δ tws for both training and test dataset performances of svr and ann are better than that of lrm in terms of ρ and rmse it also has been found in our study that with the inclusion of meteorological variables along with δtws as input parameters to model gwl the performance of svr improves and it performs better than ann these results imply that for modelling irregular time series gwl data δtws could be very useful keywords groundwater level prediction grace gravitational anomalies linear regression model support vector regression artificial

freshwater withdrawals and supplies around 36 42 and 27 of water for domestic agriculture and industrial purposes respectively taylor et al 2013 groundwater is a renewable resource and requires proper management demand for groundwater has been increasing due to various factors and efficient management is required to ensure long term supply of groundwater mays 2013 according to the alicante declaration resulted from international symposium on groundwater sustainability isgwas held in alicante spain from 23rd to 27th january 2006 availability of ground water depends on responsible use and governance current situation of ground water level gwl has been extremely alarming around the globe reduction of groundwater storage i e groundwater depletion has been considered as a global problem that threatens the sustainability of water supply mays 2013 for the time period of 1900 to 2008 the estimated depletion of global groundwater is 4500 km3 equivalent to 12 6 mm sea level rise and the maximum rate of depletion has occurred during the time period 2000 to 2008 with average rate of 145 km3 year equivalent to 0 4 mm year sea level rise konikow 1900 india is the largest groundwater user

groundwater overexploitation in india washington dc world bank 1 groundwater has been very important for india to maintain it s economy environment and standard of living as more than 60 of irrigated agriculture and 85 of drinking water supply depends on groundwater garduño et al 2011 rodell et al 2009 have shown in their study that in india during the period from august 2002 to october 2008 mean rate of groundwater depletion was 4 0 1 0 cm year equivalent height of water 17 7 4 5 km 3 year for rajasthan punjab haryana and delhi and the total groundwater depletion during this study period august 2002 to october 2008 for these regions was equivalent to 109 km 3 of water during the period of 30 years between 1980 and 2010 major areas of india have experienced substantial decline of groundwater level depth to water measured in terms of meters below ground level varying from 4 meters to 16 meters sekhri et al 2013 apart from irrigation urbanisation and climate change are major factors that affect groundwater storage mays 2013 garduño et al 2011 schewe et al 2014 islam et al 2012 slavkov et al 2013 teutschbein et al 2015 in the last decade india has observed considerable amount of declination in the groundwater level about 65 of wells in india have shown declination in groundwater level in january 2016 compared to decadal mean of groundwater level for january from 2006 to 2015 2 ground water scenario in india january 2016 central ground water board ministry of water resources government of india 2 gwl is measured in terms of depth to ground water from land surface and is a measurement from observation wells situated at spatially discrete points also gwl provides an idea about the water level but not the volume of it variations of terrestrial water storage δtws derived from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data has been used extensively by the researchers to understand groundwater storage conditions and trends with the help of it sun 2013 feng et al 2013 shamsudduha et al 2012 panda and wahr 2015 all reported δtws data are anomalies relative to 2004 2009 time mean baseline 3 source https grace jpl nasa gov data get

analysed the trends of groundwater depletion gwd and terrestrial water storage tws derived from grace satellite data on a global scale they have shown in their study that the highest gwd rates in the first decade of the 21st century occurred in india united states iran saudi arabia and china also they have found that the rate of global gwd has likely more than doubled since the period 1960 2000 chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 have studied impact of irrigation on groundwater by analysing groundwater storage and depletion trends with the help of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and the global land data assimilation systems gldas data in tamil nadu state india for the time period 2002 to 2012 they have used descriptive statistical analysis in their study panda and wahr 2015 have studied variations of terrestrial water storage δtws and ground water storage δgws data derived from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data for the period of january 2003 to may 2014 in india they have found that substantial gws depletion has taken place in the northern part of the country particularly at ganges basin and punjab state with depletion rates of 1 25 cm year 1 and 2 1 cm year 1 respectively as grace derived δtws requires adjustments for other components and involves errors due to statistical downscaling methodology rodell and famiglietti 2002 it is not an exact measurement for ground water storage also gwl is measured in terms of meters below ground level mbgl from the observation wells that are spatially distributed and are situated at discrete geographic locations whereas δtws is a continuous measurement in space therefore it is extremely important to study and understand the degree of correlation between δtws and gwl if we want to use δtws as a proxy measurement for gwl feng et al 2013 have used grace data to estimate changes in groundwater levels in north china region for the period 2003 to 2010 in the bengal basin of bangladesh

along with temperature and precipitation have also been used as explanatory variables in the literatures that we ve covered on groundwater research area we have not been able to find any study that focuses on the accuracy of δtws for measuring gwl in india and this serves as the primary motivation for this paper which is to establish the relationship between grace derived δtws and gwl measurements of observation wells for different geographic regions in india also we would like to compare the performances of different machine learning methodologies linear regression model lrm support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann both in terms of modelling and prediction of gwl with the help of δtws and other meteorological variables like temperature precipitation

we have selected five different sites table 1 from different geographic regions of india to study the relationship between gwl and δtws these sites have been selected widely apart in order to avoid any interrelation between the sites so that observations for each sites would be independent of each other coastal areas have been avoided as for coastal areas other meteorological factors like tide level could affect gwl yoon et al 2011 from central part of india we have selected mhow which is near indore most populous and the largest city of the state of madhya pradesh and is situated on the southern edge of the malwa plateau from the jashpur district of chhattisgarh we have selected kotba this region is hilly and contains forest area panitola from the tinsukia district of assam has been selected as another site this region is located at north east part of the country and includes several rivers and reserve forests this area is situated on brahmaputra river basin fig 1 we have selected sathamba as another site from the sabarkantha district of gujrat state and this area is located at the western part of india from the southern part of the country we have selected sirigeri

downloaded from water resources information system of india database 11 http www india wris nrsc gov in accessed on may27 2015 11 for the study period from january 2005 to december 2013 this well observation gwl data is available for four seasons across the year these seasons are post monsoon rabi january to march pre monsoon april to june monsoon july to september and post monsoon kharif october to december for observation sites this gwl data has not been available for all months of mentioned seasons of the year some of the sites have multiple observations in a season whereas some sites have only one observation in a season also this data is unevenly spaced in time i e time gaps between two consecutive observations are not equal the total number of observations also varies across sites and it ranges from 35 for sathamba to 67 for mhow the observed gwl data for all selected sites have been shown in fig 2 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace is a joint mission launched in march 2002 by nasa 12 national aeronautics and space administration 12 and dlr 13 german aerospace centre deutsches zentrum für luft und raumfahrt 13 the main objective of the mission has been to accurately measure earth s gravitational field for monthly intervals grace mission consists of two twin satellites 220 km apart from each other at 500 km altitude the distance between these twin satellites get affected due to spatio temporal variation of earth s gravitational field the on board k band microwave ranging systems measures this inter satellite distance this measurement associated with other ancillary data provides measurement of earth s gravity field the variations of this gravity field are mainly caused by changes in terrestrial water storage tws syed et al 2008

alldata tellus l3 gldas monthly netcdf 16 both grace δtws and gldas water content data are expressed in terms of equivalent liquid water thickness in cm as both grace δtws and gldas water content data are available for 1 resolution grid we have collected δtws and gldas water content data for the latitude and longitude grid that encompasses particular observation site for example for the site panitola latitude 27 49 north and longitude 95 26 east δtws and gldas water content data have been collected for the 1 resolution grid whose latitude covers from 26 5 north to 27 5 north and longitude covers from 94 5 east to 95 5 east also only for those months for which well observation data exists δtws and gldas water content data have been collected we have considered temperature both maximum and minimum precipitation wind and humidity as other meteorological covariates along with δtws to model gwl inclusion of wind and humidity as covariate to model and predict gwl is based on the assumption that these variables could impact groundwater demand which in turn may influence groundwater level for this purpose we have collected meteorological data from global weather data site 17 http globalweather tamu edu 17 these mentioned meteorological data have also been collected for the same 1 resolution grid used for grace δtws and gldas water content data to continue with earlier example for panitola latitude 27 49 north and longitude 95 26 east meteorological data have been collected for the 1 resolution grid whose latitude covers from 26 5 north to 27 5 north and longitude covers from 94 5 east to 95 5 east once collected for each meteorological covariate data is averaged out for all weather station data that resides within the mentioned 1 resolution grid like for panotola there exists 9 weather stations within the grid and data for all variables maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation wind and humidity have been averaged out for all 9 weather stations maximum and minimum temperature is measured in terms of celcius precipitation humidity and wind are measured in terms of millimetre mm fraction and meter s respectively we have considered the time period for the study from january 2005 to december 2013 for the purpose of processing grace δtws data and gldas water content data we have used ncview 18 http meteora ucsd edu pierce ncview home page html 18 software and r package ncdf4 19 https cran r project org web packages ncdf4 ncdf4 pdf 19 as both data files are in netcdf format 3 methodology we have collected gwl data for the selected sites and the data has not been available for all months in a year also the dataset is unevenly spaced time series data as the time gap between two consecutive data points are not same across the time period this restricts us from applying standard statistical methodology like time series analysis arma arima sarima etc which requires equal time gaps between two adjacent data points across the time period therefore we have used linear regression model lrm support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann in our study as all these methodologies could be applied on the available data without such restrictions also these methods have been widely employed in the previous literatures adamowski et al 2012 tiwari and adamowski 2013 mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 dall et al 2014 shamsudduha

index html 31 has also been used to build svr and ann models for all three methodologies used lrm svr and ann we have taken differences of gwl between two consecutive observations as output variable as primary input parameter we have considered differences of grace derived δtws between two consecutive observations other associated input parameters considered are maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation wind and humidity input variables and model structures have been discussed in details in the following section 4 model development 4 1 input variables model structure for all selected sites we have taken differences of gwl δtws and gldas water content between two consecutive observation this difference of gwl δtws and gldas water content between two consecutive observation represents the changes in gwl and corresponding changes in δtws and gldas water content we have considered these differences of gwl δtws and gldas water content to be included in the model as the changes in δtws and gldas water content should relate to the corresponding changes in gwl as shown in the table table 2 the model input for gwl δtws and gldas water content for an observation time t n are gwl t n gwl t n 1 tws t n tws t n 1 gldas t n gldas t n 1 respectively where gwl t n and gwl t n 1 are observed gwl for associated observation time t n and t n 1 similarly tws t n tws t n 1 are observed δtws for the observation time t n and t n 1 and gldas t n gldas t n 1 are observed gldas water content data for observation time t n and t n 1 from this point onwards gwl δtws and gldas water content would refer to the differences of gwl δtws and gldas water content between two consecutive observations as explained above it has been found that there exists very high level of correlation between δtws and gldas water content for all selected sites table 3 as δtws and gldas water content are highly correlated for all selected sites like previous studies rodell et al 2009 sun 2013 we also have not included gldas water content in our models gwl δtws gwl t n gwl t n 1 and tws t n tws t n 1 data for all observation sites have been shown in fig 2 in order to study the relationship between gwl and δtws we have built two sets of models in the first set of models we have used only δtws as the explanatory variable and gwl as dependent variable gwl δ tws to build linear regression model lrm support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann models for second set of models we have used meteorological variables maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation wind and humidity along with δtws as explanatory variables and gwl as dependent variable to build support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann models maximum temperature maxtemp minimum temperature mintemp wind wind and humidity humid values that have been used for an observation time t n in the svr and ann models are the average values of respective variables between the observation times t n and t n 1 whereas the value of precipitation prcpt used in the models for observation time t n is the total values of precipitation between two observation times t n and t n 1 in order to account the lag time between precipitation and its influence on groundwater level we have included precipitation values of previous time period precipitation with time lag 1 denoted by prcpt lag in the model i e while constructing the model for observation time t n we have included precipitation value for observation time t n 1 along with precipitation value for time t n due to limitation of the data precipitation with lag time more than 1 could not be added to the models thus with the inclusion of meteorological variables as explanatory covariates along with δtws the svr and ann models becomes gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid pcpt lag we have not built lrm for gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag as there exist high level of correlations among explanatory variables and that too is not consistent across selected sites all the data has been normalized before building the models in order to avoid saturation normalized value for a data point x of a variable is calculated as x normalized x x min x max x min where x min and x max are the minimum and maximum value of the variable for the entire dataset normalization would scale the values of the variables from 0 to 1 therefore after the development of the model all the fitted and predicted values for the dependent variable have been inverted using the mentioned equation while developing the linear regression models we have performed residual analysis that includes normality tests for standardized residuals to ensure robustness of the models svr models have been tuned for cost c error tolerance and kernel functions in order to improve the performance of the model similarly ann models have been tuned for hidden layer structure and activation functions 4 2 training test data set creation for each observation site we have created training and test data sets in 80 20 ratio all models lrm svr and ann for the two sets of model structures gwl δ tws and gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag have been trained and tested with same training and testing dataset 5 fold cross validation has been performed in order to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models 4 3 performance criteria we have noted r 2 value of the linear regression model gwl δ tws for all observation sites r 2 value is calculated as ssr ssto 20 where ssto is total sum of squares i e measurement of total variation ssto σ y i y 2 and ssr is regression sum of squares ssr σ y i y 2 y i y i and y are observaed values predicted or fitted values from regression and mean of observed values respectively r 2 value varies from 0 to 1 0 r 2 1 and it indicates the amount of variability in the dependent variable gwl that could be explained with the help of the model gwl δ tws in other words it indicates the importance of δtws to explain the variability in gwl high values of r 2 signifies that the fraction of variability of the dependent variable explained by the regression model is high correlation coefficient ρ has also been computed to study the degree of linear relationship between gwl and δtws to compare performances among different models lrm svr and ann we have considered correlation coefficient ρ and root mean square error rmse as performance indicators correlation coefficient ρ between fitted value and actual values for training dataset indicates fitness of the model and ρ between predicted and actual values for test dataset indicates prediction performance of the model correlation coefficient between two variables x and y is expressed as ρ x y cov x y σ x σ y where cov x y is the covariance between x and y and is expressed as e x e x y e y 32 e is the expectation function 32 and σ x and σ y are standard deviations of x and y respectively estimated statistics for ρ is calculated from the data of n observations as ρ 1 n σ i 1 n x i x i y i y i 1 n σ i 1 n x i x i 2 1 n σ i 1 n y i y i 2 where x i and y i are observation pairs of x and y respectively for ith observation also correlation test needs to be performed we have conducted pearson correlation test at 95 confidence interval to ensure existence of correlation between two variables the value of ρ varies from 0 to 1 where value 1 signifies perfect correlation 1 for perfect positive correlation and 1 for perfect negative correlation and value 0 indicates no correlation therefore a value of ρ close to 1 implies high degree of correlation between fitted and actual value for training set or between predicted and actual value for testing set in other words for training set if fitted and actual values predicted and actual values for testing set are very close the value of correlation coefficient would be high close to 1 indicating good fitness of the model for training set or good prediction performance for testing set root mean square error rmse is the measurement for deviations of fitted and predicted for training and testing set respectively from actual values mathematical expression of rmse is rmse 1 n σ i 1 n y i z i 2 where n is the number of elements in training or testing set y i and z i are the actual and fitted or predicted for training or testing set respectively values of the dependent variable for a perfectly fitted or predicted model all values of y i and z i are same rmse is 0 and it increases as the deviation between actual and fitted or predicted values of dependent variable increases therefore less value of rmse indicates high level of fitness and prediction for training and testing set respectively and high value of rmse indicates otherwise 5 results and discussions 5 1 r 2 and ρ values gwl and δtws for all our observation sites we have found that δtws is highly significant variable for gwl and the r 2 value of the linear regression model gwl δ tws varies from 0 3648 for mhow to 0 7428 for kotba as r 2 value explains the amount of variability in dependent variable gwl could be explained by independent variable δtws we can observe that the variability of gwl explained by δtws for selected observation sites varies from 36 48 for mhow to 74 28 for kotba it could be observed from table 4 that gwl and δtws is highly correlated and the ρ values between these two variables ranges from 0 6040 for mhow to 0 8619 for kotba negative values of ρ occurs because of the fact that increment in δtws would indicate rise in the groundwater storage causing decrement in the measurement of gwl as it is measured in terms of meters below ground level mbgl this negative correlation between gwl and δtws measurements could also be observed in fig 2 this observation of existence of strong correlation between gwl and δtws is consistent with previous studies shamsudduha et al 2012panda and wahr 2015 one of the possible reasons for low value of r 2 and ρ between gwl and δtws for mhow and sirigeri could be the presence of two large reservoirs namely indira sagar latitude 22 24 north and longitude 76 52 east and tungabhadra reservoir latitude 15 24 north and longitude 76 31 east respectively indira sagar reservoir is extremely close to the grace 1 degree resolution grid for mhow latitude 22 5 north to 23 5 north and longitude 75 5 east to 76 5 east and similarly tungabhadra reservoir is very close to the grace 1 degree resolution grid for sirigeri latitude 14 5 north to 15 5 north and longitude 76 5 east to 77 5 east water resource information system of india india wris 33 http www india wris nrsc gov in reservoirapp html 33 maintains and publishes reservoir level data for india and it has been observed from this india wris reservoir level data that during the time period of the study 2005 to 2013 indira sagar and tungabhadra reservoirs have experienced average yearly fluctuation defined in terms of range the difference between maximum and minimum values of 7 143bcm 34 bcm billion cubic meters 34 equivalent to 7 143 10 12 kg of water and 3 102bcm equivalent to 3 102 10 12 kg of water respectively refer to figs 3 and 4 these large variations of water mass in indira sagar and tungabhadra reservoir have not been accounted in the grace δtws data for the neighbouring grace 1 degree resolution grid for mhow and sirigeri respectively and thus could affect the relationship between gwl and δtws for these two sites 5 2 comparison of performance gwl δ tws as discussed in the earlier section for the first set of model gwl δ tws we have developed lrm svr and ann models and have performed comparative performance analysis w r t rmse and ρ for both test and train data sets please note that for all the tables mentioned below we have tabulated the values of performance indicators rmse ρ for all observation sites and methodologies lrm svr ann also we have mentioned their comparative rankings within first brackets and calculated average ranks of the methodologies have also been included for graphical representation of modelling actual and fitted values for training set and prediction actual and predicted values for test set performances among 3 methodologies lrm svr and ann we have shown data points of panitola site as an example see figs 5 and 6 for training data tables 6 7 in terms of both rmse and ρ though both svr and ann performs better that lrm for rmse average ranks of ann svr and lrm are 1 2 2 0 and 2 8 respectively and for ρ average ranks of ann svr and lrm are 1 4 1 8 and 2 8 there is no methodology that outperforms other two uniformly for all 5 observation sites in terms of both ρ and rmse for training set ann performs slightly better than svr with best ρ values for 3 observation sites and best rmse values for 4 observation sites in case of rmse for test data table 8 our observation is more or less similar to our findings for training data set for test set also again svr and ann average rank for both is 1 8 performs better than lrm average rank is 2 4 while comparing the values of ρ for test dataset table 9 we have observed that svr has outperforms ann and lrm with an average rank of 1 4 where the average ranks of ann and lrm are 1 8 and 2 8 respectively though for both the dataset we could observe that svr and ann performs better than lrm in terms of rmse and ρ there is not much significant difference in terms of absolute values of rmse and ρ for these three methodologies in other words performance of lrm is comparable with svr and ann as for small dataset size of the dataset varies from 35 to 67 across observation sites the generalization performance of simple linear models is better than complex nonlinear models like svr or ann mrch et al 1997 5 3 comparison of performance gwl δ tws meteorological variables for the second set of models we have included meteorological variables along with δtws to model and predict gwl as explained in previous section meteorological variables that we have included are maximum temperature maxtemp minimum temperature mintemp precipitation prcpt wind humidity humid and precipitation with 1 time lag prcpt lag we have developed ann and svr models with these input variables like previous section all tables include values of performance indicators rmse ρ for all observation sites and methodologies svr ann and comparative rankings have been mentioned within first brackets calculated average ranks of the methodologies have also been included as previous section panitola has been taken as a sample observation site for graphical representation of modelling actual and fitted values for training set and prediction actual and predicted values for test set performances between svr and ann see figs 7 and 8 in case of training data set tables 10 and 11 the performance of svr and ann are comparable as the average ranks of svr and ann are 1 6 and 1 4 respectively for both rmse and ρ for test data set tables 12 and 13 it could easily be observed that svr clearly outperforms ann in terms of both rmse and ρ for all observation sites in most cases both modelling and prediction performance of svr has improved significantly with inclusion of meteorological variables though this could not be concluded for ann due to it s inherent network structures as the network structures are different for two sets of models 5 4 summary conclusions finally to conclude we have observed in our study that δtws is a significant variable to model and predict gwl for the selected observation sites in india particularly for a small and irregular time series data like the data of our study δtws could be very useful for modelling gwl like previous studies conducted by rodell et al 2009 we also have found that gldas water content is not significant for ground water storage variations and have observed that it is highly correlated with δtws because of this reason similar to the attempt made by sun 2013 we have tried to model and predict gwl with the help of only δtws and other meteorological variables and have not included gldas water content as an input variable in our study for the selected observation sites it has been found that there exists a strong correlation between δtws and corresponding observation well measurement data for gwl table 5 0 8618768 ρ 0 6039772 and the amount of total variations in gwl that could be explained with the help of δtws varies from 36 48 to 74 28 table 4 0 3648 r 2 0 7428 we have found that in case of training data set for the model gwl δ tws calculated range of ρ values in our study varies from 0 6007 to 0 8622 for lrm from 0 6519 to 0 8505 for svr and from 0 6457 to 0 8639 for ann for the same training dataset the observed range of ρ values in our study varies from 0 7201 to 0 9571 for svr and from 0 8018 to 0 9837 for ann for the model gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag in case of test dataset calculated range of ρ values varies from 0 6277 to 0 8727 for lrm from 0 6416 to 0 9017 for svr and from 0 6577 to 0 8756 for ann for the model gwl δ tws for the model gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag calculated values of ρ varies from 0 7771 to 0 9182 for svr and from 0 7151 to 0 8930 for ann for the same test dataset this observed range of ρ values that we have found in our study is comparable with the reported ρ values in earlier studies conducted by sun 2013 also we have found in our study that for the purpose of modelling and predicting gwl with the inclusion of other meteorological variables svr along with δtws as explanatory variables svr performs more efficiently than ann and this finding is consistent with previous studies by yoon et al 2011 
7473,prediction of ground water level gwl is extremely important for sustainable use and management of ground water resource the motivations for this work is to understand the relationship between gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water change δtws data and gwl so that δtws could be used as a proxy measurement for gwl in our study we have selected five observation wells from different geographic regions in india the datasets are unevenly spaced time series data which restricts us from applying standard time series methodologies and therefore in order to model and predict gwl with the help of δtws we have built linear regression model lrm support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann comparative performances of lrm svr and ann have been evaluated with the help of correlation coefficient ρ and root mean square error rmse between the actual and fitted for training dataset or predicted for test dataset values of gwl it has been observed in our study that δtws is highly significant variable to model gwl and the amount of total variations in gwl that could be explained with the help of δtws varies from 36 48 to 74 28 0 3648 r 2 0 7428 we have found that for the model gwl δ tws for both training and test dataset performances of svr and ann are better than that of lrm in terms of ρ and rmse it also has been found in our study that with the inclusion of meteorological variables along with δtws as input parameters to model gwl the performance of svr improves and it performs better than ann these results imply that for modelling irregular time series gwl data δtws could be very useful keywords groundwater level prediction grace gravitational anomalies linear regression model support vector regression artificial

have studied variations of terrestrial water storage δtws and ground water storage δgws data derived from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data for the period of january 2003 to may 2014 in india they have found that substantial gws depletion has taken place in the northern part of the country particularly at ganges basin and punjab state with depletion rates of 1 25 cm year 1 and 2 1 cm year 1 respectively as grace derived δtws requires adjustments for other components and involves errors due to statistical downscaling methodology rodell and famiglietti 2002 it is not an exact measurement for ground water storage also gwl is measured in terms of meters below ground level mbgl from the observation wells that are spatially distributed and are situated at discrete geographic locations whereas δtws is a continuous measurement in space therefore it is extremely important to study and understand the degree of correlation between δtws and gwl if we want to use δtws as a proxy measurement for gwl feng et al 2013 have used grace data to estimate changes in groundwater levels in north china region for the period 2003 to 2010 in the bengal basin of bangladesh

we have selected five different sites table 1 from different geographic regions of india to study the relationship between gwl and δtws these sites have been selected widely apart in order to avoid any interrelation between the sites so that observations for each sites would be independent of each other coastal areas have been avoided as for coastal areas other meteorological factors like tide

are available for 1 resolution grid we have collected δtws and gldas water content data for the latitude and longitude grid that encompasses particular observation site for example for the site panitola latitude 27 49 north and longitude 95 26 east δtws and gldas water content data have been collected for the 1 resolution grid whose latitude covers from 26 5 north to 27 5 north and longitude covers from 94 5 east to 95 5 east also only for those months for which well observation data exists δtws and gldas water content data have been collected we have considered temperature both maximum and minimum precipitation wind and humidity as other meteorological covariates along with δtws to model gwl inclusion of wind and humidity as covariate to model and predict gwl is based on the assumption that these variables could impact groundwater demand which in turn may influence groundwater level for this purpose we have collected meteorological data from global weather data site 17 http globalweather tamu edu 17 these mentioned meteorological data have also been collected for the same 1 resolution grid used for grace δtws and gldas water content data to continue with earlier example for panitola latitude 27 49 north and longitude 95 26 east meteorological data have been collected for the 1 resolution grid whose latitude covers from 26 5 north to 27 5 north and longitude covers from 94 5 east to 95 5 east once collected for each meteorological covariate data is averaged out for all weather station data that resides within the mentioned 1 resolution grid like for panotola there exists 9 weather stations within the grid and data for all variables maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation wind and humidity have been averaged out for all 9 weather stations maximum and minimum temperature is measured in terms of celcius precipitation humidity and wind are measured in terms of millimetre mm fraction and meter s respectively we have considered the

page html 18 software and r package ncdf4 19 https cran r project org web packages ncdf4 ncdf4 pdf 19 as both data files are in netcdf format 3 methodology we have collected gwl data for the selected sites and the data has not been available for all months in a year also the dataset is unevenly spaced time series data as the time gap between two consecutive data points are not same across the time period this restricts us from applying standard statistical methodology like time series analysis arma arima sarima etc which requires equal time gaps between two adjacent data points across the time period therefore we have used linear regression model lrm support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann in our study as all these methodologies could be applied on the available data without such restrictions also these methods have been widely employed in the previous literatures adamowski et al 2012 tiwari and adamowski 2013 mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 dall et al 2014 shamsudduha

the goal is to find a hyperplane that separates different example classes with maximum margin and for support vector machine regression svr problem the goal is to construct a hyperplane that lies close to as many training data points as possible 21 from regression to classification in support vector machines by massimiliano pontil ryan rifkin and theodoros evgeniou 21 for a set of n examples of x k y k k 1 n x r m y r where x is an input vector with m components and y is the corresponding output value the svm estimator f on regression can be expressed as f x w ϕ x b where w is weight

neural network ann as it s name suggests artificial neural network is developed from biological nervous system input hidden and output layers with their nodes and activation functions are the basic

description and implementation details martin riedmiller technical report january 1994 26 are efficient and widely used algorithms to train an ann model for the purpose of building and verifying the lrm svr and ann models as described in the above sections we have used r software 27 https www r project org 27 and different r packages package nortest 28 https cran r project org web packages

regression and package neuralnet 30 https cran r project org web packages neuralnet neuralnet pdf 30 for artificial neural network modelling python package scikit learn 31 http scikit learn org stable index html 31 has also been used to build svr and ann models for all three methodologies used lrm svr and ann we have taken differences of gwl between two consecutive observations as output variable as primary input parameter we have considered differences of grace derived δtws between two consecutive observations other associated input parameters considered are maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation wind and humidity input variables and model structures have been discussed in details in the following section 4 model development 4 1 input variables model structure for all selected sites we have taken differences of gwl δtws and gldas water content between two consecutive observation this difference of gwl δtws and gldas water content between two consecutive observation represents the changes in gwl and corresponding changes in δtws and gldas water content we have considered these differences of gwl δtws and gldas water content to be included in the model as the changes in δtws and gldas water content should relate to the corresponding changes in gwl as shown in the table table 2 the model input for gwl δtws and gldas water content for an observation time t n are gwl t n gwl t n 1 tws t n tws t n 1 gldas t n gldas t n 1 respectively where gwl t n and gwl t n 1 are observed gwl for associated observation time t n and t n 1 similarly tws t n tws t n 1 are observed δtws for the observation time t n and t n 1 and gldas t n gldas t n 1 are observed gldas water content data for observation time t n and t n 1 from this point onwards gwl δtws and gldas water content would refer to the differences of gwl δtws and gldas water content between two consecutive observations as explained above it has been found that there exists very high level of correlation between δtws and gldas water content for all selected sites table 3 as δtws and gldas water content are highly correlated for all selected sites like previous studies rodell et al 2009 sun 2013 we also have not included gldas water content in our models gwl δtws gwl t n gwl t n 1 and tws t n tws t n 1 data for all observation sites have been shown in fig 2 in order to study the relationship between gwl and δtws we have built two sets of models in the first set of models we have used only δtws as the explanatory variable and gwl as dependent variable gwl δ tws to build linear regression model lrm support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann models for second set of models we have used meteorological variables maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation wind and humidity along with δtws as explanatory variables and gwl as dependent variable to build support vector regression svr and artificial neural network ann models maximum temperature maxtemp minimum temperature mintemp wind wind and humidity humid values that have been used for an observation time t n in the svr and ann models are the average values of respective variables between the observation times t n and t n 1 whereas the value of precipitation prcpt used in the models for observation time t n is the total values of precipitation between two observation times t n and t n 1 in order to account the lag time between precipitation and its influence on groundwater level we have included precipitation values of previous time period precipitation with time lag 1 denoted by prcpt lag in the model i e while constructing the model for observation time t n we have included precipitation value for observation time t n 1 along with precipitation value for time t n due to limitation of the data precipitation with lag time more than 1 could not be added to the models thus with the inclusion of meteorological variables as explanatory covariates along with δtws the svr and ann models becomes gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid pcpt lag we have not built lrm for gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag as there exist high level of correlations among explanatory variables and that too is not consistent across selected sites all the data has been normalized before building the models in order to avoid saturation normalized value for a data point x of a variable is calculated as x normalized x x min x max x min where x min and x max are the minimum and maximum value of the variable for the entire dataset normalization would scale the values of the variables from 0 to 1 therefore after the development of the model all the fitted and predicted values for the dependent variable have been inverted using the mentioned equation while developing the linear regression models we have performed residual analysis that includes normality tests for standardized residuals to ensure robustness of the models svr models have been tuned for cost c error tolerance and kernel functions in order to improve the performance of the model similarly ann models have been tuned for hidden layer structure and activation functions 4 2 training test data set creation for each observation site we have created training and test data sets in 80 20 ratio all models lrm svr and ann for the two sets of model structures gwl δ tws and gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag have been trained and tested with same training and testing dataset 5 fold cross validation has been performed in order to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models 4 3 performance criteria we have noted r 2 value of the linear regression model gwl δ tws for all observation sites r 2 value is calculated as ssr ssto 20 where ssto is total sum of squares i e measurement of total variation ssto σ y i y 2 and ssr is regression sum of squares ssr σ y i y 2 y i y i and y are observaed values predicted or fitted values from regression and mean of observed values respectively r 2 value varies from 0 to 1 0 r 2 1 and it indicates the amount of variability in the dependent variable gwl that could be explained with the help of the model gwl δ tws in other words it indicates the importance of δtws to explain the variability in gwl high values of r 2 signifies that the fraction of variability of the dependent variable explained by the regression model is high correlation coefficient ρ has also been computed to study the degree of linear relationship between gwl and δtws to compare performances among different models lrm svr and ann we have considered correlation coefficient ρ and root mean square error rmse as performance indicators correlation coefficient ρ between fitted value and actual values for training dataset indicates fitness of the model and ρ between predicted and actual values for test dataset indicates prediction performance of the model correlation coefficient between two variables x and y is expressed as ρ x y cov x y σ x σ y where cov x y is the covariance between x and y and is expressed as e x e x y e y 32 e is the expectation function 32 and σ x and σ y are standard deviations of x and y respectively estimated statistics for ρ is calculated from the data of n observations as ρ 1 n σ i 1 n x i x i y i y i 1 n σ i 1 n x i x i 2 1 n σ i 1 n y i y i 2 where x i and y i are observation pairs of x and y respectively for ith observation also correlation test needs to be performed we have conducted pearson correlation test at 95 confidence interval to ensure existence of correlation between two variables the value of ρ varies from 0 to 1 where value 1 signifies perfect correlation 1 for perfect positive correlation and 1 for perfect negative correlation and value 0 indicates no correlation therefore a value of ρ close to 1 implies high degree of correlation between fitted and actual value for training set or between predicted and actual value for testing set in other words for training set if fitted and actual values predicted and actual values for testing set are very close the value of correlation coefficient would be high close to 1 indicating good fitness of the model for training set or good prediction performance for testing set root mean square error rmse is the measurement for deviations of fitted and predicted for training and testing set respectively from actual values mathematical expression of rmse is rmse 1 n σ i 1 n y i z i 2 where n is the number of elements in training or testing set y i and z i are the actual and fitted or predicted for training or testing set respectively values of the dependent variable for a perfectly fitted or predicted model all values of y i and z i are same rmse is 0 and it increases as the deviation between actual and fitted or predicted values of dependent variable increases therefore less value of rmse indicates high level of fitness and prediction for training and testing set respectively and high value of rmse indicates otherwise 5 results and discussions 5 1 r 2 and ρ values gwl and δtws for all our observation sites we have found that δtws is highly significant variable for gwl and the r 2 value of the linear regression model gwl δ tws varies from 0 3648 for mhow to 0 7428 for kotba as r 2 value explains the amount of variability in dependent variable gwl could be explained by independent variable δtws we can observe that the variability of gwl explained by δtws for selected observation sites varies from 36 48 for mhow to 74 28 for kotba it could be observed from table 4 that gwl and δtws is highly correlated and the ρ values between these two variables ranges from 0 6040 for mhow to 0 8619 for kotba negative values of ρ occurs because of the fact that increment in δtws would indicate rise in the groundwater storage causing decrement in the measurement of gwl as it is measured in terms of meters below ground level mbgl this negative correlation between gwl and δtws measurements could also be observed in fig 2 this observation of existence of strong correlation between gwl and δtws is consistent with previous studies shamsudduha et al 2012panda and wahr 2015 one of the possible reasons for low value of r 2 and ρ between gwl and δtws for mhow and sirigeri could be the presence of two large reservoirs namely indira sagar latitude 22 24 north and longitude 76 52 east and tungabhadra reservoir latitude 15 24 north and longitude 76 31 east respectively indira sagar reservoir is extremely close to the grace 1 degree resolution grid for mhow latitude 22 5 north to 23 5 north and longitude 75 5 east to 76 5 east and similarly tungabhadra reservoir is very close to the grace 1 degree resolution grid for sirigeri latitude 14 5 north to 15 5 north and longitude 76 5 east to 77 5 east water resource information system of india india wris 33 http www india wris nrsc gov in reservoirapp html 33 maintains and publishes reservoir level data for india and it has been observed from this india wris reservoir level data that during the time period of the study 2005 to 2013 indira sagar and tungabhadra reservoirs have experienced average yearly fluctuation defined in terms of range the difference between maximum and minimum values of 7 143bcm 34 bcm billion cubic meters 34 equivalent to 7 143 10 12 kg of water and 3 102bcm equivalent to 3 102 10 12 kg of water respectively refer to figs 3 and 4 these large variations of water mass in indira sagar and tungabhadra reservoir have not been accounted in the grace δtws data for the neighbouring grace 1 degree resolution grid for mhow and sirigeri respectively and thus could affect the relationship between gwl and δtws for these two sites 5 2 comparison of performance gwl δ tws as discussed in the earlier section for the first set of model gwl δ tws we have developed lrm svr and ann models and have performed comparative performance analysis w r t rmse and ρ for both test and train data sets please note that for all the tables mentioned below we have tabulated the values of performance indicators rmse ρ for all observation sites and methodologies lrm svr ann also we have mentioned their comparative rankings within first brackets and calculated average ranks of the methodologies have also been included for graphical representation of modelling actual and fitted values for training set and prediction actual and predicted values for test set performances among 3 methodologies lrm svr and ann we have shown data points of panitola site as an example see figs 5 and 6 for training data tables 6 7 in terms of both rmse and ρ though both svr and ann performs better that lrm for rmse average ranks of ann svr and lrm are 1 2 2 0 and 2 8 respectively and for ρ average ranks of ann svr and lrm are 1 4 1 8 and 2 8 there is no methodology that outperforms other two uniformly for all 5 observation sites in terms of both ρ and rmse for training set ann performs slightly better than svr with best ρ values for 3 observation sites and best rmse values for 4 observation sites in case of rmse for test data table 8 our observation is more or less similar to our findings for training data set for test set also again svr and ann average rank for both is 1 8 performs better than lrm average rank is 2 4 while comparing the values of ρ for test dataset table 9 we have observed that svr has outperforms ann and lrm with an average rank of 1 4 where the average ranks of ann and lrm are 1 8 and 2 8 respectively though for both the dataset we could observe that svr and ann performs better than lrm in terms of rmse and ρ there is not much significant difference in terms of absolute values of rmse and ρ for these three methodologies in other words performance of lrm is comparable with svr and ann as for small dataset size of the dataset varies from 35 to 67 across observation sites the generalization performance of simple linear models is better than complex nonlinear models like svr or ann mrch et al 1997 5 3 comparison of performance gwl δ tws meteorological variables for the second set of models we have included meteorological variables along with δtws to model and predict gwl as explained in previous section meteorological variables that we have included are maximum temperature maxtemp minimum temperature mintemp precipitation prcpt wind humidity humid and precipitation with 1 time lag prcpt lag we have developed ann and svr models with these input variables like previous section all tables include values of performance indicators rmse ρ for all observation sites and methodologies svr ann and comparative rankings have been mentioned within first brackets calculated average ranks of the methodologies have also been included as previous section panitola has been taken as a sample observation site for graphical representation of modelling actual and fitted values for training set and prediction actual and predicted values for test set performances between svr and ann see figs 7 and 8 in case of training data set tables 10 and 11 the performance of svr and ann are comparable as the average ranks of svr and ann are 1 6 and 1 4 respectively for both rmse and ρ for test data set tables 12 and 13 it could easily be observed that svr clearly outperforms ann in terms of both rmse and ρ for all observation sites in most cases both modelling and prediction performance of svr has improved significantly with inclusion of meteorological variables though this could not be concluded for ann due to it s inherent network structures as the network structures are different for two sets of models 5 4 summary conclusions finally to conclude we have observed in our study that δtws is a significant variable to model and predict gwl for the selected observation sites in india particularly for a small and irregular time series data like the data of our study δtws could be very useful for modelling gwl like previous studies conducted by rodell et al 2009 we also have found that gldas water content is not significant for ground water storage variations and have observed that it is highly correlated with δtws because of this reason similar to the attempt made by sun 2013 we have tried to model and predict gwl with the help of only δtws and other meteorological variables and have not included gldas water content as an input variable in our study for the selected observation sites it has been found that there exists a strong correlation between δtws and corresponding observation well measurement data for gwl table 5 0 8618768 ρ 0 6039772 and the amount of total variations in gwl that could be explained with the help of δtws varies from 36 48 to 74 28 table 4 0 3648 r 2 0 7428 we have found that in case of training data set for the model gwl δ tws calculated range of ρ values in our study varies from 0 6007 to 0 8622 for lrm from 0 6519 to 0 8505 for svr and from 0 6457 to 0 8639 for ann for the same training dataset the observed range of ρ values in our study varies from 0 7201 to 0 9571 for svr and from 0 8018 to 0 9837 for ann for the model gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag in case of test dataset calculated range of ρ values varies from 0 6277 to 0 8727 for lrm from 0 6416 to 0 9017 for svr and from 0 6577 to 0 8756 for ann for the model gwl δ tws for the model gwl δ tws maxtemp mintemp prcpt wind humid prcpt lag calculated values of ρ varies from 0 7771 to 0 9182 for svr and from 0 7151 to 0 8930 for ann for the same test dataset this observed range of ρ values that we have found in our study is comparable with the reported ρ values in earlier studies conducted by sun 2013 also we have found in our study that for the purpose of modelling and predicting gwl with the inclusion of other meteorological variables svr along with δtws as explanatory variables svr performs more efficiently than ann and this finding is consistent with previous studies by yoon et al 2011 
7474,the major limitation of optimization models applied previously for rainwater harvesting rwh systems is the systematic evaluation of environmental and human health impacts across all the lifecycle

billion rmb yuan and 1 05e 16 mj respectively after the construction of optimal rwh system 14 7 of annual domestic water consumption and 78 5 of maximum daily rainfall would be supplied and controlled

worldwide face stress on urban water resource availability due to growing populations rapid urbanization and climate changes chao hsien et al 2015 ye et al 2018 these drives increase water scarcity stormwater runoff energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions schiermeier 2013 a large number of investments have been made to seek sustainable water resource and creative modeling tools for balancing considerations of increasing demands to provide reliable water supplies on this context rainwater has grown in popularity as an accessible water supply source with appropriate quality and adequate quantity li et al 2000 thomas and greene 1993 various approaches integrated rainwater harvesting rwh exist in developed and developing countries such as water sensitive urban design wsud in australia coombes et al 1999 coutts et al 2012 best management practices bmps and low impact development lid in usa der 1999 bhaskar et al 2016 the building research establishment environmental assessment method breeam and sustainable urban drainage systems suds in the uk breeam 2011 however so far rainwater has not been attached enough importance for utilization in china while in flood season rainwater runoffs sometimes becomes a severe issue due to water loggings in urban areas zhang et al 2012 xia 2013 in order to efficiently utilize rainwater as well as alleviate water logging problem the construction of rwh systems was taken into a high level by china government in the thirteenth five year plan the first technological instruction for rwh systems sponge cities construction technology guideline scctg was published in october 2014 which appealed cities being designed and developed as sponge cities through construction of reasonable rwh systems china housing and urban rural development 2014 the main objectives of sponge cities design and development included available water resource augmentation urban water logging disasters alleviation and rainfall runoff pollutants reduction sixteen cities selected as pilot sites have been carrying out a series of rwh projects but most of them are still in the stage of exploration and imitation zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2013 therefore how to construct rwh systems in a reasonable way is the key component of sponge cities design and development for the purpose of constructing rwh systems in an efficient and sustainable way quantity of studies have been developed recently such as rwh efficiency analysis silva et al 2015 karakocak et al 2013 rainfall runoff control zhang et al 2012 chen and adams 2007 rathnayake 2015a b rathnayake and tanyimboh 2015 and economic analysis of rwh systems liang and van dijk 2011 hatibu et al 2006 mushtaq et al 2007 our previous study li et al 2017 covered a multi objective model for optimizing the construction areas of green rooftops porous pavements and green lands in china considering the trade offs among daily rwh volume stormwater runoff control economic cost and environmental impacts the major limitation of the study was the environmental impacts assessment of rwh systems which only considered pollution reduction in the model other potential environmental impacts of rwh include acidification eutrophication global warming meanwhile human health impacts criteria pollutants from material selection and energy use and so on therefore how to systematically evaluate these environmental and human health impacts life cycle assessment lca has been widely used since its inception in the late 1960 s in diverse sectors to provide a quantitative environmental impacts analysis by using a cradle to grave approach hunt and franklin 1996 iso 2006 meyer and upadhyayula 2013 li et al 2016 use of lca to assess rwh systems is also increasing these years previous studies concentrated on residential small and large building systems findings varied by design parameters and data collection angrill et al 2011 applied lca to quantify the environmental impact of different rwh constructive solutions and determine the most environmentally favorable strategy in different scenarios under mediterranean climate conditions ghimire et al 2017 provided a comprehensive lca to assess the environmental and human health impacts of domestic and agricultural rwh for a representative u s watershed o sullivan et al 2015 used lca to evaluate three stormwater treatment systems i e a prefabricated concrete vortex unit a sub surface sandfilter and a raingarden under a functional unit of 35 m3 of stormwater runoff per event although understanding the life cycle implication of rwh systems is only in its infancy it is important for informing urban water management planning and decision making when considering the compromise among multiple objectives like water resource augmentation water logging disasters alleviation and environmental and human health impacts reduction ghimire et al 2017 this study as the follow up of our previous study to eliminate the limitation integrated lca for environmental assessment of rwh systems i e green rooftops porous brick pavements and concave green lands into multi objective optimization model for optimizing rwh construction areas in beijing of china considering the trade offs among daily rwh harvesting volume stormwater runoff control ratio economic cost environmental and human impacts the optimal solution was obtained through nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii and selected on the basis of water resource situations and rainfall characteristics the aims of this study are 1 to evaluate and compare the environmental and human impacts of three rwh systems through lca 2 to optimize the construction areas of three rwh systems in beijing for the purpose of water resource augmenting stormwater runoff control economic feasibility and environment friendly the in depth analysis of the results could provide scientific instructions for the regional stakeholders and policy makers to design more feasible and reasonable rwh systems and thus to improve sustainable rainwater management in cities 2 method 2 1 study area beijing was selected as the study area fig 1 it locates

than surrounding streets and ground considering soil parking layer sand and perforated pipe 2 2 2 goal and scope the objective of this study is to conduct lca of green rooftops porous pavements and green lands and then integrate lca into an optimization model for construction areas of the three rwh systems in beijing china the functional unit was the 10 000 m2 construction area of rwh systems the lca system boundary spanned cradle to gravel for 10 years covering the construction phase the operation and maintenance o m phase and end disposal phase fig 3 and table s1 the construction phase considered the environmental loads related to the production of materials for the realization of all the system components the transportation of materials from the manufacturing company to the site where the rwh systems situating and the production of equipment for system construction the o m phrase considered the production of replacement of materials and chemicals for the functioning of the systems in addition the consumption of energy was including all the phrases and considered as an input for rwh systems the pollution caused by the lifecycle of rwh systems consisted air pollution water pollution and other pollutions 2 2 3 inventory analysis the inventory analysis was basically conducted by obtaining the primary data and background data primary data collected on three rwh systems included design components table s1 while amount of material chemical and energy use which were directly collected from existing or planning plants in the regions and from some data in previous studies ghimire et al 2017 o sullivan et al 2015 ghimire et al 2017 morales pinzón et al 2015 no plants data in the lca model because only small ground cover grasses were typically included in beijing primarily for landscaping purposes it was possible that vegetation could reduce clogging and serve as biofilters le coustumer et al 2007 and lower co2 emissions through photosynthetic sequestration de sousa et al 2012 moore and hunt 2012 the background data were provided by the gabi database the lci results are provided in tables 1 and table 2 in supporting information 2 2 4 life cycle impact assessment the cml2001 model have been used as characterization methods morales pinzón et al 2015 silva et al 2013 the life cycle impact assessment lcia were divided into three categories i e resource depletion impact ecosystem impact and human health impact resource depletion indicators included abiotic depletion potential fossil adp fossil mj abiotic depletion potential elements adp elements kg sb eq ecosystem indicators included acidification potential ap kg so2 eq eutrophication potential ep kg po4 eq marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential maetp kg dcb eq freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential faetp kg dcb eq terrestrial ecotoxicity potential tetp kg dcb eq human health indicators included global warming potential gwp kg co2 eq human toxicity potential htp kg dcb eq photochemical oxidant creation potential pocp kg ethene eq ozone depletion potential odp kg r11 eq weighting factors for the calculation were obtained from gabi 6 0 software 2 3 multi objective optimization model a multi objective optimization model was established in this study for optimizing the construction areas of rwh systems based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii under physical constraints three urban rwh systems i e green rooftops porous pavements and concave green lands were selected as research objects which were recommended in previous studies and scctg in fact rwh systems involve the storage and distribution of rainwater besides collection they are not considered in the present study since the process of rainwater collection is the focus of this study and the applicability of rainwater is rather limited to ecosystem utilization and environment consumption 2 3 1 objective functions the multi objective optimization of rwh systems consisted of four objectives maximization of the harvesting volume of 24 h interval rainwater maximization of the stormwater runoff volume control ratio minimization of the rwh system cost and minimization of adp fossil value for environmental impact rwh volume included two categories 24 h interval rwh volume qr million m3 and rwh volume of maximum daily rainfall event qh million m3 the development of a model of rwh systems should be on a continuous daily rainfall time series for a minimum of 3 years and preferably 5 years therefore average daily rainfall data of 30 years 1981 2010 was used to calculate qr and maximum daily rainfall data 1981 2010 was used to calculate qh qr and qh can be expressed as 1 maxq r k 1 3 q k 10 3 2 q h k 1 3 q k 10 3 where qk is the harvesting volume of rainwater of green rooftops k 1 porous pavement k 2 and green lands k 3 respectively the specific calculation process were explained in supporting information the stormwater runoff volume control ratio r was determined to describe the control efficiency of stormwater runoff by the following function 3 max r 100 q h w where w million m3 was the potential total runoff volume the function of the third objective i e the economic cost ec billion rmb yuan was shown in eq 4 4 min e c k 1 3 ec k a k 10 3 t 1 m o kt 1 η t where eck rmb yuan m2 was the unit construction cost of each rwh system ak km2 was the construction areas of rwh systems a 1 for green rooftops a 2 for porous pavements and a 3 for green lands okt billion rmb yuan was the operation and maintenance cost occurring in year t of each rwh system η was the discounting rate and m was the evaluation period number of years according to the publication chinese economic evaluation parameters on construction 2006 the discount rate η used in china was 8 the evaluation period m was assumed to be 10 years liang and van dijk 2011 the function of adp fossil value for environmental impact ei mj was shown in eq 5 5 max ei k 1 3 ei adpk a k 100 where eiadp k was the adp fossil value of each rwh systems evaluated by lca model and the details about the environmental impacts were expressed in section 3 1 2 3 2 physical constraints the major constraint for the first two objectives was the precipitation volume while the objective of pollutants reduction depended on rwh volume the precipitation volume in this study was an input constant the precipitation data is available on http data cma cn site index html for a 30 year period 1981 2010 in addition the construction area of each rwh system played an important role in the calculation of this model according to the engineering technical code for rain utilization in building and sub district gb 50400 2006 and ministry of housing and urban rural development of beijing the construction area of green rooftops should be less than 20 35 of the gross building rooftops under construction and more than existing green rooftops beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2015 the construction area of porous pavements should be less than 20 30 of the urban trunk road and more than existing porous pavements referred from the ministry of transport of beijing the construction of the green lands should be less than the urban green lands and park construction planning and more than the existing green lands area according to china housing and urban rural development and the thirteen five year plan 2 3 3 multi objective optimization through nsga ii nsga ii is an effective method for multiobjective optimization developed by deb et al 2002 in nsga ii the concept of pareto dominance is used to rank the individuals control strategies of a population the implementing process of nsga ii follows the following pseudocodes randomly initialize the population p 0 of size n fast nondomination sorting on p 0 for every generation t select a parent population pp t from p t using a binary tournament selection create a child population pc t from pp t through crossover and mutation operators combine p t and pc t into an intermediate population pi t fast nondomination sorting on pi t place the best n individuals from pi t to p t 1 end loop 2 3 4 data the meteorological data i e precipitation and temperature data is available on http data cma cn site index html for a 30 year period 1981 2010 supplementary data were obtained from statistical reports beijing statistical yearbook scctg engineering technical code for rain utilization in building and sub district ministry of water resources ministry of housing and urban rural development and national bureau of statistics of china other model parameters were taken from previous studies table s2 the study sites parameters were listed in table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 lca performance analysis of rwh systems results of 11 indicators across all lifecycle stages i e construction o m and end disposal for each rwh system were detailed in table 1 adp fossil depletion ap and gwp of three rwh systems performed the largest impacts in each category resources depletion ecosystems and human health respectively impact to human health was related to the concrete materials used in construction directly impacting resource depletion resource depletion also contributed significantly to ecosystem damage while high adp fossil depletion was dominated from transportation of materials relative contribution from each stage construction o m and end disposal of rwh systems were not discussed in this study due to the focus of the total environmental and human impacts of each rwh system for optimization model in order to compare the environmental and human impacts among three rwh systems fig 4 and table 2 illustrated the standardization results of impact indicators using standardization factor from cml2001 nov 09 porous pavements had the highest values of environmental and human impacts followed by green rooftops except adp elements indicator the adp elements of green rooftops were eight times more than that of porous pavements due to the various materials required for multistory structure and strict construction standard for green rooftops the material categories of green rooftops were predominately compound materials such as ldep polyester nonwoven and renewable fiber while for porous pavements natural sand or soil were the major materials besides asphalt the human health impacts of green rooftops and porous pavements concentrated on the gwp htp and pocp whereas the value of odp was insignificant compared with others almost 7 order of magnitude lower lowest impacts of all categories were observed for the green lands with total contributions being less than half compared to green rooftops and even less for the porous pavements the material consumption of green lands focused on slag and gravel with low environmental impacts in addition green lands showed a beneficial function for water pollution treatment and regional climate adaption although the economic cost were the highest among three rwh systems table s2 adp fossil contributed more than 90 of the total environmental and human impacts fig 4 which could be explained by the consumption of polyester nonwoven for green rooftops and asphalt for porous pavements thus adp fossil was chosen as the representative impact factor in optimization model as a noticeable environmental indicator for rwh systems 3 2 optimization of rwh systems forty five pareto solutions were obtained for the multi objective model through nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii fig s1 and table s4 according to the severe situations of water scarcity and environment pollution in beijing water resource augmentation and minimization of environmental impact were considered as the external set of criteria therefore the solution no 20 was selected as the control strategy the corresponding qr r ec and ei were 238 80 million m3 78 5 66 68 billion rmb yuan and 1 05e 16 mj respectively the specific values of qr r ec and ei were listed in table s4 comparing the total optimal rwh construction areas in this study the data investigated in beijing and the previous study li et al 2017 fig 5 it was noticed that the construction percentage of green rooftops had been the least comparing with the percentages of other two rwh systems it provided the reality that green rooftops have not been widely constructed and generalized in beijing due to the defect of construction technology and the single selection of primary planting vegetation in other countries the u s for example there was a mature technology with advanced process for green rooftops construction ghimire et al 2017 in another word it was requested that the present construction technology of green rooftops should be promoted with the guarantee of no leaking problems happening and then selecting more proper planting vegetation to form a practical and sustainable rwh system moreover the construction areas of green lands obtained in this study and our previous study did not show an obvious distinction 393 6 km2 vs 392 5 km2 respectively it could be explained that the rwh capability of green lands was the strongest meanwhile the environmental impacts and production reduction value of green lands played a great role in the optimization model in detail adp fossil of green lands was the lowest in rwh systems in this study and the production reduction value of green lands was the largest in our previous study the optimal total green lands area was 393 6 km2 accounting 43 32 of the area of beijing city while the available green land area per capital was 19 69 m2 in this context comparing with the urban green land coverage ratio 44 48 and per capital green land area value 15 18 m2 requested in urban master plan of beijing 2004 2020 the government of beijing 2006 the optimal green lands area in this study completely satisfied the plan as for the construction areas of porous pavements from three data sources the gap between this study and previous study was larger than that between this study and data investigated porous pavements made a great contribution in water logging disaster alleviation r for 67 5 and pollutants reduction however they performed a huge adp fossil value table 1 and thus showed a less construction areas in this study furthermore rwh systems also contributed to temperature cooling effects and lands value enhancement as the annual average temperature in beijing reduced from 13 4 c in 2011 the first year rwh systems were constructed in beijing to 12 8 c in 2013 beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2015 according to the water consumption data from beijing water resources bulletin the total q r was equivalent to 14 7 of annual domestic water consumption it was suggested that rwh in beijing played a potential role to substitute to potable and non potable water consumption water logging disaster alleviation has been another objective for rwh system construction or sponge cities design porous pavements and green lands both performed a strong capacity in reduce the peak volume of stormwater runoff with a value of r for 67 5 of porous pavements and 89 7 of green lands for beijing 78 5 of maximum daily rainfall could be controlled after the construction of optimal rwh system areas as shown in eq 3 which would make a great contribution for water logging alleviation and reduction the loss of economy to the best of our knowledge economic consideration was becoming increasingly important for the introduction of market based mechanisms in environmental and water resources management thus ec should be attached great importance when design rwh systems the total economic cost of rwh systems in this study was much higher than the financial investment of beijing government for urban rwh systems to our knowledge efficient and reasonable utilization of rainwater was not a tentative project with the development of beijing city the demand of available water resource would become one of the most important challenges for sustainability of urban area it suggests that more and more financial investment would be put in with the increasing attention paid to rwh systems in beijing the total ei for adp fossil value of optimal rwh construction areas was 1 05e 16 mj porous pavements contributing 91 6 of the adp fossil following by green lands for 8 4 contribution this result could also express the less construction areas of porous pavements in this study the corresponding results of other environmental and human indicators were 4 70e 08 kg sb eq for adp elements as resource depletion impact 5 02e 11 kg so2 eq for ap 3 33e 10 for kg po4 eq for ep 7 12e 10 kg dcb eq for maetp 2 04e 11 kg dcb eq for faetp 1 32e 11 kg dcb eq for tetp as ecosystem impacts 9 97e 13 kg co2 eq for gwp 100 years 1 29e 13 kg dcb eq for htp 8 04e 10 kg ethene eq for pocp and 1 82e 03 kg r11 eq for odp as human health impacts over all green lands would be the first choice for water augmentation and logging alleviation rwh system in beijing and then green lands made a great contribution in daily rainwater harvesting for potable water utilization porous pavements played a great role in water logging alleviation but showed a low attention in this study due to the huge environmental and human health impacts 3 3 sensitivity analysis climate change was expected to change the volume and pattern of precipitation in order for a rwh system to be adapted to climate change it was argued that it should be able to perform at the same level under the future climate thus sensitivity analysis was carried out in response to 20 variance of 24 h interval average daily precipitation 20 variance of average daily maximum precipitation and 10 variance of average temperature to assess the robustness of the results in response to the climate variables such as temperature and precipitation fig 6 it could be found that the variance of daily maximum precipitation impact great for the results of rwh construction areas porous pavements showed a 36 positive change while green rooftops for 29 0 negative change at 20 variance of average daily maximum precipitation the changes of rwh systems under the variance of average daily precipitation and average temperature did not show obvious changes the change all below 10 it was implied that the variance of daily precipitation and temperature are not the domain factors for the performance of rwh systems in the future 4 conclusion this study integrated life cycle assessment lca method into a multi objective optimization model to optimize the construction areas of green lands porous pavements and green lands in beijing of china considering the trade offs among 24 h interval rwh volume qr stormwater runoff volume control ratio r economic cost ec and environmental impacts ei eleven life cycle impact indicators were assessed with a functional unit of 10 000 m2 of rwh construction areas the results showed that green lands performed the smallest value of all assessment indicators in contrast porous pavements showed the largest impact values except abiotic depletion potential adp elements based on the standardization results of all the impacts adp fossil was chosen as the representative indicator for the objective function calculation in multi objective optimization model due to its large value in all rwh systems lifecycle the optimization results for qr r ec and ei were 238 80 million m3 78 5 66 68 billion rmb yuan and 1 05e 16 mj respectively after the construction of optimal rwh system 14 7 of annual domestic water consumption and 78 5 of maximum daily rainfall would be supplied and controlled in beijing which would make a great contribution to reduce the stress of water scarcity and water logging problems green lands has been the first choice for rwh in beijing according to the capacity of rainwater harvesting and less environmental and human impacts porous pavements made a great contribution on water logging alleviation however did not show a large construction result due to the huge adp fossil across lifecycle sensitivity analysis revealed the daily maximum precipitation to be key factor for the

stormwater runoff energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions schiermeier 2013 a large number of investments have been made to seek sustainable water resource and creative modeling tools for balancing considerations of increasing demands to provide reliable water supplies on this context rainwater has grown in popularity as an accessible water supply source with appropriate quality and adequate quantity li et al 2000 thomas and greene 1993 various approaches integrated rainwater harvesting rwh exist in developed and developing countries such as water sensitive urban design wsud in

season rainwater runoffs sometimes becomes a severe issue due to water loggings in urban areas zhang et al 2012 xia 2013 in order to efficiently utilize rainwater as well as alleviate water logging problem the construction of rwh systems was taken into a high level by china government in the thirteenth five year plan the first technological instruction for rwh systems sponge cities construction technology guideline scctg was published in october 2014 which appealed cities being designed and developed as sponge cities through construction of reasonable rwh systems china housing and urban rural development 2014 the main objectives of sponge cities design and development included available water resource augmentation urban water logging disasters alleviation and rainfall runoff pollutants reduction sixteen cities selected as pilot sites have been carrying out a series of rwh projects but most of them are still in the stage of exploration and imitation zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2013 therefore how to construct rwh systems in a reasonable way is the key component of sponge cities design and development for the purpose of constructing rwh systems in an efficient and sustainable way quantity of studies have been developed recently such as rwh efficiency analysis silva et al 2015 karakocak et al 2013 rainfall runoff control zhang et al 2012 chen and adams 2007

objective model for optimizing the construction areas of green rooftops porous pavements and green lands in china considering the trade offs among daily rwh volume stormwater runoff control economic cost and environmental impacts the major limitation of the study was the environmental impacts assessment of rwh systems which only considered pollution reduction in the model other potential environmental impacts of rwh include acidification eutrophication global warming meanwhile human health impacts criteria pollutants from material selection and energy use and so on therefore how to systematically evaluate these environmental and human health impacts life cycle assessment lca has been widely used since its inception in the late 1960 s in diverse sectors to provide a quantitative environmental impacts analysis by using a cradle to grave approach hunt and franklin 1996 iso 2006 meyer and upadhyayula 2013 li et al 2016 use of lca to assess rwh systems is also increasing these years previous studies concentrated on residential small and large building systems findings varied by design parameters and data collection angrill et al 2011 applied lca to quantify the environmental impact of different rwh constructive solutions and determine the most environmentally favorable strategy in different scenarios under mediterranean climate conditions ghimire et al 2017 provided a comprehensive lca to assess the environmental and human health impacts of domestic and agricultural rwh for a representative u s watershed o sullivan et al 2015 used lca to evaluate three stormwater treatment systems i e a prefabricated concrete vortex unit a sub surface sandfilter and a raingarden under a functional unit of 35 m3 of stormwater runoff per event although understanding the life cycle implication of rwh systems is only in its infancy it is important for informing urban water management planning and decision making when considering the compromise among multiple objectives like water resource augmentation water logging disasters alleviation and environmental and human health impacts reduction ghimire et al 2017 this study as the follow up of our previous

optimal solution was obtained through nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii and selected on the basis of water resource situations and rainfall characteristics the aims of this study are 1 to evaluate and compare the environmental and human impacts of three rwh systems through lca 2 to optimize the construction areas of three rwh systems in beijing for the purpose of water resource augmenting stormwater runoff control economic feasibility and environment friendly the in depth analysis of the results could provide scientific instructions for the regional stakeholders and policy makers to design more feasible and reasonable rwh systems and thus to improve sustainable rainwater management in cities 2 method 2 1 study area beijing was selected as the study area fig 1 it locates

study and the applicability of rainwater is rather limited to ecosystem utilization and environment consumption 2 3 1 objective functions the multi objective optimization of rwh systems consisted of four objectives maximization of the harvesting volume of 24 h interval rainwater maximization of the stormwater runoff volume control ratio minimization of the rwh system cost and minimization of adp fossil value for environmental impact rwh volume included two categories 24 h interval rwh volume qr million m3 and rwh volume of maximum daily rainfall event qh million m3 the development of a model of rwh systems should be on a continuous daily rainfall time series for a minimum of 3 years and preferably 5 years therefore average daily rainfall data of 30 years 1981 2010 was used to calculate qr and maximum daily rainfall data 1981 2010 was used to calculate qh qr and qh can be expressed as 1 maxq r k 1 3 q k 10 3 2 q h k 1 3 q k 10 3 where qk is the harvesting volume of rainwater of green rooftops k 1 porous pavement k 2 and green lands k 3 respectively the specific calculation process were explained in supporting information the stormwater runoff volume control ratio r was determined to describe the control efficiency of stormwater runoff by the following function 3 max r 100 q h w where w million m3 was the potential total runoff volume the function of the third objective i e the economic cost ec billion rmb yuan was shown in eq 4 4 min e c k 1 3 ec k a k 10 3 t 1 m o kt 1 η t where eck rmb yuan m2 was the unit construction cost of each rwh system ak km2 was the construction areas of rwh systems a 1 for green rooftops a 2 for porous pavements and a 3 for green lands okt billion rmb yuan was the operation and maintenance cost occurring in year t of each rwh system η was the discounting rate and m was the evaluation period number of years according to the publication chinese economic evaluation parameters on construction 2006 the discount rate η used in china was 8 the evaluation period m was assumed to be 10 years liang and van dijk 2011 the function of adp fossil value for environmental impact ei mj was shown in eq 5 5 max ei k 1 3 ei adpk a k 100 where eiadp k was the adp fossil value of each rwh systems evaluated by lca model and the details about the environmental impacts were expressed in section 3 1 2 3 2 physical constraints the major constraint for the first two objectives was the precipitation volume while the objective of pollutants reduction depended on rwh volume the precipitation volume in this study was an input constant the precipitation data is available on http data cma cn site index html for a 30 year period 1981 2010 in addition the construction area of each rwh system played an important role in the calculation of this model according to the engineering technical code for rain utilization in building and sub district gb 50400 2006 and ministry of housing and urban rural development of beijing the construction area of green rooftops should be less than 20 35 of the gross building rooftops under construction and more than existing green rooftops beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2015 the construction area of porous pavements should be less than 20 30 of the urban trunk road and more than existing porous pavements referred from the ministry of transport of beijing the construction of the green lands should be less than the urban green lands and park construction planning and more than the existing green lands area according to china housing and urban rural development and the thirteen five year plan 2 3 3 multi objective optimization through nsga ii nsga ii is an effective method for multiobjective optimization developed by deb et al 2002 in nsga ii the concept of pareto dominance is used to rank the individuals control strategies of a population the implementing process of nsga ii follows the following pseudocodes randomly initialize the population p 0 of size n fast nondomination sorting on p 0 for every generation t select a parent population pp t from p t using a binary tournament selection create a child population pc t from pp t through crossover and mutation operators combine p t and pc t into an intermediate population pi t fast nondomination sorting on pi t place the best n individuals from pi t to p t 1 end loop 2 3 4 data the meteorological data i e precipitation and temperature data is available on http data cma cn site index html for a 30 year period 1981 2010 supplementary data were obtained from statistical reports beijing statistical yearbook scctg engineering technical code for rain utilization in building and sub district ministry of water resources ministry of housing and urban rural development and national bureau of statistics of china other model parameters were taken from previous studies table s2 the study sites parameters were listed in table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 lca performance analysis of rwh systems results of 11 indicators across all lifecycle stages i e construction o m and end disposal for each rwh system were detailed in table 1 adp fossil depletion ap and gwp of three rwh systems performed the largest impacts in each category resources depletion ecosystems and human health respectively impact to human health was related to the concrete materials used in construction directly impacting resource depletion resource depletion also contributed significantly to ecosystem damage while high adp fossil depletion was dominated from transportation of materials relative contribution from each stage construction o m and end disposal of rwh systems were not discussed in this study due to the focus of the total environmental and human impacts of each rwh system for optimization model in order to compare the environmental and human impacts among three rwh systems fig 4 and table 2 illustrated the standardization results of impact indicators using standardization factor from cml2001 nov 09 porous pavements had the highest values of environmental and human impacts followed by green rooftops except adp elements indicator the adp elements of green rooftops were eight times more than that of porous pavements due to the various materials required for multistory structure and strict construction standard for green rooftops the material categories of green rooftops were predominately compound materials such as ldep polyester nonwoven and renewable fiber while for porous pavements natural sand or soil were the major materials besides asphalt the human health impacts of green rooftops and porous pavements concentrated on the gwp htp and pocp whereas the value of odp was insignificant compared with others almost 7 order of magnitude lower lowest impacts of all categories were observed for the green lands with total contributions being less than half compared to green rooftops and even less for the porous pavements the material consumption of green lands focused on slag and gravel with low environmental impacts in addition green lands showed a beneficial function for water pollution treatment and regional climate adaption although the economic cost were the highest among three rwh systems table s2 adp fossil contributed more than 90 of the total environmental and human impacts fig 4 which could be explained by the consumption of polyester nonwoven for green rooftops and asphalt for porous pavements thus adp fossil was chosen as the representative impact factor in optimization model as a noticeable environmental indicator for rwh systems 3 2 optimization of rwh systems forty five pareto solutions were obtained for the multi objective model through nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii fig s1 and table s4 according to the severe situations of water scarcity and environment pollution in beijing water resource augmentation and minimization of environmental impact were considered as the external set of criteria therefore the solution no 20 was selected as the control strategy the corresponding qr r ec and ei were 238 80 million m3 78 5 66 68 billion rmb yuan and 1 05e 16 mj respectively the specific values of qr r ec and ei were listed in table s4 comparing the total optimal rwh construction areas in this study the data investigated in beijing and the previous study li et al 2017 fig 5 it was noticed that the construction percentage of green rooftops had been the least comparing with the percentages of other two rwh systems it provided the reality that green rooftops have not been widely constructed and generalized in beijing due to the defect of construction technology and the single selection of primary planting vegetation in other countries the u s for example there was a mature technology with advanced process for green rooftops construction ghimire et al 2017 in another word it was requested that the present construction technology of green rooftops should be promoted with the guarantee of no leaking problems happening and then selecting more proper planting vegetation to form a practical and sustainable rwh system moreover the construction areas of green lands obtained in this study and our previous study did not show an obvious distinction 393 6 km2 vs 392 5 km2 respectively it could be explained that the rwh capability of green lands was the strongest meanwhile the environmental impacts and production reduction value of green lands played a great role in the optimization model in detail adp fossil of green lands was the lowest in rwh systems in this study and the production reduction value of green lands was the largest in our previous study the optimal total green lands area was 393 6 km2 accounting 43 32 of the area of beijing city while the available green land area per capital was 19 69 m2 in this context comparing with the urban green land coverage ratio 44 48 and per capital green land area value 15 18 m2 requested in urban master plan of beijing 2004 2020 the government of beijing 2006 the optimal green lands area in this study completely satisfied the plan as for the construction areas of porous pavements from three data sources the gap between this study and previous study was larger than that between this study and data investigated porous pavements made a great contribution in water logging disaster alleviation r for 67 5 and pollutants reduction however they performed a huge adp fossil value table 1 and thus showed a less construction areas in this study furthermore rwh systems also contributed to temperature cooling effects and lands value enhancement as the annual average temperature in beijing reduced from 13 4 c in 2011 the first year rwh systems were constructed in beijing to 12 8 c in 2013 beijing municipal bureau of statistics 2015 according to the water consumption data from beijing water resources bulletin the total q r was equivalent to 14 7 of annual domestic water consumption it was suggested that rwh in beijing played a potential role to substitute to potable and non potable water consumption water logging disaster alleviation has been another objective for rwh system construction or sponge cities design porous pavements and green lands both performed a strong capacity in reduce the peak volume of stormwater runoff with a value of r for 67 5 of porous pavements and 89 7 of green lands for beijing 78 5 of maximum daily rainfall could be controlled after the construction of optimal rwh system areas as shown in eq 3 which would make a great contribution for water logging alleviation and reduction the loss of economy to the best of our knowledge economic consideration was becoming increasingly important for the introduction of market based mechanisms in environmental and water resources management thus ec should be attached great importance when design rwh systems the total economic cost of rwh systems in this study was much higher than the financial investment of beijing government for urban rwh systems to our knowledge efficient and reasonable utilization of rainwater was not a tentative project with the development of beijing city the demand of available water resource would become one of the most important challenges for sustainability of urban area it suggests that more and more financial investment would be put in with the increasing attention paid to rwh systems in beijing the total ei for adp fossil value of optimal rwh construction areas was 1 05e 16 mj porous pavements contributing 91 6 of the adp fossil following by green lands for 8 4 contribution this result could also express the less construction areas of porous pavements in this study the corresponding results of other environmental and human indicators were 4 70e 08 kg sb eq for adp elements as resource depletion impact 5 02e 11 kg so2 eq for ap 3 33e 10 for kg po4 eq for ep 7 12e 10 kg dcb eq for maetp 2 04e 11 kg dcb eq for faetp 1 32e 11 kg dcb eq for tetp as ecosystem impacts 9 97e 13 kg co2 eq for gwp 100 years 1 29e 13 kg dcb eq for htp 8 04e 10 kg ethene eq for pocp and 1 82e 03 kg r11 eq for odp as human health impacts over all green lands would be the first choice for water augmentation and logging alleviation rwh system in beijing and then green lands made a great contribution in daily rainwater harvesting for potable water utilization porous pavements played a great role in water logging alleviation but showed a low attention in this study due to the huge environmental and human health impacts 3 3 sensitivity analysis climate change was expected to change the volume and pattern of precipitation in order for a rwh system to be adapted to climate change it was argued that it should be able to perform at the same level under the future climate thus sensitivity analysis was carried out in response to 20 variance of 24 h interval average daily precipitation 20 variance of average daily maximum precipitation and 10 variance of average temperature to assess the robustness of the results in response to the climate variables such as temperature and precipitation fig 6 it could be found that the variance of daily maximum precipitation impact great for the results of rwh construction areas porous pavements showed a 36 positive change while green rooftops for 29 0 negative change at 20 variance of average daily maximum precipitation the changes of rwh systems under the variance of average daily precipitation and average temperature did not show obvious changes the change all below 10 it was implied that the variance of daily precipitation and temperature are not the domain factors for the performance of rwh systems in the future 4 conclusion this study integrated life cycle assessment lca method into a multi objective optimization model to optimize the construction areas of green lands porous pavements and green lands in beijing of china considering the trade offs among 24 h interval rwh volume qr stormwater runoff volume control ratio r economic cost ec and environmental impacts ei eleven life cycle impact indicators were assessed with a functional unit of 10 000 m2 of rwh construction areas the results showed that green lands performed the smallest value of all assessment indicators in contrast porous pavements showed the largest impact values except abiotic depletion potential adp elements based on the standardization results of all the impacts adp fossil was chosen as the representative indicator for the objective function calculation in multi objective optimization model due to its large value in all rwh systems lifecycle the optimization results for qr r ec and ei were 238 80 million m3 78 5 66 68 billion rmb yuan and 1 05e 16 mj respectively after the construction of optimal rwh system 14 7 of annual domestic water consumption and 78 5 of maximum daily rainfall would be supplied and controlled in beijing which would make a great contribution to reduce the stress of water scarcity and water logging problems green lands has been the first choice for rwh in beijing according to the capacity of rainwater harvesting and less environmental and human impacts porous pavements made a great contribution on water logging alleviation however did not show a large construction result due to the huge adp fossil across lifecycle sensitivity analysis revealed the daily maximum precipitation to be key factor for the robustness of the results for all three rwh systems acknowledgment this study is financially supported by the national key research and development plan no 2016yfc0401700 the foundation for innovative
