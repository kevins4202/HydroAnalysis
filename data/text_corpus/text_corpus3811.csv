stability 1 introduction population growth urbanization climate change drought and diminishing traditional potable water sources have driven many municipalities to consider using alternative water sources to meet future water demand gosling and arnell 2016 environmental protection agency 2012 one option for augmenting traditional water sources is to implement direct potable reuse dpr or advanced treatment of municipal sewage to achieve high quality water suitable for potable use advanced water treatment technologies typically applied for dpr include membrane filtration mf e g ultrafiltration reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation processes aops e g ozonation ultraviolet irradiation combined with hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide uv aop gerrity et al 2013 while these advanced treatment technologies have exhibited strong potential for removing emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals pharmaceuticals and personal care products their use also creates unique challenges kim et al 2007 wang et al 2016 watkinson et al 2007 ro for example can alter the corrosivity of water applegate 2017 gerrity et al 2013 to address this challenge as well as the limitation that wastewater reuse alone is likely insufficient to generate enough water to supply a municipality s potable water demand recycled wastewater may be blended with a traditional source water gerrity et al 2013 however little is known about how blending waters with such distinct water chemistries might impact biological stability and microbial water quality in distribution systems and premise plumbing advanced water purification awp such as mf ro and uv aop is likely to be extremely effective at reducing viable bacteria in dpr water but regrowth of bacteria can occur in distribution system pipes and premise plumbing if the processed water does not achieve sufficient biological stability chowdhury 2012 thayanukul et al 2013 the u s centers for disease control has identified opportunistic pathogens ops such as legionella as a leading source of waterborne disease outbreaks in the u s and called for awareness of the potential for water quality to degrade in pipe systems hvlasa et al 2011 yoder et al 2008 ops are known to thrive under the conditions typical of premise plumbing including high water age depleted disinfectant residual elevated water temperatures the presence of plumbing materials that react with disinfectant residuals or leach nutrients high surface area to volume ratios and highly variable water flow conditions that lead to long periods of stagnation falkinham 2015 rhoads et al 2016 concerns are also emerging regarding the potential to spread antibiotic resistance genes arg via non potable water reuse hong et al 2013 pruden 2014 though to the authors knowledge the presence of args in dpr water has never been studied because of its source secondary effluent is expected to have higher concentrations of antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args than is typical of most source waters thus implementing treatment schemes capable of removal of these contaminants is critical while awps have shown promise for removing such contaminants more effectively than traditional wastewater treatment in some studies snyder et al 2007 other studies have found that awps have failed to remove and in some cases even enriched certain args alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 yoon et al 2017 awps can also result in incomplete removal of antibiotics watkinson et al 2007 in some studies incomplete removal of arb and args during treatment creates potential for regrowth in distribution mains and or in premise plumbing before the water reaches the consumer s tap additionally horizontal gene transfer and uptake of extracellular args i e natural transformation could facilitate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance within pipe systems garner et al 2016b here we evaluated the impact of blending water source type and quality water treatment methods and blending ratio on bacterial regrowth potential in premise plumbing full scale wastewater treatment trains from each of four partner water utilities were supplemented with bench or pilot scale awp processes to achieve water quality suitable for potable use treatment varied for each utility to replicate the utilities current or anticipated treatment scenarios in some cases the reclaimed or purified reclaimed water was blended with raw surface water supplies and then subjected to a bench scale water treatment plant simulation in other cases a highly purified reclaimed water was blended with groundwater with no subsequent treatment blending was done with each municipality s potable source water at ratios ranging from 0 to 50 consistent with

rrna gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing of select samples was also conducted various biochemical indicators of microbial regrowth potential including biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc and biological activity reaction tests barts were also analyzed and compared this study provides valuable insight into potential microbial responses and public health concerns when introducing blended dpr water to distribution systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 rig design and operation simulated premise plumbing pipe rigs were constructed of polyvinylchloride pvc pipe with brass inserts to simulate the pvc pipe and brass plumbing fixtures that are commonly used in home plumbing while many homes use copper rather than pvc piping use of pvc provided an inert material to house the experiment while brass rods simulated lead containing plumbing fixtures that are susceptible to corrosion rigs were 1 5 m long with an inner diameter of 5 cm brass inserts were 46 cm long 1 3 cm in diameter and comprised of standard yellow brass that is nominally 60 copper 35 zinc and 3 lead forty pipe rigs were constructed and pre tested national sanitation foundation 2007 as described in the supplementary materials and methods test scenarios are summarized in table 1 dpr water was treated using pilot or bench scale treatment as described in the supplementary materials and methods premise plumbing operation was simulated by replacing 100 of the volume in each rig with stored treated water three times per week duplicate pipe rigs for each test scenario were incubated at room temperature 20 c during eight weeks of simulated operation poc and pou water was collected from the final two water changes during week eight in sterile one liter polypropylene containers for molecular analysis and in acid washed baked 250 milliliter amber glass bottles for carbon analysis at the conclusion of each eight week incubation biofilm samples were collected by swabbing once along the length of the brass insert with a sterile cotton tipped applicator the sample end of the swab was transferred directly to a sterile dna extraction lysing tube water samples 1 l for molecular analysis were filter concentrated immediately after collection onto 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate filters in pre packaged sterile filter funnels nalgene rochester ny filters were folded into quarters torn into 1 cm2 pieces using sterile forceps transferred to lysing tubes and frozen at 20 c dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals solon oh according to manufacturer instructions 2 2

billerica ma for dissolved organic carbon doc analysis bdoc was measured as previously described by servais et al 1989 with incubation time extended to 45 days as trial experiments using recycled water demonstrated that 30 days of incubation time was insufficient to reach stabilized organic carbon levels data not shown samples were analyzed on a sievers 5310c portable toc analyzer ge boulder

using local tertiary treated recycled water after subsequent biologically active filtration the concentration of each antibiotic that produced a 2 log reduction in plate count compared to the r2a agar without antibiotics was selected culturing was performed according to standard method 9215c apha 2005 briefly four ten fold serial dilutions of water sample were prepared and 0 1 milliliter of each

enterococci were cultured from week eight simulated poc and pou water samples using colilert and enterolert quantitrays idexx westbrook me bart tests hach loveland co were used to approximate the presence of active nitrifying denitrifying sulfate reducing acid producing slime producing and heterotrophic aerobic bacteria 2 4 quantitative polymerase chain reaction op gene markers and args were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr using previously published primers and thermocycler conditions table s1 the universal bacterial gene 16s rrna genes associated with three ops legionella spp mycobacterium spp p aeruginosa two args a quinolone resistance gene qnra and a vancomycin resistance gene vana along with the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 were quantified via qpcr reaction components are described in detail in the supplementary materials and methods prior to all analyses 16s rrna genes were quantified in a representative subset of samples diluted ten 20 50 and 100 fold as well as undiluted to identify the minimum concentration at which inhibition was negligible a ten fold dilution was selected and applied to all samples all qpcr runs included a triplicate negative control and triplicate standard curves consisting of ten fold serial dilutions ranging from 101 107 gene copies μl table s2 the loq for all genes was 10 gene copies per reaction 2 5 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics bacterial communities were profiled using gene amplicon sequencing with barcoded primers 515f 806r targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene caporaso et al 2012 triplicate pcr products were composited and 240 ng of each composite was combined and purified using a qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen valencia ca sequencing was conducted at the biocomplexity institute of virginia tech genomics sequencing center bi blacksburg va on an illumina miseq using a 250 cycle paired end protocol field filtration dna extraction blanks and a least one pcr blank per lane were included in the analysis shotgun metagenomic sequencing was conducted on the poc and week eight pou samples from each system on week eight pou water and biofilm samples from each source water and each 10 dpr blend scenario sequencing was conducted as previously described garner et al 2018b on an illumina hiseq 2500 with 100 cycle paired end reads at bi data analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic data was conducted as previously described garner et al 2018b with details provided in the supplementary materials and methods and tables s6 and s7 2 6 statistical analysis statistical differences between bdoc 16s rrna genes and hpc in samples were tested by tukey hsd in jmp v 13 for ops and args which were non normally distributed a kruskal wallis rank sum test with a posthoc pairwise wilcoxon test was performed in jmp spearman s rank correlation was used to test for correlations between bdoc and 16s rrna genes ops or args while a pearson product moment correlation was used to test for correlations between hpc and 16s rrna genes weighted unifrac distance matrices generated in qiime were imported to primer e version 6 1 13 for analysis of similarities anosim 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of regrowth in simulated premise plumbing rigs treated blends of dpr water and each utility s traditional potable water were incubated in pipe rigs to simulate water use in premise plumbing to examine regrowth of bacteria the blended waters treatment trains and blending ratios are summarized in table 1 16s rrna genes a proxy for total bacteria were measured at the simulated poc and pou following eight weeks of simulated use in the pipe rigs to examine regrowth of total bacteria fig 1 across conditions the abundance of 16srrna genes at the simulated pou was greater than at the poc paired wilcoxon p 0 0001 the most regrowth was observed in utility 1 scenarios utilizing 90 100 surface water i e treated potable water derived from surface water 2 7 4 2 log increase utility 4 s 100 groundwater scenario i e treated potable water derived from groundwater 3 19 log increase and utility 3 s 90 surface 10 tertiary blend 3 3 log increase only the 90 surface 10 awp condition from utility 3 did not result in regrowth of total bacteria 0 4 log decrease while all other scenarios produced between 0 2 and 2 0 log increase in 16s rrna genes thus most conditions stimulated regrowth of bacteria as expected but surprisingly it was sometimes the 100 traditional potable water that yielded the most regrowth suggesting that awp is capable of producing water that is more biologically stable than some potable source waters after treatment comparing within utility 2 and utility 3 scenarios there were no statistically significant differences in log increase in 16s rrna gene abundances in the simulated pou water samples collected from the different treatments and blends indicating that dpr scenarios did not produce more regrowth than the corresponding potable source waters wilcoxon p 0 2996 for utility 1 the dpr scenario with the greatest blend ratio 50 surface 50 awp resulted in more regrowth than the corresponding 90 surface 10 awp blend p 0 0490 but still produced less regrowth than the traditional potable source water alone p 0 1632 for utility 4 the 100 surface water and 100 groundwater scenarios also produced more regrowth than some of the dpr blends specifically the 90 groundwater 10 awp condition p 0 0404 the 90 surface 10 industrial awp blend produced an equivalent amount of regrowth as the corresponding potable source water p 0 426 biofilms are of interest given that they are thought to represent the primary reservoir for microbial regrowth in distribution systems liu et al 2014 though recent reports highlight that substantial regrowth can occur in the bulk phase too proctor et al 2016 while biofilms are dynamic environments previous research has demonstrated that a pseudo equilibrium state of biofilm growth was achieved after two to seven weeks in a simulated drinking water distribution system block et al 1993 batté et al 2003 thus samples were collected after eight weeks of rig incubation to sample biofilms that had likely reached or were approaching a stabilized biofilm growth rate in the present study there were no apparent effects of dpr blends on the biomass density of the biofilms after the eight week incubation fig 1 in the case of each of the four utilities the 16s rrna gene abundances in biofilms were not significantly greater in dpr blend scenarios than the corresponding source water scenarios p 0 0748 enumeration of 16s rrna genes by qpcr captures genes from both live and dead cells thus relative differences were compared above to estimate regrowth to compare the findings with a standard culture based method hpcs were also enumerated for a subset of scenarios table s4 16s rrna gene copy numbers and hpcs were found to be significantly correlated pearson r2 0 5127 p 0 0053 while substantial regrowth of total bacteria was noted for the majority of conditions neither hpc nor 16s rrna gene abundances indicated greater regrowth in any dpr scenarios than in the corresponding potable water condition these results are congruent with expectations based on available literature as regrowth of total bacteria via proxys such as hpc total coliforms and 16s rrna genes is well documented in traditional potable water distribution systems and premise plumbing lechevallier et al 1991 wang et al 2012 much less information is available regarding regrowth during distribution of reclaimed water though studies of non potable reclaimed water systems have similarly demonstrated substantial regrowth jjemba et al 2010 narahimhan et al 2005 e coli and enterococci were also cultured from the simulated poc and pou of each rig but no positives were detected this was consistent with the expectation that fecal indicators are expected to be removed by treatment and they do not typically regrow in relatively cool oligotrophic water systems which represent a very different environment than the mammalian gut and therefore are not generally subject to regrowth 3 2 microbial community composition of regrowth 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was carried out to gain insight into the kinds of bacteria subject to regrowth under the various scenarios notably the composition of the microbial community typically shifted during pipe rig incubation within each scenario the microbial community composition of simulated pou water samples were significantly different from poc samples anosim r 0 706 p 0 001 fig 2 also the composition of pou samples varied widely across utilities r 0 450 p 0 001 fig s2 and among scenarios within each utility r 0 430 p 0 001 figs s3 s6 within each scenario water and biofilm communities were not significantly different r 0 216 p 0 064 suggesting that there was interplay between the bulk water and biofilm under these stagnant pipe rig conditions leading to a high degree of similarity between the two matrices this contrasts previous studies of potable premise plumbing in which bulk water microbial communities were found to be largely unique compared to that of the corresponding biofilm ji et al 2017 liu et al 2014 which suggests that transfer between the water and biofilm phases was a key factor in the establishment of rig microbial communities while 16s rrna amplicon sequencing does not have the resolution to confirm the presence of pathogens it is possible to screen for phylogenetic groups known to contain pathogenic strains across scenarios of the actinobacteria present figs 2 93 belonged to the genus mycobacterium gammaproteobacteria primarily belonged to the nevskia acinetobacter and pseudomonas genera 44 17 and 10 respectively and no known enteric pathogens were observed which was consistent with fecal indicator monitoring noted above thus based on amplicon sequencing only a few potentially pathogenic groups were identified mycobacteria acinetobacter and pseudomonas all of which contain several non pathogenic strains as well the microbial community composition shifted markedly from the simulated poc to pou i e from the simulated treatment plant to the simulated tap with samples collected at the poc having a greater alpha diversity simpson 0 916 0 077 than the simulated pou 0 541 0 315 or biofilm samples 0 670 0 302 p 0 0006 this suggests that the conditions present in the premise plumbing rigs selected for bacteria well suited for regrowth rather than indiscriminately enriching all bacteria blended waters trended towards having a higher alpha diversity than potable waters at the poc 0 930 0 067 vs 0 882 0 097 as well as the simulated pou 0 582 0 320 vs 0 435 0 291 and biofilm 0 681 0 300 vs 0 646 0 323 though differences were not significant p 0 1526 3 3 regrowth of oppps while previous studies have examined the regrowth of ops in non potable reuse systems garner et al 2018a jjemba et al 2010 little is known about the potential for dpr waters to support regrowth of ops in distribution systems and premise plumbing the occurrence of ops at the simulated pou versus poc was explored quantitatively via qpcr targeting genes specific for legionella spp mycobacterium spp and p aeruginosa fig 1 in utility 1 scenarios there were no significant differences among scenarios for ops at the poc wilcoxon p 0 4533 or in the conditioned biofilm p 0 1859 there were no significant differences at the simulated pou in legionella spp levels for utility 1 scenarios p 0 1709 mycobacterium spp genes were more abundant in the 90 surface 10 o₃ bac scenario than the 90 surface 10 awp scenario p 0 0044 indicating that mf may offer benefits to limiting regrowth of this genus of bacteria compared to biofiltration the potable source water scenario resulted in more mycobacterium spp genes in the rig pou than either awp dpr blend condition p 0 0013 suggesting that blending the potable source water with highly treated dpr water actually offered benefits for limiting regrowth of mycobacteria spp while legionella spp genes were detected in all utility 2 rig pou samples there were no significant differences in abundance of the genes among these utility 2 treatment and blend ratio scenarios at the pou p 0 1047 or in the biofilm p 0 2453 in utility 3 scenarios legionella spp gene markers were not detected in any pou water or biofilm samples greater mycobacterium spp regrowth was observed in the 90 surface 10 o₃ bac and the 50 surface 50 o₃ bac pou water than in the potable source water pou p 0 0323 in the biofilm mycobacterium spp was detected in all reuse scenarios but concentrations were not significantly greater than scenarios where the gene was not detected p 0 2207 there were no op gene markers detected in any poc pou or biofilm samples from utility 4 scenarios p aeruginosa genes were not detected in poc pou or biofilm samples collected from any scenarios from any utilities thus the pseudomonas detected by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were likely non pathogenic strains when compared to traditional potable source waters dpr treatment schemes from utilities 1 2 and 4 all produced reuse waters that were successful at limiting regrowth of ops mf paired with uv aop appears to be a particularly promising treatment approach for limiting regrowth of ops as membrane filtered waters from utility 1 tended to harbor less regrowth than biofiltered waters when treatment approach alone was not sufficient to limit op regrowth selection of an optimal blend ratio appears to be a particularly promising approach for limiting regrowth as more regrowth was observed in greater blend ratios for some ops for example more legionella spp growth was observed in the 50 groundwater 50 awp scenario than the 90 groundwater 10 awp scenario for utility 2 and more mycobacterium spp regrowth was observed in the 50 surface 50 o3 bac scenario than the 90 surface 10 o3 bac for utility 3 previous studies have indicated that both legionella spp and mycobacterium spp are widespread in non potable reclaimed water at the pou fahrenfeld et al 2013 garner et al 2018a jjemba et al 2010 whiley et al 2015 highlighting the importance of identifying awp treatment approaches that can produce finished water that effectively limits regrowth of ops in distribution systems and premise plumbing though regrowth of ops has not been previously studied in dpr distribution systems or the associated premise plumbing results of this study indicate that awp is highly effective at producing biostable waters that do not support regrowth of ops the conditions in this study represent a worse than typical scenario for premise plumbing with long stagnation periods that are representative of lower use patterns than are expected in an inhabited residence with regular water use however further study examining the relevance of these trends in full scale systems over longer time periods in actual plumbing systems with smaller pipe diameters typical of premise plumbing and with more mature biofilms would be valuable notably some studies indicate that over six months of acclimation are required to approach a stable drinking water biofilm boe hansen et al 2002 3 4 occurrence of args while the presence of diverse args belonging to the antibiotic classes beta lactam glycopeptide macrolide sulfonamide tetracycline and quinolone among others have been previously documented in non potable reuse water distribution systems fahrenfeld et al 2013 garner et al 2018b to the authors knowledge this study is the first to examine the presence of args in dpr waters there are currently no standard methodologies for monitoring antibiotic resistance in water but it is becoming common practice to quantify a number of target args as conservative indicators for assessing potential for selection and spread of resistance in various aquatic reservoirs berendonk et al 2015 monitoring args provides a conservative indicator because while bacteria may be killed their dna carrying args still has the potential to be taken up by downstream bacteria here two args vana and qnra which encode resistance to critically important antibiotics vancomycin and quinolones respectively were quantified via qpcr the gene capture element inti1 was also measured as a broad indicator for anthropogenic influence and potential for horizontal transfer of multi antibiotic resistance fig 1 in utility 1 samples vana was widely detected but at sub quantifiable concentrations with the 90 surface 10 awp scenario yielding the only quantifiable occurrence fig 1 there were no significant differences between potable and dpr scenarios for vana concentration in either the pou water wilcoxon p 0 1709 or the biofilm p 0 4142 and qnra and inti1 were not detected in any biofilm samples in utility 2 samples args and inti1 were detected sporadically at sub quantifiable levels and there were no significant differences in arg abundance between potable and dpr scenarios for the pou water p 0 0764 or biofilm p 0 4795 for any of the genes for utility 3 scenarios inti1 and qnra were occasionally detected but not quantifiable there were no significant differences in gene abundances between potable and dpr scenarios for either gene in the pou water p 0 3816 or biofilm samples p 0 6171 no args were detected in any samples from utility 4 scenarios together these results are a promising preliminary indication that these highly treated dpr waters do not pose added risk in terms of producing waters enriched in args relative to traditional potable water or in proliferating args in the distribution system however this issue merits further monitoring particularly as more standardized tools for arg monitoring become available and over longer study periods a subset of samples representing the traditional potable source water and the 10 dpr blend of each scenario were subject to shotgun metagenomic sequencing with annotation against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database mcarthur et al 2013 to broadly profile args beyond those quantified by qpcr a large portion of the samples all samples from utility 2 and a subset from utilities 3 and 4 did not yield sufficient dna to conduct metagenomic sequencing limited recovery of dna from dpr samples was not unexpected as this is a common challenge for drinking water samples in general and premise plumbing in particular because of volume constraints representative of the condition of interest as little to no information is currently available about the occurrence of args in dpr water the metagenomic dataset that was produced provides valuable qualitative information regarding the dpr resistome of the scenarios that could be sequenced fig 3 annotation of shotgun metagenomic reads against card revealed a total of 212 different args detected across the dataset ranging from five to 94 different args per sample table s3 arg profiles varied strongly according to utility fig s1 anosim r 0 789 p 0 001 but did not vary as strongly by scenario within each utility r 0 307 p 0 012 multidrug trimethoprim and aminoglycoside resistance were abundant across all utilities while rifampin tetracycline and peptide resistance were notably abundant only in utility 4 samples overall the ten most abundant genes across the dataset included one trimethoprim resistance gene dfre two rifampin genes rbpa arr 1 one aminoglycoside gene aac 2 ib and five multidrug resistance genes mtra mdtb adeg ceob acrb mexf utility 4 samples were largely dominated by dfre mtra rbpa aaa 2 ib and arr 1 while utility 1 and 3 samples were dominated by dfre mdtb adeg ceob and acrb this strong grouping of args by utility in standardized premise plumbing rigs suggests that overarching factors such as geography and physicochemical and microbial characteristics of potable source water e g the original source of the vast majority of wastewater are likely to be critical determinants influencing the resistome i e all args present of dpr water the semi quantitative value of shotgun metagenomic sequencing is widely recognized and correspondingly data are often analyzed in terms of relative abundance e g normalized to total reads or 16s rrna genes to facilitate comparison among data sets of varying sequence depth as reported in fig s7 however relative abundance units are not suitable for monitoring or risk assessment purposes accordingly the more precise quantification of 16s rrna genes yielded by qpcr provided a means to convert gene copy 16s rrna gene copy units generated from metagenomics into more practical units of gene copy ml or swab fig 3 while it is important to recognize that factoring in an additional measured variable contributes to propagation of error recent studies have reported a strong correlation between gene targets measured independently by qpcr and metagenomic data converted to copies ml dai et al 2018 garner et al 2016a 2018a using this approach the total abundances of known args ranged from 1 5 to 6 5 log gene copies per milliliter in bulk water and from 3 7 to 6 0 log gene copies per biofilm swab in samples 3 5 regrowth of hpc bacteria capable of growth on antibiotic supplemented media while molecular methods are extremely powerful for detecting args in viable cells irrespective of their culturability molecular methods also capture dna from dead cells extracellular dna and dna incorporated into the biofilm in the form of extracellular polymeric substances to verify the presence of viable phenotypically resistant heterotrophic bacteria water samples were plated onto r2a media amended with antibiotics table s4 while comparing results across conditions can provide an indication of the potential for blending reuse waters with traditional source waters to increase growth on antibiotic supplemented media there are important limitations because r2a agar captures a variety of heterotrophic bacteria it is impossible to identify the minimum inhibitory concentration mic for each present species growth may not necessarily be indicative of resistance but rather intrinsic resistance for example some antibiotics are not effective against gram positive bacteria intermediate resistance or sub inhibitory antibiotic concentrations with these limitations in mind we compared hpc growth in the presence of a suite of antibiotics as further evidence to identify treatment schemes that potentially limit resistant strains or community shifts favoring species with inherent resistance or higher mics such an approach has been previously applied for drinking water xi et al 2009 of the 100 surface water and 50 surface 50 awp blend tested from utility 1 the 50 surface 50 awp blend consistently produced less hpcs capable of growth on media amended with antibiotics indicating that blending with highly treated awp water might have benefits for reducing microbial water quality problems in general particularly high levels of regrowth were noted from the 90 surface 10 awp blend on media amended with sulfamethoxazole 240 69 of total hpcs for rigs 1 and 2 respectively and vancomycin 65 258 utility 2 did not produce any quantifiable hpcs capable of growth on antibiotic amended hpc agar utility 3 s 100 surface condition did not produce any quantifiable hpcs at the poc or pou but regrowth of total and resistant hpcs occurred for both tertiary blends the 90 surface 10 tertiary blend rigs produced at least 1 8 log more total hpcs than the 95 surface 5 tertiary blend demonstrating that selection of the appropriate blend ratio can effectively control regrowth of hpcs in premise plumbing from utility 4 only the two potable waters 100 surface and 100 groundwater produced quantifiable hpcs capable of growth on antibiotic media notably both the vana vancomycin resistance gene and hpcs capable of growth on media amended with vancomycin were observed for the utility 1 90 surface 10 awp rig pou samples however hpcs capable of growth on media amended with ciprofloxacin a quinolone antibiotic were quantifiable for this scenario though the qnra quinolone resistance gene was not suggesting that inherent resistance may have contributed to these results again these results suggest that blending traditional potable source waters with highly treated reuse water can actually have benefits for limiting regrowth of total hpcs and hpcs capable of growth on antibiotic media 3 6 microbially influenced corrosion other nuisance bacteria may regrow during distribution that are of concern for maintaining water infrastructure and aesthetics and can indirectly cause health concerns bart tests were used to identify bacteria associated with microbially influenced corrosion following incubation in the pipe rigs table 2 heterotrophic aerobic bacteria were rarely detected and when they were present they were present at low abundances below approximately 7000 colony forming units cfu per milliliter sulfate reducing bacteria were detected in all utilities at abundances up to approximately 2 200 000 cfu per milliliter indicating that anaerobic conditions likely developed within rigs regardless of utility or scenario though dissolved oxygen was not measured in rigs so this cannot be confirmed acid producing bacteria were only detected at a quantifiable range in the 90 surface 10 tertiary blend from utility 3 indicating that overall these bacteria can be controlled by awp and selection of an appropriate blend ratio slime producing bacteria were ubiquitous but were particularly abundant in the 100 surface and tertiary blends of utility 3 while nitrifying bacteria were not detected in any samples denitrifying bacteria were notably abundant in the tertiary blends of utility 3 and all scenarios from utility 4 further suggesting that anaerobic conditions developed during simulated distribution the development of low dissolved oxygen conditions in premise plumbing is not uncommon and has been previously documented after elevated water age is reached in distribution systems masters et al 2015 especially in systems experiencing nitrification wilczak et al 1996 given that utilities 1 2 and 4 all use a chloramine residual nitrification is a particular concern given the availability of nitrogen via ammonia zhang et al 2009 while bacteria associated with microbially influenced corrosion are important because of their ability to contribute to corrosion of distribution system pipes and plumbing materials they can also be detrimental to water aesthetics sulfate reducing bacteria slime producing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria emerged as the primary concerns in the studied scenarios sulfate reducing bacteria can contribute to corrosion pitting and undesirable taste and odor problems such as the production of black slimes and rotten egg odor jacobs and edwards 2000 the elevated abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria under nearly all conditions suggests that dpr waters may be particularly susceptible to supporting the growth of these microorganisms slime producing bacteria are associated with the production of excessive biofilms and extracellular polymeric substances that can corrode metal pipes plug pipes and cause undesirable taste and odor and water cloudiness little et al 2007 denitrifying bacteria may be associated with increased ph corrosion of metal pipes and undesirable taste and odor masters et al 2015 given that sulfate reducing and denitrifying bacteria can grow only in anaerobic conditions distribution system operation will be critical for limiting growth of these organisms in full scale systems limiting stagnation and minimizing water age at the pou can aid in the prevention of redox conditions favorable to growth of these microorganisms masters et al 2015 additionally maintaining a disinfectant residual at the point of use can aid in control of these organisms and their undesirable consequences 3 7 water chemistry organic carbon is a critical nutrient supporting regrowth of microorganisms in treated water while toc and doc have long been used as proxies for the level of organic carbon in the water during distribution bdoc has been proposed as an alternative indicator that more accurately reflects the biodegradable fraction and overall biostability of water servais et al 1987 average toc in simulated poc samples for each scenario ranged from 50 7 to 5790 ppb average doc ranged from 4 5 to 5710 ppb and average bdoc ranged from sub quantifiable to 1850 ppb fig 4 previous studies that have found bdoc in reclaimed water to range from 400 to 6200 ppb jjemba et al 2010 and from 20 to 930 ppb in potable water charnock and kjønnø 2000 ribas et al 1991 with the exception of the 90 surface 10 awp and 100 o₃ bac conditions from utility 1 all other reuse scenarios fell below 930 ppb bdoc indicating that they are of comparable biostability to potable waters documented in the literature o3 bac appears particularly promising for reducing bdoc as the utility 1 90 surface 10 o3 bac treatment train resulted in less bdoc than the 90 surface 10 awp treatment p 0 0031 though blend ratio did not significantly affect bdoc concentrations for utility 1 scenarios utilizing biofiltration treatment the blend ratio did affect bdoc in membrane based treatment with the 90 surface 10 awp being greater than the 50 surface 50 awp scenario p 0 0034 of utility 2 and 4 scenarios no dpr treatment schemes produced bdoc concentrations greater than the respective potable scenario p 0 0998 of utility 3 scenarios both reuse schemes produced bdoc concentrations that were not significantly different from the finished condition p 0 1503 though the 100 surface condition produced by pilot scale treatment was greater than the bdoc concentration of the 100 finished condition produced by the full scale potable treatment plant p 0 0241 there were no significant positive correlations between bdoc and total bacteria as measured by 16s rrna genes or hpc or between bdoc and any op or arg gene markers for any of the utilities spearman p 0 2188 this result suggests that in this highly treated dpr water organic carbon is not the limiting nutrient determining biostability of finished water previous studies have demonstrated that in order for organic carbon to be the limiting nutrient constraining bacterial regrowth extremely low concentrations of below 10 ppb as assimilable organic carbon are required kooij 1992 williams et al 2015 residual disinfectant concentrations at the poc and after incubation at the simulated pou are presented in table s5 4 conclusions advancements in treatment technologies have facilitated the ability to produce high quality water from wastewater suitable for potable purposes yet prior to this work little was known about the biological stability of such dpr water this study simulated use of cold water premise plumbing where significant regrowth of ops is known to occur using blended dpr water from four u s water utilities produced by current and anticipated treatments to our knowledge this study represents the first such simulation and here we aimed to be comprehensive in the approach studying waters from four water utilities along with comprehensive culture and molecular based characterization of the resident microbial communities and factors influencing their regrowth results were compared to the regrowth observed for traditional potable water currently in use at the same utilities across tested treatment and blending scenarios total bacteria i e 16s rrna genes were more abundant at the pou than at the poc for both dpr blends and traditional potable water however there were no significant differences in the amount of regrowth observed of total bacteria legionella spp qnra vana or inti1 between awp or o3 bac treated dpr blends than in the corresponding potable water mycobacterium spp regrowth in dpr blends exceeded that observed in potable waters only for utility 3 which utilized o3 bac or tertiary treatment under such scenarios where the dpr water might have some potential to stimulate bacterial regrowth as appears to have been the case at utility 3 selection of an appropriate blend ratio appears to be a viable means of limiting regrowth the overall microbial community composition was unique at the pou compared to the poc with greater alpha diversity observed at the poc suggesting that simulated premise plumbing conditions selected for particular bacteria that were well suited for regrowth with the exception of utility 1 all awp o3 bac and tertiary treated waters had bdoc values that were not significantly greater than comparable traditional potable source waters of utility 1 scenarios o3 bac treatment reduced bdoc levels to be comparable to potable water concentrations while membrane based awp did not regrowth was observed for several microorganisms associated with microbially influenced corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria in particular grew in all conditions so control of these bacteria in dpr systems could present a critical challenge it is important to recognize however that this study was carried out over a short time period of only eight weeks which was aimed to capture key differences of the kinds of microbes expected to colonize proliferate and establish in cold water premise plumbing when dpr water is introduced given that microbial communities undergo extensive long term succession patterns additional longer term monitoring is recommended as dpr waters are integrated into potable water distribution systems further this work did not investigate regrowth of ops in hot water premise plumbing which would be worthy of future research focus given that warm water is generally more conducive to op growth additional research is also needed to determine the applicability of these findings for different levels of reclaimed water treatment and purification and blending ratios not tested herein acknowledgements we thank the

regrowth of total bacteria ops or args in premise plumbing graphical abstract image 1 keywords direct potable reuse opportunistic pathogens antibiotic resistance genes premise plumbing biological stability 1 introduction population growth urbanization climate change drought and diminishing traditional potable water sources have driven many municipalities to consider using alternative water sources to meet future water demand gosling and arnell 2016 environmental protection agency 2012 one option for augmenting traditional water sources is to implement direct potable reuse dpr or advanced treatment of municipal sewage to achieve high quality water suitable for potable use advanced water treatment technologies typically applied for dpr include membrane filtration mf e g ultrafiltration reverse osmosis ro and advanced oxidation processes aops e g ozonation ultraviolet irradiation combined with hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide uv aop gerrity et al 2013 while these advanced treatment technologies have exhibited strong potential for removing emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals pharmaceuticals and personal care products their use also creates unique challenges kim et al 2007 wang et al 2016 watkinson et al 2007 ro for example can alter the corrosivity of water applegate 2017 gerrity et al 2013 to address this challenge as well as the limitation that wastewater reuse alone is likely insufficient to generate enough water to supply a municipality s potable water demand recycled wastewater may be blended with a traditional source water gerrity et al 2013 however little is known about how blending waters with such distinct water chemistries might impact biological stability and microbial water quality in distribution systems and premise plumbing advanced water purification awp such as mf ro and uv aop is likely to be extremely effective at reducing viable bacteria in dpr water but regrowth of bacteria can occur in distribution system pipes and premise plumbing if the processed water does not achieve sufficient biological stability chowdhury 2012 thayanukul et al 2013 the u s centers for disease control has identified opportunistic pathogens ops such as legionella as a leading source of waterborne disease outbreaks in the u s and called for awareness of the potential for water quality to degrade in pipe systems hvlasa et al 2011 yoder et al 2008 ops are known to thrive under the conditions typical of premise plumbing including high water age depleted disinfectant residual elevated water temperatures the presence of plumbing materials that react with disinfectant residuals or leach nutrients high surface area to volume ratios and highly variable water flow conditions that lead to long periods of stagnation falkinham 2015 rhoads et al 2016 concerns are also emerging regarding the potential to spread antibiotic resistance genes arg via non potable water reuse hong et al 2013 pruden 2014 though to the authors knowledge the presence of args in dpr water has never been studied because of its source secondary effluent is expected to have higher concentrations of antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args than is typical of most source waters thus implementing treatment schemes capable of removal of these contaminants is critical while awps have shown promise for removing such contaminants more effectively than traditional wastewater treatment in some studies snyder et al 2007 other studies have found that awps have failed to remove and in some cases even enriched certain args alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 yoon et al 2017 awps can also result in incomplete removal of antibiotics watkinson et al 2007 in some studies incomplete removal of arb and args during treatment creates potential for regrowth in distribution mains and or in premise plumbing before the water reaches the consumer s tap additionally horizontal gene transfer and uptake of extracellular args i e natural transformation could facilitate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance within pipe systems garner et al 2016b here we evaluated the impact of blending water source type and quality water treatment methods and blending ratio on bacterial regrowth potential in premise plumbing full scale wastewater treatment trains from each of four partner water utilities were supplemented with bench or pilot scale awp processes to achieve water quality suitable for potable use treatment varied for each utility to replicate the utilities current or anticipated treatment

introducing blended dpr water to distribution systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 rig design and operation simulated premise plumbing pipe rigs were constructed of polyvinylchloride pvc pipe with brass inserts to simulate the pvc pipe and brass plumbing fixtures that are commonly used in home plumbing while many homes use copper rather than pvc piping use of pvc provided an inert material to house the experiment while brass rods simulated lead containing plumbing fixtures that are susceptible to corrosion rigs were 1 5 m long with an inner diameter of 5 cm brass inserts were 46 cm long 1 3 cm in diameter and comprised of standard yellow brass that is nominally 60 copper 35 zinc and 3 lead forty pipe rigs were constructed and pre tested national sanitation foundation 2007 as described in the supplementary materials and methods test scenarios are summarized in table 1 dpr water was treated using pilot or bench scale treatment as described in the supplementary materials and methods premise plumbing operation was simulated by replacing 100 of the volume in each rig with stored treated water three times per week duplicate pipe rigs for each test scenario were incubated at room

legionella spp mycobacterium spp p aeruginosa two args a quinolone resistance gene qnra and a vancomycin resistance gene vana along with the class 1 integron integrase gene inti1 were quantified via qpcr reaction components are described in detail in the supplementary materials and methods prior to all analyses 16s rrna genes were quantified in a representative subset of samples diluted ten 20 50 and 100 fold as well as undiluted to identify the minimum concentration at which inhibition was negligible a ten fold dilution was selected and applied to all samples all qpcr runs included a triplicate negative control and triplicate standard curves consisting of ten fold serial dilutions ranging from 101 107 gene copies μl table s2 the loq for all genes was 10 gene copies per reaction 2

analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic data was conducted as previously described garner et al 2018b with details provided in the supplementary materials and methods and tables s6 and s7 2 6 statistical analysis statistical differences between bdoc 16s rrna genes and hpc in samples were tested by tukey hsd in jmp v 13 for ops and args which were non normally distributed a kruskal wallis rank sum test with a posthoc pairwise wilcoxon test was performed in jmp spearman s rank correlation was used to test for correlations between bdoc and 16s rrna genes ops

version 6 1 13 for analysis of similarities anosim 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of regrowth in simulated premise plumbing rigs treated blends of dpr water and each utility s traditional potable water were incubated in pipe rigs to simulate water use in premise plumbing to examine regrowth of bacteria the blended waters treatment trains and blending ratios are summarized in table 1 16s rrna genes a proxy for total bacteria were measured at the simulated poc and pou following eight weeks of simulated use in the pipe rigs to examine regrowth of total bacteria fig 1 across conditions the abundance of 16srrna genes at the simulated pou was greater than at the poc paired wilcoxon p 0 0001 the most regrowth was observed in utility 1 scenarios utilizing 90 100 surface water i e treated potable water derived from surface water 2 7 4 2 log increase utility 4 s 100 groundwater scenario i e treated potable water derived from groundwater 3 19 log increase and utility 3 s 90 surface 10 tertiary blend 3 3 log increase only the 90 surface 10 awp condition from utility 3 did not result in regrowth of total bacteria 0 4 log decrease while all other scenarios produced between 0 2 and 2 0 log increase in 16s rrna genes thus most conditions stimulated regrowth of bacteria as expected but surprisingly it was sometimes the 100 traditional potable water that yielded the most regrowth suggesting that awp is capable of producing water that is more biologically stable than some potable source waters after treatment comparing within utility 2 and utility 3 scenarios there were no statistically significant differences in log increase in 16s rrna gene abundances in the simulated pou water samples collected from the different treatments and blends indicating that dpr scenarios did not produce more regrowth than the corresponding potable source waters wilcoxon p 0 2996 for utility 1 the dpr scenario with the greatest blend ratio 50 surface 50 awp resulted in more regrowth than the corresponding 90 surface 10 awp blend p 0 0490 but still produced less regrowth than the traditional potable source water alone p 0 1632 for utility 4 the 100 surface water and 100 groundwater scenarios also produced more regrowth than some of the dpr blends specifically the 90 groundwater 10 awp condition p 0 0404 the 90 surface 10 industrial awp blend produced an equivalent amount of regrowth as the corresponding potable source water p 0 426 biofilms are of interest given that they are thought to represent the primary reservoir for microbial regrowth in distribution systems liu et al 2014 though recent reports highlight that substantial regrowth can occur in the bulk phase too proctor et al 2016 while biofilms are dynamic environments previous research has demonstrated that a pseudo equilibrium state of biofilm growth was achieved after two to seven weeks in a simulated drinking water distribution system block et al 1993 batté et al 2003 thus samples were collected after eight weeks of rig incubation to sample biofilms that had likely reached or were approaching a stabilized biofilm growth rate in the present study there were no apparent effects of dpr blends on the biomass density of the biofilms after the eight week incubation fig 1 in the case of each of the four utilities the 16s rrna gene abundances in biofilms were not significantly greater in dpr blend scenarios than the corresponding source water scenarios p 0 0748 enumeration of 16s rrna genes by qpcr captures genes from both live and dead cells thus relative differences were compared above to estimate regrowth to compare the findings with a standard culture based method hpcs were also enumerated for a subset of scenarios table s4 16s rrna gene copy numbers and hpcs were found to be significantly correlated pearson r2 0 5127 p 0 0053 while substantial regrowth of total bacteria was noted for the majority of conditions neither hpc nor 16s rrna gene abundances indicated greater regrowth in any dpr scenarios than in the corresponding potable water condition these results are congruent with expectations based on available literature as regrowth of total bacteria via proxys such as hpc total coliforms and 16s rrna genes is well documented in traditional potable water distribution systems and premise plumbing lechevallier et al 1991 wang et al 2012 much less information is available regarding regrowth during distribution of reclaimed water though studies of non potable reclaimed water systems have similarly demonstrated substantial regrowth jjemba et al 2010 narahimhan et al 2005 e coli and enterococci were also cultured from the simulated poc and pou of each rig but no positives were detected this was consistent with the expectation that fecal indicators are expected to be removed by treatment and they do not typically regrow in relatively cool oligotrophic water systems which represent a very different environment than the mammalian gut and therefore are not generally subject to regrowth 3 2 microbial community composition of regrowth 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was carried out to gain insight into the kinds of bacteria subject to regrowth under the various scenarios notably the composition of the microbial community typically shifted during pipe rig incubation within each scenario the microbial community composition of simulated pou water samples were significantly different from poc samples anosim r 0 706 p 0 001 fig 2 also the composition of pou samples varied widely across utilities r 0 450 p 0 001 fig s2 and among scenarios within each utility r 0 430 p 0 001 figs s3 s6 within each scenario water and biofilm communities were not significantly different r 0 216 p 0 064 suggesting that there was interplay between the bulk water and biofilm under these stagnant pipe rig conditions leading to a high degree of similarity between the two matrices this contrasts previous studies of potable premise plumbing in which bulk water microbial communities were found to be largely unique compared to that of the corresponding biofilm ji et al 2017 liu et al 2014 which suggests that transfer between the water and biofilm phases was a key factor in the establishment of rig microbial communities while 16s rrna amplicon sequencing does not have the resolution to confirm the presence of pathogens it is possible to screen for phylogenetic groups known to contain pathogenic strains across scenarios of the actinobacteria present figs 2 93 belonged to the genus mycobacterium gammaproteobacteria primarily belonged to the nevskia acinetobacter and pseudomonas genera 44 17 and 10 respectively and no known enteric pathogens were observed which was consistent with fecal indicator monitoring noted above thus based on amplicon sequencing only a few potentially pathogenic groups were identified mycobacteria acinetobacter and pseudomonas all of which contain several non pathogenic strains as well the microbial community composition shifted markedly from the simulated poc to pou i e from the simulated treatment plant to the simulated tap with samples collected at the poc having a greater alpha diversity simpson 0 916 0 077 than the simulated pou 0 541 0 315 or biofilm samples 0 670 0 302 p 0 0006 this suggests that the conditions present in the premise plumbing rigs selected for bacteria well suited for regrowth rather than indiscriminately enriching all bacteria blended waters trended towards having a higher alpha diversity than potable waters at the poc 0 930 0 067 vs 0 882 0 097 as well as the simulated pou 0 582 0 320 vs 0 435 0 291 and biofilm 0 681 0 300 vs 0 646 0 323 though differences were not significant p 0 1526 3 3 regrowth of oppps while previous studies have examined the regrowth of ops in non potable reuse systems garner et al 2018a jjemba et al 2010 little is known about the potential for dpr waters to support regrowth of ops in distribution systems and premise plumbing the occurrence of ops at the simulated pou versus poc was explored quantitatively via qpcr targeting genes specific for legionella spp mycobacterium spp and p aeruginosa fig 1 in utility 1 scenarios there were no significant differences among scenarios for ops at the poc wilcoxon p 0 4533 or in the conditioned biofilm p 0 1859 there were no significant differences at the simulated pou in legionella spp levels for utility 1 scenarios p 0 1709 mycobacterium spp genes were more abundant in the 90 surface 10 o₃ bac scenario than the 90 surface 10 awp scenario p 0 0044 indicating that mf may offer benefits to limiting regrowth of this genus of bacteria compared to biofiltration the potable source water scenario resulted in more mycobacterium spp genes in the rig pou than either awp dpr blend condition p 0 0013 suggesting that blending the potable source water with highly treated dpr water actually offered benefits for limiting regrowth of mycobacteria spp while legionella spp genes were detected in all utility 2 rig pou samples there were no significant differences in abundance of the genes among these utility 2 treatment and blend ratio scenarios at the pou p 0 1047 or in the biofilm p 0 2453 in utility 3 scenarios legionella spp gene markers were not detected in any pou water or biofilm samples greater mycobacterium spp regrowth was observed in the 90 surface 10 o₃ bac and the 50 surface 50 o₃ bac pou water than in the potable source water pou p 0 0323 in the biofilm mycobacterium spp was detected in all reuse scenarios but concentrations were not significantly greater than scenarios where the gene was not detected p 0 2207 there were no op gene markers detected in any poc pou or biofilm samples from utility 4 scenarios p aeruginosa genes were not detected in poc pou or biofilm samples collected from any scenarios from any utilities thus the pseudomonas detected by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were likely non pathogenic strains when compared to traditional potable source waters dpr treatment schemes from utilities 1 2 and 4 all produced reuse waters that were successful at limiting regrowth of ops mf paired with uv aop appears to be a particularly promising treatment approach for limiting regrowth of ops as membrane filtered waters from utility 1 tended to harbor less regrowth than biofiltered waters when treatment approach alone was not sufficient to limit op regrowth selection of an optimal blend ratio appears to be a particularly promising approach for limiting regrowth as more regrowth was observed in greater blend ratios for some ops for example more legionella spp growth was observed in the 50 groundwater 50 awp scenario than the 90 groundwater 10 awp scenario for utility 2 and more mycobacterium spp regrowth was observed in the 50 surface 50 o3 bac scenario than the 90 surface 10 o3 bac for utility 3 previous studies have indicated that both legionella spp and mycobacterium spp are widespread in non potable reclaimed water at the pou fahrenfeld et al 2013 garner et al 2018a jjemba et al 2010 whiley et al 2015 highlighting the importance of identifying awp treatment approaches that can produce finished water that effectively limits regrowth of ops in distribution systems and premise plumbing though regrowth of ops has not been previously studied in dpr distribution systems or the associated premise plumbing results of this study indicate that awp is highly effective at producing biostable waters that do not support regrowth of ops the conditions in this study represent a worse than typical scenario for premise plumbing with long stagnation periods that are representative of lower use patterns than are expected in an inhabited residence with regular water use however further study examining the relevance of these trends in full scale systems over longer time periods in actual plumbing systems with smaller pipe diameters typical of premise plumbing and with more mature biofilms would be valuable notably some studies indicate that over six months of acclimation are required to approach a stable drinking water biofilm boe hansen et al 2002 3 4 occurrence of args while the presence of diverse args belonging to the antibiotic classes beta lactam glycopeptide macrolide sulfonamide tetracycline and quinolone among others have been previously documented in non potable reuse water distribution systems fahrenfeld et al 2013 garner et al 2018b to the authors knowledge this study is the first to examine the presence of args in dpr waters there are currently no standard methodologies for monitoring antibiotic resistance in water but it is becoming common practice to quantify a number of target args as conservative indicators for assessing potential for selection and spread of resistance in various aquatic reservoirs berendonk et al 2015 monitoring args provides a conservative indicator because while bacteria may be killed their dna carrying args still has the potential to be taken up by downstream bacteria here two args vana and qnra which encode resistance to critically important antibiotics vancomycin and quinolones respectively were quantified via qpcr the gene capture element inti1 was also measured as a broad indicator for anthropogenic influence and potential for horizontal transfer of multi antibiotic resistance fig 1 in utility 1 samples vana was widely detected but at sub quantifiable concentrations with the 90 surface 10 awp scenario yielding the only quantifiable occurrence fig 1 there were no significant differences between potable and dpr scenarios for vana concentration in either the pou water wilcoxon p 0 1709 or the biofilm p 0 4142 and qnra and inti1 were not detected in any biofilm samples in utility 2 samples args and inti1 were detected sporadically at sub quantifiable levels and there were no significant differences in arg abundance between potable and dpr scenarios for the pou water p 0 0764 or biofilm p 0 4795 for any of the genes for utility 3 scenarios inti1 and qnra were occasionally detected but not quantifiable there were no significant differences in gene abundances between potable and dpr scenarios for either gene in the pou water p 0 3816 or biofilm samples p 0 6171 no args were detected in any samples from utility 4 scenarios together these results are a promising preliminary indication that these highly treated dpr waters do not pose added risk in terms of producing waters enriched in args relative to traditional potable water or in proliferating args in the distribution system however this issue merits further monitoring particularly as more standardized tools for arg monitoring become available and over longer study periods a subset of samples representing the traditional potable source water and the 10 dpr blend of each scenario were subject to shotgun metagenomic sequencing with annotation against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database mcarthur et al 2013 to broadly profile args beyond those quantified by qpcr a large portion of the samples all samples from utility 2 and a subset from utilities 3 and 4 did not yield sufficient dna to conduct metagenomic sequencing limited recovery of dna from dpr samples was not unexpected as this is a common challenge for drinking water samples in general and premise plumbing in particular because of volume constraints representative of the condition of interest as little to no information is currently available about the occurrence of args in dpr water the metagenomic dataset that was produced provides valuable qualitative information regarding the dpr resistome of the scenarios that could be sequenced fig 3 annotation of shotgun metagenomic reads against card revealed a total of 212 different args detected across the dataset ranging from five to 94 different args per sample table s3 arg profiles varied strongly according to utility fig s1 anosim r 0 789 p 0 001 but did not vary as strongly by scenario within each utility r 0 307 p 0 012 multidrug trimethoprim and aminoglycoside resistance were abundant across all utilities while rifampin tetracycline and peptide resistance were notably abundant only in utility 4 samples overall the ten most abundant genes across the dataset included one trimethoprim resistance gene dfre two rifampin genes rbpa arr 1 one aminoglycoside gene aac 2 ib and five multidrug resistance genes mtra mdtb adeg ceob acrb mexf utility 4 samples were largely dominated by dfre mtra rbpa aaa 2 ib and arr 1 while utility 1 and 3 samples were dominated by dfre mdtb adeg ceob and acrb this strong grouping of args by utility in standardized premise plumbing rigs suggests that overarching factors such as geography and physicochemical and microbial characteristics of potable source water e g the original source of the vast majority of wastewater are likely to be critical determinants influencing the resistome i e all args present of dpr water the semi quantitative value of shotgun metagenomic sequencing is widely recognized and correspondingly data are often analyzed in terms of relative abundance e g normalized to total reads or 16s rrna genes to facilitate comparison among data sets of varying sequence depth as reported in fig s7 however relative abundance units are not suitable for monitoring or risk assessment purposes accordingly the more precise quantification of 16s rrna genes yielded by qpcr provided a means to convert gene copy 16s rrna gene copy units generated from metagenomics into more practical units of gene copy ml or swab fig 3 while it is important to recognize that factoring in an additional measured variable contributes to propagation of error recent studies have reported a strong correlation between gene targets measured independently by qpcr and metagenomic data converted to copies ml dai et al 2018 garner et al 2016a 2018a using this approach the total abundances of known args ranged from 1 5 to 6 5 log gene copies per milliliter in bulk water and from 3 7 to 6 0 log gene copies per biofilm swab in samples 3 5 regrowth of hpc bacteria capable of growth on antibiotic supplemented media while molecular methods are extremely powerful for detecting args in viable cells irrespective of their culturability molecular methods also capture dna from dead cells extracellular dna and dna incorporated into the biofilm in the form of extracellular polymeric substances to verify the presence of viable phenotypically resistant heterotrophic bacteria water samples were plated onto r2a media amended with antibiotics table s4 while comparing results across conditions can provide an indication of the potential for blending reuse waters with traditional source waters to increase growth on antibiotic supplemented media there are important limitations because r2a agar captures a variety of heterotrophic bacteria it is impossible to identify the minimum inhibitory concentration mic for each present species growth may not necessarily be indicative of resistance but rather intrinsic resistance for example some antibiotics are not effective against gram positive bacteria intermediate resistance or sub inhibitory antibiotic concentrations with these limitations in mind we compared hpc growth in the presence of a suite of antibiotics as further evidence to identify treatment schemes that potentially limit resistant strains or community shifts favoring species with inherent resistance or higher mics such an approach has been previously applied for drinking water xi et al 2009 of the 100 surface water and 50 surface 50 awp blend tested from utility 1 the 50 surface 50 awp blend consistently produced less hpcs capable of growth on media amended with antibiotics indicating that blending with highly treated awp water might have benefits for reducing microbial water quality problems in general particularly high levels of regrowth were noted from the 90 surface 10 awp blend on media amended with sulfamethoxazole 240 69 of total hpcs for rigs 1 and 2 respectively and vancomycin 65 258 utility 2 did not produce any quantifiable hpcs capable of growth on antibiotic amended hpc agar utility 3 s 100 surface condition did not produce any quantifiable hpcs at the poc or pou but regrowth of total and resistant hpcs occurred for both tertiary blends the 90 surface 10 tertiary blend rigs produced at least 1 8 log more total hpcs than the 95 surface 5 tertiary blend demonstrating that selection of the appropriate blend ratio can effectively control regrowth of hpcs in premise plumbing from utility 4 only the two potable waters 100 surface and 100 groundwater produced quantifiable hpcs capable of growth on antibiotic media notably both the vana vancomycin resistance gene and hpcs capable of growth on media amended with vancomycin were observed for the utility 1 90 surface 10 awp rig pou samples however hpcs capable of growth on media amended with ciprofloxacin a quinolone antibiotic were quantifiable for this scenario though the qnra quinolone resistance gene was not suggesting that inherent resistance may have contributed to these results again these results suggest that blending traditional potable source waters with highly treated reuse water can actually have benefits for limiting regrowth of total hpcs and hpcs capable of growth on antibiotic media 3 6 microbially influenced corrosion other nuisance bacteria may regrow during distribution that are of concern for maintaining water infrastructure and aesthetics and can indirectly cause health concerns bart tests were used to identify bacteria associated with microbially influenced corrosion following incubation in the pipe rigs table 2 heterotrophic aerobic bacteria were rarely detected and when they were present they were present at low abundances below approximately 7000 colony forming units cfu per milliliter sulfate reducing bacteria were detected in all utilities at abundances up to approximately 2 200 000 cfu per milliliter indicating that anaerobic conditions likely developed within rigs regardless of utility or scenario though dissolved oxygen was not measured in rigs so this cannot be confirmed acid producing bacteria were only detected at a quantifiable range in the 90 surface 10 tertiary blend from utility 3 indicating that overall these bacteria can be controlled by awp and selection of an appropriate blend ratio slime producing bacteria were ubiquitous but were particularly abundant in the 100 surface and tertiary blends of utility 3 while nitrifying bacteria were not detected in any samples denitrifying bacteria were notably abundant in the tertiary blends of utility 3 and all scenarios from utility 4 further suggesting that anaerobic conditions developed during simulated distribution the development of low dissolved oxygen conditions in premise plumbing is not uncommon and has been previously documented after elevated water age is reached in distribution systems masters et al 2015 especially in systems experiencing nitrification wilczak et al 1996 given that utilities 1 2 and 4 all use a chloramine residual nitrification is a particular concern given the availability of nitrogen via ammonia zhang et al 2009 while bacteria associated with microbially influenced corrosion are important because of their ability to contribute to corrosion of distribution system pipes and plumbing materials they can also be detrimental to water aesthetics sulfate reducing bacteria slime producing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria emerged as the primary concerns in the studied scenarios sulfate reducing bacteria can contribute to corrosion pitting and undesirable taste and odor problems such as the production of black slimes and rotten egg odor jacobs and edwards 2000 the elevated abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria under nearly all conditions suggests that dpr waters may be particularly susceptible to supporting the growth of these microorganisms slime producing bacteria are associated with the production of excessive biofilms and extracellular polymeric substances that can corrode metal pipes plug pipes and cause undesirable taste and odor and water cloudiness little et al 2007 denitrifying bacteria may be associated with increased ph corrosion of metal pipes and undesirable taste and odor masters et al 2015 given that sulfate reducing and denitrifying bacteria can grow only in anaerobic conditions distribution system operation will be critical for limiting growth of these organisms in full scale systems limiting stagnation and minimizing water age at the pou can aid in the prevention of redox conditions favorable to growth of these microorganisms masters et al 2015 additionally maintaining a disinfectant residual at the point of use can aid in control of these organisms and their undesirable consequences 3 7 water chemistry organic carbon is a critical nutrient supporting regrowth of microorganisms in treated water while toc and doc have long been used as proxies for the level of organic carbon in the water during distribution bdoc has been proposed as an alternative indicator that more accurately reflects the biodegradable fraction and overall biostability of water servais et al 1987 average toc in simulated poc samples for each scenario ranged from 50 7 to 5790 ppb average doc ranged from 4 5 to 5710 ppb and average bdoc ranged from sub quantifiable to 1850 ppb fig 4 previous studies that have found bdoc in reclaimed water to range from 400 to 6200 ppb jjemba et al 2010 and from 20 to 930 ppb in potable water charnock and kjønnø 2000 ribas et al 1991 with the exception of the 90 surface 10 awp and 100 o₃ bac conditions from utility 1 all other reuse scenarios fell below 930 ppb bdoc indicating that they are of comparable biostability to potable waters documented in the literature o3 bac appears particularly promising for reducing bdoc as the utility 1 90 surface 10 o3 bac treatment train resulted in less bdoc than the 90 surface 10 awp treatment p 0 0031 though blend ratio did not significantly affect bdoc concentrations for utility 1 scenarios utilizing biofiltration treatment the blend ratio did affect bdoc in membrane based treatment with the 90 surface 10 awp being greater than the 50 surface 50 awp scenario p 0 0034 of utility 2 and 4 scenarios no dpr treatment schemes produced bdoc concentrations greater than the respective potable scenario p 0 0998 of utility 3 scenarios both reuse schemes produced bdoc concentrations that were not significantly different from the finished condition p 0 1503 though the 100 surface condition produced by pilot scale treatment was greater than the bdoc concentration of the 100 finished condition produced by the full scale potable treatment plant p 0 0241 there were no significant positive correlations between bdoc and total bacteria as measured by 16s rrna genes or hpc or between bdoc and any op or arg gene markers for any of the utilities spearman p 0 2188 this result suggests that in this highly treated dpr water organic carbon is not the limiting nutrient determining biostability of finished water previous studies have demonstrated that in order for organic carbon to be the limiting nutrient constraining bacterial regrowth extremely low concentrations of below 10 ppb as assimilable organic carbon are required kooij 1992 williams et al 2015 residual disinfectant concentrations at the poc and after incubation at the simulated pou are presented in table s5 4 conclusions advancements in treatment technologies have facilitated the ability to produce high quality water from wastewater suitable for potable purposes yet prior to this work little was known about the biological stability of such dpr water this study simulated use of cold water premise plumbing where significant regrowth of ops is known to occur using blended dpr water from four u s water utilities produced by current and anticipated treatments to our knowledge this study represents the first such simulation and here we aimed to be comprehensive in the approach studying waters from four water utilities along with comprehensive culture and molecular based characterization of the resident microbial communities and factors influencing their regrowth results were compared to the regrowth observed for traditional potable water currently in use at the same utilities across tested treatment and blending scenarios total bacteria i e 16s rrna genes were more abundant at the pou than at the poc for both dpr blends and traditional potable water however there were no significant differences in the amount of regrowth observed of total bacteria legionella spp qnra vana or inti1 between awp or o3 bac treated dpr blends than in the corresponding potable water mycobacterium spp regrowth in dpr blends exceeded that observed in potable waters only for utility 3 which utilized o3 bac or tertiary treatment under such scenarios where the dpr water might have some potential to stimulate bacterial regrowth as appears to have been the case at utility 3 selection of an appropriate blend ratio appears to be a viable means of limiting regrowth the overall microbial community composition was unique at the pou compared to the poc with greater alpha diversity observed at the poc suggesting that simulated premise plumbing conditions selected for particular bacteria that were well suited for regrowth with the exception of utility 1 all awp o3 bac and tertiary treated waters had bdoc values that were not significantly greater than comparable traditional potable source waters of utility 1 scenarios o3 bac treatment reduced bdoc levels to be comparable to potable water concentrations while membrane based awp did not regrowth was observed for several microorganisms associated with microbially influenced corrosion sulfate reducing bacteria in particular grew in all conditions so control of these bacteria in dpr systems could present a critical challenge it is important to recognize however that this study was carried out over a short time period of only eight weeks which was aimed to capture key differences of the kinds of microbes expected to colonize proliferate and establish in cold water premise plumbing when dpr water is introduced given that microbial communities undergo extensive long term succession patterns additional longer term monitoring is recommended as dpr waters are integrated into potable water distribution systems further this work did not investigate regrowth of ops in hot water premise plumbing which would be worthy of future research focus given that warm water is generally more conducive to op growth additional research is also needed to determine the applicability of these findings for different levels of reclaimed water treatment and purification and blending ratios not tested herein acknowledgements we thank the

19056,to provide information for the design and improvement of full scale biofilters pilot scale biofiltration studies are the current industry standard because they utilize the same filter media size and loading rate as the full scale biofilters in the current study bench scale biofilters were designed according to a biofilter scaling model from the literature and the ability of the bench scale biofilters to accurately represent the organics removal of pilot scale biofilters was tested to ensure similarity in effluent water quality between bench and pilot or full scale biofilters at the same influent substrate concentration the tested model requires that either mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss takes primacy over the other the potential primacy of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss was evaluated via water quality testing dissolved organic carbon specific ultraviolet absorbance liquid chromatography organic carbon detection trihalomethane formation potential and haloacetic acid formation potential the biofilters also were characterized for adenosine triphosphate atp content enzyme activity extracellular polymeric substances and microbial community structure the results of this study indicate that biofilm shear loss takes primacy over mass transport resistance for bench scale biofilter design in this system thus bench scale biofilters designed in this manner accurately represent organics removal in pilot scale biofilters applying this scaling procedure can reduce filter media requirements from many kilograms to just a few grams and daily water requirements from thousands of liters to less than 10 l this scaling procedure will allow future researchers to test alternative treatment designs and operating conditions without the need for expensive pilot scale studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilter scaling procedure bench scale biofilters organics removal biomass characterization microbial community analysis enzyme activity 1 introduction biofiltration is becoming a popular drinking water treatment technology because it can utilize existing granular filter media and produce high quality water without additional chemicals fu et al 2017 typically biofilters are utilized to reduce the concentration of biodegradable organic compounds that otherwise might result in microbial growth in the distribution system or the formation of disinfection by products terry and summers 2018 basu et al 2016 in addition to removing natural organic matter nom biofilters also have shown the ability to remove pharmaceutically active compounds mckie et al 2016 zearley and summers 2012 taste and odor compounds beniwal et al 2018 and nutrients nemani et al 2018 although biofiltration has been studied extensively it still can be considered a black box technology in some respects to improve our understanding of the biological processes occurring in a biofilter advanced techniques have been applied for instance some studies have conducted microbial community or metagenomics analyses to characterize the composition and structure of the microbial community nemani et al 2018 li et al 2017 oh et al 2018 others have sought to quantify biofilter function by measuring enzyme activity directly associated with the degradation of specific substrates lautenschlager et al 2014 sharma et al 2018 these methods have provided greater insight regarding the bacteria and processes occurring in drinking water biofilters pilot scale biofiltration studies often are used to acquire additional site specific data to inform the design and operation of biofilters such pilot scale biofilters represent the current industry standard because they utilize the same filter media size and loading rate as the full scale biofilters unfortunately pilot scale studies are expensive due to the cost of infrastructure operation and maintenance kawamura 2000 as such the water treatment industry needs a less costly means to evaluate biofiltration when bench scale biofilters are employed they typically are designed to match the empty bed contact time ebct of the full scale process and the filter media size bed diameter and bed depth are chosen to minimize wall effects however these simple guidelines generally are insufficient to yield bench scale results that accurately reflect full scale performance to bridge this gap manem and rittmann 1990 formulated a scaling model such that bench scale biofilm processes could be designed to accurately reflect the treatment performance of larger scale prototype biofilm processes i e pilot or full scale when the microorganisms process configuration and temperature are the same between the bench scale and prototype processes thus the scaling model results in a bench scale design that produces the same effluent substrate concentration as the prototype process their model is based on satisfying the following three similitude criteria ф1 substrate concentration at the biofilm surface ф2 rate of biofilm shear loss ф3 substrate mass balance manem and rittmann 1990 noted that it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy all three criteria for a given influent substrate concentration e g dissolved organic carbon doc unless either external mass transport ф1 or biofilm shear loss ф2 is deemed insignificant if mass transport resistance has primacy i e biofilm shear loss is insignificant then ф1 and ф3 must be satisfied when the influent substrate concentration to the prototype and bench scale biofilters is the same if biofilm shear loss has primacy i e mass transport resistance is insignificant then ф2 and ф3 must be satisfied when the influent substrate concentration to the prototype and bench scale biofilters is the same for a bench scale biofilter the model yields an ebct calculated according to ф3 and a flow rate and bed depth calculated with respect to ф1 or ф2 this scaling procedure was reported manem and rittmann 1990 to substantially reduce the volume of filter media from liters pilot scale to milliliters bench scale and the amount of water required from thousands of liters per day to less than 10 l per day the objective of the current study was to evaluate the applicability of the biofiltration scaling procedure described by manem and rittmann 1990 to design bench scale biofilters that accurately represent organics removal in pilot scale biofilters because organics removal is one of the primary goals of drinking water biofiltration pilot scale and bench scale biofilters were directly compared with respect to performance removal of doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and disinfection by product formation potential dbp fp under typical flow conditions as well as under challenge conditions that represent seasonal changes in flow to confirm the model assumption of having similar microbial communities in the bench and pilot scale biofilters the activities of particular enzymes the concentration of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the composition of the microbial communities were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of full scale pilot scale and bench scale biofilters this study was conducted at the georgina water treatment plant ontario canada at full scale lake simcoe water is treated with ultrafiltration uf ge zeeweed1000 ultraviolet uv disinfection trojan 40 mj cm2 and biologically active granular activated carbon gac filtration the full scale filter media calgon f300 8 30 mesh has been in operation since 2003 as upstream uf was incorporated for particle removal the gac filters primarily serve as biological contactors the pilot scale biofilters were constructed with filter media obtained from the full scale biofilters and were operated with influent water following uf and uv treatment from the full scale system prior to the current study the pilot scale biofilters had been in operation for three years one pilot scale biofilter was operated with a flow rate of 300 ml min representative of the minimum ebct 15 min utilized at full scale and a second pilot scale biofilter was operated at 150 ml min representative of the maximum ebct 30 min fig 1 similar to full scale the pilot scale biofilters served primarily as biological contactors as such they only required backwashing every two to three months to eliminate air binding backwash consisted of 2 min of low wash 25 bed expansion 8 min of high wash 50 bed expansion and 2 min of low wash to allow the media to settle for the three years before the current study was initiated the pilot scale biofilters showed constant doc removal this suggests that the adsorption capacity of the gac is exhausted and that the removal of organics is largely due to biodegradation in the pilot scale biofilters this study examined two bench scale biofilter designs operated in duplicate fig 1 to determine if either mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss could be deemed insignificant one set of bench scale biofilters was designed on the basis of mass transport resistance primacy bench φ1 while the other set was designed on the basis of biofilm shear loss primacy bench φ2 a side stream of the influent to the pilot scale biofilters was pumped using a masterflex ls digital drive peristaltic pump cole parmer montreal qc to the bench scale biofilters pilot scale biofilter media was ground with a mortar and pestle sieved and the 30 40 mesh fraction was utilized for the bench scale studies since the bench scale biofilters were filled with media from the pilot scale biofilters it is expected that the removal of organics is largely due to biodegradation in the bench scale biofilters bench scale biofilters were backwashed on the same day as their counterparts at the pilot scale 2 2 filter media characterization bed porosities were determined for pilot and bench scale biofilters as follows 1 ε 1 m p ρ p a l 0 where mp total mass of particles in bed g ρp particle density g m3 l0 fixed bed depth m a cross sectional area of the empty column m2 to determine particle density 5 0 5 g of surface dry gac were added to water in a 20 ml graduated cylinder such that water displacement could be observed ten replicates were performed to calculate an average particle density sphericity was determined using a method described by hunce et al 2016 briefly a column was packed with water saturated gac and tapped at least ten times to ensure that air bubbles were removed headloss across the media was measured using pressure transducers 629 02 ch p2 e2 s5 dwyer instruments inc michigan city in at several flow rates between 3 0 and 9 7 ml min a control same column without filter media was used to account for entrance exit and friction losses

manem and rittmann 1990 model based on previous biofilm models manem and rittmann 1990 developed three similitude criteria to accurately scale a biofilm process to produce the same effluent concentration in the prototype original and scaled processes for the rate limiting substrate the model assumes the following same types of microorganisms same process configuration and same temperature in the prototype and scaled processes the similitude criteria are outlined briefly below but their full derivations can be found in manem and rittmann 1990 the first similitude criterion is that the concentration of substrate at the biofilm surface φ1 is the same in the prototype and scaled processes meaning that the processes have the same flux into the biofilm and the same external mass transport resistance this criterion is defined as 3 φ 1 d p 0 67 v 0 33 ε where dp diameter of filter medium collectors l v superficial flow velocity through the filter l t ε porosity of the filter the second similitude criterion is that the biofilm shear loss rate φ2 is the same in the prototype and scaled processes meaning that the processes have the same total attached biomass per unit area of the filter medium this criterion is defined as 4 φ 2 v 1 ε ψ d p ε 3 where ψ shape factor for filter medium collectors the third similitude criterion is that substrate mass balance φ3 is the same in the prototype and scaled processes this criterion is defined as 5 φ 3 1 ε θ d p ψ where θ empty bed contact time t these three similitude criteria cannot be satisfied simultaneously at a single influent substrate concentration however in some situations φ1 or φ2 takes primacy i e if mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss respectively is more important than the other in the reactor of interest in that case a single influent substrate concentration can be used for the prototype and scaled reactors in this work we tested whether φ1 or φ2 would demonstrate primacy over the other in drinking water biofilters used for organics removal thus to evaluate the potential primacy of mass transport resistance similitude criteria φ1 and φ3 were used to design the scaled biofilter to evaluate the potential primacy of biofilm shear loss similitude criteria φ2 and φ3 were used to design the scaled biofilter 2 4 phase i scaling acclimation and sampling of bench scale biofilters under typical flow conditions biofilters were examined in phase i under conditions representing typical flow i e loading rate in the full scale plant six bench scale biofilters glass columns 20 cm long 1 08 cm inner diameter were operated in parallel and scaled on the basis of the pilot scale biofilter table 1 three biofilters utilized a flow rate and bed depth as dictated by ф1 i e assuming biofilm shear loss was insignificant and the other three followed ф2 i e assuming mass transport resistance was insignificant for each set of three biofilters two served as replicates for water quality and biomass measurements and the third not shown in fig 1 was operated to provide replacement acclimated gac to the other two biofilters following each granular media sampling event due to the grinding and sieving of the media for the bench scale biofilters low initial biomass coverage was anticipated in phase i to reduce start up time 4 l of filter influent was recirculated in each bench scale biofilter for one week subsequently the bench scale biofilters were operated in once through mode subsequently influent and effluent water quality from the pilot and bench scale biofilters was monitored to assess acclimation pilot scale effluent was collected at a depth of 45 cm per the conditions shown in table 1 that location was chosen for sampling because previous work demonstrated that the bulk of the biological activity in these biofilters occurred in the top 45 cm samples were collected weekly and analyzed for doc uv254 ph turbidity po4 p and nh4 n acclimation of the bench scale biofilters was assumed once the concentrations for these six parameters were 10 different between the bench and pilot scale biofilters for each sampling event water was collected from the bench scale biofilters over a period of 24 h due to their low flow rates and similar samples were collected at pilot scale due to the amount of media required for analysis 4 g 50 and 1 of the media from the bench scale and pilot scale biofilters respectively was harvested per sampling event media collected at the bench scale represents a composite across the filter depth pilot scale media was collected at 5 25 and 45 cm depths and combined replacement media was added as required at bench scale water quality analyses were used to confirm bench scale biofilter re acclimation prior to the next sampling event samples for phase i were collected over a period of 6 months including data sets at water temperatures of 3 5 12 and 20 c 2 5 phase ii scaling acclimation and sampling of bench scale biofilters under challenge conditions during phase ii bench scale biofilters were examined at shorter and longer ebcts challenge conditions long ebct conditions in the bench scale biofilters were defined as double that utilized in phase i bench scale biofilters operated under these low flow conditions were compared to the 150 ml min pilot scale biofilter sampled at an ebct of 13 5 min table 2 short ebct conditions were defined as one half of that utilized in phase i bench scale biofilters operated under these high flow conditions were compared to the 300 ml min pilot scale biofilter sampled at an ebct of 3 75 min details regarding challenge conditions are provided in table 2 bench scale biofilters were operated for two weeks under low flow conditions followed by two weeks under high flow conditions with sampling at the end of each two week period the ebct associated with the low and high flow conditions were scaled in the model to be representative of minimum and maximum full scale filter values these conditions were tested to validate the application of the scaling model over a range of operating conditions pertinent to full scale operation water temperature remained constant at 18 c during the challenge phase biomass dynamics e g changes in atp enzyme activity and community composition due to altering operation are an important aspect of biofilter response to the challenge conditions however due to the media sampling requirements for these parameters 3 g 50 of the bench scale filter media monitoring biomass dynamics was infeasible as such no filter media samples were collected at the end of the low flow conditions to eliminate the need for acclimating new media prior to initiating the high flow conditions 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 biofilm characterization atp on the biofilter media 1 g aliquot was measured using a luminultra deposit surface analysis kit dsa 100c fredericton nb according to the manufacturer s instructions a single atp measurement was collected for each biofilter during a sampling event to accommodate the limited amount of media in the bench scale biofilters enzyme activity of media extracts was assessed according to the method described by lautenschlager et al 2014 briefly 1 g of media was extracted in 10 ml of 50 mm tris solution and sonicated applied energy 400 w for 10 min fluorescently labelled substrates

to 1 ml of a 20 μm solution of the desired enzyme substrate and fluorescence and absorbance readings were taken over a period of 24 h fluorescence readings were corrected with respect to absorbance

4 mub solution sigma aldrich oakville on for concentrations between 0 and 100 μm after converting the fluorescence results to molar concentrations the maximum slope of the response curve was taken as the enzyme activity eps were extracted from biofilter media in duplicate using the method of keithley and kirisits 2018 briefly a 0 5 g aliquot of media and 5 ml of extraction buffer 10 mm tris hcl 10 mm edta and 2 5 nacl at ph 8 were added to a 15 ml conical tube the tubes were vortexed for 1 min and incubated with shaking at 200 rpm at 35 c for 4 h the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and the filtrate was stored at 20 c until analysis total solids ts analyses were conducted whereby the solids were dried at 105 c for 24 h cooled in a desiccator and weighed proteins were

effluent water quality and biomass esterase activity atp phosphatase activity atp phosphatase activity esterase activity eps proteins polysaccharides and effluent values of doc suva humics thm fp and haa fp were conducted specifically a paired student s t test with a 95 confidence interval was applied if biofilter bench φ1 is significantly different from the pilot biofilter then mass transport resistance does not have primacy over biofilm shear loss in this system if biofilter bench φ2 is significantly different from the pilot biofilter then biofilm shear loss does not have primacy over mass transport resistance in this system if bench φ1 and φ2 produced a statistically similar result for a particular water quality or biomass parameter then that parameter was identified as being unaffected by the specifics of the scaling model i e primacy of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss in addition the same statistical tests were applied to filter influent and effluent to determine if the removal of organics was significant a two tailed test was utilized to determine any differences between observed values all statistical tests included results from both typical flow as well as challenge conditions p values reported in this study indicate the level at which a relationship would show a significant difference i e the higher the p value the more likely it is that the compared values are the same 3 results 3 1 atp enzyme activities and eps on media all biofilter samples had concentrations of atp 100 ng g media fig 2 which has been previously reported as a threshold value to designate biologically active filtration pharand et al 2014 atp concentrations were generally similar when comparing the pilot and bench scale biofilters p 0 6 and p 0 8 for bench φ1 and φ2 respectively with no definitive trend observed with respect to temperature the manem and rittmann model is predicated on having the same biomass per unit area so the results shown in fig 2 were expected overall neither mass transport nor biofilm shear loss significantly impacted atp concentrations when the bench scale filters were compared to each other biological function was assessed by examining the activity of six enzymes esterase phosphatase chitinase α glucosidase xylosidase cellobiohydrolase only esterase and phosphatase activities were quantifiable 0 02 μm min figs 3 and 4 in both bench and pilot scale systems esterase activity was approximately one order of magnitude higher when compared to phosphatase similar to results presented by lautenschlager et al 2014 esterase activity was observed to be independent of temperature whereas phosphatase activity was significantly lower p 0 001 during cold water conditions 3 5 c when compared to warm water conditions 12 c the impact of temperature on phosphatase activity was statistically similar p 0 05 for all filters esterase activity per gram of pilot scale media was higher than that per gram of bench scale media to eliminate differences in filter media surface area between the bench and pilot scale biofilters esterase activity was normalized to the active biomass atp the ratio of esterase activity to atp showed no significant difference between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ1 p 0 27 or between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ2 p 0 24 these results suggest that the bench scale biofilters accurately represent the pilot scale biofilter with respect to esterase activity normalized to atp with no sensitivity to the assumption of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss primacy table 3 similarly phosphatase activity did not show any difference between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ1 p 0 92 or the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ2 p 0 83 when normalized to atp these results suggest that the bench scale biofilters accurately represent the pilot scale biofilter with respect to phosphatase activity normalized to atp with no sensitivity to the assumption of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss primacy table 3 the ratio of phosphatase activity to esterase activity also was calculated for the bench and pilot scale biofilters when compared to the pilot scale biofilter 0 07 0 02 bench φ1 0 12 0 05 was significantly higher p 0 04 while bench φ2 0 11 0 05 p 0 07 was statistically similar these results suggest that assuming the primacy of mass transport resistance is inappropriate table 3 eps values for bench and pilot scale biofilters are shown in figs 5 and 6 under typical flow conditions both the bench and pilot scale biofilters showed increases in eps polysaccharides and proteins as temperature increased from 3 5 to 20 c the dominance of eps proteins over polysaccharides is common for drinking water biofilters keithley and kirisits 2018 eps polysaccharides were generally similar for both pilot and bench scale media eps proteins were higher on pilot scale biofilter media extracts for typical flow condition samples and similar for challenge conditions previous literature examined the ratio of eps proteins to polysaccharides and found a similar ratio regardless of media type or pre treatment keithley and kirisits 2018 in the current study the eps protein to polysaccharide ratio was not significantly different between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ1 p 0 30 or the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ2 p 0 27 these results suggest that neither mass transport resistance nor biofilm shear loss has primacy based on the eps protein to polysaccharide ratio table 3 overall biological characterization indicated that the bench and pilot scale filters were biologically active and had similarities with respect to enzymatic function and eps no conclusive evidence was gained with respect to identifying which of the two scaling criteria has primacy in this system indicating that biofilm characterization was insensitive to the scaling procedure in this system 3 2 microbial community structure on media the scaling model examined in this study assumes that the same types of microorganisms occur in both the prototype and scaled filters manem and rittmann 1990 fig 7 shows the microbial communities at the phylum class and order levels in the bench and pilot scale biofilters where 91 96 of the otus in a given sample classified into a taxonomic group containing at least 0 5 of the sequences among these otus all of the samples shared the same five taxonomies at the phylum level and the same 10 taxonomies at the class level the samples also shared the same 19 taxonomies at the order level additionally four of the samples bench ф1 and pilot scale biofilters during steady state conditions at 12 c and challenge conditions at 18 c contained the same additional group at the order level considering the relative abundances shown in fig 7 the bench scale biofilter communities appear similar to those at pilot scale under steady state conditions this similarity is not as strong under the short term challenge conditions suggesting that some changes in community structure might occur with seasonal flow variation alpha diversity based on abundance and evenness was calculated with the shannon diversity index and utilized all otus the shannon diversity index ranged between 4 9 and 5 4 for bench ф1 5 3 and 5 6 for bench ф2 and 4 9 and 5 2 for the pilot scale biofilter these values suggest that the microbial communities of the bench and pilot scale biofilters had similarly high diversity overall these data support the model assumption that the microbial communities in the bench scale biofilters are similar to those in the pilot scale biofilters during steady state conditions additionally the microbial communities in both the bench and pilot scale biofilters fig 7 show similarities to microbial communities observed in other drinking water biofilters pinto et al 2012 where proteobacteria is the dominant phylum and alphaproteobacteria is the dominant order in that phylum lautenschlager et al 2014 liao et al 2013 oh et al 2018 3 3 water quality characterization to determine if bench scale biofilters could accurately represent effluent organic water quality from pilot scale biofilters samples were collected to compare doc suva organic fractionation by lc ocd thm fp and haa fp doc consumption occurred across the biofilters fig 8 as evidenced by the significant difference in the influent and effluent doc concentrations under typical flow and challenge conditions table 4 the statistically significant difference in effluent doc between bench scale φ1 and the pilot scale biofilter table 4 suggests that mass transport resistance does not have primacy over biofilm shear loss in this system table 3 this is consistent with the thin biofilms 8 μm generally observed in drinking water biofilters dimas 2016 furthermore the statistical similarity in effluent doc between bench φ2 and the pilot scale biofilter table 4 suggests that biofilm shear loss has primacy over mass transport resistance in this system table 3 all biofilters had effluent suva values that were statistically similar to the influent as well as to each other table 4 this was anticipated because the suva values were relatively low in the biofilter influent suva 1 7 and uv254 absorbance generally decreased proportionally with doc as suva is an indicator of organic aromaticity the observation of similar suva values indicates that biofilters do not preferentially reduce aromatic compounds consistent with archer and singer 2006 in addition to assessing bulk doc concentrations organic fractionation was completed using lc ocd humic substances were significantly removed by the pilot biofilter table 4 the other four organic fractions were statistically similar between the influent and effluents and among biofilter effluents limited biopolymer removal has been reported by biofilters in previous studies nemani et al 2016 humic substances are generally the most prevalent sub fraction of doc typically 60 and as such low removals of humics by biofiltration limits potential overall organics removal mckie et al 2015 bench scale biofilters did not significantly remove humics when compared to the influent 1 9 1 6 and 2 8 4 1 mean standard deviation for bench φ1 and bench φ2 respectively in contrast to the pilot scale biofilter 5 9 1 6 a significant difference exists between the effluent humics concentration from bench φ1 and the pilot scale biofilter this is in contrast to the lack of significant difference between the effluent humics concentration from bench φ2 and the pilot scale biofilter table 4 thus similar to the results observed with respect to doc the humics data suggest that biofilm shear loss has primacy table 3 as humic substances were the most prevalent of the organic species measured by lc ocd it is unsurprising that similar trends were observed between humic substances and doc both bench and pilot scale filters reduced thm fp although the effluent thm fp from bench φ2 was not significantly different from the influent table 4 this was attributed to one sampling event where an increase in thm fp was observed when this event was excluded the effluent thm fp from bench φ2 is significantly different from the influent p 0 02 based on a paired t test neither the bench or pilot scale biofilters removed a significant amount of haa fp table 4 haa fp varied substantially through the study with influent concentrations ranging from 45 to 70 μg l fig 9 no significant differences with respect to haa fp exist among the filter effluents themselves overall the dbp fps from bench φ1 and bench φ2 effluents are statistically similar to the pilot scale biofilter effluent and as a result neither the primacy of mass transport resistance nor the primacy of biofilm shear loss can be concluded as such the scaled biofilter design can acceptably mimic pilot scale biofilters with respect to dbp fp and could be a useful tool for drinking water treatment facilities 4 discussion despite advances in biofilter monitoring and operation understanding and improving treatment performance still relies heavily on site specific studies these are typically performed as pilot scale studies which require a great deal of infrastructure and resources this study applied a model developed by manem and rittmann 1990 which provides a methodology for scaling biofilm processes from prototype i e full or pilot scale to bench scale for more economical testing this model was tested previously on nitrifying biofilters manem and rittmann 1990 and the current study progressed the science by determining model applicability with respect to the removal of organics the results of this study showed that biofilm shear loss has primacy over mass transport resistance in this system previous studies have examined the impact of shear stress on biofilm systems and observed that shear stress plays a major role in determining physical structure and community composition fang et al 2017 paul et al 2012 stoodley et al 2002 dunsmore et al 2002 specifically it has been demonstrated that increased applied shear stress results in thinner denser biofilms that are more strongly attached to their support structure while decreasing shear stress results is less dense biofilms that are more susceptible to sloughing paul et al 2012 furthermore differences in shear stress have been shown to have significant impacts on the biofilm community composition fang et al 2017 rochex et al 2008 these results support the results of the current study thus if the applied shear stress in the bench scale biofilters is not equivalent to the shear stress in the pilot scale biofilters differences in effluent water quality would be expected the importance of shear stress was demonstrated in the results of this study where the bench scale biofilters designed according to the primacy of mass transport resistance i e assuming biofilm shear loss was insignificant did not show the same treatment performance as the pilot scale biofilters with respect to doc or humics differences in applied shear stress in this situation likely resulted in fundamental changes to the biofilm that limited its ability to degrade organic compounds consistent with results described by others liu and tay 2002 one limitation of testing the scaling model on our particular biofilters is that these biofilters did not need to be backwashed routinely due to the upstream membrane filtration process thus the scaling model also should be tested on biofilters that require a more typical backwash frequency previous biofiltration studies have examined the shear stress applied through backwash and determined that significant reductions in active biomass occur emelko et al 2006 stoddart et al 2016 based on those studies it can be expected that shear stress applied during filtration also might play a significant role in biofilter performance particularly if backwash is required prior to the biofilm reaching a pseudo steady state condition another potential limitation of the scaling model is related to practical considerations to streamline application of the model for more routine use it would be valuable for practitioners to have a series of reliable sphericity values for the most commonly used gac media types and sieve sizes so that these do not need to be measured in each new study overall this study validated a methodology that could be applied by engineers and researchers to test biofilter performance at a reduced cost and complexity as compared to pilot scale studies this development will make biofilter testing accessible to facilities that were previously limited by the cost of pilot scale studies and it will allow researchers to expand existing biofiltration studies without significantly increasing costs specifically due to the lower cost and maintenance requirements of bench scale filters we anticipate that researchers will be able to operate multiple bench scale filters simultaneously providing the ability to test many more operating conditions than would be possible during a pilot scale study the results collected from bench scale biofilters will allow even small water providers to test potential improvements to their biofilters 5 conclusions pilot scale biofiltration studies commonly are used to provide design and optimization information for full scale biofiltration but they are costly and complex to conduct in this study we utilized a previously developed scaling model to determine if bench scale biofilters could accurately simulate pilot scale biofilter performance for the removal of organics one set of bench scale biofilters was designed with respect to the primacy of mass transport resistance φ1 in which biofilm shear loss is assumed to be insignificant a second set of bench scale biofilters was designed with respect to the primacy of biofilm shear loss φ2 where mass transport resistance is assumed to be insignificant the following conclusions were drawn bench and pilot scale filters were demonstrated to be biologically active on the basis of atp content esterase and phosphatase activities and eps content the ratio of phosphatase activity to esterase activity suggested that bench scale biofilters designed on the primacy of biofilm shear loss is appropriate the microbial communities in the bench scale and pilot scale biofilters were similar particularly under the steady state conditions thereby satisfying a key assumption of the manem and rittmann 1990 model that the same types of microorganisms are present in the prototype and scaled processes the performance of bench scale biofilters designed around the primacy of biofilm shear loss φ2 for the removal of doc humics thm fp and haa fp was statistically indistinguishable from that of the pilot scale biofilters in contrast bench scale biofilters designed around the primacy of mass transport resistance φ1 were unable to simulate pilot scale performance for the removal of doc and humics however their thm fp and haa fp removals were statistically indistinguishable from that at pilot scale hence to simulate pilot scale performance for the removal of doc humics thm fp and haa fp in this system bench scale biofilters designed on the primacy of biofilm shear loss is appropriate effluent water quality was similar between bench and pilot scale biofilters under high and low flow challenge conditions indicating that the bench scale filters are readily able to adapt to changing operating conditions and are suitable for mimicking full scale operation future studies are necessary to examine how the frequency of backwashing impacts the choice of scaling criterion i e if biofilm shear loss maintains primacy overall these results suggest that it is reasonable to use bench scale biofilters as a proxy for pilot scale biofilters removing organics with the advantage of providing simplicity and lower inherent

19056,to provide information for the design and improvement of full scale biofilters pilot scale biofiltration studies are the current industry standard because they utilize the same filter media size and loading rate as the full scale biofilters in the current study bench scale biofilters were designed according to a biofilter scaling model from the literature and the ability of the bench scale biofilters to accurately represent the organics removal of pilot scale biofilters was tested to ensure similarity in effluent water quality between bench and pilot or full scale biofilters at the same influent substrate concentration the tested model requires that either mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss takes primacy over the other the potential primacy of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss was evaluated via water quality testing dissolved organic carbon specific ultraviolet absorbance liquid chromatography organic carbon detection trihalomethane formation potential and haloacetic acid formation potential the biofilters also were characterized for adenosine triphosphate atp content enzyme activity extracellular polymeric substances and microbial community structure the results of this study indicate that biofilm shear loss takes primacy over mass transport resistance for bench scale biofilter design in this system thus bench scale biofilters designed in this manner accurately represent organics removal in pilot scale biofilters applying this scaling procedure can reduce filter media requirements from many kilograms to just a few grams and daily water requirements from thousands of liters to less than 10 l this scaling procedure will allow future researchers to test alternative treatment designs and operating conditions without the need for expensive pilot scale studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilter scaling procedure bench scale biofilters organics removal biomass characterization microbial community analysis enzyme activity 1 introduction biofiltration is becoming a popular drinking water treatment technology because it can utilize existing granular filter media and produce high quality water without additional chemicals fu et al 2017 typically biofilters are utilized to reduce the concentration of biodegradable organic compounds that otherwise might result in microbial growth in the distribution system or the formation of disinfection by products terry and summers 2018 basu et al 2016 in addition to removing natural organic matter nom biofilters also have shown the ability to remove pharmaceutically active compounds mckie et al 2016 zearley and summers 2012 taste and odor compounds beniwal et al 2018 and nutrients nemani et al 2018 although biofiltration has been studied extensively it still can be considered a black box technology in some respects to improve our understanding of the biological processes occurring in a biofilter advanced techniques have been applied for instance some studies have conducted microbial community or metagenomics analyses to characterize the composition and structure of the microbial community nemani et al 2018 li et al 2017 oh et al 2018 others have sought to quantify biofilter function by measuring enzyme activity directly associated with the degradation of specific substrates lautenschlager et al 2014 sharma et al 2018 these methods have provided greater insight regarding the bacteria and processes occurring in drinking water biofilters pilot scale biofiltration studies often are used to acquire additional site specific data to inform the design and operation of biofilters such pilot scale biofilters represent the current industry standard because they utilize the same filter media size and loading rate as the full scale biofilters unfortunately pilot scale studies are expensive due to the cost of infrastructure operation and maintenance kawamura 2000 as such the water treatment industry needs a less costly means to evaluate biofiltration when bench scale biofilters are employed they typically are designed to match the empty bed contact time ebct of the full scale process and the filter media size bed diameter and bed depth are chosen to minimize wall effects however these simple guidelines generally are insufficient to yield bench scale results that accurately reflect full scale performance to bridge this gap manem and rittmann 1990 formulated a scaling model such that bench scale biofilm processes could be designed to accurately reflect the treatment performance of larger scale prototype biofilm processes i e pilot or full scale when the microorganisms process configuration and temperature are the same between the bench scale and prototype processes thus the scaling model results in a bench scale design that produces the same effluent substrate concentration as the prototype process their model is based on satisfying the following three similitude criteria ф1 substrate concentration at the biofilm surface ф2 rate of biofilm shear loss ф3 substrate mass balance manem and rittmann 1990 noted that it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy all three criteria for a given influent substrate concentration e g dissolved organic carbon doc unless either external mass transport ф1 or biofilm shear loss ф2 is deemed insignificant if mass transport resistance has primacy i e biofilm shear loss is insignificant then ф1 and ф3 must be satisfied when the influent substrate concentration to the prototype and bench scale biofilters is the same if biofilm shear loss has primacy i e mass transport resistance is insignificant then ф2 and ф3 must be satisfied when the influent substrate concentration to the prototype and bench scale biofilters is the same for a bench scale biofilter the model yields an ebct calculated according to ф3 and a flow rate and bed depth calculated with respect to ф1 or ф2 this scaling procedure was reported manem and rittmann 1990 to substantially reduce the volume of filter media from liters pilot scale to milliliters bench scale and the amount of water required from thousands of liters per day to less than 10 l per day the objective of the current study was to evaluate the applicability of the biofiltration scaling procedure described by manem and rittmann 1990 to design bench scale biofilters that accurately represent organics removal in pilot scale biofilters because organics removal is one of the primary goals of drinking water biofiltration pilot scale and bench scale biofilters were directly compared with respect to performance removal of doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and disinfection by product formation potential dbp fp under typical flow conditions as well as under challenge conditions that represent seasonal changes in flow to confirm the model assumption of having similar microbial communities in the bench and pilot scale biofilters the activities of particular enzymes the concentration of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the composition of the microbial communities were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of full scale pilot scale and bench scale biofilters this study was conducted at the georgina water treatment plant ontario canada at full scale lake simcoe water is treated with ultrafiltration uf ge zeeweed1000 ultraviolet uv disinfection trojan 40 mj cm2 and biologically active granular activated carbon gac filtration the full scale filter media calgon f300 8 30 mesh has been in operation since 2003 as upstream uf was incorporated for particle removal the gac filters primarily serve as biological contactors the pilot scale biofilters were constructed with filter media obtained from the full scale biofilters and were operated with influent water following uf and uv treatment from the full scale system prior to the current study the pilot scale biofilters had been in operation for three years one pilot scale biofilter was operated with a flow rate of 300 ml min representative of the minimum ebct 15 min utilized at full scale and a second pilot scale biofilter was operated at 150 ml min representative of the maximum ebct 30 min fig 1 similar to full scale the pilot scale biofilters served primarily as biological contactors as such they only required backwashing every two to three months to eliminate air binding backwash consisted of 2 min of low wash 25 bed expansion 8 min of high wash 50 bed expansion and 2 min of low wash to allow the media to settle for the three years before the current study was initiated the pilot scale biofilters showed constant doc removal this suggests that the adsorption capacity of the gac is exhausted and that the removal of organics is largely due to biodegradation in the pilot scale biofilters this study examined two bench scale biofilter designs operated in duplicate fig 1 to determine if either mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss could be deemed insignificant one set of bench scale biofilters was designed on the basis of mass transport resistance primacy bench φ1 while the other set was designed on the basis of biofilm shear loss primacy bench φ2 a side stream of the influent to the pilot scale biofilters was pumped using a masterflex ls digital drive peristaltic pump cole parmer montreal qc to the bench scale biofilters pilot scale biofilter media was ground with a mortar and pestle sieved and the 30 40 mesh fraction was utilized for the bench scale studies since the bench scale biofilters were filled with media from the pilot scale biofilters it is expected that the removal of organics is largely due to biodegradation in the bench scale biofilters bench scale biofilters were backwashed on the same day as their counterparts at the pilot scale 2 2 filter media characterization bed porosities were determined for pilot and bench scale biofilters as follows 1 ε 1 m p ρ p a l 0 where mp total mass of particles in

cylinder such that water displacement could be observed ten replicates were performed to calculate an average particle density sphericity was determined using a method described by hunce et al 2016

manem and rittmann 1990 model based on previous biofilm models manem and rittmann 1990 developed three similitude criteria to accurately scale a biofilm process to produce the same effluent concentration in the prototype original and scaled processes for the rate limiting substrate the model assumes the following same types of microorganisms same process configuration and same temperature in the prototype and scaled processes the similitude criteria are outlined briefly below but their full derivations can be found in manem and rittmann 1990 the first similitude criterion is that the concentration of substrate at the biofilm surface φ1 is the same in the prototype and scaled processes meaning that the processes have the same flux into the biofilm and the same external mass transport resistance this criterion is defined as 3 φ 1 d p 0 67 v 0 33 ε where dp diameter of filter medium collectors l v superficial flow velocity through the filter l t ε porosity of the filter the second similitude criterion is that the biofilm shear loss rate φ2 is the same in the prototype and scaled processes meaning that the processes have the same total attached biomass per unit area of the filter medium this criterion is defined as 4 φ 2 v 1 ε ψ d p ε 3 where ψ shape factor for filter medium collectors the third similitude criterion is that substrate mass balance φ3 is the same in the prototype and scaled processes this criterion is defined as 5 φ 3 1 ε θ d p ψ where θ empty bed contact time t these three similitude criteria cannot be satisfied simultaneously at a single influent substrate concentration however in some situations φ1 or φ2 takes primacy i e if mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss respectively is more important than the other in the reactor of interest in that case a single influent substrate concentration can be used for the prototype and scaled reactors in this work we tested whether φ1 or φ2 would demonstrate primacy over the other in drinking water biofilters used for organics removal thus to evaluate the potential primacy of mass transport resistance similitude criteria φ1 and φ3 were used to design the scaled biofilter to evaluate the potential primacy of biofilm shear loss similitude criteria φ2 and φ3 were used to design the scaled biofilter 2 4 phase i scaling acclimation and sampling of bench scale biofilters under typical flow conditions biofilters were examined in phase i under conditions representing typical flow i e loading rate in the full scale plant six bench scale biofilters glass columns 20 cm long 1 08 cm inner diameter were operated in parallel and scaled on the basis of the pilot scale biofilter table 1 three biofilters utilized a flow rate and bed depth as dictated by ф1 i e assuming biofilm shear loss was insignificant and the other three followed ф2 i e assuming mass transport resistance was insignificant for each set of three biofilters two served as replicates for water quality and biomass measurements and the third not shown in fig 1 was operated to provide replacement acclimated gac to the other two biofilters following each granular media sampling event due to the grinding and sieving of the media for the bench scale biofilters low initial biomass coverage was anticipated in phase i to reduce start up time 4 l of filter influent was recirculated in each bench scale biofilter for one week subsequently the bench scale biofilters were operated in once through mode subsequently influent and effluent water quality from the pilot and bench scale biofilters was monitored to assess acclimation pilot scale effluent was collected at a depth of 45 cm per the conditions shown in table 1 that location was chosen for sampling because previous work demonstrated that the bulk of the biological activity in these biofilters occurred in the top 45 cm samples were collected weekly and analyzed for doc uv254 ph turbidity po4 p and nh4 n acclimation of the bench scale biofilters was assumed once the concentrations for these six parameters were 10 different between the bench and pilot scale biofilters for each sampling event water was collected from the bench scale biofilters over a period of 24 h due to their low flow rates and similar samples were collected at pilot scale due to the amount of media required for analysis 4 g 50 and 1 of the media from the bench scale and pilot scale biofilters respectively was harvested per sampling event media collected at the bench scale represents a composite across the filter depth pilot scale media was collected at 5 25

at 18 c during the challenge phase biomass dynamics e g changes in atp enzyme activity and community composition due to altering operation are an important aspect of biofilter response to the challenge conditions however due to the media sampling requirements for these parameters 3 g 50 of the bench scale filter media monitoring biomass dynamics was infeasible as such no filter media

effluent water quality and biomass esterase activity atp phosphatase activity atp phosphatase activity esterase activity eps proteins polysaccharides and effluent values of doc suva humics thm fp and haa fp were conducted specifically a paired student s t test with a 95 confidence interval was applied if biofilter bench φ1 is significantly different from the pilot biofilter then mass transport resistance does not have primacy over biofilm shear loss in this system if biofilter bench φ2 is significantly different from the pilot biofilter then biofilm shear loss does not have primacy over mass transport resistance in this system if bench φ1 and φ2 produced a statistically similar result for a particular water quality or biomass parameter then that parameter was identified as being unaffected by the specifics of the scaling model i e primacy of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss in addition the same statistical tests were applied to filter influent and effluent to determine if the removal of organics was significant a two tailed test was utilized to determine any differences between observed values all statistical tests included results from both typical flow as well as challenge conditions p values reported in this study indicate the level at which a relationship would show a significant difference i e the higher the p value the more likely it is that the compared values are the same 3 results 3 1 atp enzyme activities and eps on media all biofilter samples had concentrations of atp 100 ng g media fig 2 which has been previously reported as a threshold value to designate biologically active filtration pharand et al 2014 atp concentrations were generally similar when comparing the pilot and bench scale biofilters p 0 6 and p 0 8 for bench φ1 and φ2 respectively with no definitive trend observed with respect to temperature the manem and rittmann model is predicated on having the same biomass per unit area so the results shown in fig 2 were expected overall neither mass transport nor biofilm shear loss significantly impacted atp concentrations when the bench scale filters were compared to each other biological function was assessed by examining the activity of six enzymes esterase phosphatase chitinase α glucosidase xylosidase cellobiohydrolase only esterase and phosphatase activities were quantifiable 0 02 μm min figs 3 and 4 in both bench and pilot scale systems esterase activity was approximately one order of magnitude higher when compared to phosphatase similar to results presented by lautenschlager et al 2014 esterase activity was observed to be independent of temperature whereas phosphatase activity was significantly lower p 0 001 during cold water conditions 3 5 c when compared to warm water conditions 12 c the impact of temperature on phosphatase activity was statistically similar p 0 05 for all filters esterase activity per gram of pilot scale media was higher than that per gram of bench scale media to eliminate differences in filter media surface area between the bench and pilot scale biofilters esterase activity was normalized to the active biomass atp the ratio of esterase activity to atp showed no significant difference between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ1 p 0 27 or between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ2 p 0 24 these results suggest that the bench scale biofilters accurately represent the pilot scale biofilter with respect to esterase activity normalized to atp with no sensitivity to the assumption of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss primacy table 3 similarly phosphatase activity did not show any difference between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ1 p 0 92 or the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ2 p 0 83 when normalized to atp these results suggest that the bench scale biofilters accurately represent the pilot scale biofilter with respect to phosphatase activity normalized to atp with no sensitivity to the assumption of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss primacy table 3 the ratio of phosphatase activity to esterase activity also was calculated for the bench and pilot scale biofilters when compared to the pilot scale biofilter 0 07 0 02 bench φ1 0 12 0 05 was significantly higher p 0 04 while bench φ2 0 11 0 05 p 0 07 was statistically similar these results suggest that assuming the primacy of mass transport resistance is inappropriate table 3 eps values for bench and pilot scale biofilters are shown in figs 5 and 6 under typical flow conditions both the bench and pilot scale biofilters showed increases in eps polysaccharides and proteins as temperature increased from 3 5 to 20 c the dominance of eps proteins over polysaccharides is common for drinking water biofilters keithley and kirisits 2018 eps polysaccharides were generally similar for both pilot and bench scale media eps proteins were higher on pilot scale biofilter media extracts for typical flow condition samples and similar for challenge conditions previous literature examined the ratio of eps proteins to polysaccharides and found a similar ratio regardless of media type or pre treatment keithley and kirisits 2018 in the current study the eps protein to polysaccharide ratio was not significantly different between the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ1 p 0 30 or the pilot scale biofilter and bench φ2 p 0 27 these results suggest that neither mass transport resistance nor biofilm shear loss has primacy based on the eps protein to polysaccharide ratio table 3 overall biological characterization indicated that the bench and pilot scale filters were biologically active and had similarities with respect to enzymatic function and eps no conclusive evidence was gained with respect to identifying which of the two scaling criteria has primacy in this system indicating that biofilm characterization was insensitive to the scaling procedure in this system 3 2 microbial community structure on media the scaling model examined in this study assumes that the same types of microorganisms occur in both the prototype and scaled filters manem and rittmann 1990 fig 7 shows the microbial communities at the phylum class and order levels in the bench and pilot scale biofilters where 91 96 of the otus in a given sample classified into a taxonomic group containing at least 0 5 of the sequences among these otus all of the samples shared the same five taxonomies at the phylum level and the same 10 taxonomies at the class level the samples also shared the same 19 taxonomies at the order level additionally four of the samples bench ф1 and pilot scale biofilters during steady state conditions at 12 c and challenge conditions at 18 c contained the same additional group at the order level considering the relative abundances shown in fig 7 the bench scale biofilter communities appear similar to those at pilot scale under steady state conditions this similarity is not as strong under the short term challenge conditions suggesting that some changes in community structure might occur with seasonal flow variation alpha diversity based on abundance and evenness was calculated with the shannon diversity index and utilized all otus the shannon diversity index ranged between 4 9 and 5 4 for bench ф1 5 3 and 5 6 for bench ф2 and 4 9 and 5 2 for the pilot scale biofilter these values suggest that the microbial communities of the bench and pilot scale biofilters had similarly high diversity overall these data support the model assumption that the microbial communities in the bench scale biofilters are similar to those in the pilot scale biofilters during steady state conditions additionally the microbial communities in both the bench and pilot scale biofilters fig 7 show similarities to microbial communities observed in other drinking water biofilters pinto et al 2012 where proteobacteria is the dominant phylum and alphaproteobacteria is the dominant order in that phylum lautenschlager et al 2014 liao et al 2013 oh et al 2018 3 3 water quality characterization to determine if bench scale biofilters could accurately represent effluent organic water quality from pilot scale biofilters samples were collected to compare doc suva organic fractionation by lc ocd thm fp and haa fp doc consumption occurred across the biofilters fig 8 as evidenced by the significant difference in the influent and effluent doc concentrations under typical flow and challenge conditions table 4 the statistically significant difference in effluent doc between bench scale φ1 and the pilot scale biofilter table 4 suggests that mass transport resistance does not have primacy over biofilm shear loss in this system table 3 this is consistent with the thin biofilms 8 μm generally observed in drinking water biofilters dimas 2016 furthermore the statistical similarity in effluent doc between bench φ2 and the pilot scale biofilter table 4 suggests that biofilm shear loss has primacy over mass transport resistance in this system table 3 all biofilters had effluent suva values that were statistically similar to the influent as well as to each other table 4 this was anticipated because the suva values were relatively low in the biofilter influent suva 1 7 and uv254 absorbance generally decreased proportionally with doc as suva is an indicator of organic aromaticity the observation of similar suva values indicates that biofilters do not preferentially reduce aromatic compounds consistent with archer and singer 2006 in addition to assessing bulk doc concentrations organic fractionation was completed using lc ocd humic substances were significantly removed by the pilot biofilter table 4 the other four organic fractions were statistically similar between the influent and effluents and among biofilter effluents limited biopolymer removal has been reported by biofilters in previous studies nemani et al 2016 humic substances are generally the most prevalent sub fraction of doc typically 60 and as such low removals of humics by biofiltration limits potential overall organics removal mckie et al 2015 bench scale biofilters did not significantly remove humics when compared to the influent 1 9 1 6 and 2 8 4 1 mean standard deviation for bench φ1 and bench φ2 respectively in contrast to the pilot scale biofilter 5 9 1 6 a significant difference exists between the effluent humics concentration from bench φ1 and the pilot scale biofilter this is in contrast to the lack of significant difference between the effluent humics concentration from bench φ2 and the pilot scale biofilter table 4 thus similar to the results observed with respect to doc the humics data suggest that biofilm shear loss has primacy table 3 as humic substances were the most prevalent of the organic species measured by lc ocd it is unsurprising that similar trends were observed between humic substances and doc both bench and pilot scale filters reduced thm fp although the effluent thm fp from bench φ2 was not significantly different from the influent table 4 this was attributed to one sampling event where an increase in thm fp was observed when this event was excluded the effluent thm fp from bench φ2 is significantly different from the influent p 0 02 based on a paired t test neither the bench or pilot scale biofilters removed a significant amount of haa fp table 4 haa fp varied substantially through the study with influent concentrations ranging from 45 to 70 μg l fig 9 no significant differences with respect to haa fp exist among the filter effluents themselves overall the dbp fps from bench φ1 and bench φ2 effluents are statistically similar to the pilot scale biofilter effluent and as a result neither the primacy of mass transport resistance nor the primacy of biofilm shear loss can be concluded as such the scaled biofilter design can acceptably mimic pilot scale biofilters with respect to dbp fp and could be a useful tool for drinking water treatment facilities 4 discussion despite advances in biofilter monitoring and operation understanding and improving treatment performance still relies heavily on site specific studies these are typically performed as pilot scale studies which require a great deal of infrastructure and resources this study applied a model developed by manem and rittmann 1990 which provides a methodology for scaling biofilm processes from prototype i e full or pilot scale to bench scale for more economical testing this model was tested previously on nitrifying biofilters manem and rittmann 1990 and the current study progressed the science by determining model applicability with respect to the removal of organics the results of this study showed that biofilm shear loss has primacy over mass transport resistance in this system previous studies have examined the impact of shear stress on biofilm systems and observed that shear stress plays a major role in determining physical structure and community composition fang et al 2017 paul et al 2012 stoodley et al 2002 dunsmore et al 2002 specifically it has been demonstrated that increased applied shear stress results in thinner denser biofilms that are more strongly attached to their support structure while decreasing shear stress results is less dense biofilms that are more susceptible to sloughing paul et al 2012 furthermore differences in shear stress have been shown to have significant impacts on the biofilm community composition fang et al 2017 rochex et al 2008 these results support the results of the current study thus if the applied shear stress in the bench scale biofilters is not equivalent to the shear stress in the pilot scale biofilters differences in effluent water quality would be expected the importance of shear stress was demonstrated in the results of this study where the bench scale biofilters designed according to the primacy of mass transport resistance i e assuming biofilm shear loss was insignificant did not show the same treatment performance as the pilot scale biofilters with respect to doc or humics differences in applied shear stress in this situation likely resulted in fundamental changes to the biofilm that limited its ability to degrade organic compounds consistent with results described by others liu and tay 2002 one limitation of testing the scaling model on our particular biofilters is that these biofilters did not need to be backwashed routinely due to the upstream membrane filtration process thus the scaling model also should be tested on biofilters that require a more typical backwash frequency previous biofiltration studies have examined the shear stress applied through backwash and determined that significant reductions in active biomass occur emelko et al 2006 stoddart et al 2016 based on those studies it can be expected that shear stress applied during filtration also might play a significant role in biofilter performance particularly if backwash is required prior to the biofilm reaching a pseudo steady state condition another potential limitation of the scaling model is related to practical considerations to streamline application of the model for more routine use it would be valuable for practitioners to have a series of reliable sphericity values for the most commonly used gac media types and sieve sizes so that these do not need to be measured in each new study overall this study validated a methodology that could be applied by engineers and researchers to test biofilter performance at a reduced cost and complexity as compared to pilot scale studies this development will make biofilter testing accessible to facilities that were previously limited by the cost of pilot scale studies and it will allow researchers to expand existing biofiltration studies without significantly increasing costs specifically due to the lower cost and maintenance requirements of bench scale filters we anticipate that researchers will be able to operate multiple bench scale filters simultaneously providing the ability to test many more operating conditions than would be possible during a pilot scale study the results collected from bench scale biofilters will allow even small water providers to test potential improvements to their biofilters 5 conclusions pilot scale biofiltration studies commonly are used to provide design and optimization information for full scale biofiltration but they are costly and complex to conduct in this study we utilized a previously developed scaling model to determine if bench scale biofilters could accurately simulate pilot scale biofilter performance for the removal of organics one set of bench scale biofilters was designed with respect to the primacy of mass transport resistance φ1 in which biofilm shear loss is assumed to be insignificant a second set of bench scale biofilters was designed with respect to the primacy of biofilm shear loss φ2 where mass transport resistance is assumed to be insignificant the following conclusions were drawn bench and pilot scale filters were demonstrated to be biologically active on the basis of atp content esterase and phosphatase activities and eps content the ratio of phosphatase activity to esterase activity suggested that bench scale biofilters designed on the primacy of biofilm shear loss is appropriate the microbial communities in the bench scale and pilot scale biofilters were similar particularly under the steady state conditions thereby satisfying a key assumption of the manem and rittmann 1990 model that the same types of microorganisms are present in the prototype and scaled processes the performance of bench scale biofilters designed around the primacy of biofilm shear loss φ2 for the removal of doc humics thm fp and haa fp was statistically indistinguishable from that of the pilot scale biofilters in contrast bench scale biofilters designed around the primacy of mass transport resistance φ1 were unable to simulate pilot scale performance for the removal of doc and humics however their thm fp and haa fp removals were statistically indistinguishable from that at pilot scale hence to simulate pilot scale performance for the removal of doc humics thm fp and haa fp in this system bench scale biofilters designed on the primacy of biofilm shear loss is appropriate effluent water quality was similar between bench and pilot scale biofilters under high and low flow challenge conditions indicating that the bench scale filters are readily able to adapt to changing operating conditions and are suitable for mimicking full scale operation future studies are necessary to examine how the frequency of backwashing impacts the choice of scaling criterion i e if biofilm shear loss maintains primacy overall these results suggest that it is reasonable to use bench scale biofilters as a proxy for pilot scale biofilters removing organics with the advantage of providing simplicity and lower inherent

19057,this study revealed that thiothrix eikelboomii a well known filamentous bacterium that causes sludge bulking could also interfere oxygen transfer during wastewater treatment the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient kla in filamentous bulking sludge fbs was found to be 43 lower than that in floc forming sludge ffs at similar biomass concentrations partially because the filamentous bacteria had increased the sludge apparent viscosity the kla value for fbs however was still significantly lower than that for ffs even if both sludges had similar apparent viscosity numerous tiny and free swimming filaments were observed to attach on the air bubble surface presumably reducing the liquid film renewal and increasing the liquid film thickness moreover the filaments were co coated with extracellular polymeric substances of protein and polysaccharide which could make them performing like amphiphilic molecules of surfactants to hinder oxygen transfer therefore the particular surface property of filaments and their interaction with air bubbles could also impact oxygen transfer thiothrix eikelboomii was identified to be the responsible filamentous bacterium that lowered the kla value while other filamentous bacteria with short filaments did not interfere oxygen transfer this study implies that controlling sludge bulking benefits not only sludge settling but also oxygen

daigger and boltz 2018 the effects of mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration surfactants mixing intensity salts temperature and viscosity on the oxygen transfer from air to water have been

decreased by approximately 50 when filamentous bulking occurred liu et al 2018 filamentous microorganisms were hypothesized to be the troublemakers unfortunately the mechanisms behind this phenomenon were not clear filamentous microorganisms occur in the activated sludge process commonly which are notorious for decreasing sludge settling ability however their effect on the oxygen transfer has been rarely reported the significant decrease in the ote along with the occurrence of filamentous bulking could result from the dissolved contents and or the sludge solids the shift in the dominant

filamentous microorganism that will interfere the oxygen transfer 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge samples sludge samples for fbs and ffs were respectively collected from two pilot scale dynamic membrane bioreactors which were fed with simulated domestic wastewater the effluent cod turbidity and ammonia for both reactors were below 20 mg l 1 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu and 1 mg l respectively the activated sludge in one reactor had very good settling ability with sludge volume index svi of less than 80 ml g mlss while the sludge in the other reactor had poor settling ability with a svi value of greater than 200 ml g mlss the mlss concentrations for fbs and ffs in the corresponding bioreactors were approximately 1800 mg l and 3200 mg l respectively more operation information for both reactors are given in table s1 filamentous microorganisms were present in the fbs sludge fig 1 which was observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix53 tokyo japan 2 2 oxygen transfer tests the oxygen transfer characteristics i e the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient kla and α factor for both sludge samples were determined using a dynamic testing method metcalf and eddy 2003 to evaluate the effect of the soluble substrates e g smps the oxygen transfer tests were also conducted for the effluent from both reactors and the tap water all of the oxygen transfer tests were conducted in measuring cylinders with an effective volume of 2 5 l 87 mm in diameter and 475 mm in height a fine bubble diffuser was placed at the bottom of the measuring cylinder for aeration when testing the oxygen transfer in activated sludge the samples were aerated sufficiently in advance to remove the residual soluble cod and ammonium after that the decrease in the do concentration along with time were recorded using a ysi 550a do meter since the activated sludge was in endogenous respiration phase the oxygen uptake rate was a constant value which could be determined based on linear regression when the do concentration became below 1 0 mg l aeration at a fixed airflow rate started and the change in the do concentration as a function of time was recorded during the oxygen transfer tests for the effluent and tap water moderated amount of sodium sulfite and cobalt chloride were initially added to deplete the do in the water before aeration the solution temperature was also recorded for each test which was used to correct the effect of temperature on the kla values the oxygen transfer characteristics for both types of sludge were firstly tested at a similar mlss of approximately 1800 mg l under different volumetric airflow rates of 4 8 9 6 and 19 2 l air l water h in addition the oxygen transfer characteristics in both sludge samples were tested under different mlss concentrations between 900 and 8000 mg l for the same aeration intensity of 9 6 l air l water h in these tests the sludge samples were diluted with bioreactor effluent or concentrated by gravity settling or membrane filtration the kla values for tape water under different airflow rates were also tested to estimate the α factors in the activated sludge and reactor effluents the equations used to determine the kla 20 values and α factors were described in the supporting information the kla values determined in the measuring cylinders were not referred to the ordinary hydraulic depth in the real wastewater treatment processes however they were effective to compare the oxygen transfer property in fbs and ffs 2 3 apparent viscosity measurement the apparent viscosity of both sludge samples with various mlss concentrations from 900 to 8000 mg l and the effluents from both reactors were measured by a rotational viscometer ndj 5s bonsai instrument technology co ltd shanghai china with spindle 0 the measurement was conducted under a room temperature of approximately 22 c during the test the spindle was inserted into a breaker 114 mm in diameter and 155 mm in height that contained one litter sample before measurement the level of the viscometer was adjusted to ensure that the instrument was in horizontal condition and the spindle mark was parallel with the liquid level of the test sample according to the operation manual table s2 a rotating speed of 60 rmp was used when the measured viscosity was less than 10 mpa s when it was between 20 and 50 mpa s a rotating speed of 12 rmp was used the shear rate was proportional to rotating speed according to the correlation between the shear rate and the rotating speed provided by the manufacture and reference nittami et al 2013 the shear rates were 61 8 s 1 and 12 4 s 1 at the rotating speeds of 60 and 12 rpm respectively each measurement was conducted in triplicates because the activated sludge with a solids concentration above approximately 2 exhibits non newtonian behavior eftekharzadeh et al 2007 the measured viscosity of sludge samples represented the apparent viscosity μap 2 4 smp and tb eps analysis the contents of smp and tight bound extracellular polymer substances tb eps in both fbs and ffs were measured heat treatment method was used to extract eps which was recognized as one of the most effective methods with less disruption to cells chang and lee 1998 the detailed extraction protocols was described previously ding et al 2015 in brief the activated sludge samples were firstly centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was then taken out for smp analysis the remaining biomass was re suspended with saline water 0 9 nacl solution and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for another 15 min after discharging the supernatant the left biomass was re suspended again with 0 9 nacl solution and heated in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min finally the mixed liquor was centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was used for tb eps analysis after filtration by a 0 45 μm membrane in this study the contents of smp and eps were normalized as the sum of carbohydrate and protein since they are the main components in both smp and eps liu and fang 2002 the carbohydrate in smp and eps was measured using the h2so4 anthranone oxidation method with glucose as standard dubois et al 1956 the protein was determined by using a modified lowry method with bsa bovine serum albumin sigma fraction v 96 as the standard frolund et al 1996 2 5 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm analysis fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc concanavalin a cona and calcofluor white cw were used to stain and probe the proteins α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides respectively yu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 both types of activated sludge were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs solution to remove smp then 50 μl of mixed liquor was placed in a 200 μl centrifuge tube the sludge sample was first stained with 50 μl of fitc solution 10 g l for 30 min before which a bit of sodium bicarbonate 1 m buffer was added to maintain ph of 9 and to keep the amine group in a non protonated form next 50 μl of con a solution 0 25 g l was added into the centrifuge tube and incubate for 30 min again finally 50 μl of calcofluor white 0 3 g l was added and incubate for another 30 min after each staining step pbs solution was utilized to wash the labeled sample several times to remove the extra probes a scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm880 germany was applied to capture the structure of sludge samples and the distribution of eps components the specific operating conditions and parameters are shown as table s1 the fluorescence intensity of different contents was analyzed and calculated using image pro plus 6 0 and zeiss confocal software zen 2 0 2 6 observing the contact of sludge floc with air bubble it will be ideal to directly observe the interaction between the floc and the rising air bubbles unfortunately a suitable approach was not found in this study the contact of sludge floc with air bubble was observed under a motionless condition a nest glass bottom dish was used to hold the mixed liquor the external diameter was 35 mm and the bottom dish had a diameter of 15 mm when the bottom dish was filled with the mixed liquor an air bubble 3 5 mm in diameter was developed using a pipette then a coverslip was used to cover the bottom dish and trap the air bubble inside the mixed liquor then the contact of sludge floc with the air bubble in fbs or ffs was observed by an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix53 tokyo japan 2 7 microbial community analysis the bacterial community for each sludge was analyzed in duplicate considering some filamentous microorganisms may be fungi the fungal community was also characterized based on the its1 region power soil dna isolation kit anbiosic shenzhen china was used to extract the dna the quality and quantity of the dna were checked using gel electrophoresis and nanodrop 2000 micro spectrophotometry thermo scientific usa respectively subsequently the extracted dna was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification the hypervariable v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using the universal primers of 338f and 806r the its1 region of 18s rrna genes were amplified with primers of its1f and its2 lindahl et al 2013 nilsson et al 2009 xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 pcr amplification for both 16s and 18s were conducted in a veriti fast abpcr usa under the following condition initial denaturation at 95 c for 5 min 25 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 50 c for 30 s and 72 c for 3 replicates 40 s and final extension at 72 c for 7 min after purification using ampure xp beads vazyme nanjing china the pcr amplicons were amplified for another round finally equal concentrations of purified dna fragment for each sample were sequenced by the illumina hiseq 2500 platform which was conducted by biomarker technologies beijing china after hiseq sequencing the reads for each sample were merged using flash software version 1 2 7 magoc and salzberg 2011 to obtain raw tags then the raw tags were purified by filtering out the low quality or ambiguous sequences using trimmomatic software version 0 33 bolger et al 2014 and obtain the clean tags finally uchime software version 4 2 edgar et al 2011 was used to authenticate and exclude chimeras sequences to get effective tags for further analyses the effective tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a similarity threshold of 97 using uclust methods edgar 2010 embraced in qiime caporaso et al 2010 the taxonomic classification of otus was assigned based on the ribosomal database project rdp classifier with silva and unite databases for bacterial and eukaryotic communities respectively the data for the abundance of bacteria and fungi at different levels were processed on the bmk cloud online platform biomarker technologies beijing china 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxygen transfer characteristics in fbs and ffs two membrane bioreactors were operated in our laboratory in one reactor the ote decreased abruptly without any changes in the aeration conditions meanwhile the sludge settling ability became poor with svi values of greater than 200 ml g mlss excessive filamentous microorganisms were found in this activated sludge fig 1 a the ote in the other reactor kept normal and the sludge settled well with svi value of less than 80 ml g mlss therefore we inferred that the decreasing ote was associated with the filamentous bulking as expected fig 2 a both activated sludges had poorer oxygen transfer characteristics than the tape water and effluent did suggesting that the activated sludge would hinder oxygen transfer during aeration at a similar mlss concentration of approximately 1800 mg l however the do concentration increased significantly faster in the ffs than that in the fbs the kla 20 values for fbs and ffs were determined to be 5 68 and 10 02 h 1 respectively this indicates that the overall oxygen mass transfer rate in the fbs was 43 3 lower than that in the ffs under the same aeration condition fig 2 b shows that increasing the volumetric airflow rate had significantly increased the kla 20 values for both sludges however the kla 20 values and α factors in fbs were always lower than those in ffs under the same aeration intensity fig 2 a and c this confirmed that the fbs with excessive filamentous microorganisms had much worse oxygen transfer property than ffs did 3 2 effect of dissolved contents on oxygen transfer the differences in the oxygen transfer characteristics in fbs and ffs could result from the dissolved contents produced by the microbes and or the biomass solids as shown in fig 2 a both reactor effluents had very similar kla 20 values with tap water suggesting that the dissolved contents in both sludge samples had insignificant impact on the oxygen transfer smps mainly including protein and polysaccharide are the major soluble constituents for well treated effluent barker and stuckey 1999 wang and zhang 2010 xie et al 2012 their combined concentrations in both reactor effluents were similar and less than 5 mg l fig 2 d which were too low to pose negative impact on oxygen transfer wei et al 2015 though the biosurfactants were not measured the similar kla 20 values in both effluents and the tape water suggested that the microbes in both sludge samples did not synthesize sufficient biosurfactants that could negatively impact the oxygen transfer these results suggested that the differences in the oxygen transfer characteristics for ffs and fbs mainly resulted from the biomass solids 3 3 effect of biomass solids on oxygen transfer the fbs and ffs sludge with mlss concentrations ranging from 900 to 7000 mg l possible concentrations in municipal sewage plants were examined to explore the correlation between mlss concentration and oxygen transfer characteristic kla 20 and α factor for both sludges the values of kla 20 and so as the α factor at mlss greater than 3000 mg l were significantly lower than those at mlss less than 2000 mg l it was reported that an exponential correlation could be used to describe the kla 20 value or α factor as a function of mlss concentration for the same type of activated sludge with an extended mlss range from 5000 to 30 000 mg l germain et al 2007 for the data presented in fig 3 obviously one exponential like equation could not fit the kla 20 data for both fbs and ffs under a similar mlss concentration the fbs always had significantly lower kla 20 values than ffs did this suggested that in addition to biomass concentration other properties of biomass e g microbial types floc morphology apparent viscosity and biomass surface properties might have impacted the oxygen transfer a few exponential correlations between α factor and mlss concentration had been reported germain et al 2007 günder 2001 krampe and krauth 2003 muller et al 1995 rosenberger 2003 their correlations however varied significantly from case to case fig s1 these variations could partially result from the differences in testing conditions the aeration intensity diffuser types reactor dimension and mixing intensity could impact the measured kla values even with the same testing conditions inconsistent relationships between α factor and mlss concentration were observed for the sludge from different sources nittami et al 2013 henkel 2010 proposed that the difference in α factor at a given mlss concentration could be due to the difference of sludge characteristics and origins in conclusion both literature reviews and this study suggested that in addition to mlss concentration other properties of the activated sludge e g the presence of filamentous microorganisms also had a great impact on the oxygen transfer 3 4 correlations of apparent viscosity with mlss and oxygen transfer the results shown in figs 2 and 3 evidenced that the fbs with excessive filamentous microorganisms had significantly poorer oxygen transfer characteristics than ffs did our previous study additionally observed that the ote in the reactor decreased with increasing density of filamentous microorganisms liu et al 2018 therefore the occurrence of filamentous microorganisms in fbs had interfered the oxygen transfer the filamentous microorganisms in fbs had long filaments fig 1 which could impact the oxygen transfer by changing the apparent viscosity of the activated sludge therefore the apparent viscosity of fbs and ffs under various mlss concentrations were measured with results shown in fig 4 a under similar mlss concentrations the apparent viscosity of fbs was significantly greater than that of ffs moreover when the mlss concentration was greater than 3000 mg l the apparent viscosity of fbs increased exponentially however the effluents from both reactors had very similar apparent viscosity with tap water indicating that the dissolved contents in the mixed liquor did not impact the apparent viscosity therefore the filamentous microorganisms in fbs had enhanced the apparent viscosity of the mixed liquor the kla value decreased with increasing viscosity which has been well documented badino et al 2001 garcía ochoa et al 2000 özbek and gayik 2001 a greater apparent viscosity will lead to greater air bubbles which significantly reduce the specific interfacial area for oxygen transfer amaral et al 2017 badino et al 2001 garcía ochoa et al 2000 martín et al 2010 özbek and gayik 2001 the increase in the apparent viscosity would reduce the liquid film renewal by reducing the turbulence induced by rising air bubbles or stirrers which negatively impact the oxygen diffusion at the air liquid interface on the other hand the increasing apparent viscosity could promote oxygen transfer by reducing the bubble rising velocity due to a higher bubbles drag coefficient durán et al 2016 mena et al 2005 however this positive contribution could not offset the negative effects of increasing apparent viscosity on oxygen transfer and as result the kla value decreased with increasing apparent viscosity therefore filamentous microorganisms could hinder oxygen transfer by enhancing the apparent viscosity of activated sludge unlike the relationship of kla 20 value or α factor with mlss presented in fig 3 a consistency existed between apparent viscosity and kla 20 value for both sludge samples as shown by fig 4 b when the apparent viscosity was less than 5 mpa s the kla 20 values and so as α factors decreased rapidly with increasing apparent viscosity further increasing the apparent viscosity of activated sludge had less impact on the kla 20 values or α factors this exponential like correlation was in agreement with some other studies günder 2001 krampe and krauth 2003 nittami et al 2013 fig 4 b also indicated that the apparent viscosity instead of mlss concentration was the dominant factor that impacts the oxygen transfer in activated sludge undeniably a greater mlss concentration could enhance the apparent viscosity of the mixed liquor the presence of excessive filamentous microorganism however would additionally enhance the apparent viscosity 3 5 eps distribution and contact of floc with air bubble the ffs with mlss concentrations of 5500 6500 mg l apparent viscosity 2 09 2 20 mpa s had a similar apparent viscosity with fbs at mlss of 800 1800 mg l apparent viscosity 1 7 2 53 mpa s under a similar apparent viscosity the kla 20 value for fbs was still significantly lower than that in ffs which was marked by a red oval in fig 4 b this indicated that in addition to increasing the apparent viscosity the filamentous microorganism also interfered the oxygen transfer with other pathways proteins and carbohydrates are the main components of eps which make up the largest fraction of sludge floc they locate at or outside the cell surface wang et al 2014 xu et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 their presence could significantly impact biomass surface properties and flocculability liu et al 2010 yu et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 a in the fbs with poor oxygen transfer both the contents of eps protein and eps polysaccharide were almost doubled compared to those in ffs moreover the contents of protein in both sludge samples were significantly greater than polysaccharide this indicated that the filamentous bulking sludge could produce more eps than ffs did which was in agreement with other studies germain et al 2007 meng et al 2006 wagner et al 2015 a negative correlation between α factor and the content of eps in sludge was also proposed by some studies fan et al 2017 ferreira et al 2010 fig 5 b i present the distribution of eps components in the sludge floc for both type of sludge in the core areas of fbs flocs where both filaments and regular bacteria were co existed the fluorescence intensity ratio for protein α polysaccharides β polysaccharides was equal to 1 4 0 8 1 0 fig 5 b d and the enlarged clsm images fig s2 clearly shows that the filaments of filamentous microorganisms were also coated by eps on the swimming free filaments extending from the floc that ratio was 3 0 1 8 1 0 suggesting that they were mainly coated by protein and α polysaccharides for the ffs the three major eps components are also co existed fig 5 i and the fluorescence intensity of protein and α polysaccharide were significantly greater than that of β polysaccharide some studies suggested that eps polysaccharide are solely hydrophilic substances while the eps protein was believed to be more hydrophobic liu and fang 2003 xie et al 2010 the co coated protein and polysaccharides might have made the massive free swinging filaments acting like amphiphilic molecules e g surfactants fig 6 a shows that numerous filaments directly attached on the air water interface the filaments were too tiny and soft to impale the air bubble the wide distribution and great hydrodynamic volume of filaments in fbs made the attachment easier in addition the coated proteins could facilitate the attachment of filaments on the interface as well because hydrophobic substances are more likely to attach to the air bubble surface compared to hydrophilic substances this suggests that during aeration the very long but tiny filaments can attach on the gas liquid interface which will reduce the liquid film renewal increase the liquid film thickness and directly block the oxygen mass transfer then the liquid film mass transfer coefficient kl will be reduced in ffs the floc had a certain shape and only one side or angle could touch the interface of air bubble as shown fig 6 b as a result the specific contact area between floc and air bubble in ffs is much smaller than that in fbs the motionless observation only represented a specific moment for the contact of sludge flocs with air bubble the changes in the bubble size bubble shape and the dynamic interaction between air bubbles and flocs during aeration however were not observed it will be ideal to directly observe the interaction between the swimming free filaments and the rising air bubbles in the bulk solution unfortunately a suitable approach was not found moreover no references were available on the effect of interfacial properties of sludge floc e g hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on oxygen transfer and the interaction between sludge floc and air bubble this study suggested that in addition to interfering oxygen transfer by enhancing the apparent viscosity the direct interaction between the filaments and air bubbles could also play a significant role in oxygen transfer however more studies are needed to further explore the effect of biomass surface properties on the oxygen transfer 3 6 microbial communities as shown in fig 7 though both type of sludges shared many bacterial genera their dominant genera were different the uncultured bacteria cytophagaceae and sphingobacteriales were the most dominant genera in ffs and fbs respectively both genera are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems with a relative abundance of greater than 3 these two sludges did not share any bacterial genus according to the database for bulking bacteria summarized by nielsen et al 2009 and guo and zhang 2012 ten related filamentous genera with relative abundance of greater than 0 1 were identified in both samples which included thiothrix sphaerotilus runella meganema leptothrix chryseobacterium trichococcus flavobacterium isosphaera and planctomycetaceae as shown in fig 8 fbs was dominated by thiothrix with a high relative abundance greater than 8 5 while thiothrix was nearly not detected in ffs both sphaerotilus and runella had a relatively high abundance in fbs while they both also existed in ffs with a relatively high abundance of 4 9 and 2 6 respectively fortunately their presence did not significantly impact the sludge settling apparent viscosity and oxygen transfer efficiency in ffs this might because both sphaerotilus and runella had short filaments that would not pose negative impact on the sludge settling ability and apparent viscosity alternatively their short filaments could work as bones to form large floc fig 1 thiothrix in fbs however had very long filaments 0 5 1 5 μm in diameter and a few millimeters in length which could bridge the flocs as a result the sludge settling ability decreased and the apparent viscosity increased therefore not all of filamentous bacteria had negative effects on the sludge settling ability and apparent viscosity the relative abundances for other filamentous bacteria were less than 0 6 and might not have a significant impact on sludge properties the high throughput sequencing analysis for eukaryotic community indicated that there were only a few non filamentous fungi existed in both fbs and ffs data not shown this indicated that the filamentous microorganisms in the experimental sludge were bacteria consequently we can infer that thiothrix was the major filamentous genus in fbs that had caused significantly negative impact on the oxygen transfer based on diversity analysis at specie level fig s3 thiothrix eikelboomii was identified as the predominant species thiothrix eikelboomii is a member of eikelboom type 021n bacteria aruga et al 2002 nielsen et al 2000 unlike other thiothrix ssp e g t nivea jp2t and t unzii a1t they can grow heterotrophically without requiring reduced sulfur aruga et al 2002 therefore thiothrix eikelboomii was frequently found in the bulking sludge of municipal wastewater treatment process and some other thiothrix ssp were more frequently found in the industrial wastewater treatment systems aruga et al 2002 guo and zhang 2012 howarth et al 1999 previously they are well known for decreasing sludge settling property however no reports are found about their impact on the apparent viscosity and oxygen transfer in activated sludge other thiothrix ssp may also have negative impact on the apparent viscosity and oxygen transfer since they have similar morphology with thiothrix eikelboomii aruga et al 2002 in addition to thiothrix species another popular filamentous bacterium in activated sludge that has long filaments i e microthrix parvicella may also impact the oxygen transfer negatively wagner et al 2015 more than 30 typical biosurfactant producing microbes were summarized by shekhar et al 2015 and ndlovu et al 2016 only three types of biosurfactant producing microbes i e aeromonas enterobacter and acinetobacter were detected in our experimental sludge fig 8 however their relative abundances in fbs were low 1 23 0 24 and 0 08 respectively in addition the relative abundances of enterobacter and acinetobacter in fbs were even significantly lower than those in ffs 0 81 and 0 63 respectively the low abundances of biosurfactant producing bacteria might not produce sufficient biosurfactants to impact the oxygen transfer therefore community analysis also supported that biosurfactants were not the troublemakers for the reduced oxygen transfer performance in fbs 4 conclusions fbs had significantly poorer oxygen transfer characteristics than ffs did even at similar biomass concentrations filamentous bacteria of thiothrix eikelboomii were determined to be the troublemakers they had long filaments and could significantly enhance the apparent viscosity of activated sludge however the kla value for fbs was still lower than that for ffs even if the apparent viscosity of ffs was increased to a similar level by concentrating the sludge the additional impact of thiothrix eikelboomii on oxygen transfer could be caused by their particular cell surface property and interaction with air bubbles sludge bulking especially the growth of filamentous bacteria with long filaments have to be controlled even in the membrane bioreactors not only for improving sludge settling but also

19057,this study revealed that thiothrix eikelboomii a well known filamentous bacterium that causes sludge bulking could also interfere oxygen transfer during wastewater treatment the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient kla in filamentous bulking sludge fbs was found to be 43 lower than that in floc forming sludge ffs at similar biomass concentrations partially because the filamentous bacteria had increased the sludge apparent viscosity the kla value for fbs however was still significantly lower than that for ffs even if both sludges had similar apparent viscosity numerous tiny and free swimming filaments were observed to attach on the air bubble surface presumably reducing the liquid film renewal and increasing the liquid film thickness moreover the filaments were co coated with extracellular polymeric substances of protein and polysaccharide which could make them performing like amphiphilic molecules of surfactants to hinder oxygen transfer therefore the particular surface property of filaments and their interaction with air bubbles could also impact oxygen transfer thiothrix eikelboomii was identified to be the responsible filamentous bacterium that lowered the kla value while other filamentous bacteria with short filaments did not interfere oxygen transfer this study implies that controlling sludge bulking benefits not only sludge settling but also oxygen transfer graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxygen transfer wastewater treatment activated sludge filamentous bulking thiothrix 1 introduction aeration is needed to provide sufficient oxygen for microbes during aerobic wastewater treatment the low solubility of oxygen in water makes aeration an energy intensive process currently more than 50 of the energy consumption in wastewater treatment plants is used for aeration henriques and catarino 2017 li et al 2017 therefore improving oxygen transfer efficiency ote is critically important for improving wastewater treatment sustainability daigger and boltz 2018 the effects of mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration surfactants mixing intensity salts temperature and viscosity on the oxygen transfer from air to water have been intensively studied baquero rodríguez et al 2018 germain et al 2007 nittami et al 2013 painmanakul et al 2005 vogelaar et al 2000 however very little attention has been paid to the impact of microbial community in activated sludge on the oxygen transfer during our previous study on nitrification under low dissolved oxygen do conditions we observed that the ote in the activated sludge reactor decreased by approximately 50 when filamentous bulking occurred liu et al 2018 filamentous microorganisms were hypothesized to be the troublemakers unfortunately the mechanisms behind this phenomenon were not clear filamentous microorganisms occur in the activated sludge process commonly which are notorious for decreasing sludge settling ability however their effect on the oxygen transfer has been rarely reported the significant decrease in the ote along with the occurrence of filamentous bulking could result from the dissolved contents and or the sludge solids the shift in the dominant microbes in activated sludge could change the type and concentration of soluble microbial products smps the smps e g biosurfactants could impact the oxygen transfer significantly capodici et al 2015 filamentous microorganisms have long filaments which may physically change the activated sludge rheological properties e g increasing the apparent viscosity moreover filamentous microorganisms could have different cell surface properties due to higher production of extracellular polymeric substances eps which may directly or indirectly impact the oxygen transfer germain and stephenson 2005 meng et al 2006 wagner et al 2015 previous studies noticed a new issue associated with filamentous bulking in term of oxygen transfer unfortunately this issue has not been well studied in this study the oxygen transfer characteristics smp production eps content and distribution apparent viscosity and microbial communities in the filamentous bulking sludge fbs and floc forming sludge ffs were comparatively investigated our goals were to 1 further characterize the interference of filamentous microorganism on oxygen transfer 2 explore the major mechanisms and 3 identify the type of filamentous microorganism that will interfere the oxygen transfer 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge samples sludge samples for fbs and ffs were respectively collected from two pilot scale dynamic membrane bioreactors which were fed with simulated domestic wastewater the effluent cod turbidity and ammonia for both reactors were below 20 mg l 1 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu and 1 mg l respectively the activated sludge in one reactor had very good settling ability with sludge volume index svi of less than 80 ml g mlss while the sludge in the other reactor had poor settling ability with a svi value of greater than 200 ml g mlss the mlss concentrations for fbs and ffs in the corresponding bioreactors were approximately 1800 mg l and 3200 mg l respectively more operation information for both reactors are given in table s1 filamentous microorganisms were present in the fbs sludge fig 1 which was observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix53 tokyo japan 2 2 oxygen transfer tests the oxygen transfer characteristics i e the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient kla and α factor for both sludge samples were determined using a dynamic testing method metcalf and eddy 2003 to evaluate the effect of the soluble substrates e g smps the oxygen transfer tests were also conducted for the effluent from both reactors and the tap water all of the oxygen transfer tests were conducted in measuring cylinders with an effective volume of 2 5 l 87 mm in diameter and 475 mm in height a fine bubble diffuser was placed at the bottom of the measuring cylinder for aeration when testing the oxygen transfer in activated sludge the samples were aerated sufficiently in advance to remove the residual soluble cod and ammonium after that the decrease in the do concentration along with time were recorded using a ysi 550a do meter since the activated sludge was in endogenous respiration phase the oxygen uptake rate was a constant value which could be determined based on linear regression when the do concentration became below 1 0 mg l aeration at a fixed airflow rate started and the change in the do concentration as a function of time was recorded during the oxygen transfer tests for the effluent and tap water moderated amount of sodium sulfite and cobalt chloride were initially added to deplete the do in the water before aeration the solution temperature was also recorded for each test which was used to correct the effect of temperature on the kla values the oxygen transfer characteristics for both types of sludge were firstly tested at a similar mlss of approximately 1800 mg l under different volumetric airflow rates of 4 8 9 6 and 19 2 l air l water h in addition the oxygen transfer characteristics in both sludge samples were tested under different mlss concentrations between 900 and 8000 mg l for the same aeration intensity of 9 6 l air l water h in these tests the sludge samples were diluted with bioreactor effluent or concentrated by gravity settling or membrane filtration the kla values for tape water under different airflow rates were also tested to estimate the α factors in the activated sludge and reactor effluents the equations used to determine the kla 20 values and α factors were described in the supporting information the kla values determined in the measuring cylinders were not referred to the ordinary hydraulic depth in the real wastewater treatment processes however they were effective to compare the oxygen transfer property in fbs and ffs 2 3 apparent viscosity measurement the apparent viscosity of both sludge samples with various mlss concentrations from 900 to 8000 mg l and the effluents from both reactors were measured by a rotational viscometer ndj 5s bonsai instrument technology co ltd shanghai china with spindle 0 the measurement was conducted under a room temperature of approximately 22 c during the test the spindle was inserted into a breaker 114 mm in diameter and 155 mm in height that contained one litter sample before measurement the level of the viscometer was adjusted to ensure that the instrument was in horizontal condition and the spindle mark was parallel with the liquid level of the test sample according to the operation manual table s2 a rotating speed of 60 rmp was used when the measured viscosity was less than 10 mpa s when it was between 20 and 50 mpa s a rotating speed of 12 rmp was used the shear rate was proportional to rotating speed according to the correlation between the shear rate and the rotating speed provided by the manufacture and reference nittami et al 2013 the shear rates were 61 8 s 1 and 12 4 s 1 at the rotating speeds of 60 and 12 rpm respectively each measurement was conducted in triplicates because the activated sludge with a solids concentration above approximately 2 exhibits non newtonian behavior eftekharzadeh et al 2007 the measured viscosity of sludge samples represented the apparent viscosity μap 2 4 smp and tb eps analysis the contents of smp and tight bound extracellular polymer substances tb eps in both fbs and ffs were measured heat treatment method was used to extract eps which was recognized as one of the most effective methods with less disruption to cells chang and lee 1998 the detailed extraction protocols was described previously ding et al 2015 in brief the activated sludge samples were firstly centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was then taken out for smp analysis the remaining biomass was re suspended with saline water 0 9 nacl solution and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for another 15 min after discharging the supernatant the left biomass was re suspended again with 0 9 nacl solution and heated in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min finally the mixed liquor was centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was used for tb eps analysis after filtration by a 0 45 μm membrane in this study the contents of smp and eps were normalized as the sum of carbohydrate and protein since they are the main components in both smp and eps liu and fang 2002 the carbohydrate in smp and eps was measured using the h2so4 anthranone oxidation method with glucose as standard dubois et al 1956 the protein was determined by using a modified lowry method with bsa bovine serum albumin sigma fraction v 96 as the standard frolund et al 1996 2 5 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm analysis fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc concanavalin a cona and calcofluor white cw were used to stain and probe the proteins α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides respectively yu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 both types of activated sludge were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs solution to remove smp then 50 μl of mixed liquor was placed in a 200 μl centrifuge tube the sludge sample was first stained with 50 μl of fitc solution 10 g l for 30 min before which a bit of sodium bicarbonate 1 m buffer was added to maintain ph of 9 and to keep the amine group in a non protonated form next 50 μl of con a solution 0 25 g l was added into the centrifuge tube and incubate for 30 min again finally 50 μl of calcofluor white 0 3 g l was added and incubate for another 30 min after each staining step pbs solution was utilized to wash the labeled sample several times to remove the extra probes a scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm880 germany was applied to capture the structure of sludge samples and the distribution of eps components the specific operating conditions and parameters are shown as table s1 the fluorescence intensity of different contents was analyzed and calculated using image pro plus 6 0 and zeiss confocal software zen 2 0 2 6 observing the contact of sludge floc with air bubble it will be ideal to directly observe the interaction between the floc and the rising air bubbles unfortunately a suitable approach was not found in this study the contact of sludge floc with air bubble was observed under a motionless condition a nest glass bottom dish was used to hold the mixed liquor the external diameter was 35 mm and the bottom dish had a diameter of 15 mm when the bottom dish was filled with the mixed liquor an air bubble 3 5 mm in diameter was developed using a pipette then a coverslip was used to cover the bottom dish and trap the air bubble inside the mixed liquor then the contact of sludge floc with the air bubble in fbs or ffs was observed by an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix53 tokyo japan 2 7 microbial community analysis the bacterial community for each sludge was analyzed in duplicate considering some filamentous microorganisms may be fungi the fungal community was also characterized based on the its1 region power soil dna isolation kit anbiosic shenzhen china was used to extract the dna the quality and quantity of the dna were checked using gel electrophoresis and nanodrop 2000 micro spectrophotometry thermo scientific usa respectively subsequently the extracted dna was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification the hypervariable v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified using the universal primers of 338f and 806r the its1 region of 18s rrna genes were amplified with primers of its1f and its2 lindahl et al 2013 nilsson et al 2009 xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 pcr amplification for both 16s and 18s were conducted in a veriti fast abpcr usa under the following condition initial denaturation at 95 c for 5 min 25 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 50 c for 30 s and 72 c for 3 replicates 40 s and final extension at 72 c for 7 min after purification using ampure xp beads vazyme nanjing china the pcr amplicons were amplified for another round finally equal concentrations of purified dna fragment for each sample were sequenced by the illumina hiseq 2500 platform which was conducted by biomarker technologies beijing china after hiseq sequencing the reads for each sample were merged using flash software version 1 2 7 magoc and salzberg 2011 to obtain raw tags then the raw tags were purified by filtering out the low quality or ambiguous sequences using trimmomatic software version 0 33 bolger et al 2014 and obtain the clean tags finally uchime software version 4 2 edgar et al 2011 was used to authenticate and exclude chimeras sequences to get effective tags for further analyses the effective tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a similarity threshold of 97 using uclust methods edgar 2010 embraced in qiime caporaso et al 2010 the taxonomic classification of otus was assigned based on the ribosomal database project rdp classifier with silva and unite databases for bacterial and eukaryotic communities respectively the data for the abundance of bacteria and fungi at different levels were processed on the bmk cloud online platform biomarker technologies beijing china 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxygen transfer characteristics in fbs and ffs two membrane bioreactors were operated in our laboratory in one reactor the ote decreased abruptly without any changes in the aeration conditions meanwhile the sludge settling ability became poor with svi values of greater than 200 ml g mlss excessive filamentous microorganisms were found in this activated sludge fig 1 a the ote in the other reactor kept normal and the sludge settled well with svi value of less than 80 ml g mlss therefore we inferred that the decreasing ote was associated with the filamentous bulking as expected fig 2 a both activated sludges had poorer oxygen transfer characteristics than the tape water and effluent did suggesting that the activated sludge would hinder oxygen transfer during aeration at a similar mlss concentration of approximately 1800 mg l however the do concentration increased significantly faster in the ffs than that in the fbs the kla 20 values for fbs and ffs were determined to be 5 68 and 10 02 h 1 respectively this indicates that the overall oxygen mass transfer rate in the fbs was 43 3 lower than that in the ffs under the same aeration condition fig 2 b shows that increasing the volumetric airflow rate had significantly increased the kla 20 values for both sludges however the kla 20 values and α factors in fbs were always lower than those in ffs under the same aeration intensity fig 2 a and c this confirmed that the fbs with excessive filamentous microorganisms had much worse oxygen transfer property than ffs did 3 2 effect of dissolved contents on oxygen transfer the differences in the oxygen transfer characteristics in fbs and ffs could result from the dissolved contents produced by the microbes and or the biomass solids as shown in fig 2 a both reactor effluents had very similar kla 20 values with tap water suggesting that the dissolved contents in both sludge samples had insignificant impact on the oxygen transfer smps mainly including protein and polysaccharide are the major soluble constituents for well treated effluent barker and stuckey 1999 wang and zhang 2010 xie et al 2012 their combined concentrations in both reactor effluents were similar and less than 5 mg l fig 2 d which were too low to pose negative impact on oxygen transfer wei et al 2015 though the biosurfactants were not measured the similar kla 20 values in both effluents and the tape water suggested that the microbes in both sludge samples did not synthesize sufficient biosurfactants that could negatively impact the oxygen transfer these results suggested that the differences in the oxygen transfer characteristics for ffs and fbs mainly resulted from the biomass solids 3 3 effect of biomass solids on oxygen transfer the fbs and ffs sludge with mlss concentrations ranging from 900 to 7000 mg l possible concentrations in municipal sewage plants were examined to explore the correlation between mlss concentration and oxygen transfer characteristic kla 20 and α factor for both sludges the values of kla 20 and so as the α factor at mlss greater than 3000 mg l were significantly lower than those at mlss less than 2000 mg l it was reported that an exponential correlation could be used to describe the kla 20 value or α factor as a function of mlss concentration for the same type of activated sludge with an extended mlss range from 5000 to 30 000 mg l germain et al 2007 for the data presented in fig 3 obviously one exponential like equation could not fit the kla 20 data for both fbs and ffs under a similar mlss concentration the fbs always had significantly lower kla 20 values than ffs did this suggested that in addition to biomass concentration other properties of biomass e g microbial types floc morphology apparent viscosity and biomass surface properties might have impacted the oxygen transfer a few exponential correlations between α factor and mlss concentration had been reported germain et al 2007 günder 2001 krampe and krauth 2003 muller et al 1995 rosenberger 2003 their correlations however varied significantly from case to case fig s1 these variations could partially result from the differences in testing conditions the aeration intensity diffuser types reactor dimension and mixing intensity could impact the measured kla values even with the same testing conditions inconsistent relationships between α factor and mlss concentration were observed for the sludge from different sources nittami et al 2013 henkel 2010 proposed that the difference in α factor at a given mlss concentration could be due to the difference of sludge characteristics and origins in conclusion both literature reviews and this study suggested that in addition to mlss concentration other properties of the activated sludge e g the presence of filamentous microorganisms also had a great impact on the oxygen transfer 3 4 correlations of apparent viscosity with mlss and oxygen transfer the results shown in figs 2 and 3 evidenced that the fbs with excessive filamentous microorganisms had significantly poorer oxygen transfer characteristics than ffs did our previous study additionally observed that the ote in the reactor decreased with increasing density of filamentous microorganisms liu et al 2018 therefore the occurrence of filamentous microorganisms in fbs had interfered the oxygen transfer the filamentous microorganisms in fbs had long filaments fig 1 which could impact the oxygen transfer by changing the apparent viscosity of the activated sludge therefore the apparent viscosity of fbs and ffs under various mlss concentrations were measured with results shown in fig 4 a under similar mlss concentrations the apparent viscosity of fbs was significantly greater than that of ffs moreover when the mlss concentration was greater than 3000 mg l the apparent viscosity of fbs increased exponentially however the effluents from both reactors had very similar apparent viscosity with tap water indicating that the dissolved contents in the mixed liquor did not impact the apparent viscosity therefore the filamentous microorganisms in fbs had enhanced the apparent viscosity of the mixed liquor the kla value decreased with increasing viscosity which has been well documented badino et al 2001 garcía ochoa et al 2000 özbek and gayik 2001 a greater apparent viscosity will lead to greater air bubbles which significantly reduce the specific interfacial area for oxygen transfer amaral et al 2017 badino et al 2001 garcía ochoa et al 2000 martín et al 2010 özbek and gayik 2001 the increase in the apparent viscosity would reduce the liquid film renewal by reducing the turbulence induced by rising air bubbles or stirrers which negatively impact the oxygen diffusion at the air liquid interface on the other hand the increasing apparent viscosity could promote oxygen transfer by reducing the bubble rising velocity due to a higher bubbles drag coefficient durán et al 2016 mena et al 2005 however this positive contribution could not offset the negative effects of increasing apparent viscosity on oxygen transfer and as result the kla value decreased with increasing apparent viscosity therefore filamentous microorganisms could hinder oxygen transfer by enhancing the apparent viscosity of activated sludge unlike the relationship of kla 20 value or α factor with mlss presented in fig 3 a consistency existed between apparent viscosity and kla 20 value for both sludge samples as shown by fig 4 b when the apparent viscosity was less than 5 mpa s the kla 20 values and so as α factors decreased rapidly with increasing apparent viscosity further increasing the apparent viscosity of activated sludge had less impact on the kla 20 values or α factors this exponential like correlation was in agreement with some other studies günder 2001 krampe and krauth 2003 nittami et al 2013 fig 4 b also indicated that the apparent viscosity instead of mlss concentration was the dominant factor that impacts the oxygen transfer in activated sludge undeniably a greater mlss concentration could enhance the apparent viscosity of the mixed liquor the presence of excessive filamentous microorganism however would additionally enhance the apparent viscosity 3 5 eps distribution and contact of floc with air bubble the ffs with mlss concentrations of 5500 6500 mg l apparent viscosity 2 09 2 20 mpa s had a similar apparent viscosity with fbs at mlss of 800 1800 mg l apparent viscosity 1 7 2 53 mpa s under a similar apparent viscosity the kla 20 value for fbs was still significantly lower than that in ffs which was marked by a red oval in fig 4 b this indicated that in addition to increasing the apparent viscosity the filamentous microorganism also interfered the oxygen transfer with other pathways proteins and carbohydrates are the main components of eps which make up the largest fraction of sludge floc they locate at or outside the cell surface wang et al 2014 xu et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 their presence could significantly impact biomass surface properties and flocculability liu et al 2010 yu et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 a in the fbs with poor oxygen transfer both the contents of eps protein and eps polysaccharide were almost doubled compared to those in ffs moreover the contents of protein in both sludge samples were significantly greater than polysaccharide this indicated that the filamentous bulking sludge could produce more eps than ffs did which was in agreement with other studies germain et al 2007 meng et al 2006 wagner et al 2015 a negative correlation between α factor and the content of eps in sludge was also proposed by some studies fan et al 2017 ferreira et al 2010 fig 5 b i present the distribution of eps components in the sludge floc for both type of sludge in the core areas of fbs flocs where both filaments and regular bacteria were co existed the fluorescence intensity ratio for protein α polysaccharides β polysaccharides was equal to 1 4 0 8 1 0 fig 5 b d and the enlarged clsm images fig s2 clearly shows that the filaments of filamentous microorganisms were also coated by eps on the swimming free filaments extending from the floc that ratio was 3 0 1 8 1 0 suggesting that they were mainly coated by protein and α polysaccharides for the ffs the three major eps components are also co existed fig 5 i and the fluorescence intensity of protein and α polysaccharide were significantly greater than that of β polysaccharide some studies suggested that eps polysaccharide are solely hydrophilic substances while the eps protein was believed to be more hydrophobic liu and fang 2003 xie et al 2010 the co coated protein and polysaccharides might have made the massive free swinging filaments acting like amphiphilic molecules e g surfactants fig 6 a shows that numerous filaments directly attached on the air water interface the filaments were too tiny and soft to impale the air bubble the wide distribution and great hydrodynamic volume of filaments in fbs made the attachment easier in addition the coated proteins could facilitate the attachment of filaments on the interface as well because hydrophobic substances are more likely to attach to the air bubble surface compared to hydrophilic substances this suggests that during aeration the very long but tiny filaments can attach on the gas liquid interface which will reduce the liquid film renewal increase the liquid film thickness and directly block the oxygen mass transfer then the liquid film mass transfer coefficient kl will be reduced in ffs the floc had a certain shape and only one side or angle could touch the interface of air bubble as shown fig 6 b as a result the specific contact area between floc and air bubble in ffs is much smaller than that in fbs the motionless observation only represented a specific moment for the contact of sludge flocs with air bubble the changes in the bubble size bubble shape and the dynamic interaction between air bubbles and flocs during aeration however were not observed it will be ideal to directly observe the interaction between the swimming free filaments and the rising air bubbles in the bulk solution unfortunately a suitable approach was not found moreover no references were available on the effect of interfacial properties of sludge floc e g hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on oxygen transfer and the interaction between sludge floc and air bubble this study suggested that in addition to interfering oxygen transfer by enhancing the apparent viscosity the direct interaction between the filaments and air bubbles could also play a significant role in oxygen transfer however more studies are needed to further explore the effect of biomass surface properties on the oxygen transfer 3 6 microbial communities as shown in fig 7 though both type of sludges shared many bacterial genera their dominant genera were different the uncultured bacteria cytophagaceae and sphingobacteriales were the most dominant genera in ffs and fbs respectively both genera are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems with a relative abundance of greater than 3 these two sludges did not share any bacterial genus according to the database for bulking bacteria summarized by nielsen et al 2009 and guo and zhang 2012 ten related filamentous genera with relative abundance of greater than 0 1 were identified in both samples which included thiothrix sphaerotilus runella meganema leptothrix chryseobacterium trichococcus flavobacterium isosphaera and planctomycetaceae as shown in fig 8 fbs was dominated by thiothrix with a high relative abundance greater than 8 5 while thiothrix was nearly not detected in ffs both sphaerotilus and runella had a relatively high abundance in fbs while they both also existed in ffs with a relatively high abundance of 4 9 and 2 6 respectively fortunately their presence did not significantly impact the sludge settling apparent viscosity and oxygen transfer efficiency in ffs this might because both sphaerotilus and runella had short filaments that would not pose negative impact on the sludge settling ability and apparent viscosity alternatively their short filaments could work as bones to form large floc fig 1 thiothrix in fbs however had very long filaments 0 5 1 5 μm in diameter and a few millimeters in length which could bridge the flocs as a result the sludge settling ability decreased and the apparent viscosity increased therefore not all of filamentous bacteria had negative effects on the sludge settling ability and apparent viscosity the relative abundances for other filamentous bacteria were less than 0 6 and might not have a significant impact on sludge properties the high throughput sequencing analysis for eukaryotic community indicated that there were only a few non filamentous fungi existed in both fbs and ffs data not shown this indicated that the filamentous microorganisms in the experimental sludge were bacteria consequently we can infer that thiothrix was the major filamentous genus in fbs that had caused significantly negative impact on the oxygen transfer based on diversity analysis at specie level fig s3 thiothrix eikelboomii was identified as the predominant species thiothrix eikelboomii is a member of eikelboom type 021n bacteria aruga et al 2002 nielsen et al 2000 unlike other thiothrix ssp e g t nivea jp2t and t unzii a1t they can grow heterotrophically without requiring reduced sulfur aruga et al 2002 therefore thiothrix eikelboomii was frequently found in the bulking sludge of municipal wastewater treatment process and some other thiothrix ssp were more frequently found in the industrial wastewater treatment systems aruga et al 2002 guo and zhang 2012 howarth et al 1999 previously they are well known for decreasing sludge settling property however no reports are found about their impact on the apparent viscosity and oxygen transfer in activated sludge other thiothrix ssp may also have negative impact on the apparent viscosity and oxygen transfer since they have similar morphology with thiothrix eikelboomii aruga et al 2002 in addition to thiothrix species another popular filamentous bacterium in activated sludge that has long filaments i e microthrix parvicella may also impact the oxygen transfer negatively wagner et al 2015 more than 30 typical biosurfactant producing microbes were summarized by shekhar et al 2015 and ndlovu et al 2016 only three types of biosurfactant producing microbes i e aeromonas enterobacter and acinetobacter were detected in our experimental sludge fig 8 however their relative abundances in fbs were low 1 23 0 24 and 0 08 respectively in addition the relative abundances of enterobacter and acinetobacter in fbs were even significantly lower than those in ffs 0 81 and 0 63 respectively the low abundances of biosurfactant producing bacteria might not produce sufficient biosurfactants to impact the oxygen transfer therefore community analysis also supported that biosurfactants were not the troublemakers for the reduced oxygen transfer performance in fbs 4 conclusions fbs had significantly poorer oxygen transfer characteristics than ffs did even at similar biomass concentrations filamentous bacteria of thiothrix eikelboomii were determined to be the troublemakers they had long filaments and could significantly enhance the apparent viscosity of activated sludge however the kla value for fbs was still lower than that for ffs even if the apparent viscosity of ffs was increased to a similar level by concentrating the sludge the additional impact of thiothrix eikelboomii on oxygen transfer could be caused by their particular cell surface property and interaction with air bubbles sludge bulking especially the growth of filamentous bacteria with long filaments have to be controlled even in the membrane bioreactors not only for improving sludge settling but also

the solubilization of sludge were investigated cbz and pmd were effectively removed and the removal fitted pseudo first kinetics under mp uv cao2 treatment with r2 0 97 the higher cao2 dosage and lower initial volatile suspended solids vss concentration were conductive to the removal of cbz and pmd of the cao2 hydrolysates ca oh 2 played a more important role than h2o2 during mp uv cao2 treatment the removal of the target compounds was attributed to direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by oh 3dom and 1o2 in which oh played a vital role with 62 2 contribution to the overall degradation rate a model predicting the steady concentration of oh in was vss 8 6 g l 1 under mp uv cao2 treatment with cao2 dosage ranging from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss was proposed and validated moreover major intermediates of cbz and pmd were detected and the probable transformation pathways during mp uv cao2 treatment were proposed in addition mp uv cao2 promoted the sludge solubilization effectively considering both the pharmaceutical degradation and sludge solubilization the optimum operation condition with 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss combined with 7 h mp uv irradiation is recommended under this condition more than 92 3 of cbz and 90 3 of pmd were removed and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod increased by 657 and 13 6 compared with sole 10 h cao2 0 2 g g 1 vss treatment and 7 h mp uv treatment respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords mp uv cao2 pretreatment waste activated sludge was carbamazepine cbz and primidone pmd degradation pathway sludge solubilization 1 introduction waste activated sludge was produced from wastewater treatment plants wwpts are becoming a major concern with the urbanization in the world anaerobic digestion ad is claimed to be a highly cost effective technology for was stabilization in modern waste sludge treatment anjum et al 2016 however the persistent trace organic contaminants torcs are one of major concerned issues during sludge treatment and application anjum et al 2016 these torcs including pesticides industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals and personal care products could be adsorbed onto sludge with concentration generally between ng g 1 and μg g 1 dry weight dw liu and wong 2013 subedi et al 2013 wu et al 2013 and difficult to be degraded during ad process stasinakis 2012 which were finally discharged to the environment through landfill or land application of sludge resulting in potential harm to ecosystem and human health semblante et al 2015 they may also pose an inhibitation to ad for example chen et al 2008 reported methanogens were highly susceptible to torcs such as halogenated aliphatic chlrophenols and n subsituted aromatic compounds therefore these refractory torcs should be removed before ad recent years pretreatment of was is adopted to remove the toxic torcs and improve the solubilization of sludge it has been demonstrated that calcium peroxide cao2 as a slowly released oxidant could help to remove some torcs and enhance the solubilization of sludge chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 because cao2 can produce ca oh 2 h2o2 o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o 2 in moist media ma et al 2007 li et al 2015 has reported that the addition of 0 2 g cao2 g 1 volatile suspended solids vss during ad could decrease the total detection frequency of some torcs in the supernatant and improve the sludge solubilization zhang et al 2015 showed 0 25 g cao2 g 1 vss effectively removed more than 50 of estrogens in was and increased the soluble total organic carbon stoc by 25 after 7 d ad chen et al 2016 demonstrated 0 025 g cao2 g 1 vss enhanced the was dewaterability and broke the sludge floc through changing the extracellular polymeric substances in addition cao2 has been proved as a good pretreatment to promote the subsequent ad to produce high quality short chain fatty acids tscfa and methane ch4 li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 therefore cao2 was considered to be a good additive for was pretreatment however the previous investigation found 19 of the 29 organic pollutants detected in the supernatants of raw sludge samples were not removed by cao2 treatment li et al 2015 our recent preliminary experiments also showed that cao2 had little degradation effects on the typical refractory pollutants carbamazepine cbz and primidone pmd fig s2 in supporting information si therefore combination of cao2 with other technologies as a stronger pretreatment method should be considered previous investigations have proved photochemical aops were the common and effective methods to remove refractory torcs in water and was rosario ortiz et al 2010 salihoglu et al 2012 yang et al 2014 yonar et al 2006 zhang and li 2014 zhang et al 2018 especially the uv h2o2 treatment which has been used for the refectory torcs control yang et al 2014 besides uv based processes have also been used to enhance was stabilization anjum et al 2016 zhang and li 2014 as cao2 was considered as solid h2o2 cao2 combination with uv irradiation uv cao2 is assumed to have the similar oxidation power to uv h2o2 to remove refractory pollutants in was furthermore sole cao2 and its hydrolysate ca oh 2 have been proved to accelerate hydrolysis and acidification processes during was ad li et al 2014 2015 hence combination of uv with cao2 as a novel sludge pretreatment to remove torcs in was was investigated in this paper cbz and pmd were selected as the typical torcs in this study as they were frequently

combining with mp uv on the degradation of the two target compounds were clarified 3 to ascertain the degradation mechanisms of cbz and pmd under mp uv cao2 treatment the main reactive radicals and their effects were identified and the production of oh at different cao2 dose was modeled 4 the intermediates of cbz and pmd generated under mp uv cao2 treatment were detected 5 effect of mp uv cao2 pretreatment on sludge solubilization was evaluated and the optimal pretreatment conditions were recommended this work explores the mechanisms and applicability of a new advanced treatment to remove

cbz and pmd during uv cao2 treatment cbz and pmd may undergo structural alteration because of the electronic transition from an excited state to the ground state direct photolysis or photolytic transformation induced by reactive radicals generated by the uv photons indirect photolysis kosjek et al 2009 the transformation products of cbz and pmd in was under mp uv cao2 were investigated main intermediates were analyzed using an agilent 1290 series hplc coupled to a 6500 series accurate mass quadrupole time of flight lc q tof and an agilent 1290 uhplc coupled to an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lc qqq details of the analytical methods are provided in si materials the samples of intermediates were prepared as the same procedure of cbz and pmd 2 7 analytical methods for other parameters the analytical methods for tcod scod tss vss ts vs ph oxidation reduction potential orp toc were all described in our previous investigations li et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp uv cao2 pretreatment for the degradation of cbz and pmd 3 1 1 effect of cao2 dosage cbz and pmd were well degraded under both mp uv and m uv cao2 treatments and the addition of cao2 obviously enhanced their removal fig 1 a and b the degradation of the target compounds under mp uv or mp uv cao2 was due to direct and indirect uv photolysis the indirect photolysis may be caused by free reactive radicals oh o 2 1o2 dom co 3 etc generated from uv light activated cao2 or dom jasper and sedlak 2013 kozak and włodarczyk makuła 2018 the significant improvement of degradation efficiency upon cao2 addition may be attributed to amounts of reactive radical generated from cao2 activated by uv light especially oh reactions 3 5 kozak and włodarczyk makuła 2018 which is a vital oxidative radical to remove micropollutants oulton et al 2010 rosario ortiz et al 2010 3 cao 2 2 h 2 o ca oh 2 h 2 o 2 4 2 cao 2 2 h 2 o 2 ca oh 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh the kinetics fitting results of cbz and pmd coincided well with the pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 97 table s1 and the degradation rates k of cbz and pmd are shown in fig 1 c although k value increased with increasing cao2 the tendency became retarded in fact the degradation of micropollutant in was was the comprehensive outcome of multi factors on the one hand cao2 disrupted the was structure and increased sludge solubilization li et al 2015 which may reduce uv shading effect on micropollutant degradation furthermore it made the natural chelating agents organic acids amino acids and hydroxamate siderophores and transition metals release from sludge cell disruption forming modified fenton zhang et al 2015 which could accelerate the production rate of free radicals under mp uv therefore the degradation of cbz and pmd was improved on the other hand the over addition of cao2 resulted in the increase of tss fig s3 and dom they could compete with the target compounds for the uv light and oxidants which may retard the increase of k values of the target compounds furthermore the invariable uv intensity limited the linear formation of oh with the increase of cao2 the excessive cao2 caused a higher ph value fig 1 d which may increase the decomposition rate of h2o2 reaction 6 and lowered oh concentration reactions 7 10 and moreover may reduce the oh oxidation potential buxton et al 1988 consequently the increase of k value was retarded with the overdose of cao2 dosage in all 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss was considered as the suitable cao2 dosage for the degradation of the target compounds and the corresponding irradiation time for 90 of cbz and pmd degradation was 5 8 h and 6 3 h respectively 6 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 7 oh oh o h 2 o 8 oh o ho 2 k 2 10 10 l mol 1 s 1 9 oh h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o o 2 h h 2 o 10 oh ho 2 oh ho 2 o 2 h h 2 o fig 1 d shows final ph value increased with increasing cao2 dosage however at the same cao2 dosage the ph with mp uv treatment was lower than that without mp uv because mp uv cao2 treatment as a stronger aop caused a greater degree of was disruption resulting in the release of more extracellular and intracellular materials which may function as buffering agents meanwhile the orp increased exponentially with the cao2 dosage r 2 0 97 table s2 and the curve has the similar trends with k values of cbz and pmd in fig 1 c r 2 0 99 table s2 the orp increased little when cao2 dosage was higher than 0 2 g g 1 vss indicating that further addition of cao2 could not increase the oxidation capacity any more 3 1 2 effect of initial vss concentration and ph the increase of vss concentration has a significant suppression on the degradation of cbz and pmd under both mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments fig 2 a this is because the increase of vss caused serious uv screening meanwhile the increase of suspended organic matter doms e g humic acid and inorganic ions e g cl no3 no2 co3 2 and hco3 may compete with cbz and pmd for reactive radicals during the treatment qiu et al 2019 moreover the k values were fitted as an exponential function of initial vss concentration very well r 2 0 98 table s3 according the fitting formulas the degradation rates of the target compounds under different vss concentrations can be inferred fig 2 b showed both the extreme low and high initial ph values promoted the degradation of cbz and pmd under mp uv treatment and the increase of k values under alkaline conditions were more significantly than those under acidic conditions under mp uv cao2 treatment both the low and high initial ph induced a big promotion to the removal of the target compounds this can be explained as follows firstly previous investigation showed strong ph surroundings could increase the was solubilization through rupturing the sludge structure and cells ruiz hernando et al 2014 and subsequently improve the efficacy of uv light on micropollutant degradation secondly the improvement of k under low ph was because the acidic medium increased the release rate of h2o2 reaction 11 and the final h2o2 yield from cao2 wang et al 2016 which finally facilitated the formation of oh reactions 3 5 to degrade cbz and pmd however it should be noted that with the addition of cao2 ph increased to the alkaline condition irrespective of the initial ph fig s4 unless the very high initial ph condition ph 12 the initial alkaline condition cannot significantly improve the degradation rates of cbz and pmd under mp uv cao2 treatment fig 2 b therefore there is no need to adjust the initial ph of was under mp uv cao2 treatment 11 cao 2 2 h ca 2 h 2 o 2 3 2 the degradation mechanisms of cbz and pmd during mp uv cao2 treatment 3 2 1 effect of cao2 hydrolysates combined with mp uv combining cao2 hydrolysates with mp uv to remove the target compounds was investigated as shown in fig 3 when combining with mp uv irradiation ca oh 2 promoted the removal of cbz and pmd significantly while cacl2 and h2o2 had little influence therefore the alkaline condition caused by cao2 played an important role in the improvement of k during mp uv cao2 liquid h2o2 known as an oxidant could promote the was solubilization and remove some contaminants zhang and li 2014 however unlike cao2 it is thermodynamically unstable and easily decomposed to form water and oxygen therefore liquid h2o2 is insignificant in improving the degradation rate constants of the target compounds under mp uv however the slow release of h2o2 from cao2 may lead to the persistence of h2o2 in was as compared with liquid h2o2 resulting in the increase of oh from h2o2 photolysis meanwhile the alkaline condition caused by cao2 can promote the sludge disintegration which can improve the uv utilization efficiency during the photolysis of cbz and pmd therefore cao2 played a significant promotion in the degradation rate constants of the target compounds compared to h2o2 under mp uv moreover compared with the mp uv treatment the increases of k values of the target compounds cbz 0 235 h 1 pmd 0 215 h 1 by mp uv cao2 treatment were greater than the sum of the increases caused by mp uv ca oh 2 and mp uv h2o2 treatments cbz 0 102 h 1 pmd 0 115 h 1 this indicates that during mp uv irradiation using cao2 was better than combination of ca oh 2 with h2o2 to improve the degradation of micropollutants in was 3 2 2 contributions of reactive radicals on the degradation of cbz and pmd 3 2 2 1 identification by scavengers fig 4 a and b reveal effects of reactive radical scavengers on the degradation rate constants of the target compounds in was under mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments respectively ipa 0 1 mol l 1 can quench oh almost completely reaction 12 whereas reactions of o2 and 1o2 are unaffected singh 1982 therefore the significant decrease of k upon adding ipa indicates oh played an important role in cbz and pmd degradation under mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments the sparged n2 was used to remove o2 and 1o2 since sole o2 had no effect on the removal of the target compounds in was fig s5 the decrease of k under n2 satuated conditions was attributed to the elimination of 1o2 under both treatments sod a o2 scavenger can react with oh and 1o2 at 5 3 1010 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 109 m 1 s 1 respectively singh 1982 therefore to eliminate the effects of oh and 1o2 the ipa was added and n2 was sparged in advance the negligible decrease of k upon adding sod implies little contribution of o2 to the removal of cbz and pmd ipe usually as 3dom scavenger can react with oh at 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2011 meanwhile 3dom can be quenched by o2 jasper and sedlak 2013 therefore the ipa was added before the reaction and n2 was saturated during the reaction the comparison between k values upon n2 ipa and n2 ipa ipe additions indicates 3dom could promote cbz and pmd degradation during the treatments when cat usually as h2o2 scavenger was further added the n2 ipa ipe sod cat group it appeared no suppression on the degradation rate constants of the target compounds under mp up treatment but a little suppression under mp up cao2 treatment which is inconsistent with aforementioned little effect of sole h2o2 on the degradation of the target compounds fig s5 because h2o2 generated from cao2 hydrolysis may improve the efficacy of uv light irradiation on the target compounds via was disruption 12 oh ch 3 2 choh ch 3 2 coh h 2 o k 1 9 10 9 l mol 1 s 1 the degradations of cbz and pmd in the condition with addition of n2 ipa ipe sod cat during mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments may be caused by direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by co3 jasper and sedlak 2013 previous investigation demonstrated that stic was the main factor to impact the production of co3 huang and mabury 2000 preliminary investigation showed stic was about 3 6 mmol l 1 and 3 9 mmol l 1 under mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments respectively meanwhile the effect of co3 on the target compounds was negligible when the stic co3 2 was below 10 mmol l 1 detailed data not shown here moreover the second order reaction rates posed by co3 on the target compounds was 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than the values posed by oh on the target compounds and dom could reduce the lifetime of co3 canonica et al 2005 jasper and sedlak 2013 therefore the contribution of co3 to the overall degradation rates of the target compounds was negligible and the degradation of cbz and pmd with the addition of n2 ipa ipe sod cat should be attributed to the direct photolysis the contributions of different reactive radicals to the overall degradation rate constants of was spiked cbz and pmd are shown in fig 4 c the degradation of was spiked cbz was mainly induced by oh 68 3dom 15 and direct photolysis 6 under mp uv cao2 while oh 39 3dom 24 and direct photolysis 23 under mp uv the degradation of was spiked pmd was mainly induced by oh 62 3dom 15 1o2 10 and direct photolysis 8 under mp uv cao2 while oh 38 3dom 23 1o2 11 and direct photolysis 21 under mp uv treatment the contribution of oh was obviously increased under mp uv cao2 treatment than that under mp uv treatment this enhancement was due to the large production of oh upon adding cao2 in our investigation oh was the main reactive radical to remove cbz and pmd but the contributions of direct photolysis 3dom and 1o2 increased as compared to previous investigation in water jasper and sedlak 2013 this was attributed to 1 the different sludge matrix from aqueous matrix and 2 the specific mp uv lamp and the strong intense irradiance of mp uv 3 2 2 2 identification by epr during epr experiments sod was added to quench o2 reaction with dmpo to generate dmpo ooh which is easily converted into dmpo oh during mp uv cao2 treatment lipovsky et al 2012 the quartet dmpo oh signal from the reaction between dmpo and oh indicates oh generated during mp uv cao2 treatment in fig 5 a fig 5 b shows a negligible trace of dmpo oh signal and a dmpo ooh signal upon adding thiourea a oh quencher which indicates the generation of o2 in was under mp uv cao2 treatment the weak dmpo oh signal may be transformed from dmpo ooh fig 5 c displays the primary spectral features of similar dmpo ch3 upon adding the target compounds under mp uv cao2 treatment according to previous investigation the primary spectra signal may be dmpo c r signal zhang et al 2015 furthermore the dmpo c r signal further confirmed the existence of oh radicals because oh can attack the target compounds to produce c r which can transform dmpo into dmpo c r lipovsky et al 2012 fig 5 d exhibits the dmpo oh dmpo ooh and dmpo c r signals in was under mp uv cao2 indicating the existence of oh o2 and probable c r radicals in was during mp uv cao2 treatment 3 3 modeling and validating the steady state oh concentration since oh played a vital role in the degradation of cbz and pmd under mp uv cao2 treatment oh ss was further calculated using pcba the changes of k p c b a and k i p a p c b a under mp uv cao2 treatment are shown in fig s6 according to eq 2 the oh ss was calculated and shown in fig 6 a the oh ss increased from 1 18 10 15 mol l 1 to 1 01 10 14 mol l 1 with cao2 dosage increasing from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss the mathematical fitting to the curves shows that oh ss is an exponential function of cao2 dosage cao2 eq 13 r 2 0 99 13 oh ss 1 22 10 14 1 01 10 14 exp 3 06 cao2 the oh ss increased with the increase of cao2 dosage but the tendency became retarded this is because the increase of cao2 dosage would increase the production of h2o2 reaction 3 and ph which finally increased the oh ss under uv activation reaction 5 however the uv irradiance was fixed and the increase of cao2 would increase the tss concentration which may block the uv irradiation and retard the increase of oh formation this phenomena was in consistent with the tendency of cbz and pmd degradation described in section 3 1 1 to evaluate the applicability of the fitting formula of oh ss eq 13 predicted degradation rates of the target compounds k o h c o m p o u n d p r e d i c t e d based on eq 14 were compared to the measured degradation rates k o h c o m p o u n d m e a s u r e d of the target compounds based on eq 15 cbz 0 10 mg g 1 vss k oh cbz 9 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 pmd 0 10 mg g 1 vss k oh pmd 6 7 10 9 m 1 s 1 jasper and sedlak 2013 park et al 2017 the measured k c b z k i p a c b z k p m d and k i p a p m d at different cao2 dosages under mp uv cao2 treatment are showed in fig s6 14 k o h c o m p o u n d p r e d i c t e d k o h c o m p o u n d oh s s 15 k o h c o m p o u n d m e a s u r e d k c o m p o u n d k i p a c o m p o u n d where k o h c o m p o u n d is the degradation rates of the target compounds caused by oh radical in h 1 according to eq 14 and eq 15 when cao2 dosage increased from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss the predicted k o h c b z increased from 0 0688 h 1 to 0 328 h 1 and the measured k o h c b z increased from 0 0709 h 1 to 0 330 h 1 the predicted k o h p m d was from 0 0507 h 1 to 0 242 h 1 corresponding to the measured k o h p m d from 0 0541 h 1 to 0 243 h 1 k o h c o m p o u n d m e a s u r e d of the target compounds under mp uv cao2 treatment agreed well with k o h c o m p o u n d p r e d i c t e d at various cao2 dosage the difference between them was less than 7 fig 6 b meanwhile the pearson product moment correlation coefficients between them were over 0 99 therefore the fitting formula of oh ss at various initial cao2 dosage during mp uv cao2 treatment was considered reasonable however since the vss is the big influencing factor for mp uv cao2 treatment the effect of vss on the oh generation should be investigated in future 3 4 the transformation products of cbz and pmd 3 4 1 the transformation products of carbamazepine the detected intermediates of cbz are listed in table s4 their variations detected by lc qqq during mp uv cao2 treatment are shown in fig 7 a during mp uv cao2 treatment both the olefinic double bond in the central heterocyclic ring and two outside aromatic rings can be attacked based on the transformation products detected in was and the aforementioned degradation mechanism a possible degradation pathway for cbz was proposed in fig 8 a the olefinic double bond was usually hydroxylated to form corresponding hydroxyl derivatives hu et al 2009 li et al 2013 tang et al 2017 such as the alcohol 10 hydroxy 10 11 dihydro carbamazepine cbz 10oh and 10 11 dihydro 10 11 trans cis dihydroxy cbz cbz dioh aldehyde acridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic and ketone i e oxcarbazepine therefore the hydration of the c10c11 double bond of cbz firstly occurred forming cbz 10oh due to direct photolysis of cbz chiron et al 2006 the second predominant pathway involved the heterocyclic ring contraction process chiron et al 2006 the reactive double bond was firstly attacked by oxidants to yield 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine cbz ep which has been mentioned in many studies for water or soil treatments de laurentiis et al 2012 kosjek et al 2009 li et al 2013 vogna et al 2004 then cbz ep was further oxidized into acridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic by oh through the heterocyclic ring contraction with the loss of the conh2 lateral chain kosjek et al 2009 vogna et al 2004 this contraction may take place via a pinacol type rearrangement for π electron rich heterocycles and convert an azepine ring into an aromatic structure li et al 2013 finally aic was hydroxylated into hydroxyacridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic oh or the carboxyaldehyde group of aic would cleavage to yield acridine ai kosjek et al 2009 in addition although cbz dioh was not detected here previous investigation has showed cbz ep may easily evolve into cbz dioh during photooxidation and then undergo ring contraction to yield ai via direct photolysis de laurentiis et al 2012 the aromatic rings of cbz can be attacked by oh to form two stereoisomers cbz oh 2 hydroxy carbamazepine and 3 hydroxy carbamazepine they can be further hydroxylated into the dihydroxylated derivatives cbzohoh de laurentiis et al 2012 miao et al 2005 the dihydroxylated stereoisomers were distinguished on the basis of the retention time which may be 2 7 dihydroxycarbamazepine 2 8 dihydroxycarbamazepine and 3 8 dihydroxycarbamazepine with the hydroxyl function on the different carbon site of outside aromatic ring de laurentiis et al 2012 fig 7 a shows the detected intermediates were almost degraded after 7 h treatment by mp uv cao2 which indicates mp uv cao2 is effective in removing cbz and its intermediates previous investigations have also shown ai and aic are biodegradable kosjek et al 2009 and the intermediates containing a hydroxyl and carbonyl groups such as aic oh can be mineralized by micro organisms found in activated sludge keen et al 2012 therefore the cbz products produced in mp uv cao2 treatment was biodegradable 3 4 2 the transformation products of primidone the detected intermediates of pmd are listed in table s5 and their variations detected by lc qqq are shown in fig 7 b fig 8 b reveals a possible degradation pathway for pmd in was under mp uv cao2 phenobarbital pbb and hydroxyl primidone pmd oh were first detected during reaction which suggested the attack of oh on the pyrimidine ring and the aromatic ring of pmd this result was consistent with previous investigations for pmd in water under uv photolysis sijak et al 2015 and electron beam radiolysis liu et al 2015 pmd may also undergo the cleavage of n 1 c 2 bond and n 3 c 2 bond of pyrimidine ring to form phenylethylmalonamide pema mac leod et al 2008 moreover both pbb and pmd 4oh may be oxidized by oh to form 4 hydroxyphenobarbital pbb4oh in addition the dipeptide bonds on the heterocyclic ring of pbb can be hydrolyzed to form pema as shown in fig 7 b mp uv cao2 is also considered to be an effective pretreatment method to remove pmd and its intermediates because of the disappearance of pmd intermediates in 7 h reaction mp uv cao2 process efficiently removed cbz and pmd as well as their intermediates however due to the complexity of organic constituents in sludge there may exist other incomplete intermediates which may lead to environmental problem and need to be further treated similar problems was also mentioned in the investigation to cbz degradation in soil li et al 2013 previous investigations have shown the combination of oxidation and biotransformation has the potential to synergistically mineralize persistent contaminants and their incomplete intermediates in water keen et al 2012 watts and linden 2008 for example uv treatment followed by aerobic or anoxic activated sludge treatment can remove cbz and its final such as acridine and 9 10h acridone in wastewater kosjek et al 2009 uv h2o2 treatment followed by a mixed bacterial inoculum from activated sludge processes can mineralize cbz and its oxidation products keen et al 2012 therefore uv h2o2 process followed by a biofilm mediated biofiltration process have been proposed for the treatment of recalcitrant contaminants in water keen et al 2012 metz et al 2011 in this study we proved that mp uv cao2 is effective in eliminating cbz and pmd in sludge it can be followed by the subsequent anaerobic fermentation treatment which means the incomplete intermediates may be finally degraded however the detailed biotransformation of these incomplete intermediates during the ad should be investigated in future research 3 5 effect of mp uv cao2 pretreatment on the solubilization of sludge fig 9 a shows scod increased drastically within 2 h and then slowly to the maximum scod scodmax after 7 h reaction during mp uv cao2 treatment the scodmax increased with increasing cao2 dosage while overdose of cao2 and mp uv irradiation did not help much to increase scod fig 9 b shows tss and vss reduced more than 17 6 and 21 6 after 10 h mp uv irradiation respectively vss reduction increased slowly with the increase of cao2 dosage however tss reduction increased first and then decreased the maximum of tss reduction occurred at cao2 of 0 2 g g 1 vss this is because the increase of cao2 dosage can also increase the suspended solid fig s3 overall 7 h mp uv 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss was considered as the optimum irradiation time for sludge disintegration with this treatment scodmax was 13 6 greater than that under 7 h mp uv moreover scodmax with mp uv treatment were much greater than those with sole cao2 treatment scodmax increased by 657 under 7 h mp uv 0 2 g cao2 and 566 under 7 h mp uv as compared to that under sole 10 h cao2 treatment 98 8 mg g 1 vss fig 9 c therefore both mp uv and mp uv cao2 could serve as quick methods to promote the sludge solubilization however comprehensively considering the degradation of pharmaceutical degradation and sludge solubilization the operation condition with 7 h mp uv 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss is recommended in this condition cbz and pmd were removed by 92 3 and 90 2 respectively although mp uv cao2 performed very well in the removal of toxic torcs the consumption of chemicals and energy should be considered given the water content of was is 99 5 99 2 vss ts 0 6 0 7 and the optimum dosage of cao2 is 0 2 g g 1 vss the cao2 consumption is about 0 6 1 1 kg ton 1 was according to title 22 of california code of regulations 0 5 log removal 68 4 was needed for the removal of cbz and pmd in advanced oxidation processes park et al 2017 indicating the time for cbz and pmd removal is 1 3 3 1 h when ts was from 7 to 15 g l 1 therefore the energy consumption ept and the increase of the effective energy δeb of mp uv cao2 compared to control group without any treatment was 73 174 kwh m 3 and 2 6 5 6 kwh m 3 respectively as compared to ultrasounds with ept at 16 6 117 9 kwh m 3 and δeb at 1 5 7 4 kwh m 3 microwaves with ept at 37 5 150 kwh m 3 and δeb at 5 3 7 4 kwh m 3 etc table s6 mp uv cao2 does not show obvious advantage as an energetically self sufficient pretreatment however this pretreatment mainly aims to remove the refractory torcs in was therefore mp uv cao2 as a new aop to pretreat was is worthwhile studying and furthermore the subsequent ad after mp uv cao2 need to be investigated in future especially in a full scale wwtp 4 conclusion mp uv cao2 was an effective pretreatment method to remove cbz and pmd in was the degradation of cbz and pmd followed the pseudo first order kinetics higher cao2 dosage and lower vss concentration were conductive to the removals of cbz and pmd of the hydrolysates of cao2 ca oh 2 played a more important role than h2o2 during mp uv cao2 treatment using cao2 is better than using ca oh 2 and h2o2 for the removal of cbz and pmd under mp uv irradiation the degradation of cbz and pmd was mainly attributed to uv direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by oh 3dom and 1o2 considering mp uv cao2 as a new aop a model for predicting oh ss was proposed with cao2 dosage ranging from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss major transformation products of cbz and pmd were identified and the degradation pathways were proposed for the mp uv cao2 treatment of was most intermediates of cbz and pmd were well removed after 7 h mp uv cao2 additionally these intermediates are biodegradable which means mp uv cao2 as a good pretreatment method for was ad mp uv cao2 was effective in promoting the sludge solubilization considering both the degradation of cbz and pmd and the sludge solubilization the optimal operation condition with 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss and 7 h mp uv irradiation is recommended under this condition cbz and pmd were removed by 92 3 and 90 2 respectively and scod increased by 657 and 13 6 compared with sole 10 h cao2 treatment and 7 h mp uv treatment respectively indicating this technology may be used for the subsequent ad to produce high quality scfas and ch4 in future declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

the solubilization of sludge were investigated cbz and pmd were effectively removed and the removal fitted pseudo first kinetics under mp uv cao2 treatment with r2 0 97 the higher cao2 dosage and lower initial volatile suspended solids vss concentration were conductive to the removal of cbz and pmd of the cao2 hydrolysates ca oh 2 played a more important role than h2o2 during mp uv cao2 treatment the removal of the target compounds was attributed to direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by oh 3dom and 1o2 in which oh played a vital role with 62 2 contribution to the overall degradation rate a model predicting the steady concentration of oh in was vss 8 6 g l 1 under mp uv cao2 treatment with cao2 dosage ranging from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss was proposed and validated moreover major intermediates of cbz and pmd were detected and the probable transformation pathways during mp uv cao2 treatment were proposed in addition mp uv cao2 promoted the sludge solubilization effectively considering both the pharmaceutical degradation and sludge solubilization the optimum operation condition with 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss combined with 7 h mp uv irradiation is recommended under this condition more than 92 3 of cbz and 90 3 of pmd were removed and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod increased by 657 and 13 6 compared with sole 10 h cao2 0 2 g g 1 vss treatment and 7 h mp uv treatment respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords mp uv cao2 pretreatment waste activated sludge was carbamazepine cbz and primidone pmd degradation pathway sludge solubilization 1 introduction waste activated sludge was produced from wastewater treatment plants wwpts are becoming a major concern with the urbanization in the world anaerobic digestion ad is claimed to be a highly cost effective technology for was stabilization in modern waste sludge treatment anjum et al 2016 however the persistent trace organic contaminants torcs are one of major concerned issues during sludge treatment and application anjum et al 2016 these torcs including pesticides industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals and personal care products could be adsorbed onto sludge with concentration generally between ng g 1 and μg g 1 dry weight dw liu and wong 2013 subedi et al 2013 wu et al 2013 and difficult to be degraded during ad process stasinakis 2012 which were finally discharged to the

al 2008 reported methanogens were highly susceptible to torcs such as halogenated aliphatic chlrophenols and n subsituted aromatic compounds therefore these refractory torcs should be removed before ad recent years pretreatment of was is adopted to remove the toxic torcs and improve the solubilization of sludge it has been demonstrated that calcium peroxide cao2 as a slowly released oxidant could help to remove some torcs and enhance the solubilization of sludge chen et al 2016 li et al 2015 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 because cao2 can produce ca oh 2 h2o2 o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o 2 in moist media ma et al 2007 li et al 2015 has reported that the addition of 0 2 g cao2 g 1 volatile suspended solids vss during ad could decrease the total detection frequency of some torcs in the supernatant and improve the sludge solubilization zhang et al 2015 showed 0 25 g cao2 g 1 vss effectively removed more than 50 of estrogens in was and increased the soluble total organic carbon stoc by 25 after 7 d ad chen et al 2016 demonstrated 0 025 g cao2 g 1 vss enhanced the was dewaterability and broke the sludge floc through changing the extracellular polymeric substances in addition cao2 has been proved as a good pretreatment to promote the subsequent ad to produce high quality short chain fatty acids tscfa and methane ch4 li et al 2015 ping et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 therefore cao2 was considered to be a good additive for was pretreatment however the previous investigation found 19 of the 29 organic pollutants detected in the supernatants of raw sludge samples were not removed by cao2 treatment li et al 2015 our recent preliminary experiments also showed that cao2 had little degradation effects on the typical refractory pollutants carbamazepine cbz and primidone pmd fig s2 in supporting information si therefore combination of cao2 with other technologies as a stronger pretreatment method should be considered previous investigations have proved photochemical aops were the common and effective methods to remove refractory torcs in water and was rosario ortiz et al 2010 salihoglu et al 2012 yang et al 2014 yonar et al 2006 zhang and li 2014 zhang et al 2018 especially the uv h2o2 treatment which has been used for the refectory torcs control yang et al 2014 besides uv based processes have also been used to enhance was stabilization anjum et al 2016 zhang and li 2014 as cao2 was considered as solid h2o2 cao2 combination with uv irradiation uv cao2 is assumed to have the similar oxidation power to uv h2o2 to remove refractory pollutants in was furthermore sole cao2 and its hydrolysate ca oh 2 have been proved to accelerate hydrolysis and acidification processes during was ad li et al 2014 2015 hence combination of uv with cao2 as a novel sludge pretreatment to remove torcs in was was investigated in this paper cbz and pmd were selected as the typical torcs in this study as they were frequently detected in wastewater lqd 2300 ng l 1 and wastewater sludge lqd 103 ng g 1 dw for their wide application liu and wong 2013 oulton et al 2010 subedi et al 2013 and their biological hazard keen et al

pretreatment on sludge solubilization was evaluated and the optimal pretreatment conditions were recommended this work explores the mechanisms and applicability of a new advanced treatment to remove the persistent torcs in sludge and promote the safe application of sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals calcium peroxide cao2 75 cbz and pmd 97 purity as well as scavengers including isopropyl

the pretreatment of was using mp uv cao2 a merry go round photochemical reactor phchemiiii nbet co ltd beijing china equipped with medium pressure mercury lamp mp uv was used for the photoirradiation experiments it contained 12 quartz tubes and the volume of each tube was 80 ml the irradiant intensity of the mp uv was 180 mw cm 2 and the irradiance spectra were measured by a spectroscope usb2000 uv vis oceanoptics usa the mp uv lamp has relatively strong intensity at wavelength from 250 to 440 fig s1 was spiked with cbz or pmd at 0 1 mg g 1 vss was first mixed with cao2 for 2 min and then were irradiated by mp uv unless otherwise stated 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss was added during the photoirradiation each tube contained 50 ml sludge meanwhile two control tests were set with one only adding 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss and another using uv photoirradiation without cao2 the degradation of cbz and pmd were described using pseudo first order kinetics as follows eq 1 1 ln c c 0 k t where c is the residual

initial ph values from 1 83 to 12 12 on cbz and pmd degradation during uv cao2 treatment were conducted the initial ph value was adjusted using naoh and h2so4 as appropriate for 2 min before pretreatment 2 3 2 effects of cao2 hydrolysates combined with mp uv cao2 can be hydrolyzed into ca oh 2 and h2o2 in was zhang et al 2015 experiments using ca oh 2 or h2o2 combining with mp uv irradiation were conducted to ascertain effect of each hydrolysate on the removal of the target compounds the ca oh 2 dosage was set at the same initial ph of 0 20 g cao2 ph 9 05 and h2o2 were set at the equivalent amount of the hydrolysate of 0 20 g cao2 g 1 vss h2o2 0 071 g g 1 vss in addition cacl2 0 305 g g 1 vss was used to evaluate the effect of calcium ion like cao2 each additive was first mixed with was for 2 min before irradiation 2 3 3 effect of mp uv cao2 treatment on solubilization of was effect of mp uv cao2 pretreatment on was solubilization was investigated scod and vss were measured to evaluate the sludge solubilization li et al 2015 specifically 100 ml of sludge were first mixed well with various cao2 dosage from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss for 2 min and then exposed to mp uv irradiation from 0 to 10 h the change of scod was tested the reductions of tss and vss after 10 h were measured in addition was treated by various cao2 dosages without mp uv irradiation were set as control tests 2 4 analysis of reactive radicals 2 4 1 detection of the reactive radicals using scavengers h2o2 o2 oh triplet of dissolved organic matter 3dom o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and carbonate radical co3 may be produced in photochemical system upon adding cao2 jasper and sedlak 2013 kozak and włodarczyk makuła 2018 ma et al 2007 to understand contributions of each reactive radical in the removal of cbz and pmd effects of scavengers of these reactive radicals were investigated ipa 100 mmol g 1 vss was used to quench oh reactions jasper and sedlak 2013 ipe 100 mmol g 1 vss was used to quench 3dom jasper and sedlak 2013 sod 12 5 1000 unite ku g 1 vss was used to quench o2 singh 1982 cat 12 5 ku g 1 vss was used to quench h2o2 keen et al 2012 as 1o2 was mainly generated from the reaction between the dissolved oxygen and the 3dom haag and hoigne 1986 sparging n2 99 99 can be used to evaluate the effects of 1o2 and o2 on the removal of the target compounds jasper and sedlak 2013 scavengers were added into was and mixed evenly before irradiation 2 4 2 epr analysis electron paramagnetic resonance epr esp300 bruker germany was also used to detect the main reactive radicals during mp uv cao2 pretreatment 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used in trapping experiments dmpo can trap oh o2 and methyl radicals ch3 forming dmpo oh signal with four split lines with the height ratio of 1 2 2 1 dmpo ooh with a sextet epr signal and dmpo ch3 with six split lines with same height ration respectively barbierikova et al 2018 li et al 2015 lipovsky et al 2012 dmpo ooh can be easily converted into dmpo oh lipovsky et al 2012 to identify whether the dmpo oh signal was from the trapping of oh by dmpo sod 12 5 ku g 1 vss and thiourea 0 01 mol g 1 vss were used to quench o2 and oh respectively li et al 2015 singh 1982 as the alkyl radical c r may be generated from the oxidation of contaminants to form dmpo c r which had the similar dmpo ch3 signal feature zhang et al 2015 epr analysis for the oxidation of cbz and pmd under mp uv cao2 was also conducted cbz 1 mg g 1 vss and pmd 1 mg g 1 vss 2 4 3 detection of steady state oh concentrations to confirm uv cao2 as a new effective aop steady state concentrations of oh oh ss were calculated oh ss in was under mp uv cao2 treatment cao2 ranging from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss was measured using para chlorobenzoic acid pcba

detected using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1260 series details of the analytical methods are provided in si materials 2 6 identification of transformation products of cbz and pmd during uv cao2 treatment cbz and pmd may undergo structural alteration because of the electronic transition from an excited state to the ground state direct photolysis or photolytic transformation induced by reactive radicals generated by the uv photons indirect photolysis kosjek et al 2009 the transformation products of cbz and pmd in was under mp uv cao2 were investigated main

quadrupole mass spectrometer lc qqq details of the analytical methods are provided in si materials the samples of intermediates were prepared as the same procedure of cbz and pmd 2 7 analytical methods for other parameters the analytical methods for tcod scod tss vss ts vs ph oxidation reduction potential orp toc were all described in our previous investigations li et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 mp uv cao2 pretreatment for the degradation of cbz and pmd 3 1 1 effect of cao2 dosage cbz and pmd were well degraded under both mp uv and m uv cao2 treatments and the addition of cao2 obviously enhanced their removal fig 1 a and b the degradation of the target compounds under mp uv or mp uv cao2 was due to direct and indirect uv photolysis the indirect photolysis may be caused by free reactive radicals oh o 2 1o2 dom co 3 etc generated from uv light activated cao2 or dom jasper and sedlak 2013 kozak and włodarczyk makuła 2018 the significant improvement of degradation efficiency upon cao2 addition may be attributed to amounts of reactive radical generated from cao2 activated by uv light especially oh reactions 3 5 kozak and włodarczyk makuła 2018 which is a vital oxidative radical to remove micropollutants oulton et al 2010 rosario ortiz et al 2010 3 cao 2 2 h 2 o ca oh 2 h 2 o 2 4 2 cao 2 2 h 2 o 2 ca oh 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh the kinetics fitting results of cbz and pmd coincided well with the pseudo first order kinetics r 2 0 97 table s1 and the degradation rates k of cbz and pmd are shown in fig 1 c although k value increased with increasing cao2 the tendency became retarded in fact the degradation of micropollutant in was was the comprehensive outcome of multi factors on the one hand cao2 disrupted the was structure and increased sludge solubilization li et al 2015 which may reduce uv shading effect on micropollutant degradation furthermore it made the natural chelating agents organic acids amino acids and hydroxamate siderophores and transition metals release from sludge cell disruption forming modified fenton zhang et al 2015 which could accelerate the production rate of free radicals under mp uv therefore the degradation of cbz and pmd was improved on the other hand the over addition of cao2 resulted in the increase of tss fig s3 and dom they could compete with the target compounds for the uv light and oxidants which may retard the increase of k values of the target compounds furthermore the invariable uv intensity limited the linear formation of oh with the increase of cao2 the excessive cao2 caused a higher ph value fig 1 d which may increase the decomposition rate of h2o2 reaction 6 and lowered oh concentration reactions 7 10 and moreover may reduce the oh oxidation potential buxton et al 1988 consequently the increase of k value was retarded with the overdose of cao2 dosage in all 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss was considered as the suitable cao2 dosage for the degradation of the target compounds and the corresponding irradiation time for 90 of cbz and pmd degradation was 5 8 h and 6 3 h respectively 6 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 7 oh oh o h 2 o 8 oh o ho 2 k 2 10 10 l mol 1 s 1 9 oh h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o o 2 h h 2 o 10 oh ho 2 oh ho 2 o 2 h h 2 o fig 1 d shows final ph value increased with increasing cao2 dosage however at the same cao2 dosage the ph with mp uv treatment was lower than that without mp uv because mp uv cao2 treatment as a stronger aop caused a greater degree of was disruption resulting in the release of more extracellular and intracellular materials which may function as buffering agents meanwhile the orp increased exponentially with the cao2 dosage r 2 0 97 table s2 and the curve has the similar trends with k values of cbz and pmd in fig 1 c r 2 0 99 table s2 the orp increased little when cao2 dosage was higher than 0 2 g g 1 vss indicating that further addition of cao2 could not increase the oxidation capacity any more 3 1 2 effect of initial vss concentration and ph the increase of vss concentration has a significant suppression on the degradation of cbz and pmd under both mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments fig 2 a this is because the increase of vss caused serious uv screening meanwhile the increase of suspended organic matter doms e g humic acid and inorganic ions e g cl no3 no2 co3 2 and hco3 may compete with cbz and pmd for reactive radicals during the treatment qiu et al 2019 moreover the k values were fitted as an exponential function of initial vss concentration very well r 2 0 98 table s3 according the fitting formulas the degradation rates of the target compounds under different vss concentrations can be inferred fig 2 b showed both the extreme low and high initial ph values promoted the degradation of cbz and pmd under mp uv treatment and the increase of k values under alkaline conditions were more significantly than those under acidic conditions under mp uv cao2 treatment both the low and high initial ph induced a big promotion to the removal of the target compounds this can be explained as follows firstly previous investigation showed strong ph surroundings could increase the was solubilization through rupturing the sludge structure and cells ruiz hernando et al 2014 and subsequently improve the efficacy of uv light on micropollutant degradation secondly the improvement of k under low ph was because the acidic medium increased the release rate of h2o2 reaction 11 and the final h2o2 yield from cao2 wang et al 2016 which finally facilitated the formation of oh reactions 3 5 to degrade cbz and pmd however it should be noted that with the addition of cao2 ph increased to the alkaline condition irrespective of the initial ph fig s4 unless the very high initial ph condition ph 12 the initial alkaline condition cannot significantly improve the degradation rates of cbz and pmd under mp uv cao2 treatment fig 2 b therefore there is no need to adjust the initial ph of was under mp uv cao2 treatment 11 cao 2 2 h ca 2 h 2 o 2 3 2 the degradation mechanisms of cbz and pmd during mp uv cao2 treatment 3 2 1 effect of cao2 hydrolysates combined with mp uv combining cao2 hydrolysates with mp uv to remove the target compounds was investigated as shown in fig 3 when combining with mp uv irradiation ca oh 2 promoted the removal of cbz and pmd significantly while cacl2 and h2o2 had little influence therefore the alkaline condition caused by cao2 played an important role in the improvement of k during mp uv cao2 liquid h2o2 known as an oxidant could promote the was solubilization and remove some contaminants zhang and li 2014 however unlike cao2 it is thermodynamically unstable and easily decomposed to form water and oxygen therefore liquid h2o2 is insignificant in improving the degradation rate constants of the target compounds under mp uv however the slow release of h2o2 from cao2 may lead to the persistence of h2o2 in was as compared with liquid h2o2 resulting in the increase of oh from h2o2 photolysis meanwhile the alkaline condition caused by cao2 can promote the sludge disintegration which can improve the uv utilization efficiency during the photolysis of cbz and pmd therefore cao2 played a significant promotion in the degradation rate constants of the target compounds compared to h2o2 under mp uv moreover compared with the mp uv treatment the increases of k values of the target compounds cbz 0 235 h 1 pmd 0 215 h 1 by mp uv cao2 treatment were greater than the sum of the increases caused by mp uv ca oh 2 and mp uv h2o2 treatments cbz 0 102 h 1 pmd 0 115 h 1 this indicates that during mp uv irradiation using cao2 was better than combination of ca oh 2 with h2o2 to improve the degradation of micropollutants in was 3 2 2 contributions of reactive radicals on the degradation of cbz and pmd 3 2 2 1 identification by scavengers fig 4 a and b reveal effects of reactive radical scavengers on the degradation rate constants of the target compounds in was under mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments respectively ipa 0 1 mol l 1 can quench oh almost completely reaction 12 whereas reactions of o2 and 1o2 are unaffected singh 1982 therefore the significant decrease of k upon adding ipa indicates oh played an important role in cbz and pmd degradation under mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments the sparged n2 was used to remove o2 and 1o2 since sole o2 had no effect on the removal of the target compounds in was fig s5 the decrease of k under n2 satuated conditions was attributed to the elimination of 1o2 under both treatments sod a o2 scavenger can react with oh and 1o2 at 5 3 1010 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 109 m 1 s 1 respectively singh 1982 therefore to eliminate the effects of oh and 1o2 the ipa was added and n2 was sparged in advance the negligible decrease of k upon adding sod implies little contribution of o2 to the removal of cbz and pmd ipe usually as 3dom scavenger can react with oh at 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 huang et al 2011 meanwhile 3dom can be quenched by o2 jasper and sedlak 2013 therefore the ipa was added before the reaction and n2 was saturated during the reaction the comparison between k values upon n2 ipa and n2 ipa ipe additions indicates 3dom could promote cbz and pmd degradation during the treatments when cat usually as h2o2 scavenger was further added the n2 ipa ipe sod cat group it appeared no suppression on the degradation rate constants of the target compounds under mp up treatment but a little suppression under mp up cao2 treatment which is inconsistent with aforementioned little effect of sole h2o2 on the degradation of the target compounds fig s5 because h2o2 generated from cao2 hydrolysis may improve the efficacy of uv light irradiation on the target compounds via was disruption 12 oh ch 3 2 choh ch 3 2 coh h 2 o k 1 9 10 9 l mol 1 s 1 the degradations of cbz and pmd in the condition with addition of n2 ipa ipe sod cat during mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments may be caused by direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by co3 jasper and sedlak 2013 previous investigation demonstrated that stic was the main factor to impact the production of co3 huang and mabury 2000 preliminary investigation showed stic was about 3 6 mmol l 1 and 3 9 mmol l 1 under mp uv and mp uv cao2 treatments respectively meanwhile the effect of co3 on the target compounds was negligible when the stic co3 2 was below 10 mmol l 1 detailed data not shown here moreover the second order reaction rates posed by co3 on the target compounds was 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than the values posed by oh on the target compounds and dom could reduce the lifetime of co3 canonica et al 2005 jasper and sedlak 2013 therefore the contribution of co3 to the overall degradation rates of the target compounds was negligible and the degradation of cbz and pmd with the addition of n2 ipa ipe sod cat should be attributed to the direct photolysis the contributions of different reactive radicals to the overall degradation rate constants of was spiked cbz and pmd are shown in fig 4 c the degradation of was spiked cbz was mainly induced by oh 68 3dom 15 and direct photolysis 6 under mp uv cao2 while oh 39 3dom 24 and direct photolysis 23 under mp uv the degradation of was spiked pmd was mainly induced by oh 62 3dom 15 1o2 10 and direct photolysis 8 under mp uv cao2 while oh 38 3dom 23 1o2 11 and direct photolysis 21 under mp uv treatment the contribution of oh was obviously increased under mp uv cao2 treatment than that under mp uv treatment this enhancement was due to the large production of oh upon adding cao2 in our investigation oh was the main reactive radical to remove cbz and pmd but the contributions of direct photolysis 3dom and 1o2 increased as compared to previous investigation in water jasper and sedlak 2013 this was attributed to 1 the different sludge matrix from aqueous matrix and 2 the specific mp uv lamp and the strong intense irradiance of mp uv 3 2 2 2 identification by epr during epr experiments sod was added to quench o2 reaction with dmpo to generate dmpo ooh which is easily converted into dmpo oh during mp uv cao2 treatment lipovsky et al 2012 the quartet dmpo oh signal from the reaction between dmpo and oh indicates oh generated during mp uv cao2 treatment in fig 5 a fig 5 b shows a negligible trace of dmpo oh signal and a dmpo ooh signal upon adding thiourea a oh quencher which indicates the generation of o2 in was under mp uv cao2 treatment the weak dmpo oh signal may be transformed from dmpo ooh fig 5 c displays the primary spectral features of similar dmpo ch3 upon adding the target compounds under mp uv cao2 treatment according to previous investigation the primary spectra signal may be dmpo c r signal zhang et al 2015 furthermore the dmpo c r signal further confirmed the existence of oh radicals because oh can attack the target compounds to produce c r which can transform dmpo into dmpo c r lipovsky et al 2012 fig 5 d exhibits the dmpo oh dmpo ooh and dmpo c r signals in was under mp uv cao2 indicating the existence of oh o2 and probable c r radicals in was during mp uv cao2 treatment 3 3 modeling and validating the steady state oh concentration since oh played a vital role in the degradation of cbz and pmd under mp uv cao2 treatment oh ss was further calculated using pcba the changes of k p c b a and k i p a p c b a under mp uv cao2 treatment are shown in fig s6 according to eq 2 the oh ss was calculated and shown in fig 6 a the oh ss increased from 1 18 10 15 mol l 1 to 1 01 10 14 mol l 1 with cao2 dosage increasing from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss the mathematical fitting to the curves shows that oh ss is an exponential function of cao2 dosage cao2 eq 13 r 2 0 99 13 oh ss 1 22 10 14 1 01 10 14 exp 3 06 cao2 the oh ss increased with the increase of cao2 dosage but the tendency became retarded this is because the increase of cao2 dosage would increase the production of h2o2 reaction 3 and ph which finally increased the oh ss under uv activation reaction 5 however the uv irradiance was fixed and the increase of cao2 would increase the tss concentration which may block the uv irradiation and retard the increase of oh formation this phenomena was in consistent with the tendency of cbz and pmd degradation described in section 3 1 1 to evaluate the applicability of the fitting formula of oh ss eq 13 predicted degradation rates of the target compounds k o h c o m p o u n d p r e d i c t e d based on eq 14 were compared to the measured degradation rates k o h c o m p o u n d m e a s u r e d of the target

and k i p a p m d at different cao2 dosages under mp uv cao2 treatment are showed in fig s6 14 k o h c o m p o u n d p r e d i c t e d k o h c o m p o u n d oh s s 15 k o h c o m p o u n d m e a s u r e d k c o m p o u n d k i p a c o m p o u n d where k o h c o m p o u n d is the degradation rates of the target compounds caused by oh radical in h 1 according to eq 14 and eq 15 when cao2 dosage increased from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss the predicted k o h c b z increased from 0 0688 h 1 to 0 328 h 1 and the measured k o h c b z increased from 0 0709 h 1 to 0 330 h 1 the predicted k o h p m d was from 0 0507 h 1 to 0 242 h 1 corresponding to the measured k o h p m d from 0 0541 h 1 to 0 243 h 1 k o h c o m p o u n d m e a s u r e d of the target compounds under mp uv cao2 treatment agreed well with k o h c o m p o u n d p r e d i c t e d at various cao2 dosage the difference between them was less than 7 fig 6 b meanwhile the pearson product moment correlation coefficients between them were over 0 99 therefore the fitting formula of oh ss at various initial cao2 dosage during mp uv cao2 treatment was considered reasonable however since the vss is the big influencing factor for mp uv cao2 treatment the effect of vss on the oh generation should be investigated in future 3 4 the transformation products of cbz and pmd 3 4 1 the transformation products of carbamazepine the detected intermediates of cbz are listed in table s4 their variations detected by lc qqq during mp uv cao2 treatment are shown in fig 7 a during mp uv cao2 treatment both the olefinic double bond in the central heterocyclic ring and two outside aromatic rings can be attacked based on the transformation products detected in was and the aforementioned degradation mechanism a possible degradation pathway for cbz was proposed in fig 8 a the olefinic double bond was usually hydroxylated to form corresponding hydroxyl derivatives hu et al 2009 li et al 2013 tang et al 2017 such as the alcohol 10 hydroxy 10 11 dihydro carbamazepine cbz 10oh and 10 11 dihydro 10 11 trans cis dihydroxy cbz cbz dioh aldehyde acridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic and ketone i e oxcarbazepine therefore the hydration of the c10c11 double bond of cbz firstly occurred forming cbz 10oh due to direct photolysis of cbz chiron et al 2006 the second predominant pathway involved the heterocyclic ring contraction process chiron et al 2006 the reactive double bond was firstly attacked by oxidants to yield 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine cbz ep which has been mentioned in many studies for water or soil treatments de laurentiis et al 2012 kosjek et al 2009 li et al 2013 vogna et al 2004 then cbz ep was further oxidized into acridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic by oh through the heterocyclic ring contraction with the loss of the conh2 lateral chain kosjek et al 2009 vogna et al 2004 this contraction may take place via a pinacol type rearrangement for π electron rich heterocycles and convert an azepine ring into an aromatic structure li et al 2013 finally aic was hydroxylated into hydroxyacridine 9 carboxaldehyde aic oh or the carboxyaldehyde group of aic would cleavage to yield acridine ai kosjek et al 2009 in addition although cbz dioh was not detected here previous investigation has showed cbz ep may easily evolve into cbz dioh during photooxidation and then undergo ring contraction to yield ai via direct photolysis de laurentiis et al 2012 the aromatic rings of cbz can be attacked by oh to form two stereoisomers cbz oh 2 hydroxy carbamazepine and 3 hydroxy carbamazepine they can be further hydroxylated into the dihydroxylated derivatives cbzohoh de laurentiis et al 2012 miao et al 2005 the dihydroxylated stereoisomers were distinguished on the basis of the retention time which may be 2 7 dihydroxycarbamazepine 2 8 dihydroxycarbamazepine and 3 8 dihydroxycarbamazepine with the hydroxyl function on the different carbon site of outside aromatic ring de laurentiis et al 2012 fig 7 a shows the detected intermediates were almost degraded after 7 h treatment by mp uv cao2 which indicates mp uv cao2 is effective in removing cbz and its intermediates previous investigations have also shown ai and aic are biodegradable kosjek et al 2009 and the intermediates containing a hydroxyl and carbonyl groups such as aic oh can be mineralized by micro organisms found in activated sludge keen et al 2012 therefore the cbz products produced in mp uv cao2 treatment was biodegradable 3 4 2 the transformation products of primidone the detected intermediates of pmd are listed in table s5 and their variations detected by lc qqq are shown in fig 7 b fig 8 b reveals a possible degradation pathway for pmd in was under mp uv cao2 phenobarbital pbb and hydroxyl primidone pmd oh were first detected during reaction which suggested the attack of oh on the pyrimidine ring and the aromatic ring of pmd this result was consistent with previous investigations for pmd in water under uv photolysis sijak et al 2015 and electron beam radiolysis liu et al 2015 pmd may also undergo the cleavage of n 1 c 2 bond and n 3 c 2 bond of pyrimidine ring to form phenylethylmalonamide pema mac leod et al 2008 moreover both pbb and pmd 4oh may be oxidized by oh to form 4 hydroxyphenobarbital pbb4oh in addition the dipeptide bonds on the heterocyclic ring of pbb can be hydrolyzed to form pema as shown in fig 7 b mp uv cao2 is also considered to be an effective pretreatment method to remove pmd and its intermediates because of the disappearance of pmd intermediates in 7 h reaction mp uv cao2 process efficiently removed cbz and pmd as well as their intermediates however due to the complexity of organic constituents in sludge there may exist other incomplete intermediates which may lead to environmental problem and need to be further treated similar problems was also mentioned in the investigation to cbz degradation in soil li et al 2013 previous investigations have shown the combination of oxidation and biotransformation has the potential to synergistically mineralize persistent contaminants and their incomplete intermediates in water keen et al 2012 watts and linden 2008 for example uv treatment followed by aerobic or anoxic activated sludge treatment can remove cbz and its final such as acridine and 9 10h acridone in wastewater kosjek et al 2009 uv h2o2 treatment followed by a mixed bacterial inoculum from activated sludge processes can mineralize cbz and its oxidation products keen et al 2012 therefore uv h2o2 process followed by a biofilm mediated biofiltration process have been proposed for the treatment of recalcitrant contaminants in water keen et al 2012 metz et al 2011 in this study we proved that mp uv cao2 is effective in eliminating cbz and pmd in sludge it can be followed by the subsequent anaerobic fermentation treatment which means the incomplete intermediates may be finally degraded however the detailed biotransformation of these incomplete intermediates during the ad should be investigated in future research 3 5 effect of mp uv cao2 pretreatment on the solubilization of sludge fig 9 a shows scod increased drastically within 2 h and then slowly to the maximum scod scodmax after 7 h reaction during mp uv cao2 treatment the scodmax increased with increasing cao2 dosage while overdose of cao2 and mp uv irradiation did not help much to increase scod fig 9 b shows tss and vss reduced more than 17 6 and 21 6 after 10 h mp uv irradiation respectively vss reduction increased slowly with the increase of cao2 dosage however tss reduction increased first and then decreased the maximum of tss reduction occurred at cao2 of 0 2 g g 1 vss this is because the increase of cao2 dosage can also increase the suspended solid fig s3 overall 7 h mp uv 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss was considered as the optimum irradiation time for sludge disintegration with this treatment scodmax was 13 6 greater than that under 7 h mp uv moreover scodmax with mp uv treatment were much greater than those with sole cao2 treatment scodmax increased by 657 under 7 h mp uv 0 2 g cao2 and 566 under 7 h mp uv as compared to that under sole 10 h cao2 treatment 98 8 mg g 1 vss fig 9 c therefore both mp uv and mp uv cao2 could serve as quick methods to promote the sludge solubilization however comprehensively considering the degradation of pharmaceutical degradation and sludge solubilization the operation condition with 7 h mp uv 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss is recommended in this condition cbz and pmd were removed by 92 3 and 90 2 respectively although mp uv cao2 performed very well in the removal of toxic torcs the consumption of chemicals and energy should be considered given the water content of was is 99 5 99 2 vss ts 0 6 0 7 and the optimum dosage of cao2 is 0 2 g g 1 vss the cao2 consumption is about 0 6 1 1 kg ton 1 was according to title 22 of california code of regulations 0 5 log removal 68 4 was needed for the removal of cbz and pmd in advanced oxidation processes park et al 2017 indicating the time for cbz and pmd removal is 1 3 3 1 h when ts was from 7 to 15 g l 1 therefore the energy consumption ept and the increase of the effective energy δeb of mp uv cao2 compared to control group without any treatment was 73 174 kwh m 3 and 2 6 5 6 kwh m 3 respectively as compared to ultrasounds with ept at 16 6 117 9 kwh m 3 and δeb at 1 5 7 4 kwh m 3 microwaves with ept at 37 5 150 kwh m 3 and δeb at 5 3 7 4 kwh m 3 etc table s6 mp uv cao2 does not show obvious advantage as an energetically self sufficient pretreatment however this pretreatment mainly aims to remove the refractory torcs in was therefore mp uv cao2 as a new aop to pretreat was is worthwhile studying and furthermore the subsequent ad after mp uv cao2 need to be investigated in future especially in a full scale wwtp 4 conclusion mp uv cao2 was an effective pretreatment method to remove cbz and pmd in was the degradation of cbz and pmd followed the pseudo first order kinetics higher cao2 dosage and lower vss concentration were conductive to the removals of cbz and pmd of the hydrolysates of cao2 ca oh 2 played a more important role than h2o2 during mp uv cao2 treatment using cao2 is better than using ca oh 2 and h2o2 for the removal of cbz and pmd under mp uv irradiation the degradation of cbz and pmd was mainly attributed to uv direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by oh 3dom and 1o2 considering mp uv cao2 as a new aop a model for predicting oh ss was proposed with cao2 dosage ranging from 0 to 0 5 g g 1 vss major transformation products of cbz and pmd were identified and the degradation pathways were proposed for the mp uv cao2 treatment of was most intermediates of cbz and pmd were well removed after 7 h mp uv cao2 additionally these intermediates are biodegradable which means mp uv cao2 as a good pretreatment method for was ad mp uv cao2 was effective in promoting the sludge solubilization considering both the degradation of cbz and pmd and the sludge solubilization the optimal operation condition with 0 2 g cao2 g 1 vss and 7 h mp uv irradiation is recommended under this condition cbz and pmd were removed by 92 3 and 90 2 respectively and scod increased by 657 and 13 6 compared with sole 10 h cao2 treatment and 7 h mp uv treatment respectively indicating this technology may be used for the subsequent ad to produce high quality scfas and ch4 in future declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

19059,imitating natural lakes pond treatment systems inherit a high complexity with interconnected web of biochemical reactions and complex hydraulic processes as such its simulation requires a large and integrated model which has been a challenge for pond engineers in this study we develop an all encompassing model to gain a quantitative and comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic physicochemical and microbiological conversion processes in the most common pond a facultative pond moreover to deal with an evitable issue of large mechanistic models as overparameterization leading to poor identifiability a systematic parameter estimation was implemented the application of sensitivity analysis reveals the most influential parameters on pond performance particularly physical parameters such as vertical eddy diffusivity water temperature and maximum growth rate of heterotrophs induce the most changes of organic matters while microbial assimilation and ammonia volatilization appear to be main processes for nutrient removal in contrast the efficiency of phosphate precipitation and nutrient biological removal via polyphosphate accumulating organisms and denitrifying bacteria is limited identifiability problems are addressed mainly by the characterization of light dependence of algal growth interaction between water temperature and its coefficient and the growth of autotrophic bacteria while based on the determinant measures the most important parameter subsets affecting model outputs are related to physical processes and algal activity after the establishment of the influential and identifiable parameter subset an automatic calibration with the data collected from ucubamba pond system ecuador demonstrates the effect of high altitude climatic conditions on pond behaviors an aerobic prevailing condition is observed as a result of high light intensity causing accelerated algal activities hence leading to the limitation of hydrolysis anaerobic processes and the growth of anoxic heterotrophs for denitrification furthermore the output of uncertainty analysis indicates that a large avoidable uncertainty as a result of vast complexity of the applied model can be reduced greatly via a systematic approach for parameter estimation graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste stabilization pond integrated mechanistic model sensitivity analysis identifiability analysis parameter estimation uncertainty analysis 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsps are large shallow lagoons surrounded by earth embankments where wastewater is purified by completely natural processes taking advantage of algal photosynthetic oxygenation wsps are a major choice for wastewater treatment plants wwtps in many countries e g the us 8000 installations france 2500 installations and germany 3000 installations epa 2011 despite being categorized as simple and basic operational system processes inside the pond systems are complicated facultative ponds fps which are normally used as primary or secondary treatment in pond series display a high complexity because of a synergy between microalgae and bacteria this mutualistic relationship is one of the main reasons for the variation of vertical oxygen profile creating simultaneous occurrence of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones inside fps to simulate this interconnected web of biochemical processes and reactions an integrated modeling approach is required however has been a challenge for pond engineers sah et al 2011 there are two main goals of applying models in environmental sciences in general firstly models are a powerful tool to describe and analyze the behavior of the systems second models can be used to forecast the responses of the systems under varying conditions each of these two goals addresses different pathways of modeling techniques for descriptive models the task is to construct a simple model with good estimates of model parameters which can simulate measured output with reasonable accuracy omlin and reichert 1999 a more complex model which is unable to increase considerably its goodness of fit or gain a better understanding of the system is normally considered a wasteful expense according to the parsimony principle of spriet 1985 on the other hand if the goal of the model is to have a reliable prediction and reasonable approximation of model uncertainty simple model structure may result in poor predictive performance and significant underestimation of uncertainty estimates reichert and omlin 1997 from this perspective an integrated mechanistic model is a more suitable candidate in fact during the last two decades there has been a shift from data driven models to mechanistic models due to the great interest in seeking better cost effective designs process optimization and pond upgrades ho et al 2017 besides pond engineers also desire to extrapolate their models to other systems under different driving conditions which is impossible without simulating the causal mechanisms of the systems brun et al 2001 however pond engineers are currently facing two fundamental problems in simulating this complex system first there is no standard model which includes hydrodynamics physicochemical as well as microbial conversion processes sah et al 2012 more importantly these large and complex models are almost always overparameterized leading to a problem of poor identifiability as the number of available data for parameter estimation is of significantly lower order than model complexity omlin and reichert 1999 identifiability problem relating to the application of large mechanistic models has long been studied and widely reported by the scientific community of wwtps brun et al 2002 van veldhuizen et al 1999 weijers and vanrolleghem 1997 however it is striking that the number of research paper dealing with this issue in wsps remains extremely low ho et al 2017 in fact to the author s knowledge there have been only three mechanistic models in pond modeling i e kayombo et al 2000 dochain et al 2003 beran and kargi 2005 that conducted model calibration but without the consideration of the identifiability problem in this study we develop an all encompassing mathematical model which simulates not only biogeochemical processes of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal but also the hydraulic and physical processes of a fp the most common ponds in wsp systems we explicitly consider the interplay between biogeochemical and hydraulic submodels in the mass balance of multiple variables the main purpose is to gain a quantitative and comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic physicochemical and microbiological conversion processes in the fp this leads to the fact that many relevant processes which are not yet included in the previous models colomer and rico 1993 gehring et al 2010 sah et al 2011 such as phosphorus removal processes by phosphorus accumulating organisms pao or precipitation ammonia volatilization sedimentation and resuspension are included in the model subsequently to deal with the inevitable problem of overparameterization in this large mechanistic model a systematic procedure of parameter estimation was conducted firstly sensitivity sa and identifiability analyses ia are implemented via a practical technique proposed by brun et al 2002 where two criteria of model parameters are addressed first the model output needs to be sufficiently sensitive to the changes of the parameters second these changes may not be compensated by the changes of other parameters as a result a subset of influential and identifiable parameters is revealed which subsequently is calibrated by fitting the model to the data collected in ucubamba wsp cuenca ecuador in 2013 finally monte carlo simulation a nonlinear error propagation with latin hypercube sampling technique is applied for uncertainty analysis 2 methods 2 1 study site and data collection the wsp is located at ucubamba at altitude of 2400 m a s l the largest wwtp in ecuador is operated by etapa to treat the domestic effluent of around 400 000 inhabitants in cuenca the dry season is between june and december and the rainy season is between january and may with temperatures between 7 and 20 c and 12 25 c respectively this pond system is divided into two identical flow lines containing an aerated pond ap a facultative pond fp and a maturation pond mp fig 1 more detailed information of ucubamba wsp system can be found in ho et al 2018 the data used for model calibration and validation were measured at the inlet and outlet of fp1 during 2013 following the cross validation of snee 1977 to avoid overfitting problem of the model the data of the first half of 2013 were used for calibration while the predictive performance of calibrated model were compared to the rest of the data the area of the fp1 is 13 ha with the depth of 2 m respectively leading to the theoretical hydraulic retention time hrt of five days the inlet outlet of this pond consists of a submerged pipe of 0 9 m diameter lying at the bottom of the 1 8 m deep pond and an overflow structure is a sharp weir of 10 m long alvarado et al 2012 the samples were collected during the daytime by grab sampling method three times per 2 weeks at the input and output of the fp1 and then were analyzed in the laboratory following the american public health association methods apha 2005 the variables were measured including for bod5 mg o2 l 1 cod mg o2 l 1 ammonium mg nh4 n l 1 nitrite mg no2 n l 1 nitrate mg no3 n l 1 tkn mg n l 1 tp mg p l 1 ph chlorophyll a total solid ts mg l 1 volatile suspended solid vss mg l 1 water temperature oc and dissolved oxygen do mg o2 l 1 additionally meteorological data including air temperature c solar radiation w m 2 and wind speed m s 1 were obtained from the meteorological station of celec hidropaute located at around 600 m from the wsp 2 2 model description and implementation 2 2 1 system boundaries a vertical 1 d model of the fp1 in ucubamba wsp was developed by the integration of hydraulic and biogeochemical submodels within the lake module of the software aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 the software is designed to simultaneously simulate physical and biogeochemical processes in natural and mechanical aquatic systems since the pond area is relative small compared to natural lakes the assumption of homogenous horizontal gradients for the 1 d approach is satisfied goudsmit et al 2002 as such wind driven horizontal flow is assumed to be negligible hence wind effect is simulated only as the shear stress on water surface moreover the bottom sediment layer is simulated in a sediment submodel with an assumption of its homogeneity meaning that no diffusive exchanges among neighboring sediment layers can occur regarding biogeochemical submodel the growth of algae is divided into two subprocesses with different nitrogen sources nh4 preferred or no3 furthermore the temporal variation of algal photosynthesis and respiration activity as a result of the day night cycle are included in the model by setting the fluctuation of irradiance as a function of time even though light attenuation k z is a function of algae biomass suspended and dissolved solids which can fluctuate within the pond system for practical purposes it is assumed to consider k z values as constant heaven et al 2005 the role of cyanobacteria and algal consumers is assumed to be negligible hence being neglected to avoid complexity only chemical equilibrium between nh4 and nh3 is taken into account the integration of the hydraulic and biogeochemical submodels consists of a set of different differential equations which are integrated numerically by dassl algorithm follows newton rapson s methods where the derivative is approximated via backward differentiation formula with boundary conditions can be found in software aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 the initial and influent conditions of the model variables are supplied in supplementary material s1 the 1 d model was implemented with the time resolution of 30 min the vertical resolution of 20 cm and the accuracy was set at 0 1 2 2 2 hydraulic processes a hydraulic submodel is built to simulate the hydrodynamic flow of the fp1 based on a combination of conventional advective diffusive model for the water column with one uniform sediment layer and buoyancy extended k epsilon turbulence model see fig 2 elliott et al 1999 goudsmit et al 2002 rodi and research 1984 ulrich et al 1995 more specifically dissolved and particulate substances are transported through the water column by vertical mixing and advection the movements of particulate substances are driven by sedimentation the bottom sediment layer is simulated in a sediment submodel with an assumption of its homogeneity the exchange of substances between water column and pore water of the sediment layer via resuspension and diffusion are taken into account the surface shear is applied to count the effect of wind stress driving the horizontal motion which is estimated by following the study of amorocho and devries 1980 in the water column the following differential equations are solved for each dissolved and particulate state variable 1 s i t a z a k z s i z a z q s i r s i q a s i n d a a d z d θ h s e d 2 s i s s i 2 x j t a z a k z x j z a z q x j r x j q a x i n z v s e d x j d a d z v r e s x s j where s i is the concentration of a dissolved substance i in the water column g m 3 x j is the concentration of a particulate compound j in the water column g m 3 t is the time d z is the vertical coordinate pointing downwards z 0 at the pond surface m a is the cross sectional area of the fp m2 k z is the vertical mixing coefficient m2 d 1 r s i and r x j are the biogeochemical transformation rates in the water column g m 3 d 1 q is the hydraulic flow rate m 3 d 1 s in and x in are the influent concentration of dissolved and particulate substances g m 3 h sed is the thickness of the sediment layer m v sed is the sedimentation velocity m d 1 q is the volumetric lateral water flow m2 d 1 d is the coefficient of molecular diffusion m2 d 1 θ is the porosity of the sediment layer s s i is the concentration of dissolved substance i in the sediment layer g m 3 x s j is the concentration of particulate substance j in the sediment layer g m 3 v res is the resuspension velocity of the sediment m d 1 in the right hand side of the above equations the first terms represent the vertical mixing because of eddy diffusion the second terms reflect the advective flow as a result of lateral influent especially noteworthy is that the third terms represent the net effect of biogeochemical transformation processes which shows how two submodels are integrated these transformation processes are described in more detail in the biogeochemical submodel the fourth terms are related to the pond influent the last term of eq 1 refers to the exchange of the dissolved substances between the water column and pore water of the sediment layer the last two terms of eq 2 represent the sedimentation and resuspension of particulate substances between the water column and pore water of the sediment layer lopes et al 2011 omlin et al 2001b these two equations are coupled with two following equations which represents the processes in the sediment layer 3 s s i t d a d z i e x s s i d a d z h s e d r s s i 4 x s j t d a d z i e x x s j d a d z h s e d r x s j in these two equations i e x s s i and i e x x s j are the flux of the dissolved substance i and particulate substance j into the sediment layer g d 1 and r s s i and r x s j are the biogeochemical transformation rates in the sediment layer g m 3 d 1 the first term of eq 3 describes the changes in mass of the dissolved substances in the sediment layer due to diffusive exchange with the neighboring sediment layers if there are more than one sediment layer the first term of eq 4 refers the advection of the particles caused by sedimentation the last term in both equations represents the transformation processes of the substances through the sediment layer 2 2 3 biogeochemical processes a biogeochemical submodel describes the transformations of dissolved and particulate substances inside the fp1 which are specified via 30 kinetic rate equations these mathematical equations represent aerobic anoxic and anaerobic reactions carried out by the metabolisms and interactions of algae and bacteria in the fp see fig 3 the details of stoichiometric matrix kinetic rate expressions and their values are shown in supplementary materials s2s4 the formulation of the biogeochemical transformation rates can be found in the supplementary material s5 particularly the aerobic and anoxic processes are built following the activated sludge model 2d henze et al 2000 the anaerobic processes are simplified from the constructed wetland model no 1 langergraber et al 2009 and the algal metabolism is based on the river water quality model 1 reichert et al 2001 the arrhenius equation is included in all reaction rates to describe the temperature dependence the interactions between all involved microbial groups are summarized in table 1 in the model gas exchange at the pond surface includes two processes i e oxygen reaeration and ammonia volatilization the oxygen reaeration rate was a flux proportional to pond depth the difference between saturation concentration and the available oxygen level and interfacial transfer coefficient morenograu et al 1996 concerning ammonia volatilization in the chemical equilibrium between nh4 and nh3 the concentration of nh3 is dependent on ph temperature and total ammonia concentration emerson et al 1975 an equilibrium based mass transfer equation in valero and mara 2007 is applied to calculate the theoretical ammonia volatilization rate precipitation and redissolution of phosphate po4 3 are accounted given the assumption that precipitation and redissolution are reverse processes henze et al 2000 additionally light attenuation is included to describe the exponential decrease of light intensity with depth by beer s law 2 3 parameter estimation 2 3 1 local sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa evaluates the degree to which model inputs affect model output from that the universality and robustness of these parameters can be further investigated the following technique of sa was proposed in brun et al 2001 firstly the model is defined as being described above subsequently the prior uncertainty of model parameters and inputs θ j is estimated based on the literature scale factors of state variables which are used to make the results for the various model endpoints comparable are calculated based on their mean concentration in the system brun et al 2002 after prior analysis steps gaussian error propagation of the uncertainty ranges is applied to compute the sensitivity function for each state variable y i against the changes of model parameter θ j as follows 5 s i j δ θ j s c i y i θ j where i 1 n representing the model output variables j 1 137 representing the model parameters δθ j represents the uncertainty ranges which were estimated following brun et al 2001 omlin et al 2001a and benedetti et al 2012 sc i is the scale factor of the state variable y i the values of δθ j and sc i are listed in supplementary material s6 the importance ranking of parameters was then determined based on the sensitivity measure δ j m s q r in eq 6 6 δ j m s q r 1 n i 1 n s i j 2 a high δ j m s q r means that the value of parameter θ j has an important influence on simulation results while a sensitivity measure of zero indicates no effects on model output 2 3 2 identifiability analysis after the calculation of the important ranking 30 parameters with the highest values suggesting that they are the most influential parameters on the model output was chosen for identifiability analysis two different measures collinearity index γ and determinant measure ρ were calculated for every parameter subset k of these 30 parameters to assess their identifiability the collinearity index represents the compensability of the parameter subset k which can be calculated as shown in eq 7 7 γ k 1 m i n β 1 s 1 β 1 s k β k 1 m i n β 1 s β 1 m i n e v s k t s k where s k being an n k submatrix of the normalized matrix s k s i j with normalized value of the sensitivity function s i k s i k s i k n is the total number of model output variables k 1 30 β β 1 β k t is a vector of coefficient of the length k with the constraint β 1 e v is the eigenvalue of s k t s k γ k quantifies the degree of approximate linear dependence of the sensitivity functions of the parameters a value of γ over 10 indicates a poor identifiability of parameter subset mieleitner and reichert 2008 the second criterion determinant measure ρ is defined as shown in eq 8 8 ρ k d e t s k t s k 1 2 k determinant measure ρ is proposed by weijers and vanrolleghem 1997 which combines the information provided by δ j m s q r and γ in which a high value of ρ indicates a low value of γ and a high value of δ j m s q r hence good conditional identifiability of parameter subset brun et al 2002 2 3 3 model calibration after sa and ia a subset of identifiable and influential parameters is chosen for calibration with the data collected for the first six months of 2013 generally to objectify calibration process a function representing the agreement between model and data is defined to demonstrate the desire to fit the model to the data dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 in this case the weighted sum of squares wss of the residuals is minimized from which selected parameters are calibrated using the simplex algorithm reichert 1994 to calculate the wss each residual is divided by a scale factor sc i of the corresponding variable y i from that the residuals become non dimensional as sc i and the model output have a same dimension mieleitner and reichert 2008 9 w s s θ j i 1 n y m e a s i y i θ j s c i 2 in this equation y m e a s i is the i th measurement y i θ j is the calculated value of the model output corresponding to the i th measurement and evaluated at the time and location of this measurement and n is the number of data points 2 4 uncertainty analysis like natural lakes wsp systems are inherently subject to large variations hence uncertainty analysis ua is considered an essential role during their modeling process ho et al 2017 since sa can help to recognize the uncertainty source from model inputs which allocates to the uncertainty of model output it is recommended that ua and sa should be implemented in tandem saltelli et al 2008 in this study ua is conducted in two cases in the first case all of the prior uncertainties listed in supplementary material s6 are included while the calibrated value of the identifiable parameters is fixed with no uncertainty in the second case these calculations allow assessing the contribution of these parameters to the uncertainty of model output monte carlo simulation is applied using the uncsim package reichert 2005 to propagate the model uncertainty into the predictions mckay et al 1979 500 sets of samples are generated using latin hypercube sampling lhs technique which provides a sufficient coverage of parameter space 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa is designed as a tool to identify the most influential model parameters for the variability of the state variables for the overparameterized models sa is considered very useful as model output are often strongly influenced by few key inputs saltelli 2002 in this case study we investigate particularly the degree to which model inputs affecting two groups of model output i e organic matter and nutrient removals 3 1 1 the most influential parameters for organic matter removal organic matter om content in wastewater can be measured via cod which includes slowly biodegradable particulate cod x s fermentable and readily biodegradable soluble cod s f fermentation products as acetate s a inert soluble s i and particulate x i cod and cod from bacterial biomass however not all of these components are of equal importance henze et al 2000 particularly cod fraction from microorganisms is mostly neglected due to wash out phenomena in treatment systems additionally the inert cod is not in our interest because of its marginal variation to identify the most influential model parameters for the first three cod fractions the sensitivity functions s i j for each of the three variables against the changes of model parameter θ j were calculated positive values of s i j indicate the proportional relationship between the model parameters and the concentration of state variable and vice versa as shown in fig 4 the most significant parameter influencing the om content is the coefficient of vertical turbulent diffusion k z which is responsible for around 60 40 and 20 of the total variance of x s s f and s a respectively interestingly while the increase of k z has a positive effect on the accumulation of xs meaning a negative impact on its removal higher k z leads to higher removal efficiency of s f and s a this result suggests that high vertical mixing leading to non stratified water column is detrimental to hydrolysis a conversion process of x s to sf conducted by heterotrophs x h and fermenting bacteria x fb indeed a similar oxygen level in water column can inhibit the growth of anaerobic bacteria at bottom layers like x fb and anoxic heterotrophs x h no in this case while providing an insufficiently amount of oxygen for aerobic heterotrophs x h o at the surface layers the removal of x s via hydrolysis creating s f and then s a via the growth of x fb in the wastewater explain the abovementioned contradictory effects of the k z noticeably the maximum growth rate of heterotrophs μ h is responsible for 20 of the total variance of s f and s a this parameter is highly dependent on temperature as the optimal growth rate of x h in wsps was reported at 35 c being similar to the recommended value for nitrifying bacteria mayo and noike 1996 indeed temperature appears to be a crucial factor for the efficiency of om removal with high contribution of temperature coefficient θ tw in all graphs 3 1 2 the most influential parameters for nutrient removal nutrient content in municipal wastewater mainly includes two fractions of nitrogen n and phosphorus p particularly the total n concentration contains particulate and soluble kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and nitrate and nitrite nitrogen s no henze et al 2000 particulate kjeldahl nitrogen as the sum of n bound to all organic particulate fractions x i x s x h x pao and x a is not investigated due to its marginal values compared to the value of soluble kjeldahl nitrogen which is dominated by ammonium nitrogen s nh for the same reason particulate phosphorus is not in the interest of this research as such the most influential model parameters for nutrient removal represented by the variance of s nh s no and s po4 are shown in fig 5 regarding the first state variable it appears that microbial assimilation and ammonia volatilization are two main processes of s nh removal in fps the first process is demonstrated via the role of the metabolisms of algae autotrophic x a and methanogenic microorganisms x am and x hm specifically the decay b alg and respiratory rates b a l g r e s of algae are responsible for above 20 of the total ammonium removal which is equal to the total contribution of the bacterial metabolisms on ammonium uptake more importantly ph contributes to more than 20 of the total variance of s nh demonstrating ammonia volatilization as one of the most important processes for ammonium removal in fact ammonia volatilization can account for 75 98 of total n removal with ph range from 7 to 9 pano and middlebrooks 1982 pearson et al 1996 reed 1985 these results indicated both advantages and disadvantages of the unique characteristic of high altitude climate in this case on the one hand strong solar radiation boosted the algae photosynthesis leading to more nitrogen algal uptake and high value of ph which can increase the volatilization rate on the other hand the abundance of algae can release the ammonium back to the water column during their decay process which is indicated via the positive correlation between the algal decay rate and s nh concentration due to the limited concentration of s no from the influent of the fp1 its main input is from nitrification process by autotrophic bacteria as such the metabolism of this microorganism represented as maximum growth rate μ a yield coefficient y a and phosphorous half saturation coefficient k a p in the radar chart contributes above 50 of the total variance of s no the absence of parameters related to heterotrophic bacteria indicates the insignificant role of denitrification process in the removal of s no which can be explained by the aerobic conditions in the pond on the other hand the k z is responsible for around 15 suggesting the stratification in water column is crucial for the presence of autotrophs as they require oxygen generated from algal photosynthesis the following parameters were found to have a significant impact on the p removal listed in the decreasing order of importance fraction of phosphorus in s f i psf yield coefficient of fermenting bacteria y fb decay rate of algae b alg and fraction of p in bacteria i psb this list suggests the negligible role of chemical precipitation process in p removal in ucubamba wsp systems in fact the possibility of its occurrence is constrained by marginal concentration of cations al3 and fe3 around only 4 mg l 1 while the sufficient amount is suggested larger than 50 100 mg l 1 diaz et al 1994 as a result the main process of p removal is the uptake by microorganisms which however has a marginal effect on the p removal leading to its similar concentration in the effluent 3 1 3 the most important parameters for model output after calculating s i j further step of sa is proceeded with the computation of importance rankings δ m s q r of model parameters table 2 shows the δ m s q r of 30 parameters which have highest influence on the model output the ranking suggests that the physical parameters i e eddy vertical diffusivity k z water temperature t w and temperature coefficient θ tw initiate the most variability of the model output moreover the metabolisms of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria indicated via maximum specific growth and yield coefficient μ a y a y h also appear as highly influential parameters in fact autotrophs prove their significance by being responsible for 50 of the total variance of sno and μh is one of the most influential factors on om removal more importantly high δ m s q r of algal related parameters ph μ alg k z b a l g r e s f p1 b alg reflect high sensitivity of the model output towards the efficiency of the photosynthetic process indeed the aeration of fps depends heavily on algal activity where more than 80 of dissolved oxygen is generated in wsp system shilton 2005 this is certainly the case in this high altitude wsp where strong solar radiation up to 1500 w m 2 during the peak of light intensity can promote the overgrowth of algae generating extremely high oxygen level up to 39 mg o2 l 1 ho et al 2018 this prevailing of aerobic condition reduce the influence of anaerobic processes on the performance of the pond system which reflects in low δ m s q r of anaerobic related parameters y fb y hm k h y am b hm 3 2 identifiability analysis to avoid an inevitable problem of poor identifiability of the complex models the compensability of model parameters is evaluated via collinearity index γ and determinant measure ρ fig 6 illustrates an overview of possible values of the two measures for all the possible subsets of the 30 parameters listed in table 2 i e 2 65e 32 combinations in contrast to the dramatic drop of ρ the graph demonstrates the significant increase of the maximum values of γ with the increasing size of the parameter subsets interestingly the highest γ value of the subset of two parameters already increases to 28 01 suggesting that a set of two parameters can have a serious problem associated with parameter correlation as the threshold value is 10 omlin et al 2001a this wide range of γ also ascertains the necessity of ia in model evaluation to obtain the uniqueness of parameter estimates and to avoid the poor convergence in nonlinear parameter estimation vanrolleghem et al 1995 especially noteworthy is that when the size of subset is above 8 the value range of ρ diminishes considerably which can make the differentiation of the results among different subsets difficult to avoid assessing the collinearity of all combinations the parameters were divided into five different functional subsets based on the mechanisms of the fp the reason of this division is that the parameters in a same functional subset have higher chance to represent a similar property of the system hence these parameters are more likely to have high correlation by identifying them and then removing them from the final combination the simultaneous estimation of this combination is more likely to be successful as such five functional subsets are defined i e physical anaerobic aerobic and anoxic algal and pao related processes to investigate their correlations via γ and ρ see table 3 the details of the parameters belonging to the five subsets can be found in the supplementary material s7 the first group evidences high correlation between water temperature t w and temperature coefficient θ tw as adding θ tw into the subset increases the γ by 12 on the other hand the parameters related to anaerobic process and algal activity shows relatively low correlations while three anaerobic parameters y fb y hm k h describing different anaerobic processes explain their weak interdependence low correlations among algal related parameters are surprising outcomes theoretically there is a strong relation between the algal activity and ph since co2 consumption via algal photosynthesis causes the increase of ph during the day while its respiration generates co2 causing the drop of ph and o2 level during the night or light limited conditions since the model excludes the chemical equilibria between co2 and hco3 between hco3 and co3 2 between h2o and h and oh due to its current complexity this carbonate bicarbonate buffering system in fps is not able to be included regarding aerobic and anoxic process the maximum growth rate μ a and yield coefficient y a of autotrophs have a high correlation above 6 while the connection between autotroph and heterotroph related parameters is insignificant after identifying the set of parameters having strong interdependency all possible combinations of the parameters from the five functional group excluding these sets were calculated however since the obtained lowest γ of the combinations with more than 13 parameters was already 13 42 implying the identifiability problem the γ and ρ are calculated to the possible combinations of size 12 and 13 these combinations can include four physical parameters three anaerobic parameters five algal related parameters five parameters link to autotrophs and heterotrophs and three pao related parameters in contrast to similar values of ρ γ changes considerably among different combined subsets from 8 to 29 suggesting its potential of being a more relevant criterion in assessing the identifiability of the model parameters as such after assessing both indices of the combinations the subset in bold in table 3 is selected based on its lowest value of γ and relatively high value of ρ compared to other subsets the highest values of γ are observed in the subsets containing two parameters i e μ alg and light extinction coefficient k z suggesting the identifiability problem from the parameterization of light dependence of algal growth which is line with the conclusions of omlin et al 2001a on a natural lake system in fact the intrinsic correlation between algal biomass and light extinction coefficient has been studied and modelled using a non linear approximation in photobioreactors fernandez et al 1997 ogbonna et al 1995 privoznik et al 1978 yun and park 2001 this suggests that there is a need for further investigation with more available data that can indicate the spatiotemporal variability of algal biomass in the wsps from that a non linear equation between this parameter and k z could be added to improve the model structure hence its identifiability 3 3 model calibration after the establishment of the subset of 12 selected parameters an automatic calibration was performed on the basis of the measurements until the convergence in simplex mode is achieved in aquasim reichert 1994 the original and calibrated results are represented in table 4 the first conclusion can be drawn is that except for y a stoichiometric parameters maintain comparable values after the calibration inferring their less influential role on the model output compared to the kinetic parameters conversely the maximum growth of algae μ alg increase considerably by 49 1 indicating more intensive algal activity in this pond in fact ucubamba wsp locating at 2400 m a s l receives immense light intensity hence accelerating the photosynthesis rate and the growth of algae ho et al 2018 higher calibrated ph of 9 09 can also indicate this unique characteristic of high altitude pond where volatilization process was one of the main nitrogen removal processes within the pond however note that since the carbonate bicarbonate buffering system in the fp1 was not included in the model the drop of ph during the night was not able to be simulated this might lead to the overestimation of the rate of volatilization process during the night two physical parameters k z and t w experience a dramatic increase after the calibration as the field data were collected during the day t w would be higher than the daily average 18 6 c while extreme high altitude climates i e strong solar radiation great temperature variation and strong wind can be a reason for the higher calibrated value of k z compared to the ordinary range of vertical eddy diffusivity in shallow and eutrophic lakes from 10 7 to 10 4 m2 s 1 macintyre 1993 the calibration presented a relatively high value of k z 4 86 10 5 m2 s 1 since k z characterizes the intensity of vertical mixing in the fp1 its high value indicates the homogenous conditions of the water column in the fp1 due to abundant aerobic condition and strong mixing the aerobic prevailing condition in ucubamba pond system during the daylight is also implied via a substantial drop in value of hydrolysis rate k h by almost 50 furthermore the reduction of nitrification reflecting by the decrease of μ a and y a by 17 8 and 49 1 respectively supports the findings of craggs et al 2000 who concluded that the lack of biofilm attachment surfaces is a major constraint for its efficiency in wsps as such the most influential parameters for the n removal are mainly related to microbial assimilation and ammonia volatilization table 5 shows better predictive performance of the calibrated model in estimating the removal efficiencies of the fp via relatively lower values of two error measurements i e wss and mean absolute percentage error mape by using these two error measurements the model goodness of fit with respect to mean amplitude and phase can be accessed in fact except for bod the model predicts relatively precisely the removal of om and nutrients its inaccuracy in predicting bod concentration can be due to the fact that the biogeochemical submodel is built on cod balance the changes in the value of parameters related to algal photosynthesis and physical processes appear to reduce considerably the error measures of the model i e 42 2 and 54 7 of wss of bod and tn 3 4 uncertainty analysis fig 7 shows the uncertainty range of model predictions i e om and nutrient removals in comparison with the observed data collected during the second half of 2013 it is important to recognize the substantial contribution of the selected parameters on the output uncertainty ranges since apart from the case of n removal the light grey bands are much wider than the dark grey bands this suggests that the consideration of model calibration can reduce greatly the model uncertainty and the selected parameters appear to be key inputs influencing the model output however these relatively small uncertainty ranges with no contribution of the selected parameters are not able to encompass the large variations of measured data this high variabilities of the effluent concentrations of fp1 can be associated with the large variations of climatic conditions which are very influential factors on the performance of high altitude pond systems ho et al 2018 on the other hand a wide dark grey range in the prediction of n removal infers that there is are other parameter s besides the selected parameters which can largely contribute to the model uncertainty also noteworthy is the extensive light grey uncertainty ranges which indicate this intrinsic property of large model predictions especially in the case of ecological systems such as ponds lakes and rivers omlin et al 2001a reichert and vanrolleghem 2001 regarding the model predictive performance besides the inaccuracy in predicting bod via its high overestimation the model shows relatively accurate predictions for cod and nutrient removal with minor underestimations these underestimations can be caused by the seasonal difference in sampling period of the data used in the calibration and validation processes particularly the measurements used for calibration were collected during the first half of 2013 which was a rainy season while the validated data were measured during the dry season as such the dilution factor from heavy rains may cause the underestimations of model predictions in dry season more importantly the patterns of collinearity among model parameters such as temperature and its coefficients or algae growth rate and light attenuation are likely to change in different environmental conditions additionally the difference regarding the characterization of the influent between two seasons might also another reason of the inaccuracy of the model from this perspective a well designed sampling strategy using online sensor technology that is able to cover representative geographic and environmental conditions such as night time data or different seasonal data is needed for the model extrapolation to longer time period and to other pond treatment systems 4 conclusions we develop an all encompassing mechanistic model simulating not only biogeochemical processes of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal but also the hydraulic and physical processes of a facultative pond in combination with a systematic investigation for model calibration and validation despite the high variability of the measurements the model shows a good agreement between the predictions and observed data indicating via the low values of two error measurements i e wss and mape the first application of a practical sensitivity analysis sheds light on the most influential parameters on the pond performance particularly together with the maximum growth rate of heterotrophs physical parameters such as eddy vertical diffusivity water temperature and temperature coefficient initiate the most variability of organic matter nitrogen removal is mainly done by microbial assimilation and ammonium volatilization in contrast to insignificant role of denitrification process due to the abundant aerobic condition in the high altitude pond as a result of intensive algae photosynthetic activity phosphorus removal by phosphorus accumulating organisms and chemical precipitation appears to be trivial leading to low removal efficiency two indexes are applied for identifiability analysis i e collinearity index γ used by brun et al 2001 and determinant measure ρ proposed by weijers and vanrolleghem 1997 based on their values of all possible parameter subsets the former appears to be a more relevant indicator for assessing the parameter identifiability while the latter emerges as an excellent tool for determining the most influential parameter subsets a deeper understanding of parameter identifiability problems can be obtained thanks to the practical identifiability analysis particularly two main problems are identified the first problem comes from the collinearity of maximum growth rate of algae and light attenuation coefficient indicating the strong influence of algal biomass on the light penetration in the pond system to reduce the problem of this collinearity better understanding about the mechanisms of this effect should be added to improve the model structure hence its identifiability secondly like the pond performance the patterns of collinearity among model parameters are likely to change in different environmental conditions such as temperature and its coefficients in this case causing serious errors in model extrapolation as such a well designed sampling strategy using online sensor technology that is able to cover representative geographic and environmental conditions such as night time data or different seasonal data is needed for the model extrapolation to more extensive time period and to other pond treatment systems model calibration reveals the distinctive characteristics of this high altitude pond where more intensive algal activity because of strong solar radiation generating aerobic prevailing condition consequently this leads to low hydrolysis rate low importance ranking of anaerobic related parameters and the absence of anoxic heterotrophic bacteria which are responsible for denitrification process higher values of eddy vertical diffusivity and water temperature are obtained reflecting the impact of high altitude climates i e great variation of temperature and strong wind an uncertainty analysis suggests that a large avoidable uncertainty as a result of vast complexity of the applied model can be reduced greatly via a systematic procedure for parameter estimation however one should keep in mind the fluctuation of the model parameters when extrapolating the model output especially in this case where seasonal variation and the characterization of the influent appear to be influential factors declarations of interest none acknowledgement this research was performed in the context of the vlir ecuador biodiversity network

19059,imitating natural lakes pond treatment systems inherit a high complexity with interconnected web of biochemical reactions and complex hydraulic processes as such its simulation requires a large and integrated model which has been a challenge for pond engineers in this study we develop an all encompassing model to gain a quantitative and comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic physicochemical and microbiological conversion processes in the most common pond a facultative pond moreover to deal with an evitable issue of large mechanistic models as overparameterization leading to poor identifiability a systematic parameter estimation was implemented the application of sensitivity analysis reveals the most influential parameters on pond performance particularly physical parameters such as vertical eddy diffusivity water temperature and maximum growth rate of heterotrophs induce the most changes of organic matters while microbial assimilation and ammonia volatilization appear to be main processes for nutrient removal in contrast the efficiency of phosphate precipitation and nutrient biological removal via polyphosphate accumulating organisms and denitrifying bacteria is limited identifiability problems are addressed mainly by the characterization of light dependence of algal growth interaction between water temperature and its coefficient and the growth of autotrophic bacteria while based on the determinant measures the most important parameter subsets affecting model outputs are related to physical processes and algal activity after the establishment of the influential and identifiable parameter subset an automatic calibration with the data collected from ucubamba pond system ecuador demonstrates the effect of high altitude climatic conditions on pond behaviors an aerobic prevailing condition is observed as a result of high light intensity causing accelerated algal activities hence leading to the limitation of hydrolysis anaerobic processes and the growth of anoxic heterotrophs for denitrification furthermore the output of uncertainty analysis indicates that a large avoidable uncertainty as a result of vast complexity of the applied model can be reduced greatly via a systematic approach for parameter estimation graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste stabilization pond integrated mechanistic model sensitivity analysis identifiability analysis parameter estimation uncertainty analysis 1 introduction waste stabilization ponds wsps are large shallow lagoons surrounded by earth embankments where wastewater is purified by completely natural processes taking advantage of algal photosynthetic oxygenation wsps are a major choice for wastewater treatment plants wwtps in many countries e g the us 8000 installations france 2500 installations and germany 3000 installations epa 2011 despite being categorized as simple and basic operational system processes inside the pond systems are complicated facultative ponds fps which are normally used as primary or secondary treatment in pond series display a high complexity because of a synergy between microalgae and bacteria this mutualistic relationship is one of the main reasons for the variation of vertical oxygen profile creating simultaneous occurrence of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones inside fps to simulate this interconnected web of biochemical processes and reactions an integrated modeling approach is required however has been a challenge for pond engineers sah et al 2011 there are two main goals of applying models in environmental sciences in general firstly models are a powerful tool to describe and analyze the behavior of the systems second models can be used to forecast the responses of the systems under varying conditions each of these two goals addresses different pathways of modeling techniques for descriptive models the task is to construct a simple model with good estimates of model parameters which can simulate measured output with reasonable accuracy omlin and reichert 1999 a more complex model which is unable to increase considerably its goodness of fit or gain a better understanding of the system is normally considered a wasteful expense according to the parsimony principle of spriet 1985 on the other hand if the goal of the model is to have a reliable prediction and reasonable approximation of model uncertainty simple model structure may result in poor predictive performance and significant underestimation of uncertainty estimates reichert and omlin 1997 from this perspective an integrated mechanistic model is a more suitable candidate in fact during the last two decades there has been a shift from data driven models to mechanistic models due to the great interest in seeking better cost effective designs process optimization and pond upgrades ho et al 2017 besides pond engineers also desire to extrapolate their models to other systems under different driving conditions which is impossible without simulating the causal mechanisms of the systems brun et al 2001 however pond engineers are currently facing two fundamental problems in simulating this complex system first there is no standard model which includes hydrodynamics physicochemical as well as microbial conversion processes sah et al 2012 more importantly these large and complex models are almost always overparameterized leading to a problem of poor identifiability as the number of available data for parameter estimation is of significantly lower order than model complexity omlin and reichert 1999 identifiability problem relating to the application of large mechanistic models has long been studied and widely reported by the scientific community of wwtps brun et al 2002 van veldhuizen et al 1999 weijers and vanrolleghem 1997 however it is striking that the number of research paper dealing with this issue in wsps remains extremely low ho et al 2017 in fact to the author s knowledge there have been only three mechanistic models in pond modeling i e kayombo et al 2000 dochain et al 2003 beran and kargi 2005 that conducted model calibration but without the consideration of the identifiability problem in this study we develop an all encompassing mathematical model which simulates not only biogeochemical processes of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal but also the hydraulic and physical processes of a fp the most common ponds in wsp systems we explicitly consider the interplay between biogeochemical and hydraulic submodels in the mass balance of multiple variables the main purpose is to gain a quantitative and comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic physicochemical and microbiological conversion processes in the fp this leads to the fact that many relevant processes which are not yet included in the previous models colomer and rico 1993 gehring et al 2010 sah et al 2011 such as phosphorus removal processes by phosphorus accumulating organisms pao or precipitation ammonia volatilization sedimentation and resuspension are included in the model subsequently to deal with the inevitable problem of overparameterization in this large mechanistic model a systematic procedure of parameter estimation was conducted firstly sensitivity sa and identifiability analyses ia are implemented via a practical technique proposed by brun et al 2002 where two criteria of model parameters are addressed first the model output needs to be sufficiently sensitive to the changes of the parameters second these changes may not be compensated by the changes of other parameters as a result a subset of influential and identifiable parameters is revealed which subsequently is calibrated by fitting the model to the data collected in ucubamba wsp cuenca ecuador in 2013 finally monte carlo simulation a nonlinear error propagation with latin hypercube sampling technique is applied for uncertainty analysis 2 methods 2 1 study site and data collection the wsp is located at ucubamba at altitude of 2400 m a s l the largest wwtp in ecuador is operated by etapa to treat the domestic effluent of around 400 000 inhabitants in cuenca the dry season is between june and december and the rainy season is between january and may with temperatures between 7 and 20 c and 12 25 c respectively this pond system is divided into two identical flow lines containing an aerated pond ap a facultative pond fp and a maturation pond mp fig 1 more detailed information of ucubamba wsp system can be found in ho et al 2018 the data used for model calibration and validation were measured at the inlet and outlet of fp1 during 2013 following the cross validation of snee 1977 to avoid overfitting problem of the model the data of the first half of 2013 were used for calibration while the predictive performance of calibrated model were compared to the rest of the data the area of the fp1 is 13 ha with the depth of 2 m respectively leading to the theoretical hydraulic retention time hrt of five days the inlet outlet of this pond consists of a submerged pipe of 0 9 m diameter lying at the bottom of the 1 8 m deep pond and an overflow structure is a sharp weir of 10 m long alvarado et al 2012 the samples were collected during the daytime by grab sampling method three times per 2 weeks at the input and output of the fp1 and then were analyzed in the laboratory following the american public health association methods apha 2005 the variables were measured including for bod5 mg o2 l 1 cod mg o2 l 1 ammonium mg nh4 n l 1 nitrite mg no2 n l 1 nitrate mg no3 n l 1 tkn mg n l 1 tp mg p l 1 ph chlorophyll a total solid ts mg l 1 volatile suspended solid vss mg l 1 water temperature oc and dissolved oxygen do mg o2 l 1 additionally meteorological data including air temperature c solar radiation w m 2 and wind speed m s 1 were obtained from the meteorological station of celec hidropaute located at around 600 m from the wsp 2 2 model description and implementation 2 2 1 system boundaries a vertical 1 d model of the fp1 in ucubamba wsp was developed by the integration of hydraulic and biogeochemical submodels within the lake module of the software aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 the software is designed to simultaneously simulate physical and biogeochemical processes in natural and mechanical aquatic systems since the pond area is relative small compared to natural lakes the assumption of homogenous horizontal gradients for the 1 d approach is satisfied goudsmit et al 2002 as such wind driven horizontal flow is assumed to be negligible hence wind effect is simulated only as the shear stress on water surface moreover the bottom sediment layer is simulated in a sediment submodel with an assumption of its homogeneity meaning that no diffusive exchanges among neighboring sediment layers can occur regarding biogeochemical submodel the growth of algae is divided into two subprocesses with different nitrogen sources nh4 preferred or no3 furthermore the temporal variation of algal photosynthesis and respiration activity as a result of the day night cycle are included in the model by setting the fluctuation of irradiance as a function of time even though light attenuation k z is a function of algae biomass suspended and dissolved solids which can fluctuate within the pond system for practical purposes it is assumed to consider k z values as constant heaven et al 2005 the role of cyanobacteria and algal consumers is assumed to be negligible hence being neglected to avoid complexity only chemical equilibrium between nh4 and nh3 is taken into account the integration of the hydraulic and biogeochemical submodels consists of a set of different differential equations which are integrated numerically by dassl algorithm follows newton rapson s methods where the derivative is approximated via backward differentiation formula with boundary conditions can be found in software aquasim 2 1 reichert 1994 the initial and influent conditions of the model variables are supplied in supplementary material s1 the 1 d model was implemented with the time resolution of 30 min the vertical resolution of 20 cm and the accuracy was set at 0 1 2 2 2 hydraulic processes a hydraulic submodel is built to simulate the hydrodynamic flow of the fp1 based on a combination of conventional advective diffusive model for the water column with one uniform sediment layer and buoyancy extended k epsilon turbulence model see fig 2 elliott et al 1999 goudsmit et al 2002 rodi and research 1984 ulrich et al 1995 more specifically dissolved and particulate substances are transported through the water column by vertical mixing and advection the movements of particulate substances are driven by sedimentation the bottom sediment layer is simulated in a sediment submodel with an assumption of its homogeneity the exchange of substances between water column and pore water of the sediment layer via resuspension and diffusion are taken into account the surface shear is applied to count the effect of wind stress driving the horizontal motion which is estimated by following the study of amorocho and devries 1980 in the water column the following differential equations are solved for each dissolved and particulate state variable 1 s i t a z a k z s i z a z q s i r s i q a s i n d a a d z d θ h s e d 2 s i s s i 2 x j t a z a k z x j z a z q x j r x j q a x i n z v s e d x j d a d z v r e s x s j where s i is the concentration of a dissolved substance i in the water column g m 3 x j is the concentration of a particulate compound j in the water column g m 3 t is the time d z is the vertical coordinate pointing downwards z 0 at the pond surface m a is the cross sectional area of the fp m2 k z is the vertical mixing coefficient m2 d 1 r s i and r x j are the biogeochemical transformation rates in the water column g m 3 d 1 q is the hydraulic flow rate m 3 d 1 s in and x in are the influent concentration of dissolved and particulate substances g m 3 h sed is the thickness of the sediment layer m v sed is the sedimentation velocity m d 1 q is the volumetric lateral water flow m2 d 1 d is the coefficient of molecular diffusion m2 d 1 θ is the porosity of the sediment layer s s i is the concentration of dissolved substance i in the sediment layer g m 3 x s j is the concentration of particulate substance j in the sediment layer g m 3 v res is the resuspension velocity of the sediment m d 1 in the right hand side of the above equations the first terms represent the vertical mixing because of eddy diffusion the second terms reflect the advective flow as a result of lateral influent especially noteworthy is that the third terms represent the net effect of biogeochemical transformation processes which shows how two submodels are integrated these transformation processes are described in more detail in the biogeochemical submodel the fourth terms are related to the pond influent the last term of eq 1 refers to the exchange of the dissolved substances between the water column and pore water of the sediment layer the last two terms of eq 2 represent the sedimentation and resuspension of particulate substances between the water column and pore water of the sediment layer lopes et al 2011 omlin et al 2001b these two equations are coupled with two following equations which represents the processes in the sediment layer 3 s s i t d a d z i e x s s i d a d z h s e d r s s i 4 x s j t d a d z i e x x s j d a d z h s e d r x s j in these two equations i e x s s i and i e x x s j are the flux of the dissolved substance i and particulate substance j into the sediment layer g d 1 and r s s i and r x s j are the biogeochemical transformation rates in the sediment layer g m 3 d 1 the first term of eq 3 describes the changes in mass of the dissolved substances in the sediment layer due to diffusive exchange with the neighboring sediment layers if there are more than one sediment layer the first term of eq 4 refers the advection of the particles caused by sedimentation the last term in both equations represents the transformation processes of the substances through the sediment layer 2 2 3 biogeochemical processes a biogeochemical submodel describes the transformations of dissolved and particulate substances inside the fp1 which are specified via 30 kinetic rate equations these mathematical equations represent aerobic anoxic and anaerobic reactions carried out by the metabolisms and interactions of algae and bacteria in the fp see fig 3 the details of stoichiometric matrix kinetic rate expressions and their values are shown in supplementary materials s2s4 the formulation of the biogeochemical transformation rates can be found in the supplementary material s5 particularly the aerobic and anoxic processes are built following the activated sludge model 2d henze et al 2000 the anaerobic processes are simplified from the constructed wetland model no 1 langergraber et al 2009 and the algal metabolism is based on the river water quality model 1 reichert et al 2001 the arrhenius equation is included in all reaction rates to describe the temperature dependence the interactions between all involved microbial groups are summarized in table 1 in the model gas exchange at the pond surface includes two processes i e oxygen reaeration and ammonia volatilization the oxygen reaeration rate was a flux proportional to pond depth the difference between saturation concentration and the available oxygen level and interfacial transfer coefficient morenograu et al 1996 concerning ammonia volatilization in the chemical equilibrium between nh4 and nh3 the concentration of nh3 is dependent on ph temperature and total ammonia concentration emerson et al 1975 an equilibrium based mass transfer equation in valero and mara 2007 is applied to calculate the theoretical ammonia volatilization rate precipitation and redissolution of phosphate po4 3 are accounted given the assumption that precipitation and redissolution are reverse processes henze et al 2000 additionally light attenuation is included to describe the exponential decrease of light intensity with depth by beer s law 2 3 parameter estimation 2 3 1 local sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa evaluates the degree to which model inputs affect model output from that the universality and robustness of these parameters can be further investigated the following technique of sa was proposed in brun et al 2001 firstly the model is defined as being described above subsequently the prior uncertainty of model parameters and inputs θ j is estimated based on the literature scale factors of state variables which are used to make the results for the various model endpoints comparable are calculated based on their mean concentration in the system brun et al 2002 after prior analysis steps gaussian error propagation of the uncertainty ranges is applied to compute the sensitivity function for each state variable y i against the changes of model parameter θ j as follows 5 s i j δ θ j s c i y i θ j where i 1 n representing the model output variables j 1 137 representing the model parameters δθ j represents the uncertainty ranges which were estimated following brun et al 2001 omlin et al 2001a and benedetti et al 2012 sc i is the scale factor of the state variable y i the values of δθ j and sc i are listed in supplementary material s6 the importance ranking of parameters was then determined based on the sensitivity measure δ j m s q r in eq 6 6 δ j m s q r 1 n i 1 n s i j 2 a high δ j m s q r means that the value of parameter θ j has an important influence on simulation results while a sensitivity measure of zero indicates no effects on model output 2 3 2 identifiability analysis after the calculation of the important ranking 30 parameters with the highest values suggesting that they are the most influential parameters on the model output was chosen for identifiability analysis two different measures collinearity index γ and determinant measure ρ were calculated for every parameter subset k of these 30 parameters to assess their identifiability the collinearity index represents the compensability of the parameter subset k which can be calculated as shown in eq 7 7 γ k 1 m i n β 1 s 1 β 1 s k β k 1 m i n β 1 s β 1 m i n e v s k t s k where s k being an n k submatrix of the normalized matrix s k s i j with normalized value of the sensitivity function s i k s i k s i k n is the total number of model output variables k 1 30 β β 1 β k t is a vector of coefficient of the length k with the constraint β 1 e v is the eigenvalue of s k t s k γ k quantifies the degree of approximate linear dependence of the sensitivity functions of the parameters a value of γ over 10 indicates a poor identifiability of parameter subset mieleitner and reichert 2008 the second criterion determinant measure ρ is defined as shown in eq 8 8 ρ k d e t s k t s k 1 2 k determinant measure ρ is proposed by weijers and vanrolleghem 1997 which combines the information provided by δ j m s q r and γ in which a high value of ρ indicates a low value of γ and a high value of δ j m s q r hence good conditional identifiability of parameter subset brun et al 2002 2 3 3 model calibration after sa and ia a subset of identifiable and influential parameters is chosen for calibration with the data collected for the first six months of 2013 generally to objectify calibration process a function representing the agreement between model and data is defined to demonstrate the desire to fit the model to the data dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 in this case the weighted sum of squares wss of the residuals is minimized from which selected parameters are calibrated using the simplex algorithm reichert 1994 to calculate the wss each residual is divided by a scale factor sc i of the corresponding variable y i from that the residuals become non dimensional as sc i and the model output have a same dimension mieleitner and reichert 2008 9 w s s θ j i 1 n y m e a s i y i θ j s c i 2 in this equation y m e a s i is the i th measurement y i θ j is the calculated value of the model output corresponding to the i th measurement and evaluated at the time and location of this measurement and n is the number of data points 2 4 uncertainty analysis like natural lakes wsp systems are inherently subject to large variations hence uncertainty analysis ua is considered an essential role during their modeling process ho et al 2017 since sa can help to recognize the uncertainty source from model inputs which allocates to the uncertainty of model output it is recommended that ua and sa should be implemented in tandem saltelli et al 2008 in this study ua is conducted in two cases in the first case all of the prior uncertainties listed in supplementary material s6 are included while the calibrated value of the identifiable parameters is fixed with no uncertainty in the second case these calculations allow assessing the contribution of these parameters to the uncertainty of model output monte carlo simulation is applied using the uncsim package reichert 2005 to propagate the model uncertainty into the predictions mckay et al 1979 500 sets of samples are generated using latin hypercube sampling lhs technique which provides a sufficient coverage of parameter space 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa is designed as a tool to identify the most influential model parameters for the variability of the state variables for the overparameterized models sa is considered very useful as model output are often strongly influenced by few key inputs saltelli 2002 in this case study we investigate particularly the degree to which model inputs affecting two groups of model output i e organic matter and nutrient removals 3 1 1 the most influential parameters for organic matter removal organic matter om content in wastewater can be measured via cod which includes slowly biodegradable particulate cod x s fermentable and readily biodegradable soluble cod s f fermentation products as acetate s a inert soluble s i and particulate x i cod and cod from bacterial biomass however not all of these components are of equal importance henze et al 2000 particularly cod fraction from microorganisms is mostly neglected due to wash out phenomena in treatment systems additionally the inert cod is not in our interest because of its marginal variation to identify the most influential model parameters for the first three cod fractions the sensitivity functions s i j for each of the three variables against the changes of model parameter θ j were calculated positive values of s i j indicate the proportional relationship between the model parameters and the concentration of state variable and vice versa as shown in fig 4 the most significant parameter influencing the om content is the coefficient of vertical turbulent diffusion k z which is responsible for around 60 40 and 20 of the total variance of x s s f and s a respectively interestingly while the increase of k z has a positive effect on the accumulation of xs meaning a negative impact on its removal higher k z leads to higher removal efficiency of s f and s a this result suggests that high vertical mixing leading to non stratified water column is detrimental to hydrolysis a conversion process of x s to sf conducted by heterotrophs x h and fermenting bacteria x fb indeed a similar oxygen level in water column can inhibit the growth of anaerobic bacteria at bottom layers like x fb and anoxic heterotrophs x h no in this case while providing an insufficiently amount of oxygen for aerobic heterotrophs x h o at the surface layers the removal of x s via hydrolysis creating s f and then s a via the growth of x fb in the wastewater explain the abovementioned contradictory effects of the k z noticeably the maximum growth rate of heterotrophs μ h is responsible for 20 of the total variance of s f and s a this parameter is highly dependent on temperature as the optimal growth rate of x h in wsps was reported at 35 c being similar to the recommended value for nitrifying bacteria mayo and noike 1996 indeed temperature appears to be a crucial factor for the efficiency of om removal with high contribution of temperature coefficient θ tw in all graphs 3 1 2 the most influential parameters for nutrient removal nutrient content in municipal wastewater mainly includes two fractions of nitrogen n and phosphorus p particularly the total n concentration contains particulate and soluble kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and nitrate and nitrite nitrogen s no henze et al 2000 particulate kjeldahl nitrogen as the sum of n bound to all organic particulate fractions x i x s x h x pao and x a is not investigated due to its marginal values compared to the value of soluble kjeldahl nitrogen which is dominated by ammonium nitrogen s nh for the same reason particulate phosphorus is not in the interest of this research as such the most influential model parameters for nutrient removal represented by the variance of s nh s no and s po4 are shown in fig 5 regarding the first state variable it appears that microbial assimilation and ammonia volatilization are two main processes of s nh removal in fps the first process is demonstrated via the role of the metabolisms of algae autotrophic x a and methanogenic microorganisms x am and x hm specifically the decay b alg and respiratory rates b a l g r e s of algae are responsible for above 20 of the total ammonium removal which is equal to the total contribution of the bacterial metabolisms on ammonium uptake more importantly ph contributes to more than 20 of the total variance of s nh demonstrating ammonia volatilization as one of the most important processes for ammonium removal in fact ammonia volatilization can account for 75 98 of total n removal with ph range from 7 to 9 pano and middlebrooks 1982 pearson et al 1996 reed 1985 these results indicated both advantages and disadvantages of the unique characteristic of high altitude climate in this case on the one hand strong solar radiation boosted the algae photosynthesis leading to more nitrogen algal uptake and high value of ph which can increase the volatilization rate on the other hand the abundance of algae can release the ammonium back to the water column during their decay process which is indicated via the positive correlation between the algal decay rate and s nh concentration due to the limited concentration of s no from the influent of the fp1 its main input is from nitrification process by autotrophic bacteria as such the metabolism of this microorganism represented as maximum growth rate μ a yield coefficient y a and phosphorous half saturation coefficient k a p in the radar chart contributes above 50 of the total variance of s no the absence of parameters related to heterotrophic bacteria indicates the insignificant role of denitrification process in the removal of s no which can be explained by the aerobic conditions in the pond on the other hand the k z is responsible for around 15 suggesting the stratification in water column is crucial for the presence of autotrophs as they require oxygen generated from algal photosynthesis the following parameters were found to have a significant impact on the p removal listed in the decreasing order of importance fraction of phosphorus in s f i psf yield coefficient of fermenting bacteria y fb decay rate of algae b alg and fraction of p in bacteria i psb this list suggests the negligible role of chemical precipitation process in p removal in ucubamba wsp systems in fact the possibility of its occurrence is constrained by marginal concentration of cations al3 and fe3 around only 4 mg l 1 while the sufficient amount is suggested larger than 50 100 mg l 1 diaz et al 1994 as a result the main process of p removal is the uptake by microorganisms which however has a marginal effect on the p removal leading to its similar concentration in the effluent 3 1 3 the most important parameters for model output after calculating s i j further step of sa is proceeded with the computation of importance rankings δ m s q r of model parameters table 2 shows the δ m s q r of 30 parameters which have highest influence on the model output the ranking suggests that the physical parameters i e eddy vertical diffusivity k z water temperature t w and temperature coefficient θ tw initiate the most variability of the model output moreover the metabolisms of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria indicated via maximum specific growth and yield coefficient μ a y a y h also appear as highly influential parameters in fact autotrophs prove their significance by being responsible for 50 of the total variance of sno and μh is one of the most influential factors on om removal more importantly high δ m s q r of algal related parameters ph μ alg k z b a l g r e s f p1 b alg reflect high sensitivity of the model output towards the efficiency of the photosynthetic process indeed the aeration of fps depends heavily on algal activity where more than 80 of dissolved oxygen is generated in wsp system shilton 2005 this is certainly the case in this high altitude wsp where strong solar radiation up to 1500 w m 2 during the peak of light intensity can promote the overgrowth of algae generating extremely high oxygen level up to 39 mg o2 l 1 ho et al 2018 this prevailing of aerobic condition reduce the influence of anaerobic processes on the performance of the pond system which reflects in low δ m s q r of anaerobic related parameters y fb y hm k h y am b hm 3 2 identifiability analysis to avoid an inevitable problem of poor identifiability of the complex models the compensability of model parameters is evaluated via collinearity index γ and determinant measure ρ fig 6 illustrates an overview of possible values of the two measures for all the possible subsets of the 30 parameters listed in table 2 i e 2 65e 32 combinations in contrast to the dramatic drop of ρ the graph demonstrates the significant increase of the maximum values of γ with the increasing size of the parameter subsets interestingly the highest γ value of the subset of two parameters already increases to 28 01 suggesting that a set of two parameters can have a serious problem associated with parameter correlation as the threshold value is 10 omlin et al 2001a this wide range of γ also ascertains the necessity of ia in model evaluation to obtain the uniqueness of parameter estimates and to avoid the poor convergence in nonlinear parameter estimation vanrolleghem et al 1995 especially noteworthy is that when the size of subset is above 8 the value range of ρ diminishes considerably which can make the differentiation of the results among different subsets difficult to avoid assessing the collinearity of all combinations the parameters were divided into five different functional subsets based on the mechanisms of the fp the reason of this division is that the parameters in a same functional subset have higher chance to represent a similar property of the system hence these parameters are more likely to have high correlation by identifying them and then removing them from the final combination the simultaneous estimation of this combination is more likely to be successful as such five functional subsets are defined i e physical anaerobic aerobic and anoxic algal and pao related processes to investigate their correlations via γ and ρ see table 3 the details of the parameters belonging to the five subsets can be found in the supplementary material s7 the first group evidences high correlation between water temperature t w and temperature coefficient θ tw as adding θ tw into the subset increases the γ by 12 on the other hand the parameters related to anaerobic process and algal activity shows relatively low correlations while three anaerobic parameters y fb y hm k h describing different anaerobic processes explain their weak interdependence low correlations among algal related parameters are surprising outcomes theoretically there is a strong relation between the algal activity and ph since co2 consumption via algal photosynthesis causes the increase of ph during the day while its respiration generates co2 causing the drop of ph and o2 level during the night or light limited conditions since the model excludes the chemical equilibria between co2 and hco3 between hco3 and co3 2 between h2o and h and oh due to its current complexity this carbonate bicarbonate buffering system in fps is not able to be included regarding aerobic and anoxic process the maximum growth rate μ a and yield coefficient y a of autotrophs have a high correlation above 6 while the connection between autotroph and heterotroph related parameters is insignificant after identifying the set of parameters having strong interdependency all possible combinations of the parameters from the five functional group excluding these sets were calculated however since the obtained lowest γ of the combinations with more than 13 parameters was already 13 42 implying the identifiability problem the γ and ρ are calculated to the possible combinations of size 12 and 13 these combinations can include four physical parameters three anaerobic parameters five algal related parameters five parameters link to autotrophs and heterotrophs and three pao related parameters in contrast to similar values of ρ γ changes considerably among different combined subsets from 8 to 29 suggesting its potential of being a more relevant criterion in assessing the identifiability of the model parameters as such after assessing both indices of the combinations the subset in bold in table 3 is selected based on its lowest value of γ and relatively high value of ρ compared to other subsets the highest values of γ are observed in the subsets containing two parameters i e μ alg and light extinction coefficient k z suggesting the identifiability problem from the parameterization of light dependence of algal growth which is line with the conclusions of omlin et al 2001a on a natural lake system in fact the intrinsic correlation between algal biomass and light extinction coefficient has been studied and modelled using a non linear approximation in photobioreactors fernandez et al 1997 ogbonna et al 1995 privoznik et al 1978 yun and park 2001 this suggests that there is a need for further investigation with more available data that can indicate the spatiotemporal variability of algal biomass in the wsps from that a non linear equation between this parameter and k z could be added to improve the model structure hence its identifiability 3 3 model calibration after the establishment of the subset of 12 selected parameters an automatic calibration was performed on the basis of the measurements until the convergence in simplex mode is achieved in aquasim reichert 1994 the original and calibrated results are represented in table 4 the first conclusion can be drawn is that except for y a stoichiometric parameters maintain comparable values after the calibration inferring their less influential role on the model output compared to the kinetic parameters conversely the maximum growth of algae μ alg increase considerably by 49 1 indicating more intensive algal activity in this pond in fact ucubamba wsp locating at 2400 m a s l receives immense light intensity hence accelerating the photosynthesis rate and the growth of algae ho et al 2018 higher calibrated ph of 9 09 can also indicate this unique characteristic of high altitude pond where volatilization process was one of the main nitrogen removal processes within the pond however note that since the carbonate bicarbonate buffering system in the fp1 was not included in the model the drop of ph during the night was not able to be simulated this might lead to the overestimation of the rate of volatilization process during the night two physical parameters k z and t w experience a dramatic increase after the calibration as the field data were collected during the day t w would be higher than the daily average 18 6 c while extreme high altitude climates i e strong solar radiation great temperature variation and strong wind can be a reason for the higher calibrated value of k z compared to the ordinary range of vertical eddy diffusivity in shallow and eutrophic lakes from 10 7 to 10 4 m2 s 1 macintyre 1993 the calibration presented a relatively high value of k z 4 86 10 5 m2 s 1 since k z characterizes the intensity of vertical mixing in the fp1 its high value indicates the homogenous conditions of the water column in the fp1 due to abundant aerobic condition and strong mixing the aerobic prevailing condition in ucubamba pond system during the daylight is also implied via a substantial drop in value of hydrolysis rate k h by almost 50 furthermore the reduction of nitrification reflecting by the decrease of μ a and y a by 17 8 and 49 1 respectively supports the findings of craggs et al 2000 who concluded that the lack of biofilm attachment surfaces is a major constraint for its efficiency in wsps as such the most influential parameters for the n removal are mainly related to microbial assimilation and ammonia volatilization table 5 shows better predictive performance of the calibrated model in estimating the removal efficiencies of the fp via relatively lower values of two error measurements i e wss and mean absolute percentage error mape by using these two error measurements the model goodness of fit with respect to mean amplitude and phase can be accessed in fact except for bod the model predicts relatively precisely the removal of om and nutrients its inaccuracy in predicting bod concentration can be due to the fact that the biogeochemical submodel is built on cod balance the changes in the value of parameters related to algal photosynthesis and physical processes appear to reduce considerably the error measures of the model i e 42 2 and 54 7 of wss of bod and tn 3 4 uncertainty analysis fig 7 shows the uncertainty range of model predictions i e om and nutrient removals in comparison with the observed data collected during the second half of 2013 it is important to recognize the substantial contribution of the selected parameters on the output uncertainty ranges since apart from the case of n removal the light grey bands are much wider than the dark grey bands this suggests that the consideration of model calibration can reduce greatly the model uncertainty and the selected parameters appear to be key inputs influencing the model output however these relatively small uncertainty ranges with no contribution of the selected parameters are not able to encompass the large variations of measured data this high variabilities of the effluent concentrations of fp1 can be associated with the large variations of climatic conditions which are very influential factors on the performance of high altitude pond systems ho et al 2018 on the other hand a wide dark grey range in the prediction of n removal infers that there is are other parameter s besides the selected parameters which can largely contribute to the model uncertainty also noteworthy is the extensive light grey uncertainty ranges which indicate this intrinsic property of large model predictions especially in the case of ecological systems such as ponds lakes and rivers omlin et al 2001a reichert and vanrolleghem 2001 regarding the model predictive performance besides the inaccuracy in predicting bod via its high overestimation the model shows relatively accurate predictions for cod and nutrient removal with minor underestimations these underestimations can be caused by the seasonal difference in sampling period of the data used in the calibration and validation processes particularly the measurements used for calibration were collected during the first half of 2013 which was a rainy season while the validated data were measured during the dry season as such the dilution factor from heavy rains may cause the underestimations of model predictions in dry season more importantly the patterns of collinearity among model parameters such as temperature and its coefficients or algae growth rate and light attenuation are likely to change in different environmental conditions additionally the difference regarding the characterization of the influent between two seasons might also another reason of the inaccuracy of the model from this perspective a well designed sampling strategy using online sensor technology that is able to cover representative geographic and environmental conditions such as night time data or different seasonal data is needed for the model extrapolation to longer time period and to other pond treatment systems 4 conclusions we develop an all encompassing mechanistic model simulating not only biogeochemical processes of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal but also the hydraulic and physical processes of a facultative pond in combination with a systematic investigation for model calibration and validation despite the high variability of the measurements the model shows a good agreement between the predictions and observed data indicating via the low values of two error measurements i e wss and mape the first application of a practical sensitivity analysis sheds light on the most influential parameters on the pond performance particularly together with the maximum growth rate of heterotrophs physical parameters such as eddy vertical diffusivity water temperature and temperature coefficient initiate the most variability of organic matter nitrogen removal is mainly done by microbial assimilation and ammonium volatilization in contrast to insignificant role of denitrification process due to the abundant aerobic condition in the high altitude pond as a result of intensive algae photosynthetic activity phosphorus removal by phosphorus accumulating organisms and chemical precipitation appears to be trivial leading to low removal efficiency two indexes are applied for identifiability analysis i e collinearity index γ used by brun et al 2001 and determinant measure ρ proposed by weijers and vanrolleghem 1997 based on their values of all possible parameter subsets the former appears to be a more relevant indicator for assessing the parameter identifiability while the latter emerges as an excellent tool for determining the most influential parameter subsets a deeper understanding of parameter identifiability problems can be obtained thanks to the practical identifiability analysis particularly two main problems are identified the first problem comes from the collinearity of maximum growth rate of algae and light attenuation coefficient indicating the strong influence of algal biomass on the light penetration in the pond system to reduce the problem of this collinearity better understanding about the mechanisms of this effect should be added to improve the model structure hence its identifiability secondly like the pond performance the patterns of collinearity among model parameters are likely to change in different environmental conditions such as temperature and its coefficients in this case causing serious errors in model extrapolation as such a well designed sampling strategy using online sensor technology that is able to cover representative geographic and environmental conditions such as night time data or different seasonal data is needed for the model extrapolation to more extensive time period and to other pond treatment systems model calibration reveals the distinctive characteristics of this high altitude pond where more intensive algal activity because of strong solar radiation generating aerobic prevailing condition consequently this leads to low hydrolysis rate low importance ranking of anaerobic related parameters and the absence of anoxic heterotrophic bacteria which are responsible for denitrification process higher values of eddy vertical diffusivity and water temperature are obtained reflecting the impact of high altitude climates i e great variation of temperature and strong wind an uncertainty analysis suggests that a large avoidable uncertainty as a result of vast complexity of the applied model can be reduced greatly via a systematic procedure for parameter estimation however one should keep in mind the fluctuation of the model parameters when extrapolating the model output especially in this case where seasonal variation and the characterization of the influent appear to be influential factors declarations of interest none acknowledgement this research was performed in the context of the vlir ecuador biodiversity network
