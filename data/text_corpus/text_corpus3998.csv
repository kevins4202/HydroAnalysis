19990,billions of people living in developing countries lack access to safe drinking water not to mention water for handwashing one of the most effective ways to contain the fast spreading novel coronavirus covid 19 the recent global spread of covid 19 has fostered diverse initiatives such as the safe hands challenge led by the world health organization individuals are encouraged to regularly wash their hands for 40 60 s under running water with soap this call for safe hands comes at a time when water insecurity and limited access to handwashing facilities in africa is heightened in this article chitungwiza city in zimbabwe is used as a case study to assess the implications of the safe hands challenge for poor municipalities in developing countries and characterize the challenges they face to do so interviews were conducted at water points boreholes used by residents during zimbabwe s covid 19 national lockdown the calculation of water requirements for proper hand hygiene determined the capacity for water stressed regions to effectively implement safe hands on average it was established that one person consumes an extra 4 5 l per day of water when they practice who safe hands in the context of covid 19 this increases domestic water demand in chitungwiza by 9 due to water scarcity people in chitungwiza were experiencing challenges with practicing safe hands with their dry taps woes they might not be able to meet the standards of this who challenge lack of soap also reduced the effectiveness of the safe hands challenge this paper proposes short and long term measures that would allow effective implementation of the safe hands by means of sustainable potable water supply these measures include extensive social awareness and temporary change of household water use behavior municipalities are recommended to establish public private partnerships ppps to create immediate and long term water investments structural and transformational reforms would enhance through flexible planning investments for both water infrastructure and governance this narrative has the potential to improve the urban water systems resiliency against future pandemics keywords covid 19 safe hands intermittent water supply world health organisation chitungwiza 1 introduction on march 22 2020 the world celebrated world water day with grief and anguish while undergoing the covid 19 pandemic the illness caused by sars cov 2 affecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands of people the preceding week on march 13 the world health organisation who introduced the safe hands challenge the safe hands encourages individuals across the globe to regularly wash their hands for 40 60 s with soap under running water to maintain hygiene 1 1 who save lives clean your hands in the context of covid 19 a handout with key guidelines on the importance of safe hands initiative and how it can be done found on https www who int docs default source coronaviruse who hh community campaign finalv3 pdf sfvrsn 5f3731ef 2 and limit the virus transmission the underlying rationale is clear washing hands regularly and thoroughly physically degrades and removes viral particles staddon et al 2020 therefore it lowers the likelihood of infection transmission while millions of people living in developing countries lack access to potable water this affect the implementation of handwashing activities despite at this stage handwashing being one of the most effective ways to contain the fast spreading coronavirus the increased potable water demand as a result of the safe hands initiative is adding to the challenges that the municipalities in developing countries already face water supply in these regions often suffers from diverse issues numerous and institutional bottlenecks inadequate financial resources rapid population growth ainuson 2010 zimmerman et al 2008 and poorly maintained and aging infrastructure britto et al 2019 larsen et al 2016 these problems prevent municipalities from providing reliable potable water to people thus increasing the vulnerability of millions to diseases and pandemics such as covid 19 this article will explore the implications of insufficient and unreliable water supplies on practicing safe hands to prevent covid 19 transmission for people in developing regions this article is also addressing competing water use arise between the increased potable water demand brought by covid 19 through regular hand washing and the existing water rationing that under resourced municipalities in developing countries implement to maintain sustainable water supply and management of water consumption short and long term measures are needed to improve water supply and access and create resilient water systems that mitigate the shocks of future disasters and pandemic diseases this is essential to protect millions of people that live in the informal and densely populated areas within cities as covid 19 continues to spread to developing countries without sustainable access to safe drinking water people in these regions remain highly vulnerable aboelnga et al 2020 there is a strong agreement that people in developing regions lack access to reliable water supply and hand washing facilities world health organisation 2020 globally 2 1 billion people lack access to clean and safe water they are using either an unimproved water source or an improved source that is contaminated with faecal matter world health organisation 2016 according to unicef and who 2019 as many as one in three of the world s people do not enjoy access to safe and reliable water services three billion people across the world do not have basic hand washing facilities soap and water in their home increasing water scarcity in urban areas is projected to intensify even more during the coming years almost 900 million people live in cities that are facing seasonal water shortages in which potable water supplies dip below 100 l day at least one month each year by 2050 these numbers are expected to grow to 1 billion and 3 1 billion people respectively britto et al 2019 nearly a third of humanity including over half of the 6 billion urban dwellers predicted by 2050 will face critical water shortages in their cities xylem 2013 in africa 400 million people lack access to clean water 2 2 https www afdb org en news and events coronavirus and climate change observing world water day 34912 african cities are also facing increasing water insecurity grasham et al 2019 the covid 19 pandemic exacerbates this situation in such circumstances planning and governance responses need to be both flexible and proactive in order to manage this shock and its associated effects rodina 2019 access to clean water including handwashing facilities is widely accepted as a cost effective way to reduce the disease burden in lower income countries jamison 2018 with evidence provided in literature household water insecurity may exacerbate the covid 19 pandemic especially in africa asia and latin america as many people do not have access to safe and secure potable water services staddon et al 2020 the problem is exacerbated by the continuous development of disordered informal network adding to the alarming state of current affairs about 238 million people in sub saharan africa ssa are living in informal settlements without basic services i e access to water to practice basic hygiene and social amenities 3 3 https unstats un org sdgs report 2019 goal 11 they can therefore hardly comply with the covid 19 transmission prevention measures this places millions of people at risk of the fast spreading covid 19 in ssa water provision in developing regions is mainly provided through municipalities these municipalities are often under resourced jacobsen et al 2013 and are exposed to severe water supply rationing urban water scarcity in developing countries is getting more real compelling and growing day by day britto et al 2019 the outbreak of covid 19 intensifies this situation as people are required to frequently do handwashing the frequent handwashing activities require household taps to always have running water the safe hands challenge encounters the existing water insecurity problems and its implementation faces hurdles this has the potential to reduce its effectiveness this study assesses the capacity to implement safe hands for cities like chitungwiza zimbabwe where residents have dry taps for almost 5 days every week 2 methods 2 1 study area chitungwiza zimbabwe is used as a case study to highlight the implications and successes of the safe hands challenge in under resourced and poorly managed municipalities in developing countries chitungwiza is the third largest and fastest growing city in zimbabwe with a population of over 386 000 people 4 4 a site shows the latest population census for cities across the globe we used the site statistics because the last census in zimbabwe was done in 2012 8 years ago next census is 2022 found on https populationstat com zimbabwe chitungwiza the local municipality is responsible for supplying potable water years of economic meltdown and under development in zimbabwe have resulted in municipalities failing to keep up with supplying reliably to its residents japan international cooperation agency 2013 chitungwiza is a classic example of a cities failing to provide reliable water service the municipality for the past decade has been implementing a strict water rationing program fig 1 2 2 water supply in chitungwiza potable water in chitungwiza is supplied through two sources a potable water distribution system and municipal boreholes the potable water system is supported by 79 municipal boreholes chitungwiza does not have its own potable water treatment plant rather it buys potable water from harare water therefore for chitungwiza to sustainably maintain its supply residents must pay for water services so that the municipality is able to buy water from city of harare domestic water supply in chitungwiza is divided into four zones a total of 26 suburbs are in the four zones 5 5 four zones are seke north and south zengeza and st mary s as adopted in the chitungwiza water department slb report of 2016 the water connections statistics in the four residential zones are given in table 1 chitungwiza municipality receives approximately 28 30 ml of water per day from harare water against a daily demand of approximately 45 ml gambe 2019 this has caused a water supply deficit leading to a strict water rationing in chitungwiza each zone only has access to water services for 36 48 h per week more than 40 of the residential suburbs in chitungwiza experience deficiencies in water supply lasting from 24 h to several days africa water facility 2009 the current supply volume from harare was reduced because chitungwiza municipality is owing harare water the water supply volume from harare water is based on the purchasing power of the chitungwiza municipality the current intermittent water supply situation facing chitungwiza together with covid 19 threatens people as they need a reliable and constant supply of water to safeguard public health immediate measures are required to address this intermittent water supply situation in chitungwiza to curb the spread of covid 19 along with long term sustainable solutions to build resilience to future pandemics 2 2 1 chitungwiza water distribution system the main water distribution pipeline that supplies water to chitungwiza comes from the prince edward water treatment plant it leaves the treatment plant at an elevation of 1467 m in order to get to chitungwiza at this elevation lower altitude areas of chitungwiza fig 2 zengeza and st mary s zones are fed directly using gravitational force this main distribution pipeline is 600 mm in diameter and it splits into two mains of 525 mm and 450 mm to the night storage reservoir nsr in the seke north zone fig 2 the nsr supplies the two seke zones seke north and south because they are located in higher elevated ground that requires pumping from the nsr to boost water pressure the initial nsr design storage capacity was 44 ml for three days due to population growth and city expansion the nsr is now unable to supply water for at least two days to these two zones this current situation has caused irregularities in water supply across the four zones the problem is exacerbated by a lack of meaningful infrastructure development in the water system for the past three decades 2 3 safe hands challenge who made a call for policy makers to provide the necessary infrastructure for effectively implementing the safe hands challenge in private and public places this news has been unfortunately received with contempt in towns and cities in developing countries as most lack access to basic water services box 1 details the who safe hands procedure that is relevant for this paper in a video statement the who director general said there are several practical measures you can take to protect yourself from the new coronavirus one of the most important is regular safe and effective hand hygiene using soap and water here are the steps recommended by who the procedure in box 1 is possible when individuals have access to adequate water services using the procedure in box 1 we determined how many litres people can use per day when they practice safe hands in the context of covid 19 many health agencies are recommending washing hands for a minimum of 20 s up to 8 10 times per day staddon et al 2020 box 2 highlights the key message on when people should wash their hands as recommended by unicef and who during the covid 19 pandemic using box 2 we assumed that a person would practice safe hands three times a day during the covid 19 pandemic in the context of developing regions where water access is very limited 2 4 implications for daily water demand we calculated the key aspects below of water supply service provision related to daily water consumption using recommended benchmarks and standards of best practices and the who 2010 guidelines a daily water consumption during the 40 60 s of handwashing the key assumption is that one person will practice safe hands with running water on average three times a day to keep maintain good hygiene b daily increase of water consumption the increasing water use per person per day and the implications of this new demand to the existing chitungwiza water supply difficulties were determined c shift in water management practices while the municipality does not provide sufficient amount of water before and during the covid 19 pandemic new water use practices and management were recommended to the municipalities and water users in the context of safe hands challenge using who 2010 guidelines for the minimum amount of water sufficient per person per day 50 l were allocated per person per day box 3 highlights the summary of the results on hypothetical old and new demand for chitungwiza in its simplistic form despite high non revenue water in chitungwiza like in many cities in developing countries rouse 2014 the research did not address water losses through leakages the water demand increase referred to is specifically related to water discharge at household taps standpipes 2 5 interviews to assess the implications of the lack of water access for residents to practice safe hands challenge in chitungwiza in depth interviews were conducted at selected municipal public boreholes water points four boreholes were visited in the four residential zones of chitungwiza participants interviewed were local people collecting water as their household taps were dry https www youtube com watch v yznwewfhzi0 twelve in depth interviews three from each water point were conducted the interviews were conducted on the 6th day of zimbabwe s national covid 19 lockdown and 26 days after who initiated the safe hands challenge interviews were conducted by bustop tv a local private media entity it is important to note that the authors utilised the interviews as secondary users the interviewers solicit the views of the residents on the current water supply situation and the threats posed by water shortages for spreading of covid 19 in chitungwiza the views expressed during these interviews were used to examine how best to address the intermittent water supply challenge in chitungwiza in regard to the current covid 19 pandemic and future outbreaks the argument was also based on the knowledge of the authors on the current water supply challenges in chitungwiza video showing interviews found on this link https www youtube com watch v yznwewfhzi0 3 results and discussion 3 1 water demand and consumption as a result of who safe hands challenge the study established that the implementation of safe hands increases water consumption by 4 5 l per person per day see box 3 the results assume that one person practice safe hands on average three times a day for 40 60 s this is a 9 increase in the current domestic water consumption for chitungwiza our results agree with staddon et al 2020 the authors found that if hands are washed in running water in the context of covid 19 the average hand basin tap uses 2 3 l per minute which implies a total water requirement of 8 10 l of clean water per person per day if one practices safe hands for 8 10 times as well as appropriate soap and drying facilities box 3 summaries the findings for the calculated the new demand and the amount of water required for safe hands if practiced for 40 60 s 3 2 water supply situation in chitungwiza insights from water point interviews like the rest of the world the government of zimbabwe goz declared 21 days of national lockdown to encourage the public to maintain social distancing the aim of staying at home was to limit the spread of covid 19 despite the declaration interviews revealed that due to the unavailability of water in chitungwiza people were gathering at municipal boreholes in long queues of more than 100 people fig 3 as you can see we are over 100 here no social distancing we all want to collect water and go back home so we squeeze each other to get water interviewee in zengeza zone the results confirm staddon et al 2020 reiterations that in many settlements in low and middle income countries insufficient water supply points lead to queuing for water and therefore present an extra challenge for social distancing and thus too for preventing the spread of infectious diseases many of the people queueing at boreholes were women and children thus increasing their vulnerability to covid 19 residents could not afford to stay home as they need to constantly fetch water for daily use and for practicing safe hands the necessity of travelling to fetch water from water points makes it very hard to practice social distancing or self isolation in chitungwiza interviews further showed that residents in chitungwiza understood the importance of lockdown and social distancing measures but conditions such as the unavailability of potable water restrained their compliance as they need water to frequently practice hand and surface washing lockdown is good but the unavailability of municipal water forces us to go out to the boreholes to collect water yes we have understood why we should stay home maintaining social distance but if the municipality could give us water twice a week we can fill our containers at home and less people can congest at boreholes during this covid 19 lockdown old woman at zengeza water point the frequency of going to water points boreholes was intensified by residents lack of water storage facilities this forced them to collect water daily thus increasing their risk of contracting covid 19 we come here daily no council water at our houses our containers are few we are afraid of covid 19 but with this water situation we have no option we have to come here to collect water daily woman at st marys water point intermittent water supply is becoming more severe in chitungwiza the interviewees expressed that since the start of lockdown their suburbs never had access to potable water lack of personal protective equipment such as masks was also an issue at all the boreholes visited people had no masks despite gathering in large numbers fig 4 we heard that in unit j they had water access for a few hours last sunday but here in unit k we have no water for 12 weeks we come here with kids as you can see i am with my child she was breast feeding at the borehole we do social distancing at home not here we have no masks we only heard about them or see them on tvs but none of us here is wearing a mask as you can see woman at seke south water point in addition to continuous dry taps other factors such as limited number of boreholes and lack of maintenance also further exposes residents to the risk of contracting covid 19 this has led to the overutilization of many boreholes causing them to be difficult to operate this forced many people to touch the force rod these people were not sanitizing wash their hands with soap the hand pump is too heavy one person cannot operate it we come here in groups to assist each other to pull the hand pump so usually 3 or 4 people help each other on the force rod we touch the force rod without sanitizing this increases our chances of contracting covid 19 but we have no option we have to collect water young women at seke north borehole developed countries having more resources to tackle the disease highly relied on their water supply system to fight covid 19 for example china and other developed countries have been spraying the streets and public areas using chemicals dissolved in water 6 6 https www businessinsider com wuhan coronavirus china dispatches bleach trucks to spray down cities 2020 2 while in developing countries like ethiopia where authorities disinfection of public place led to a disaster of water supply outage 7 7 https www ethiopiaobserver com 2020 05 31 the pandemic is laying bare a global water crisis thus revealing that apart from being used for maintaining personal household hygiene including handwashing water is the main ingredient in tackling the spread of covid 19 pandemic in many ways residents of chitungwiza face much a greater threat from water shortages than those in many other countries where lockdown was imposed in the event of the pandemic taking its toll in zimbabwe chitungwiza will likely experience extreme casualties due to the lack of access to potable water to manage covid 19 lockdowns and water consumption in chitungwiza some chitungwiza residents have reduced their daily water use as covid 19 lockdown has reduced access to the water points others were fearing that constant fetching of water increases their chances of contracting covid 19 at boreholes we have reduced the amount of water we use per day to two 20 l buckets we fear that coming here frequently increases our risk us of contracting covid 19 women at zengeza water the unavailability of water in chitungwiza was not only affecting the who safe hands challenge implementation but it was also affecting residents in different ways residents failed to comply to the recommended hygiene practice i e wiping down contaminated surfaces the lack of water increased the exposure of women and children gathering in long queues at boreholes this affected the effectiveness of the stay at home measures that were implemented by government staddon et al 2020 argued that women and girls as the main domestic water labour in the global south will be more vulnerable to viral infection and intercommunal conflict they predicted that the current pandemic exacerbates the existing inequalities and vulnerabilities within and between communities the results in chitungwiza confirm this as more women and children were engaged in water collection activities during the lockdown fig 4 shows children collecting water at a borehole during the lockdown improving access to water will not act as a standalone solution to curb the spreading of covid 19 in developing countries greater availability and accessibility of other essentials such as soap and sanitizers will also be needed to ensure the success of who s safe hands challenge in towns and cities in developing countries interviewees had no sanitisers or soap we don t have sanitisers at home shops are running out of sanitizers old woman at zengeza water point not only that we need water we don t have soap at home things are expensive in shops woman at st mary s water point these water points are overseen by local management committees an interview with one of the management committee members of a water point in st mary s zone mangoromera explained that the management committee for that water point had set rules aiming to maintain social distancing during covid 19 to ensure safety of people fetching water however there was a lack of enforcement of these rules these local management committees also do not have the financial resources to ensure that essentials like soaps and sanitizers are available at water points so that people can wash their hands and disinfect touch points as you can see we have a notice here that we erected since the announcement by the president about covid 19 the notice is showing rules that our people should observe during this pandemic mangoromera water point committee member in st mary s zone 4 what are the possible solutions to water challenges in chitungwiza this article submits possible solutions to manage the tension between stopping the spread of covid 19 and the need to manage water demand and consumption by chitungwiza municipality and other municipalities in developing countries to allow a sustainable supply of potable water during covid 19 to date it s unclear when covid 19 is going to be contained implying that the who safe hands could be practiced for an indefinite period the article proposes short and long term measures that both municipalities and residents can implement short term measures are immediate decisions that municipalities and residents can implement to ensure that there is continuous access to water they aim to limit water use from the residents side and increase water supply from the municipalities side by strengthening their capacities residents in chitungwiza can limit activities that consume water such as watering their gardens in order to prioritise health promoting activities including the regularly washing hands changes of behaviour regarding water use reduce the daily water use sorensen 2017 and allocate the available water for washing hands and surfaces prioritization of water use at the household level has been used in several cases during periods of droughts with positive results research in cape town sorensen 2017 has shown that residents are capable of making unprecedented behavioral and attitudinal shifts and technological innovation simpson et al 2019b to better manage water during stringent household water supply increasing residents social awareness of household level water management practices such as the opening and closing of taps when rinsing hands can significantly reduce consumption during this pandemic time and beyond there are numerous examples demonstrating the impact of social awareness campaigns in reducing water consumption when cape town south africa experienced a 3 year drought a substantial media campaign was launched to inform residents about the severity of the drought and to urge relentless water conservation booysen et al 2019 in response residents reduced water usage from 540 to 280 l per household per day between january 2015 and january 2018 booysen et al 2019 together with higher water tariffs this communication campaign was credited for playing an important role in shifting water consumption patterns and related attitudes booysen et al 2019 this demonstrates the significant role social awareness plays in the reduction of water usage chitungwiza and other under resourced municipalities can implement these measures during the covid 19 pandemic to allow a more constant supply in addition to the above this article presents other key measures that households within urban areas of africa can implement table 2 summarises these measures however the household roles above cannot replace the responsibility of municipalities to ensure reliable water supply services to the people haddout et al 2020 also emphasised the importance of municipalities in developing countries to provide running water for the effectiveness of regular handwashing to stop covid 19 transmission the above household measures are rudimentary they work as complementary measures to the municipality providing running water to households 24 7 the municipalities ability to provide such continuous services can be strengthened in several ways one way is through the central governments urgently exhausting various financial schemes such as grants to fund water supply projects this gives assurance of running water on household taps in this critical time and for the safe hands challenge to yield positive results in cities of low income countries this underlines the importance of budgetary flexibility robust financial buffers and insurance mechanisms for cities in developing countries the current water supply situation in chitungwiza reflects how lack of inter and intra governmental coordination within and between central and local governments across sectors can exacerbate inefficiencies and delay response this concurs with nyikadzino and nhema 2015 findings that chitungwiza s poor water supply services are attributed to the lack of coordination between the council and the central government immediate government intervention is required to address water issues in chitungwiza to protect thousands from the covid 19 private sector elsewhere has been a key stakeholder in the provision of water supply mostly in developed regions and the global west dahiya and gentry 2020 fu and guo 2020 purbo et al 2019 ruiters and matji 2016 on securing a sustainable water supply service chitungwiza can sign concessions with the private sector forming public private partnerships ppps these concessions are crucial to encourage huge investments needed to expand and improve water infrastructure supply and related services these long term planning investments in water like elsewhere in developed regions improves water services efficacy arezki 2020 ruiters and matji 2016 dahiya and gentry 2020 purbo et al 2019 qian et al 2019 further research is required on how these mechanisms can work in the context of chitungwiza the global call for safe hands has exposed how weak the water governance is in developing regions long term measures to address the lack of access to potable water by many urban settlements require structural reforms of municipalities and other relevant institutions in many developing countries institutions responsible for water service provision are still trying to solve new problems with old solutions simpson et al 2019a experience in such circumstances shows little improvements compared to the investments committed dasgupta 2019 water utilities and municipalities in developing regions are still heavily investing in linear systems big pipes in and big pipes out transfer models aboelnga et al 2020 tjandraatmadja 2019 the soft path approach that focuses on strengthening integrated urban water supply governance has been inadequately addressed in many countries institutions continue to work in silos policies are set without aligning objectives with the required resources and are counting on public funds that are insufficient and poorly targeted aboelnga et al 2020 the new sources of finance for water supply in urban areas in developing countries is constrained by regulatory institutional and other barriers new approaches to address the water governance in developing countries are required to demonstrate the importance of flexible budgetary planning for water management during critical times such as the covid 19 pandemic we assessed the interventions done by the department of water and sanitation in south africa box 4 to compare with the situation in zimbabwe financial mechanisms are required to finance the long term investments needed in developing regions to improve water access investments however should not just prioritise infrastructure development because experience has shown that infrastructure investments alone do not give the much needed change in the water sector investments in governance systems planning and implementation are also vital transformational and structural reforms of these municipalities is vital to address the water problems in developing regions policies that allow sustainable water resources development and their implementation are also vital in regions lacking water access haddout et al 2020 in order to effectively change the status quo decision makers and municipalities require conceptual and operational shifts in ways of doing things simpson et al 2019b including but not limited to inter governmental cooperation and management rodina 2019 financial planning that anticipates disruptive shocks to municipal budgets simpson et al 2019c alternative supplies development olivier and xu 2019 and enhanced crisis communication booysen et al 2019 water points boreholes have emerged as new sources of water in response to chronic intermittent water supplies in chitungwiza however their existence is insufficient as demonstrated during interviews where more than 300 people were gathering at one borehole this increases their chances of contracting and spreading covid 19 defeating the purpose of the remedial stay at home orders that were implemented worldwide and in zimbabwe to limit public gatherings one solution could include constructing more boreholes to improve water access in the suburbs of chitungwiza as to limit the number of people gathering at and using one borehole effective management of the existing boreholes is also important as some of the boreholes in the study area are not working the outbreak of covid 19 should be a wakeup call to developing countries on the changes needed to achieve sustainable development goal sdg 6 future pandemics may continue to disrupt the achievement of the sdgs specifically around water for all this should serve as an opportunity for governments and local authorities to foster cooperation and bilateral agreements that improve water access with the establishment of ambitious sdg 6 in 2015 governments set the bar higher than ever before for improving water access shifting from basic to safely managed systems and well as calling for universal access to these essential services aboelnga et al 2020 safely managed systems are critical during period of uncertainty associated with climatic and health related hazards such as droughts and covid 19 however achieving safely managed systems would remain a far fetched idea in developing countries as huge political and financial commitments are required fig 5 shows the global investments required to meet sdg 6 by 2030 compared with the annual spending recorded for achievement of the millennium development goals mdgs 2000 15 fig 5 shows a wide gap between previous mdg spending and what is needed to achieve sdg 6 to ensure safely managed water systems for all most of these countries with people lacking water access are in developing regions that lack the financial mechanisms to invest in water systems conditions such as covid 19 present further unforeseen challenges that slow the progress on water investments this is because governments and municipalities shift their focus to firefighting emergency approaches regardless of the fact that long term reliable water access is the key weapon in this and future fights for developing countries that lack investments and financial mechanisms to meet the targets laid out by sdg 6 fig 5 strategic planning is required events such as covid 19 should be utilised as opportunities to improve cooperation and bring the world s attention to one goal improved water access for all the outbreak of covid 19 has revealed that a single event can prompt previously unseen human and economic losses at a large scale aboelnga et al 2020 and how conditions such as the lack of water may accelerate these losses a new paradigm is needed that turns on its head the current approach to water development and the ways in which institutions and governments in developing regions manage and finance urban water security aboelnga et al 2020 far sighted and highly capacitated water planning and governance have been identified as important in addressing water supply challenges in africa and elsewhere muller 2018 6 conclusions and recommendations the covid 19 outbreak brings up the vital importance of improved water access in developing countries particularly in poor informal and high density urban areas this pandemic is a wake up call to the importance of achieving sdg 6 vulnerability to covid 19 for people in developing countries is increased by factors such as the lack of household water access and the unavailability of soap alcohol based hand rubs and disinfectants they are the main barriers to the implementation and efficacy of the who safe hands initiative in chitungwiza water scarcity does not only affect the safe hands initiative but also the effectiveness of national lockdowns in developing areas in chitungwiza women and children given their exposure when collecting water without adequate protection are at higher risk from covid 19 these public places often pull together crowds that have no access to sanitizers nor soap dry household taps only give one alternative to inhabitants of chitungwiza ignore social distancing measures to combat coronavirus so that they may access shared waterpoints to collect water for drinking and hygiene purposes the study further illustrates how the lack of reliable water supplies for cities in developing countries decreases people s resilience towards diseases and pandemics while residents in chitungwiza clearly understood the importance of regular handwashing the lack of access to water barred them from practicing the required hygienic activities the increase in water demand due to regular handwashing has compounded the effects in the under resourced municipalities the existing multiple stressors in these regions aggravate the situation as short term measures we recommend households take the lead in practicing domestic water management we recommend temporary changes to behaviours or the adoption of new water use regimes this can be reinforced through extensive social awareness campaigns directed to residents to conserve water such as encouraging and educating residents to practice measures such as opening and closing faucet taps when rinsing hands residents can also suspend water consuming activities such gardening to prioritise the available water for washing hands however the household role above cannot replace the responsibility of municipalities to ensure reliable water supply services to people these municipalities need capacitation central governments in developing countries should also consider immediate financial assistance to the under resourced municipalities through grants municipalities on can also partner with the private sector to form public private partnerships ppps to fund both immediate and long term water investments municipalities should implement structural and transformational reforms that enhance investments both around water infrastructure and governance to allow flexible planning this can cushion residents against future pandemic outbreaks funding the research did not receive any financial grant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we want to thank bustop tv for the interviews they conducted in chitungwiza on april 04 2020 day 6 of the 21 days covid 19 national lockdown in zimbabwe at selected residential boreholes the interviews gave deep insights of the water supply situation the public views on the need to regularly wash hands and the implications of the current supply challenges to the spreading of covid 19 in chitungwiza 
19990,billions of people living in developing countries lack access to safe drinking water not to mention water for handwashing one of the most effective ways to contain the fast spreading novel coronavirus covid 19 the recent global spread of covid 19 has fostered diverse initiatives such as the safe hands challenge led by the world health organization individuals are encouraged to regularly wash their hands for 40 60 s under running water with soap this call for safe hands comes at a time when water insecurity and limited access to handwashing facilities in africa is heightened in this article chitungwiza city in zimbabwe is used as a case study to assess the implications of the safe hands challenge for poor municipalities in developing countries and characterize the challenges they face to do so interviews were conducted at water points boreholes used by residents during zimbabwe s covid 19 national lockdown the calculation of water requirements for proper hand hygiene determined the capacity for water stressed regions to effectively implement safe hands on average it was established that one person consumes an extra 4 5 l per day of water when they practice who safe hands in the context of covid 19 this increases domestic water demand in chitungwiza by 9 due to water scarcity people in chitungwiza were experiencing challenges with practicing safe hands with their dry taps woes they might not be able to meet the standards of this who challenge lack of soap also reduced the effectiveness of the safe hands challenge this paper proposes short and long term measures that would allow effective implementation of the safe hands by means of sustainable potable water supply these measures include extensive social awareness and temporary change of household water use behavior municipalities are recommended to establish public private partnerships ppps to create immediate and long term water investments structural and transformational reforms would enhance through flexible planning investments for both water infrastructure and governance this narrative has the potential to improve the urban water systems resiliency against future pandemics keywords covid 19 safe hands intermittent water supply world health organisation chitungwiza 1 introduction on march 22 2020 the world celebrated world water day with grief and anguish while undergoing the covid 19 pandemic the illness caused by sars cov 2 affecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands of people the preceding week on march 13 the world health organisation who introduced the safe hands challenge the safe hands encourages individuals across the globe to regularly wash their hands for 40 60 s with soap under running water to maintain hygiene 1 1 who save lives clean your hands in the context of covid 19 a handout with key guidelines on the importance of safe hands initiative and how it can be done found on https www who int docs default source coronaviruse who hh community campaign finalv3 pdf sfvrsn 5f3731ef 2 and limit the virus transmission the underlying rationale is clear washing hands regularly and thoroughly physically degrades and removes viral particles staddon et al 2020 therefore it lowers the likelihood of infection transmission while millions of people living in developing countries lack access to potable water this affect the implementation of handwashing activities despite at this stage handwashing being one of the most effective ways to contain the fast spreading coronavirus the increased potable water demand as a result of the safe hands initiative is adding to the challenges that the municipalities in developing countries already face water supply in these regions often suffers from diverse issues numerous and institutional bottlenecks inadequate financial resources rapid population growth ainuson 2010 zimmerman et al 2008 and poorly maintained and aging infrastructure britto et al 2019 larsen et al 2016 these problems prevent municipalities from providing reliable potable water to people thus increasing the vulnerability of millions to diseases and pandemics such as covid 19 this article will explore the implications of insufficient and unreliable water supplies on practicing safe hands to prevent covid 19 transmission for people in developing regions this article is also addressing competing water use arise between the increased potable water demand brought by covid 19 through regular hand washing and the existing water rationing that under resourced municipalities in developing countries implement to maintain sustainable water supply and management of water consumption short and long term measures are needed to improve water supply and access and create resilient water systems that mitigate the shocks of future disasters and pandemic diseases this is essential to protect millions of people that live in the informal and densely populated areas within cities as covid 19 continues to spread to developing countries without sustainable access to safe drinking water people in these regions remain highly vulnerable aboelnga et al 2020 there is a strong agreement that people in developing regions lack access to reliable water supply and hand washing facilities world health organisation 2020 globally 2 1 billion people lack access to clean and safe water they are using either an unimproved water source or an improved source that is contaminated with faecal matter world health organisation 2016 according to unicef and who 2019 as many as one in three of the world s people do not enjoy access to safe and reliable water services three billion people across the world do not have basic hand washing facilities soap and water in their home increasing water scarcity in urban areas is projected to intensify even more during the coming years almost 900 million people live in cities that are facing seasonal water shortages in which potable water supplies dip below 100 l day at least one month each year by 2050 these numbers are expected to grow to 1 billion and 3 1 billion people respectively britto et al 2019 nearly a third of humanity including over half of the 6 billion urban dwellers predicted by 2050 will face critical water shortages in their cities xylem 2013 in africa 400 million people lack access to clean water 2 2 https www afdb org en news and events coronavirus and climate change observing world water day 34912 african cities are also facing increasing water insecurity grasham et al 2019 the covid 19 pandemic exacerbates this situation in such circumstances planning and governance responses need to be both flexible and proactive in order to manage this shock and its associated effects rodina 2019 access to clean water including handwashing facilities is widely accepted as a cost effective way to reduce the disease burden in lower income countries jamison 2018 with evidence provided in literature household water insecurity may exacerbate the covid 19 pandemic especially in africa asia and latin america as many people do not have access to safe and secure potable water services staddon et al 2020 the problem is exacerbated by the continuous development of disordered informal network adding to the alarming state of current affairs about 238 million people in sub saharan africa ssa are living in informal settlements without basic services i e access to water to practice basic hygiene and social amenities 3 3 https unstats un org sdgs report 2019 goal 11 they can therefore hardly comply with the covid 19 transmission prevention measures this places millions of people at risk of the fast spreading covid 19 in ssa water provision in developing regions is mainly provided through municipalities these municipalities are often under resourced jacobsen et al 2013 and are exposed to severe water supply rationing urban water scarcity in developing countries is getting more real compelling and growing day by day britto et al 2019 the outbreak of covid 19 intensifies this situation as people are required to frequently do handwashing the frequent handwashing activities require household taps to always have running water the safe hands challenge encounters the existing water insecurity problems and its implementation faces hurdles this has the potential to reduce its effectiveness this study assesses the capacity to implement safe hands for cities like chitungwiza zimbabwe where residents have dry taps for almost 5 days every week 2 methods 2 1 study area chitungwiza zimbabwe is used as a case study to highlight the implications and successes of the safe hands challenge in under resourced and poorly managed municipalities in developing countries chitungwiza is the third largest and fastest growing city in zimbabwe with a population of over 386 000 people 4 4 a site shows the latest population census for cities across the globe we used the site statistics because the last census in zimbabwe was done in 2012 8 years ago next census is 2022 found on https populationstat com zimbabwe chitungwiza the local municipality is responsible for supplying potable water years of economic meltdown and under development in zimbabwe have resulted in municipalities failing to keep up with supplying reliably to its residents japan international cooperation agency 2013 chitungwiza is a classic example of a cities failing to provide reliable water service the municipality for the past decade has been implementing a strict water rationing program fig 1 2 2 water supply in chitungwiza potable water in chitungwiza is supplied through two sources a potable water distribution system and municipal boreholes the potable water system is supported by 79 municipal boreholes chitungwiza does not have its own potable water treatment plant rather it buys potable water from harare water therefore for chitungwiza to sustainably maintain its supply residents must pay for water services so that the municipality is able to buy water from city of harare domestic water supply in chitungwiza is divided into four zones a total of 26 suburbs are in the four zones 5 5 four zones are seke north and south zengeza and st mary s as adopted in the chitungwiza water department slb report of 2016 the water connections statistics in the four residential zones are given in table 1 chitungwiza municipality receives approximately 28 30 ml of water per day from harare water against a daily demand of approximately 45 ml gambe 2019 this has caused a water supply deficit leading to a strict water rationing in chitungwiza each zone only has access to water services for 36 48 h per week more than 40 of the residential suburbs in chitungwiza experience deficiencies in water supply lasting from 24 h to several days africa water facility 2009 the current supply volume from harare was reduced because chitungwiza municipality is owing harare water the water supply volume from harare water is based on the purchasing power of the chitungwiza municipality the current intermittent water supply situation facing chitungwiza together with covid 19 threatens people as they need a reliable and constant supply of water to safeguard public health immediate measures are required to address this intermittent water supply situation in chitungwiza to curb the spread of covid 19 along with long term sustainable solutions to build resilience to future pandemics 2 2 1 chitungwiza water distribution system the main water distribution pipeline that supplies water to chitungwiza comes from the prince edward water treatment plant it leaves the treatment plant at an elevation of 1467 m in order to get to chitungwiza at this elevation lower altitude areas of chitungwiza fig 2 zengeza and st mary s zones are fed directly using gravitational force this main distribution pipeline is 600 mm in diameter and it splits into two mains of 525 mm and 450 mm to the night storage reservoir nsr in the seke north zone fig 2 the nsr supplies the two seke zones seke north and south because they are located in higher elevated ground that requires pumping from the nsr to boost water pressure the initial nsr design storage capacity was 44 ml for three days due to population growth and city expansion the nsr is now unable to supply water for at least two days to these two zones this current situation has caused irregularities in water supply across the four zones the problem is exacerbated by a lack of meaningful infrastructure development in the water system for the past three decades 2 3 safe hands challenge who made a call for policy makers to provide the necessary infrastructure for effectively implementing the safe hands challenge in private and public places this news has been unfortunately received with contempt in towns and cities in developing countries as most lack access to basic water services box 1 details the who safe hands procedure that is relevant for this paper in a video statement the who director general said there are several practical measures you can take to protect yourself from the new coronavirus one of the most important is regular safe and effective hand hygiene using soap and water here are the steps recommended by who the procedure in box 1 is possible when individuals have access to adequate water services using the procedure in box 1 we determined how many litres people can use per day when they practice safe hands in the context of covid 19 many health agencies are recommending washing hands for a minimum of 20 s up to 8 10 times per day staddon et al 2020 box 2 highlights the key message on when people should wash their hands as recommended by unicef and who during the covid 19 pandemic using box 2 we assumed that a person would practice safe hands three times a day during the covid 19 pandemic in the context of developing regions where water access is very limited 2 4 implications for daily water demand we calculated the key aspects below of water supply service provision related to daily water consumption using recommended benchmarks and standards of best practices and the who 2010 guidelines a daily water consumption during the 40 60 s of handwashing the key assumption is that one person will practice safe hands with running water on average three times a day to keep maintain good hygiene b daily increase of water consumption the increasing water use per person per day and the implications of this new demand to the existing chitungwiza water supply difficulties were determined c shift in water management practices while the municipality does not provide sufficient amount of water before and during the covid 19 pandemic new water use practices and management were recommended to the municipalities and water users in the context of safe hands challenge using who 2010 guidelines for the minimum amount of water sufficient per person per day 50 l were allocated per person per day box 3 highlights the summary of the results on hypothetical old and new demand for chitungwiza in its simplistic form despite high non revenue water in chitungwiza like in many cities in developing countries rouse 2014 the research did not address water losses through leakages the water demand increase referred to is specifically related to water discharge at household taps standpipes 2 5 interviews to assess the implications of the lack of water access for residents to practice safe hands challenge in chitungwiza in depth interviews were conducted at selected municipal public boreholes water points four boreholes were visited in the four residential zones of chitungwiza participants interviewed were local people collecting water as their household taps were dry https www youtube com watch v yznwewfhzi0 twelve in depth interviews three from each water point were conducted the interviews were conducted on the 6th day of zimbabwe s national covid 19 lockdown and 26 days after who initiated the safe hands challenge interviews were conducted by bustop tv a local private media entity it is important to note that the authors utilised the interviews as secondary users the interviewers solicit the views of the residents on the current water supply situation and the threats posed by water shortages for spreading of covid 19 in chitungwiza the views expressed during these interviews were used to examine how best to address the intermittent water supply challenge in chitungwiza in regard to the current covid 19 pandemic and future outbreaks the argument was also based on the knowledge of the authors on the current water supply challenges in chitungwiza video showing interviews found on this link https www youtube com watch v yznwewfhzi0 3 results and discussion 3 1 water demand and consumption as a result of who safe hands challenge the study established that the implementation of safe hands increases water consumption by 4 5 l per person per day see box 3 the results assume that one person practice safe hands on average three times a day for 40 60 s this is a 9 increase in the current domestic water consumption for chitungwiza our results agree with staddon et al 2020 the authors found that if hands are washed in running water in the context of covid 19 the average hand basin tap uses 2 3 l per minute which implies a total water requirement of 8 10 l of clean water per person per day if one practices safe hands for 8 10 times as well as appropriate soap and drying facilities box 3 summaries the findings for the calculated the new demand and the amount of water required for safe hands if practiced for 40 60 s 3 2 water supply situation in chitungwiza insights from water point interviews like the rest of the world the government of zimbabwe goz declared 21 days of national lockdown to encourage the public to maintain social distancing the aim of staying at home was to limit the spread of covid 19 despite the declaration interviews revealed that due to the unavailability of water in chitungwiza people were gathering at municipal boreholes in long queues of more than 100 people fig 3 as you can see we are over 100 here no social distancing we all want to collect water and go back home so we squeeze each other to get water interviewee in zengeza zone the results confirm staddon et al 2020 reiterations that in many settlements in low and middle income countries insufficient water supply points lead to queuing for water and therefore present an extra challenge for social distancing and thus too for preventing the spread of infectious diseases many of the people queueing at boreholes were women and children thus increasing their vulnerability to covid 19 residents could not afford to stay home as they need to constantly fetch water for daily use and for practicing safe hands the necessity of travelling to fetch water from water points makes it very hard to practice social distancing or self isolation in chitungwiza interviews further showed that residents in chitungwiza understood the importance of lockdown and social distancing measures but conditions such as the unavailability of potable water restrained their compliance as they need water to frequently practice hand and surface washing lockdown is good but the unavailability of municipal water forces us to go out to the boreholes to collect water yes we have understood why we should stay home maintaining social distance but if the municipality could give us water twice a week we can fill our containers at home and less people can congest at boreholes during this covid 19 lockdown old woman at zengeza water point the frequency of going to water points boreholes was intensified by residents lack of water storage facilities this forced them to collect water daily thus increasing their risk of contracting covid 19 we come here daily no council water at our houses our containers are few we are afraid of covid 19 but with this water situation we have no option we have to come here to collect water daily woman at st marys water point intermittent water supply is becoming more severe in chitungwiza the interviewees expressed that since the start of lockdown their suburbs never had access to potable water lack of personal protective equipment such as masks was also an issue at all the boreholes visited people had no masks despite gathering in large numbers fig 4 we heard that in unit j they had water access for a few hours last sunday but here in unit k we have no water for 12 weeks we come here with kids as you can see i am with my child she was breast feeding at the borehole we do social distancing at home not here we have no masks we only heard about them or see them on tvs but none of us here is wearing a mask as you can see woman at seke south water point in addition to continuous dry taps other factors such as limited number of boreholes and lack of maintenance also further exposes residents to the risk of contracting covid 19 this has led to the overutilization of many boreholes causing them to be difficult to operate this forced many people to touch the force rod these people were not sanitizing wash their hands with soap the hand pump is too heavy one person cannot operate it we come here in groups to assist each other to pull the hand pump so usually 3 or 4 people help each other on the force rod we touch the force rod without sanitizing this increases our chances of contracting covid 19 but we have no option we have to collect water young women at seke north borehole developed countries having more resources to tackle the disease highly relied on their water supply system to fight covid 19 for example china and other developed countries have been spraying the streets and public areas using chemicals dissolved in water 6 6 https www businessinsider com wuhan coronavirus china dispatches bleach trucks to spray down cities 2020 2 while in developing countries like ethiopia where authorities disinfection of public place led to a disaster of water supply outage 7 7 https www ethiopiaobserver com 2020 05 31 the pandemic is laying bare a global water crisis thus revealing that apart from being used for maintaining personal household hygiene including handwashing water is the main ingredient in tackling the spread of covid 19 pandemic in many ways residents of chitungwiza face much a greater threat from water shortages than those in many other countries where lockdown was imposed in the event of the pandemic taking its toll in zimbabwe chitungwiza will likely experience extreme casualties due to the lack of access to potable water to manage covid 19 lockdowns and water consumption in chitungwiza some chitungwiza residents have reduced their daily water use as covid 19 lockdown has reduced access to the water points others were fearing that constant fetching of water increases their chances of contracting covid 19 at boreholes we have reduced the amount of water we use per day to two 20 l buckets we fear that coming here frequently increases our risk us of contracting covid 19 women at zengeza water the unavailability of water in chitungwiza was not only affecting the who safe hands challenge implementation but it was also affecting residents in different ways residents failed to comply to the recommended hygiene practice i e wiping down contaminated surfaces the lack of water increased the exposure of women and children gathering in long queues at boreholes this affected the effectiveness of the stay at home measures that were implemented by government staddon et al 2020 argued that women and girls as the main domestic water labour in the global south will be more vulnerable to viral infection and intercommunal conflict they predicted that the current pandemic exacerbates the existing inequalities and vulnerabilities within and between communities the results in chitungwiza confirm this as more women and children were engaged in water collection activities during the lockdown fig 4 shows children collecting water at a borehole during the lockdown improving access to water will not act as a standalone solution to curb the spreading of covid 19 in developing countries greater availability and accessibility of other essentials such as soap and sanitizers will also be needed to ensure the success of who s safe hands challenge in towns and cities in developing countries interviewees had no sanitisers or soap we don t have sanitisers at home shops are running out of sanitizers old woman at zengeza water point not only that we need water we don t have soap at home things are expensive in shops woman at st mary s water point these water points are overseen by local management committees an interview with one of the management committee members of a water point in st mary s zone mangoromera explained that the management committee for that water point had set rules aiming to maintain social distancing during covid 19 to ensure safety of people fetching water however there was a lack of enforcement of these rules these local management committees also do not have the financial resources to ensure that essentials like soaps and sanitizers are available at water points so that people can wash their hands and disinfect touch points as you can see we have a notice here that we erected since the announcement by the president about covid 19 the notice is showing rules that our people should observe during this pandemic mangoromera water point committee member in st mary s zone 4 what are the possible solutions to water challenges in chitungwiza this article submits possible solutions to manage the tension between stopping the spread of covid 19 and the need to manage water demand and consumption by chitungwiza municipality and other municipalities in developing countries to allow a sustainable supply of potable water during covid 19 to date it s unclear when covid 19 is going to be contained implying that the who safe hands could be practiced for an indefinite period the article proposes short and long term measures that both municipalities and residents can implement short term measures are immediate decisions that municipalities and residents can implement to ensure that there is continuous access to water they aim to limit water use from the residents side and increase water supply from the municipalities side by strengthening their capacities residents in chitungwiza can limit activities that consume water such as watering their gardens in order to prioritise health promoting activities including the regularly washing hands changes of behaviour regarding water use reduce the daily water use sorensen 2017 and allocate the available water for washing hands and surfaces prioritization of water use at the household level has been used in several cases during periods of droughts with positive results research in cape town sorensen 2017 has shown that residents are capable of making unprecedented behavioral and attitudinal shifts and technological innovation simpson et al 2019b to better manage water during stringent household water supply increasing residents social awareness of household level water management practices such as the opening and closing of taps when rinsing hands can significantly reduce consumption during this pandemic time and beyond there are numerous examples demonstrating the impact of social awareness campaigns in reducing water consumption when cape town south africa experienced a 3 year drought a substantial media campaign was launched to inform residents about the severity of the drought and to urge relentless water conservation booysen et al 2019 in response residents reduced water usage from 540 to 280 l per household per day between january 2015 and january 2018 booysen et al 2019 together with higher water tariffs this communication campaign was credited for playing an important role in shifting water consumption patterns and related attitudes booysen et al 2019 this demonstrates the significant role social awareness plays in the reduction of water usage chitungwiza and other under resourced municipalities can implement these measures during the covid 19 pandemic to allow a more constant supply in addition to the above this article presents other key measures that households within urban areas of africa can implement table 2 summarises these measures however the household roles above cannot replace the responsibility of municipalities to ensure reliable water supply services to the people haddout et al 2020 also emphasised the importance of municipalities in developing countries to provide running water for the effectiveness of regular handwashing to stop covid 19 transmission the above household measures are rudimentary they work as complementary measures to the municipality providing running water to households 24 7 the municipalities ability to provide such continuous services can be strengthened in several ways one way is through the central governments urgently exhausting various financial schemes such as grants to fund water supply projects this gives assurance of running water on household taps in this critical time and for the safe hands challenge to yield positive results in cities of low income countries this underlines the importance of budgetary flexibility robust financial buffers and insurance mechanisms for cities in developing countries the current water supply situation in chitungwiza reflects how lack of inter and intra governmental coordination within and between central and local governments across sectors can exacerbate inefficiencies and delay response this concurs with nyikadzino and nhema 2015 findings that chitungwiza s poor water supply services are attributed to the lack of coordination between the council and the central government immediate government intervention is required to address water issues in chitungwiza to protect thousands from the covid 19 private sector elsewhere has been a key stakeholder in the provision of water supply mostly in developed regions and the global west dahiya and gentry 2020 fu and guo 2020 purbo et al 2019 ruiters and matji 2016 on securing a sustainable water supply service chitungwiza can sign concessions with the private sector forming public private partnerships ppps these concessions are crucial to encourage huge investments needed to expand and improve water infrastructure supply and related services these long term planning investments in water like elsewhere in developed regions improves water services efficacy arezki 2020 ruiters and matji 2016 dahiya and gentry 2020 purbo et al 2019 qian et al 2019 further research is required on how these mechanisms can work in the context of chitungwiza the global call for safe hands has exposed how weak the water governance is in developing regions long term measures to address the lack of access to potable water by many urban settlements require structural reforms of municipalities and other relevant institutions in many developing countries institutions responsible for water service provision are still trying to solve new problems with old solutions simpson et al 2019a experience in such circumstances shows little improvements compared to the investments committed dasgupta 2019 water utilities and municipalities in developing regions are still heavily investing in linear systems big pipes in and big pipes out transfer models aboelnga et al 2020 tjandraatmadja 2019 the soft path approach that focuses on strengthening integrated urban water supply governance has been inadequately addressed in many countries institutions continue to work in silos policies are set without aligning objectives with the required resources and are counting on public funds that are insufficient and poorly targeted aboelnga et al 2020 the new sources of finance for water supply in urban areas in developing countries is constrained by regulatory institutional and other barriers new approaches to address the water governance in developing countries are required to demonstrate the importance of flexible budgetary planning for water management during critical times such as the covid 19 pandemic we assessed the interventions done by the department of water and sanitation in south africa box 4 to compare with the situation in zimbabwe financial mechanisms are required to finance the long term investments needed in developing regions to improve water access investments however should not just prioritise infrastructure development because experience has shown that infrastructure investments alone do not give the much needed change in the water sector investments in governance systems planning and implementation are also vital transformational and structural reforms of these municipalities is vital to address the water problems in developing regions policies that allow sustainable water resources development and their implementation are also vital in regions lacking water access haddout et al 2020 in order to effectively change the status quo decision makers and municipalities require conceptual and operational shifts in ways of doing things simpson et al 2019b including but not limited to inter governmental cooperation and management rodina 2019 financial planning that anticipates disruptive shocks to municipal budgets simpson et al 2019c alternative supplies development olivier and xu 2019 and enhanced crisis communication booysen et al 2019 water points boreholes have emerged as new sources of water in response to chronic intermittent water supplies in chitungwiza however their existence is insufficient as demonstrated during interviews where more than 300 people were gathering at one borehole this increases their chances of contracting and spreading covid 19 defeating the purpose of the remedial stay at home orders that were implemented worldwide and in zimbabwe to limit public gatherings one solution could include constructing more boreholes to improve water access in the suburbs of chitungwiza as to limit the number of people gathering at and using one borehole effective management of the existing boreholes is also important as some of the boreholes in the study area are not working the outbreak of covid 19 should be a wakeup call to developing countries on the changes needed to achieve sustainable development goal sdg 6 future pandemics may continue to disrupt the achievement of the sdgs specifically around water for all this should serve as an opportunity for governments and local authorities to foster cooperation and bilateral agreements that improve water access with the establishment of ambitious sdg 6 in 2015 governments set the bar higher than ever before for improving water access shifting from basic to safely managed systems and well as calling for universal access to these essential services aboelnga et al 2020 safely managed systems are critical during period of uncertainty associated with climatic and health related hazards such as droughts and covid 19 however achieving safely managed systems would remain a far fetched idea in developing countries as huge political and financial commitments are required fig 5 shows the global investments required to meet sdg 6 by 2030 compared with the annual spending recorded for achievement of the millennium development goals mdgs 2000 15 fig 5 shows a wide gap between previous mdg spending and what is needed to achieve sdg 6 to ensure safely managed water systems for all most of these countries with people lacking water access are in developing regions that lack the financial mechanisms to invest in water systems conditions such as covid 19 present further unforeseen challenges that slow the progress on water investments this is because governments and municipalities shift their focus to firefighting emergency approaches regardless of the fact that long term reliable water access is the key weapon in this and future fights for developing countries that lack investments and financial mechanisms to meet the targets laid out by sdg 6 fig 5 strategic planning is required events such as covid 19 should be utilised as opportunities to improve cooperation and bring the world s attention to one goal improved water access for all the outbreak of covid 19 has revealed that a single event can prompt previously unseen human and economic losses at a large scale aboelnga et al 2020 and how conditions such as the lack of water may accelerate these losses a new paradigm is needed that turns on its head the current approach to water development and the ways in which institutions and governments in developing regions manage and finance urban water security aboelnga et al 2020 far sighted and highly capacitated water planning and governance have been identified as important in addressing water supply challenges in africa and elsewhere muller 2018 6 conclusions and recommendations the covid 19 outbreak brings up the vital importance of improved water access in developing countries particularly in poor informal and high density urban areas this pandemic is a wake up call to the importance of achieving sdg 6 vulnerability to covid 19 for people in developing countries is increased by factors such as the lack of household water access and the unavailability of soap alcohol based hand rubs and disinfectants they are the main barriers to the implementation and efficacy of the who safe hands initiative in chitungwiza water scarcity does not only affect the safe hands initiative but also the effectiveness of national lockdowns in developing areas in chitungwiza women and children given their exposure when collecting water without adequate protection are at higher risk from covid 19 these public places often pull together crowds that have no access to sanitizers nor soap dry household taps only give one alternative to inhabitants of chitungwiza ignore social distancing measures to combat coronavirus so that they may access shared waterpoints to collect water for drinking and hygiene purposes the study further illustrates how the lack of reliable water supplies for cities in developing countries decreases people s resilience towards diseases and pandemics while residents in chitungwiza clearly understood the importance of regular handwashing the lack of access to water barred them from practicing the required hygienic activities the increase in water demand due to regular handwashing has compounded the effects in the under resourced municipalities the existing multiple stressors in these regions aggravate the situation as short term measures we recommend households take the lead in practicing domestic water management we recommend temporary changes to behaviours or the adoption of new water use regimes this can be reinforced through extensive social awareness campaigns directed to residents to conserve water such as encouraging and educating residents to practice measures such as opening and closing faucet taps when rinsing hands residents can also suspend water consuming activities such gardening to prioritise the available water for washing hands however the household role above cannot replace the responsibility of municipalities to ensure reliable water supply services to people these municipalities need capacitation central governments in developing countries should also consider immediate financial assistance to the under resourced municipalities through grants municipalities on can also partner with the private sector to form public private partnerships ppps to fund both immediate and long term water investments municipalities should implement structural and transformational reforms that enhance investments both around water infrastructure and governance to allow flexible planning this can cushion residents against future pandemic outbreaks funding the research did not receive any financial grant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we want to thank bustop tv for the interviews they conducted in chitungwiza on april 04 2020 day 6 of the 21 days covid 19 national lockdown in zimbabwe at selected residential boreholes the interviews gave deep insights of the water supply situation the public views on the need to regularly wash hands and the implications of the current supply challenges to the spreading of covid 19 in chitungwiza 
19991,particulate substrate xb is the major organic substrate fraction in most municipal wastewaters however the impact of xb on aerobic granular sludge ags systems is not fully understood this study evaluated the physical retention of xb in ags sequencing batch reactor sbr during anaerobic plug flow and then aerobic fully mixed conditions the influence of different sludge types and operational variables on the extent and mechanisms of xb retention in ags sbr were evaluated xb mass balancing and magnetic resonance imaging mri were applied during the anaerobic plug flow feeding most xb was retained in the first few cm of the settled sludge bed within the interstitial voids where xb settled and accumulated ultimately resulting in the formation of a filter cake sedimentation and surface filtration were thus the dominant xb retention mechanisms during plug flow conditions indicating that contact and attachment of xb to the biomass was limited xb retention was variable and influenced by the xb influent concentration sludge bed composition and upflow feeding velocity vww xb retention increased with larger xb influent concentrations and lower vww which demonstrated the importance of sedimentation on xb retention during plug flow conditions hence large fractions of influent xb likely re suspended during aerobic fully mixed conditions where xb then preferentially and rapidly attached to the flocs during fully mixed conditions increasing floc fractions longer mixing times and larger xb concentrations increased xb retention elevated xb retention was observed after short mixing times 60 min when flocs were present and the contribution of flocs towards xb retention was even more pronounced for short mixing times 5 min overall our results suggest that flocs occupy an environmental niche that results from the availability of xb during aerobic fully mixed conditions of ags sbr therefore a complete wash out of flocs is not desirable in ags systems treating municipal wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge municipal wastewater particulate substrate plug flow feeding attachment flocs 1 introduction our understanding of the effect of particulate organic substrate xb on the formation operation and overall process performance of aerobic granular sludge ags remains limited despite many full scale installations derlon et al 2016 ali et al 2019 prior studies suggested that xb might have several different effects on the behaviour and performance of ags systems 1 floc formation and reduced settleability wagner et al 2015b derlon et al 2016 layer et al 2019 2 longer start up duration wagner et al 2015a layer et al 2019 3 reduced nutrient removal capability de kreuk et al 2010 jabari et al 2016 guimarães et al 2018 and 4 deterioration of effluent quality due to an increased effluent solids concentration rocktäschel et al 2015 van dijk et al 2018 however the link between these observations and the presence of xb in the influent wastewater ww is not well understood yet research on the overall impact and utilisation pathways of xb on ags systems is therefore necessary xb represents a major fraction of the organic substrate present in municipal ww typically 50 metcalf and eddy 2014 hydrolysis of xb is required prior to its utilisation which often is considered the rate limiting step in biological ww treatment morgenroth et al 2002 in ags systems an anaerobic feeding phase of 1 2 h duration most of the time as plug flow is typically applied pronk et al 2015b however such period of plug flow feeding is likely too short to allow for full hydrolysis of xb jabari et al 2016 wagner et al 2015b therefore it is suspected that some xb could leak into aerobic conditions in ags operation the presence of organic substrate in aerobic conditions favours the growth of finger type granules de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015a or can even result in process breakdown due to granule breakage sturm et al 2004 however finger type granules are rarely observed in ags systems treating municipal ww pronk et al 2015b derlon et al 2016 rather a noticeable growth of flocs is actually observed so that flocs represent a substantial fraction of 10 20 of the ags formed during treatment of municipal ww wagner et al 2015a derlon et al 2016 layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015b the presence of flocs in ags is now acknowledged in full scale installations van dijk et al 2018 despite their origin is not well understood ags is therefore step by step seen as hybrid system where biofilm granules and suspended biomass flocs coexist layer et al 2019 understanding the connection between influent xb and the presence and role of flocs is therefore required xb degradation is a three step process 1 physical contact to biomass physical xb retention 2 initiation of enzymatic hydrolysis after contact to biomass and 3 further utilisation of hydrolysis products as readily biodegradable substrate sb in anaerobic fermentation storage anoxic denitrification or aerobic direct oxidation storage processes the present study focuses specifically on physical retention of xb several aspects might hamper physical retention of xb in ags in comparison to conventional activated sludge systems 1 distinct hydraulic conditions during anaerobic plug flow feeding followed by aerobic fully mixed conditions in

plug flow feeding fig 1a and aerobic fully mixed conditions fig 1b plug flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor into the settled ags bed could limit attachment through restricted contact between influent xb and biomass if xb then re suspends during fully mixed conditions it is hypothesized that flocs would have a competitive advantage in capturing xb due to their much increased adsorption capacity andreadakis 1993 fig 1b understanding when i e during plug flow or fully mixed conditions and where i e by flocs or at the granules surface xb is retained therefore needs to be clarified in addition it should be clarified what external factors operational influent ww influence xb retention in ags sbr operation the main objective of this study was to better understand the fate of xb during ags sbr operation and ultimately to get insights about the presence and role of flocs in ags systems therefore the focus was on evaluating 1 to what extent xb is retained during anaerobic plug flow feeding and then during aerobic fully mixed conditions 2 to what extent is the retention of xb affected by operational variables upflow feeding velocity vww mixing time and influent composition on xb retention in ags sbr operation and ultimately 3 to provide insights about the presence and role of flocs in ags systems therefore several different retention tests under plug flow and fully mixed conditions were conducted different types of biomass or mimics of biomass ags fed with acetate propionate glass beads ags fed with municipal ww activated sludge flocs and the effect of different vww during plug flow feeding and mixing time during fully mixed conditions were tested real municipal ww particles were used as xb source and cod mass balances were conducted to quantify the extent of xb retention in the different experiments in addition magnetic resonance imaging mri was used to identify the mechanisms of xb retention during plug flow feeding 2 materials and methods 2 1

dübendorf switzerland was used as the source of xb during all tests anaerobic or anoxic redox conditions were kept during all tests in order to minimize degradation of xb 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1

some influent ww would exit the column through the effluent the procedure of the plug flow tests was as follows step 1 addition of sludge to the column to a targeted bed height of 13 cm fixed sludge bed height tests or variable from 0 5 to 20 cm variable sludge bed height tests after 20 min of settling a settling duration of 20 min was sufficient to ensure a complete settling of the sludge during

mixed tests fully mixed tests were conducted to analyse xb retention under fully mixed conditions representative of the aerobic phase of ags systems schematic fig 2b the approach was based on modin et al 2015 and jimenez et al 2005 the influence of sludge composition mixing time and influent xb concentration was evaluated table 1 the sludge was composed of different ratios of large granules 1 mm 0

evaluated all fully mixed tests were conducted for a defined sludge composition blank fully mixed tests were in addition conducted tap water instead of real ww to account for xb loss from biomass the procedure of the fully mixed tests was as follow step 1 addition of 300 ml of biomass to 1 l glass beakers with a target total suspended solids tss concentration of 4 gtss l 1 a addition of 700 ml of ww normal fully mixed tests b addition of 700 ml of tap water blank fully mixed tests step 2 mixing for 0 5 5 10 60 or 180 min the mixing velocity gradient g was set to 3 3 s 1 using an apparatus with propellers similar to the g values maintained during aeration in the long term lab scale experiments performed at eawag layer et al 2019 supplementary information s2 step 3 settling for 30 min in

for a clear differentiation between granules and particles based on signal intensity predominantly t 2 weighted images were conducted see supplementary information fig s2 lower row as the signal intensities of granules and particles were in a similar intensity range a threshold value 6300 out of 215 intensity values was chosen for predominantly t 1 weighted images to separate granules and

3 1 retention of xb during the anaerobic plug flow feeding of ags systems 3 1 1 how is xb retention influenced by influent ww composition vww and biomass type in plug flow conditions xb retention was evaluated during plug flow tests fig 3 xb retention during plug flow conditions varied between 10 and 90 the concentration of xb in the influent ww had major impact on xb retention biomass composition and applied vww influenced xb retention to a lesser extent increasing xb concentrations significantly increased xb retention p 2 48e 07 independent of biomass composition or applied vww specifically high xb influent concentrations 600 mg l 1 resulted in xb retention 60 biomass composition also affected xb retention during plug flow conditions p 1 28e 03 in absence of a filter bed blank test 10 52 of influent xb were retained fig 3a in presence of a filter bed overall xb retention is increased to 60 on average fig 3b d in addition lower vww in general resulted in higher xb retention p 0 022 3 1 2 how is xb distributed over the bed height during plug flow conditions a main question is where does the retention of xb occur within the settled bed of ags during plug flow feeding results from the plug flow tests with variable sludge bed heights indicated that a gradient of xb retention over the bed height existed fig 4 hereby large amounts of xb were retained at the bottom of the settled sludge bed the larger was the upflow feeding velocity during the plug flow feeding the deeper was the penetration of xb and hence the lower was the gradient of xb retention within the settled sludge bed low vww of 1 m h 1 led to increased xb retention at the bottom of the sludge bed almost 70 of final xb retention occurred within the first 0 5 cm on the other hand higher vww of 2 5 m h 1 during feeding increased the penetration depth of xb thus resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of xb within the bed the first 0 5 cm of the settled sludge bed retained 30 of the final retention in this case overall higher xb retention at vww 1 m h 1 were likely the result of a higher influent xb concentration compared to the run at vww 2 5 m h 1 which were 292 and 201 mg l 1 for vww 1 and 2 5 m h 1 respectively the reynolds numbers were 0 6 and 1 4 for vww of 1 and 2 5 m h 1 respectively 3 1 3 does xb attach to granules surface or accumulate within interstitial voids of the sludge bed during plug flow conditions our results from plug flow tests helped to quantify the extent of xb retention during plug flow feeding and its spatial distribution over the height of the sludge bed a major aspect is however to better understand if xb is attached to the settled biomass after feeding or if it simply accumulated within the bed without much contact mri tests were thus conducted to evaluate the spatial distribution of xb within the settled granular sludge bed during anaerobic plug flow feeding results from mri tests demonstrated that xb accumulated within the interstitial voids in the first few cm of the settled sludge bed and that xb accumulation was actually affected by both sedimentation and surface filtration fig 5 fig 6 most xb accumulated within the first 13 mm in vertical direction after the 1st feeding fig 5a white colour fig 6ab granules were pushed by the applied flow creating channels and resulting in void space fig 5a moreover xb hardly distributed horizontally within the granule bed instead xb was located mostly in the bottom of the chamber and additionally occupied the void space in vertical direction extending the inlet fig 5a only minimal distribution of xb in the x and y direction occurred despite the rather narrow chamber of the mri and no wall effects were visible after the 2nd feeding xb occupied even more of the void space and was distributed along the whole height of the chamber fig 5b occupation of the void space by xb was indicated by large white coloured areas volumes surrounding the preferential flow channel created by the inlet flow in the centre of the column after the 1st and 2nd feeding figs 5 and 6a the reynolds number during mri tests was 0 1 assuming a granule diameter of d 1 0 mm 3 2 how is xb retained during fully mixed conditions if large fractions of influent xb are retained within the settled sludge bed during anaerobic plug flow feeding but not binding to the granules it is then likely that xb re suspends and becomes available for attachment in aerobic fully mixed conditions for both flocs and granules in ags systems fully mixed tests were thus conducted to better understand where xb does attach during mixed conditions i e to granules or flocs fig 7 results from the fully mixed tests indicated that an increasing floc fraction in the ags significantly increased xb retention during fully mixed conditions in ags systems p 1 0e 05 specifically in the first 60 min of mixing additionally longer mixing times as well as higher influent xb concentrations significantly increased xb retention in ags systems all p 1 0e 05 over 50 of the final xb removal was achieved during the first 30 s of mixing if flocs were present in the biomass fig 7 reduced xb retention was observed after 30 s in absence of flocs 20 less xb retention by 100 granules fig 7ab however the longer the mixing time was the smaller were the differences in overall xb retention between the different biomass compositions after 3 h of mixing xb retention was 60 85 among all biomass compositions and floc fractions were less important towards overall xb retention p 0 14 fig 7ab it must be noted that the total biomass concentration during fully mixed tests was held constant independent of different granule flocs fractions which further highlighted the impact of flocs on xb retention in mixes of granules and flocs influent xb concentration also contributed to the overall level of xb retention the increased xb influent concentration of fully mixed test b 196 mgcod l 1 fig 7b led to overall higher xb retention independent of mixing time or biomass composition when compared to the lower xb influent concentration of fully mixed test a 94 mgcod l 1 fig 7a 4 discussion 4 1 xb accumulates within the sludge bed during plug flow feeding but does not attach to granules our first main result is that xb accumulated predominantly within the voids at the bottom of the settled sludge bed thus indicating that xb retention was governed by sedimentation and surface filtration during plug flow feeding figs 3 6 if xb retention was governed by sedimentation and surface filtration it is then likely that only a minor fraction of xb is actually in contact with the granules during anaerobic plug flow feeding figs 5 6 ranzinger et al 2020 we propose that xb retention through sedimentation and surface filtration during plug flow feeding of ags systems is a 3 step process consisting of 1 channel formation 2 settling of xb and 3 surface filtration firstly influent flow causes slight redistribution of granules which locally enlarges void space and then forms channels in upward direction within the settled sludge bed secondly influent xb settles within the channels the channels are progressively filled up by the settling of xb ultimately resulting in a filter cake thirdly influent xb is then strained by the filter cake and surface filtration occurs maroudas and eisenklam 1965 with continuing influent ww injection the filter cake consisting of xb is being pushed upwards attachment of xb to the granules during plug flow feeding is thus limited however our results do not allow us to conclude about actual contact between filter cake and the granule surface since the resolution of mri is too coarse ranzinger et al 2020 a minor fraction of xb could thus be in contact to the granules during anaerobic plug flow feeding our results also indicated that the influent xb concentration and upflow velocity determined the extent of xb retention during plug flow feeding the upflow feeding velocities applied at pilot scale but also in full scale ags system are ranging from 0 5 to 5 m h 1 with a typical value of 2 m h 1 when treating municipal ww derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015a pronk et al 2015b the settling velocity of influent xb particles in the size range of 45 200 μm in diameter is 0 8 16 m h 1 specific gravity 1 2 kg l 1 or 4 0 75 m h 1 specific gravity 2 0 kg l 1 stokes 1851 levine et al 1985 johnson et al 1996 the settling velocities of xb particles are in general larger than the values of upflow feeding velocities however the upflow velocity of the influent ww must be corrected for the porosity of the settled sludge bed with a typical value of 0 52 van dijk et al 2020 the actual upflow velocity within the sludge bed pores therefore increases by a factor of 1 9 to values of 1 0 9 6 m h 1 in general the actual upflow velocities are in the same range as the settling velocities of influent xb particles however large xb particles are strongly affected by sedimentation and could therefore play an important role in the initial formation of a filter cake at the bottom of the settled sludge bed smaller xb particles that are transported through advection could then be retained through surface filtration by the filter cake maroudas and eisenklam 1965 higher xb concentrations usually coincide with larger particle diameters sophonsiri and morgenroth 2004 influent ww composed of high xb concentrations will thus lead to increased settling of xb at the bottom of the sludge bed and fast formation of a filter cake during the anaerobic plug flow feeding the overall particle size distribution entering the ags sbr is determined by whether primary treatment via primary clarification or a similar filtration or sedimentation step is implemented or not levine et al 1991 colloids particles d 1 μm are prone to diffusion and can indeed diffuse into the granules located at the bottom of the sludge bed during plug flow feeding ranzinger et al 2020 retention of colloidal particles is therefore governed by inherently different mechanisms compared to retention of xb particles which cannot diffuse into the biofilm polson 1950 it must be noted that mri tests were conducted using a very high xb loading in order to increase the image quality therefore results gained from mri figs 5 6 likely overemphasised the magnitude but not the occurrence of sedimentation and surface filtration as xb retention mechanisms during plug flow feeding we therefore propose that a large fraction of xb is retained at the bottom of the settled sludge bed through sedimentation and surface filtration and is thus not attached to biomass combining limited attachment to biomass and slow hydrolysis in anaerobic plug flow feeding conditions suggests that large fractions of xb are not hydrolysed during anaerobic plug flow feeding conditions henze and mladenovski 1991 large fractions of influent xb could therefore re suspend once aerobic fully mixed aerobic conditions are applied ranzinger et al 2020 in analogy to particle re suspension during backwash of granular media filters amirtharajah 1985 4 2 large fractions of xb are retained by flocs during fully mixed conditions another main finding of our study is that xb re suspends during fully mixed conditions e g once aeration starts and is available for attachment onto both granules and flocs a main question is whether xb will then attach preferentially to the flocs or to the granules during the first 60 min of mixing the presence of flocs increased xb retention by more than 20 in comparison to the 100 granules case fig 7 we hypothesize that xb retention is mostly achieved by flocs through rapid attachment due to the very large specific surface area of flocs flocs tss fraction 20 flocs to granules surface area ratio 939 to 1 supplementary information s4 andreadakis 1993 mihciokur and oguz 2016 jimenez et al 2005 granules on the other hand have a much smaller specific surface area and are much lower in number supplementary information s4 in addition the surface of mature granules is often rather smooth when flocs are also present in the ags and granules do not offer many locations for attachment in comparison to odd shaped ramified flocs reduced xb removal and decreased xb removal rates by biofilm systems is linked to limited active adsorption sites boltz and la motta 2007 we thus propose that flocs have a competitive advantage over granules to retain xb through attachment during fully mixed aerobic conditions due to their physical structure despite their minor fraction in ags systems treating municipal ww 10 30 tss based layer et al 2019 if xb is attaching rapidly and preferentially to the flocs only little xb is then left for attachment onto the granules attachment of xb onto the granules was much slower compared to xb attachment to mixtures of flocs and granules or solely flocs fig 7 previous studies indeed indicate that the contribution of biofilms to the retention and hydrolysis of xb is quite limited during fully mixed conditions particles 1 μm are typically considered the most difficult to be removed in biofilm systems levine et al 1991 in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr used for the treatment of municipal wastewater no reduction in tss usually occurs in the mbbr stage åhl et al 2006 in general reduced hydrolysis of xb has been reported for biofilm systems in comparison to conventional activated sludge systems janning et al 1998 morgenroth et al 2002 actually several studies even suggested that hydrolysis in biofilm systems is carried out in the bulk phase rather than at the biofilm surface rohold and harremoës 1993 larsen and harremoës 1994a 1994b those findings suggest that the contribution of biofilms to xb hydrolysis is rather small due to the limited attachment of xb onto biofilms ags systems treating municipal ww are now often regarded to as hybrid biofilm systems layer et al 2019 therefore we hypothesize that in hybrid systems such as ags flocs outcompete granules in xb retention through attachment once mixing is applied 4 3 practical implications attachment of xb was quite limited during anaerobic plug flow conditions and full retention of xb was then achieved in aerobic fully mixed conditions retention of xb during fully mixed tests were performed using very high xb to biomass ratios 70 30 v v and final xb retention was 80 in all tests thus complete removal of xb can be expected during the aerobic fully mixed phase in full scale ags sbr operation flocs retained a large fraction of xb through rapid attachment after mixing was applied therefore it is very likely that 1 xb will be fully hydrolysed within the sbr cycle henze et al 2000 and that 2 the majority of hydrolysis products are consumed within the floc micro environment too martins et al 2011 flocs will thus always co exist with granules in ags systems as long as the ww contains organic substrate in the form of xb aggressive wash out of flocs via short settling times still is a common start up and operational strategy in ags sbr operation adav et al 2008 we however propose that too aggressive wash out of flocs is neither desirable nor expedient in ags systems treating municipal ww even at the cost of decreased settling performance layer et al 2019 it is likely that too high wash out of flocs in ags systems treating xb rich municipal ww leads to increased xb attachment hydrolysis and utilisation by the granules an increased aerobic utilisation of xb by the granules would then result aerobic utilisation of organic substrate by the granules was linked to filamentous outgrowth loss of nutrient removal performance and or granule breakage and process failure eventually sturm et al 2004 de kreuk et al 2010 derlon et al 2016 haaksman et al 2020 to date it is still under debate if flocs have other important functions in ags systems like e g if their contribution towards nutrient removal is significant or negligible and whether their presence is desirable or not ali et al 2019 layer et al 2019 2020 therefore more research is required on the specific function of flocs in ags systems treating municipal ww xb retention can be optimised by e g introducing an anaerobic mixed phase after plug flow feeding layer et al 2019 an increased attachment of xb to flocs and granules during anaerobic conditions would be the result however prior research has indicated that anaerobic hydrolysis of xb originating from municipal ww can be limited jabari et al 2016 thus anaerobic xb degradation by introducing anaerobic mixing could be limited another option could aim at minimising xb in the influent to the ags stage through advanced pre treatment such as micro sieving or chemically enhanced pre treatment sancho et al 2019 pre fermentation of captured xb in primary treatment could indeed enhance ags performance in low strength municipal ww conditions yuan et al 2020 vollertsen et al 2006 however more research is required to identify feasible operational strategies and technologies to improve xb retention degradation and utilisation in ags based wwtp reynolds numbers calculated for plug flow tests indicated laminar flow conditions during plug flow feeding at lab scale it must be noted that turbulent flow conditions could occur during the feeding phase of a full scale ags sbr depending on the design of the influent ww distribution system e g due to scarce injection nozzle distribution in such case two distinct zones might exist where the first zone e g bottom 10 50 cm of the settled sludge bed experiences turbulent flow conditions and could act as a fluidized bed within the fluidized bed attachment of xb to biomass could be possible the second zone above the fluidized bed would experience laminar flow conditions where similar xb retention mechanisms as observed in our study likely occur however to date no detailed information on full scale ags sbr injection hydraulics are available and thus considerations are highly speculative 5 conclusions 1 during anaerobic plug flow feeding of ags sbr xb is retained within the interstitial voids of the settled sludge bed but with minimal attachment in the subsequent fully mixed phase xb then attaches preferentially to the flocs 2 xb retention results from the combined mechanisms of sedimentation and surface filtration that occur at the bottom of the settled sludge bed during anaerobic plug flow feeding up to 70 of the final xb retention occurred within the first 0 5 cm of the settled sludge bed the attachment of xb onto the granules is thus limited during anaerobic plug flow feeding 3 the extent of xb retention during plug flow feeding is determined by ww composition influent xb concentration vww and sludge bed composition high influent xb concentrations and low vww increase xb retention 4 a large fraction of influent xb likely re suspends during aerobic fully mixed conditions rapid xb retention after 0 5 60 min of mixing occurs if flocs are present in the biomass therefore xb attaches preferentially to flocs and only a small fraction of xb attaches to granules 5 flocs are an important biomass fraction in

19991,particulate substrate xb is the major organic substrate fraction in most municipal wastewaters however the impact of xb on aerobic granular sludge ags systems is not fully understood this study evaluated the physical retention of xb in ags sequencing batch reactor sbr during anaerobic plug flow and then aerobic fully mixed conditions the influence of different sludge types and operational variables on the extent and mechanisms of xb retention in ags sbr were evaluated xb mass balancing and magnetic resonance imaging mri were applied during the anaerobic plug flow feeding most xb was retained in the first few cm of the settled sludge bed within the interstitial voids where xb settled and accumulated ultimately resulting in the formation of a filter cake sedimentation and surface filtration were thus the dominant xb retention mechanisms during plug flow conditions indicating that contact and attachment of xb to the biomass was limited xb retention was variable and influenced by the xb influent concentration sludge bed composition and upflow feeding velocity vww xb retention increased with larger xb influent concentrations and lower vww which demonstrated the importance of sedimentation on xb retention during plug flow conditions hence large fractions of influent xb likely re suspended during aerobic fully mixed conditions where xb then preferentially and rapidly attached to the flocs during fully mixed conditions increasing floc fractions longer mixing times and larger xb concentrations increased xb retention elevated xb retention was observed after short mixing times 60 min when flocs were present and the contribution of flocs towards xb retention was even more pronounced for short mixing times 5 min overall our results suggest that flocs occupy an environmental niche that results from the availability of xb during aerobic fully mixed conditions of ags sbr therefore a complete wash out of flocs is not desirable in ags systems treating municipal wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge municipal wastewater particulate substrate plug flow feeding attachment flocs 1 introduction our understanding of the effect of particulate organic substrate xb on the formation operation and overall process performance of aerobic granular sludge ags remains limited despite many full scale installations derlon et al 2016 ali et al 2019 prior studies suggested that xb might have several different effects on the behaviour and performance of ags systems 1 floc formation and reduced settleability wagner et al 2015b derlon et al 2016 layer et al 2019 2 longer start up duration wagner et al 2015a layer et al 2019 3 reduced nutrient removal capability de kreuk et al 2010 jabari et al 2016 guimarães et al 2018 and 4 deterioration of effluent quality due to an increased effluent solids concentration rocktäschel et al 2015 van dijk et al 2018 however the link between these observations and the presence of xb in the influent wastewater ww is not well understood yet research on the overall impact and utilisation pathways of xb on ags systems is therefore necessary xb represents a major fraction of the organic substrate present in municipal ww typically 50 metcalf and eddy 2014 hydrolysis of xb is required prior to its utilisation which often is considered the rate limiting step in biological ww treatment morgenroth et al 2002 in ags systems an anaerobic feeding phase of 1 2 h duration most of the time as plug flow is typically applied pronk et al 2015b however such period of plug flow feeding is likely too short to allow for full hydrolysis of xb jabari et al 2016 wagner et al 2015b therefore it is suspected that some xb could leak into aerobic conditions in ags operation the presence of organic substrate in aerobic conditions favours the growth of finger type granules de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015a or can even result in process breakdown due to granule breakage sturm et al 2004 however finger type granules are rarely observed in ags systems treating municipal ww pronk et al 2015b derlon et al 2016 rather a noticeable growth of flocs is actually observed so that flocs represent a substantial fraction of 10 20 of the ags formed during treatment of municipal ww wagner et al 2015a derlon et al 2016 layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015b the presence of flocs in ags is now acknowledged in full scale installations van dijk et al 2018 despite their origin is not well understood ags is therefore step by step seen as hybrid system where biofilm granules and suspended biomass flocs coexist layer et al 2019 understanding the connection between influent xb and the presence and role of flocs is therefore required xb degradation is a three step process 1 physical contact to biomass physical xb retention 2 initiation of enzymatic hydrolysis after contact to biomass and 3 further utilisation of hydrolysis products as readily biodegradable substrate sb in anaerobic fermentation storage anoxic denitrification or aerobic direct oxidation storage processes the present study focuses specifically on physical retention of xb several aspects might hamper physical retention of xb in ags in comparison to conventional activated sludge systems 1 distinct hydraulic conditions during anaerobic plug flow feeding followed by aerobic fully mixed conditions in sbr operation and 2 the presence of both biofilms granules and suspended biomass flocs in ags systems treating municipal ww fig 1 illustrates the possible pathways of xb retention during anaerobic plug flow feeding fig 1a and aerobic fully mixed conditions fig 1b plug flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor into the settled ags bed could limit attachment through restricted contact between influent xb and biomass if xb then re suspends during fully mixed conditions it is hypothesized that flocs would have a competitive advantage in capturing xb due to their much increased adsorption capacity andreadakis 1993 fig 1b understanding when i e during plug flow or fully mixed conditions and where i e by flocs or at the granules surface xb is retained therefore needs to be clarified in addition it should be clarified what external factors operational influent ww influence xb retention in ags sbr operation the main objective of this study was to better understand the fate of xb during ags sbr operation and ultimately to get insights about the presence and role of flocs in ags systems therefore the focus was on evaluating 1 to what extent xb is retained during anaerobic plug flow feeding and then during aerobic fully mixed conditions 2 to what extent is the retention of xb affected by operational variables upflow feeding velocity vww mixing time and influent composition on xb retention in ags sbr operation and ultimately 3 to provide insights about the presence and role of flocs in ags systems therefore several different retention tests under plug flow and fully mixed conditions were conducted different types of biomass or mimics of biomass ags fed with acetate propionate glass beads ags fed with municipal ww activated sludge flocs and the effect of different vww during plug flow feeding and mixing time during fully mixed conditions were tested real municipal ww particles were used as xb source and cod mass balances were conducted to quantify the extent of xb retention in the different experiments in addition magnetic resonance imaging mri was used to identify the mechanisms of xb retention during plug flow feeding 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach both plug flow mri and fully mixed tests were conducted to evaluate the fate of xb in ags sbr operation table 1 primary effluent ww of the ww treatment plant wwtp of eawag dübendorf switzerland was used as the source of xb during all tests anaerobic or anoxic redox conditions were kept during all tests in order to minimize degradation of xb 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1

height table 1 low and medium vww 1 2 5 m h 1 and filter bed composed of glass beads d 2 mm were tested in parallel to the tests with real ww xb as influent blank plug flow tests were conducted tap water injection instead of real ww to account for xb loss from the filter bed during feeding columns with 2 5 and 5 cm inner diameter working volume of 393 and 1963 ml height of 82 and 100 cm

some influent ww would exit the column through the effluent the procedure of the plug flow tests was as follows step 1 addition of sludge to the column to a targeted bed height of 13 cm fixed sludge bed height tests or variable from 0 5 to 20 cm variable sludge bed height tests after 20 min of settling a settling duration of 20 min was sufficient to ensure a complete settling of the sludge during all tests supernatant removal above settled sludge bed using drainage ports step 2 1st tap water injection from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic pump to refill the column heidolph germany

mixed tests fully mixed tests were conducted to analyse xb retention under fully mixed conditions representative of the aerobic phase of ags systems schematic fig 2b the approach was based on modin et al 2015 and jimenez et al 2005 the influence of sludge composition mixing time and influent xb concentration was evaluated table 1 the sludge was composed of different ratios of large granules 1 mm 0

evaluated all fully mixed tests were conducted for a defined sludge composition blank fully mixed tests were in addition conducted tap water instead of real ww to account for xb loss from biomass the procedure of the fully mixed tests was as follow step 1 addition of 300 ml of biomass to 1 l glass beakers with a target total suspended solids tss concentration of 4 gtss l 1 a addition of 700 ml of ww normal fully mixed tests b addition of 700 ml of tap water blank fully mixed tests step 2 mixing for 0 5 5 10 60 or 180 min the mixing velocity gradient g was set to 3 3 s 1 using an apparatus with propellers similar to the g values maintained during aeration in the long term lab scale experiments performed at eawag layer et al 2019 supplementary information s2 step 3 settling for 30 min in order to separate biomass and supernatant step 4 collection of 50 ml of supernatant 9 cm underneath the water surface 2 3 analytical methods tss was quantified using standard methods apha 2005 sludge

data analysis was performed using matlab r2018b mathworks usa and avizo 9 4 thermo fisher scientific usa the granular sludge bed was visualised with the t 1 weighted images see supplementary information fig s2 upper row according to the signal intensity particles appear the brightest followed by granules and water filled void space no signal black is obtained from exterior solid materials for a clear differentiation between granules and particles based on signal intensity predominantly t 2 weighted images were conducted see supplementary information fig s2 lower row as the signal intensities of granules and particles were in a similar intensity range a threshold value 6300 out of 215 intensity values was chosen for predominantly t 1 weighted images to separate granules and particles from void space and exterior parts for predominantly t 2 weighted images a threshold value 5000 was chosen to separate particles and exterior parts from granules and void space the combination of both binary images allowed for a clear determination and quantification of the fractions for a more detailed description of the applied method please see ranzinger et al 2020 3 results 3 1 retention of xb during the anaerobic plug flow feeding of ags systems 3 1 1 how is xb retention influenced by influent ww composition vww and biomass type in plug flow conditions xb retention was evaluated during plug flow tests fig 3 xb retention during plug flow conditions varied between 10 and 90 the concentration of xb in the influent ww had major impact on xb retention biomass composition and applied vww influenced xb retention to a lesser extent increasing xb concentrations significantly increased xb retention p 2 48e 07 independent of biomass composition or applied vww specifically high xb influent concentrations 600 mg l 1 resulted in xb retention 60 biomass composition also affected xb retention during plug flow conditions p 1 28e 03 in absence of a filter bed blank test 10 52 of influent xb were retained fig 3a in presence of a filter bed overall xb retention is increased to 60 on average fig 3b d in addition lower vww in general resulted in higher xb retention p 0 022 3 1 2 how is xb distributed over the bed height during plug flow conditions a main question is where does the retention of xb occur within the settled bed of ags during plug flow feeding results from the plug flow tests with variable sludge bed heights indicated that a gradient of xb retention over the bed height existed fig 4 hereby large amounts of xb were retained at the bottom of the settled sludge bed the larger was the upflow feeding velocity during the plug flow feeding the deeper was the penetration of xb and hence the lower was the gradient of xb retention within the settled sludge bed low vww of 1 m h 1 led to increased xb retention at the bottom of the sludge bed almost 70 of final xb retention occurred within the first 0 5 cm on the other hand higher vww of 2 5 m h 1 during feeding increased the penetration depth of xb thus resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of xb within the bed the first 0 5 cm of the settled sludge bed retained 30 of the final retention in this case overall higher xb retention at vww 1 m h 1 were likely the result of a higher influent xb concentration compared to the run at vww 2 5 m h 1 which were 292 and 201 mg l 1 for vww 1 and 2 5 m h 1 respectively the reynolds numbers were 0 6 and 1 4 for vww of 1 and 2 5 m h 1 respectively 3 1 3 does xb attach to granules surface or accumulate within interstitial voids of the sludge bed during plug flow conditions our results from plug flow tests helped to quantify the extent of xb retention during plug flow feeding and its spatial distribution over the height of the sludge bed a major aspect is however to better understand if xb is attached to the settled biomass after feeding or if it simply accumulated within the bed without much contact mri tests were thus conducted to evaluate the spatial distribution of xb within the settled granular sludge bed during anaerobic plug flow feeding results from mri tests demonstrated that xb accumulated within the interstitial voids in the first few cm of the settled sludge bed and that xb accumulation was actually affected by both sedimentation and surface filtration fig 5 fig 6 most xb accumulated within the first 13 mm in vertical direction after the 1st feeding fig 5a white colour fig 6ab granules were pushed by the applied flow creating channels and resulting in void space fig 5a moreover xb hardly distributed horizontally within the granule bed instead xb was located mostly in the bottom of the chamber and additionally occupied the void space in vertical direction extending the inlet fig 5a only minimal distribution of xb in the x and y direction occurred despite the rather narrow chamber of the mri and no wall effects were visible after the 2nd feeding xb occupied even more of the void space and was distributed along the whole height of the chamber fig 5b occupation of the void space by xb was indicated by large white coloured areas volumes surrounding the preferential flow channel created by the inlet flow in the centre of the column after the 1st and 2nd feeding figs 5 and 6a the reynolds number during mri tests was 0 1 assuming a granule diameter of d 1 0 mm 3 2 how is xb retained during fully mixed conditions if large fractions of influent xb are retained within the settled sludge bed during anaerobic plug flow feeding but not binding to the granules it is then likely that xb re suspends and becomes available for attachment in aerobic fully mixed conditions for both flocs and granules in ags systems fully mixed tests were thus conducted to better understand where xb does attach during mixed conditions i e to granules or flocs fig 7 results from the fully mixed tests indicated that an increasing floc fraction in the ags significantly increased xb retention during fully mixed conditions in ags systems p 1 0e 05 specifically in the first 60 min of mixing additionally longer mixing times as well as higher influent xb concentrations significantly increased xb retention in ags systems all p 1 0e 05 over 50 of the final xb removal was achieved during the first 30 s of mixing if flocs were present in the biomass fig 7 reduced xb retention was observed after 30 s in absence of flocs 20 less xb retention by 100 granules fig 7ab however the longer the mixing time was the smaller were the differences in overall xb retention between the different biomass compositions after 3 h of mixing xb retention was 60 85 among all biomass compositions and floc fractions were less important towards overall xb retention p 0 14 fig 7ab it must be noted that the total biomass concentration during fully mixed tests was held constant independent of different granule flocs fractions which further highlighted the impact of flocs on xb retention in mixes of granules and flocs influent xb concentration also contributed to the overall level of xb retention the increased xb influent concentration of fully mixed test b 196 mgcod l 1 fig 7b led to overall higher xb retention independent of mixing time or biomass composition when compared to the lower xb influent concentration of fully mixed test a 94 mgcod l 1 fig 7a 4 discussion 4 1 xb accumulates within the sludge bed during plug flow feeding but does not attach to granules our first main result is that xb accumulated predominantly within the voids at the bottom of the settled sludge bed thus indicating that xb retention was governed by sedimentation and surface filtration during plug flow feeding figs 3 6 if xb retention was governed by sedimentation and surface filtration it is then likely that only a minor fraction of xb is actually in contact with the granules during anaerobic plug flow feeding figs 5 6 ranzinger et al 2020 we propose that xb retention through sedimentation and surface filtration during plug flow feeding of ags systems is a 3 step process consisting of 1 channel formation 2 settling of xb and 3 surface filtration firstly influent flow causes slight redistribution of granules which locally enlarges void space and then forms channels in upward direction within the settled sludge bed secondly influent xb settles within the channels the channels are progressively filled up by the settling of xb ultimately resulting in a filter cake thirdly influent xb is then strained by the filter cake and surface filtration occurs maroudas and eisenklam 1965 with continuing influent ww injection the filter cake consisting of xb is being pushed upwards attachment of xb to the granules during plug flow feeding is thus limited however our results do not allow us to conclude about actual contact between filter cake and the granule surface since the resolution of mri is too coarse ranzinger et al 2020 a minor fraction of xb could thus be in contact to the granules during anaerobic plug flow feeding our results also indicated that the influent xb concentration and upflow velocity determined the extent of xb retention during plug flow feeding the upflow feeding velocities applied at pilot scale but also in full scale ags system are ranging from 0 5 to 5 m h 1 with a typical value of 2 m h 1 when treating municipal ww derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015a pronk et al 2015b the settling velocity of influent xb particles in the size range of 45 200 μm in diameter is 0 8 16 m h 1 specific gravity 1 2 kg l 1 or 4 0 75 m h 1 specific gravity 2 0 kg l 1 stokes 1851 levine et al 1985 johnson et al 1996 the settling velocities of xb particles are in general larger than the values of upflow feeding velocities however the upflow velocity of the influent ww must be corrected for the porosity of the settled sludge bed with a typical value of 0 52 van dijk et al 2020 the actual upflow velocity within the sludge bed pores therefore increases by a factor of 1 9 to values of 1 0 9 6 m h 1 in general the actual upflow velocities are in the same range as the settling velocities of influent xb particles however large xb particles are strongly affected by sedimentation and could therefore play an important role in the initial formation of a filter cake at the bottom of the settled sludge bed smaller xb particles that are transported through advection could then be retained through surface filtration by the filter cake maroudas and eisenklam 1965 higher xb concentrations usually coincide with larger particle diameters sophonsiri and morgenroth 2004 influent ww composed of high xb concentrations will thus lead to increased settling of xb at the bottom of the sludge bed and fast formation of a filter cake during the anaerobic plug flow feeding the overall particle size distribution entering the ags sbr is determined by whether primary treatment via primary clarification or a similar filtration or sedimentation step is implemented or not levine et al 1991 colloids particles d 1 μm are prone to diffusion and can indeed diffuse into the granules located at the bottom of the sludge bed during plug flow feeding ranzinger et al 2020 retention of colloidal particles is therefore governed by inherently different mechanisms compared to retention of xb particles which cannot diffuse into the biofilm polson 1950 it must be noted that mri tests were conducted using a very high xb loading in order to increase the image quality therefore results gained from mri figs 5 6 likely overemphasised the magnitude but not the occurrence of sedimentation and surface filtration as xb retention mechanisms during plug flow feeding we therefore propose that a large fraction of xb is retained at the bottom of the settled sludge bed through sedimentation and surface filtration and is thus not attached to biomass combining limited attachment to biomass and slow hydrolysis in anaerobic plug flow feeding conditions suggests that large fractions of xb are not hydrolysed during anaerobic plug flow feeding conditions henze and mladenovski 1991 large fractions of influent xb could therefore re suspend once aerobic fully mixed aerobic conditions are applied ranzinger et al 2020 in analogy to particle re suspension during backwash of granular media filters amirtharajah 1985 4 2 large fractions of xb are retained by flocs during fully mixed conditions another main finding of our study is that xb re suspends during fully mixed conditions e g once aeration starts and is available for attachment onto both granules and flocs a main question is whether xb will then attach preferentially to the flocs or to the granules during the first 60 min of mixing the presence of flocs increased xb retention by more than 20 in comparison to the 100 granules case fig 7 we hypothesize that xb retention is mostly achieved by flocs through rapid attachment due to the very large specific surface area of flocs flocs tss fraction 20 flocs to granules surface area ratio 939 to 1 supplementary information s4 andreadakis 1993 mihciokur and oguz 2016 jimenez et al 2005 granules on the other hand have a much smaller specific surface area and are much lower in number supplementary information s4 in addition the surface of mature granules is often rather smooth when flocs are also present in the ags and granules do not offer many locations for attachment in comparison to odd shaped ramified flocs reduced xb removal and decreased xb removal rates by biofilm systems is linked to limited active adsorption sites boltz and la motta 2007 we thus propose that flocs have a competitive advantage over granules to retain xb through attachment during fully mixed aerobic conditions due to their physical structure despite their minor fraction in ags systems treating municipal ww 10 30 tss based layer et al 2019 if xb is attaching rapidly and preferentially to the flocs only little xb is then left for attachment onto the granules attachment of xb onto the granules was much slower compared to xb attachment to mixtures of flocs and granules or solely flocs fig 7 previous studies indeed indicate that the contribution of biofilms to the retention and hydrolysis of xb is quite limited during fully mixed conditions particles 1 μm are typically considered the most difficult to be removed in biofilm systems levine et al 1991 in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr used for the treatment of municipal wastewater no reduction in tss usually occurs in the mbbr stage åhl et al 2006 in general reduced hydrolysis of xb has been reported for biofilm systems in comparison to conventional activated sludge systems janning et al 1998 morgenroth et al 2002 actually several studies even suggested that hydrolysis in biofilm systems is carried out in the bulk phase rather than at the biofilm surface rohold and harremoës 1993 larsen and harremoës 1994a 1994b those findings suggest that the contribution of biofilms to xb hydrolysis is rather small due to the limited attachment of xb onto biofilms ags systems treating municipal ww are now often regarded to as hybrid biofilm systems layer et al 2019 therefore we hypothesize that in hybrid systems such as ags flocs outcompete granules in xb retention through attachment once mixing is applied 4 3 practical implications attachment of xb was quite limited during anaerobic plug flow conditions and full retention of xb was then achieved in aerobic fully mixed conditions retention of xb during fully mixed tests were performed using very high xb to biomass ratios 70 30 v v and final xb retention was 80 in all tests thus complete removal of xb can be expected during the aerobic fully mixed phase in full scale ags sbr operation flocs retained a large fraction of xb through rapid attachment after mixing was applied therefore it is very likely that 1 xb will be fully hydrolysed within the sbr cycle henze et al 2000 and that 2 the majority of hydrolysis products are consumed within the floc micro environment too martins et al 2011 flocs will thus always co exist with granules in ags systems as long as the ww contains organic substrate in the form of xb aggressive wash out of flocs via short settling times still is a common start up and operational strategy in ags sbr operation adav et al 2008 we however propose that too aggressive wash out of flocs is neither desirable nor expedient in ags systems treating municipal ww even at the cost of decreased settling performance layer et al 2019 it is likely that too high wash out of flocs in ags systems treating xb rich municipal ww leads to increased xb attachment hydrolysis and utilisation by the granules an increased aerobic utilisation of xb by the granules would then result aerobic utilisation of organic substrate by the granules was linked to filamentous outgrowth loss of nutrient removal performance and or granule breakage and process failure eventually sturm et al 2004 de kreuk et al 2010 derlon et al 2016 haaksman et al 2020 to date it is still under debate if flocs have other important functions in ags systems like e g if their contribution towards nutrient removal is significant or negligible and whether their presence is desirable or not ali et al 2019 layer et al 2019 2020 therefore more research is required on the specific function of flocs in ags systems treating municipal ww xb retention can be optimised by e g introducing an anaerobic mixed phase after plug flow feeding layer et al 2019 an increased attachment of xb to flocs and granules during anaerobic conditions would be the result however prior research has indicated that anaerobic hydrolysis of xb originating from municipal ww can be limited jabari et al 2016 thus anaerobic xb degradation by introducing anaerobic mixing could be limited another option could aim at minimising xb in the influent to the ags stage through advanced pre treatment such as micro sieving or chemically enhanced pre treatment sancho et al 2019 pre fermentation of captured xb in primary treatment could indeed enhance ags performance in low strength municipal ww conditions yuan et al 2020 vollertsen et al 2006 however more research is required to identify feasible operational strategies and technologies to improve xb retention degradation and utilisation in ags based wwtp reynolds numbers calculated for plug flow tests indicated laminar flow conditions during plug flow feeding at lab scale it must be noted that turbulent flow conditions could occur during the feeding phase of a full scale ags sbr depending on the design of the influent ww distribution system e g due to scarce injection nozzle distribution in such case two distinct zones might exist where the first zone e g bottom 10 50 cm of the settled sludge bed experiences turbulent flow conditions and could act as a fluidized bed within the fluidized bed attachment of xb to biomass could be possible the second zone above the fluidized bed would experience laminar flow conditions where similar xb retention mechanisms as observed in our study likely occur however to date no detailed information on full scale ags sbr injection hydraulics are available and thus considerations are highly speculative 5 conclusions 1 during anaerobic plug flow feeding of ags sbr xb is retained within the interstitial voids of the settled sludge bed but with minimal attachment in the subsequent fully mixed phase xb then attaches preferentially to the flocs 2 xb retention results from the combined mechanisms of sedimentation and surface filtration that occur at the bottom of the settled sludge bed during anaerobic plug flow feeding up to 70 of the final xb retention occurred within the first 0 5 cm of the settled sludge bed the attachment of xb onto the granules is thus limited during anaerobic plug flow feeding 3 the extent of xb retention during plug flow feeding is determined by ww composition influent xb concentration vww and sludge bed composition high influent xb concentrations and low vww increase xb retention 4 a large fraction of influent xb likely re suspends during aerobic fully mixed conditions rapid xb retention after 0 5 60 min of mixing occurs if flocs are present in the biomass therefore xb attaches preferentially to flocs and only a small fraction of xb attaches to granules 5 flocs are an important biomass fraction in ags systems treating municipal ww rich in xb too high wash out of flocs is not desirable in those conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

19992,cu and ag have been used as bactericidal agents since ancient times yet their antiviral capacity in water remains poorly understood this study tested the effect of copper cu and silver ag on model rna and dna viruses ms2 and phix 174 in solution at ph 6 8 cu caused ms2 inactivation with similar rates at ph 6 and 7 but was inert towards phix 174 regardless of ph ag inactivated both viruses causing denaturation of ms2 and loss of capsid spikes in phix 174 ag inactivation rates were ph dependent and increased with increasing ph at ph 8 6 5 logs of phix were inactivated after 3 h and 3 logs of ms2 after only 10 min the combined use of cu and ag revealed synergy in disinfecting ms2 at ph 7 although metal concentrations used were higher than the desired values for drinking water

introduction use of metals in medicine food and water preservation is dated back to antiquity arendsen et al 2019 gadi and jeffrey 2009 konieczny and rdzawski 2012 some metals such as copper cu and silver ag display potent biocidal activity against bacteria borkow and gabbay 2005 hwang et al 2007 pathak and gopal 2012 vincent et al 2016 wijnhoven et al 2009 yeast fungi marambio jones and hoek

boosted application of metals for disinfection in a multitude of sectors in the water sector cu ag ionization units are used globally to control legionella and other waterborne microbes that may grow in hospital water systems borkow and gabbay 2005 stout and yu 2003 triantafyllidou et al 2016 cu ag ionization was proven more effective than other disinfectants such as uv light and chlorine stout and yu 2003 triantafyllidou et al 2016 the absence of harmful by products from cu and ag has expanded their application to reduce chlorine use in swimming pools silvestry rodriguez et al 2007 yahya et al 1992 cu and ag have also been incorporated in household water treatment systems to improve their microbial disinfection capacity oyanedel craver and smith 2008 pooi and ng 2018 although cu and ag antiviral activity was first reported in 1963 and 1964 yamamoto et al 1964 research evaluating their effectiveness has been limited there is a surprising absence of studies evaluating physical and chemical parameters that affect cu and ag antiviral activity reports evaluating cu as antiviral agent focused mainly on cu doses armstrong et al 2017 nieto juarez et al 2010 and the role of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in enhancing inactivation rates kim et al 2015 nguyen et al 2013 nieto juarez et al 2010 j l sagripanti et al 1993 yamamoto 1969 cu speciation was briefly addressed by nieto juarez et al 2010 since inactivation rates of ms2 were associated with the dissolved fraction of cu ions although ag antiviral studies reported on different doses comparing results is challenging as different studies used different solution matrices and speciation of ag ions was commonly overlooked butkus et al 2004 kim et al 2008 swathy et al 2014 zodrow et al 2009 the variation in testing conditions was also accompanied by contradicting results on cu and ag antiviral efficiency and inactivation capacity this highlights the need for a systematic evaluation of chemical physical parameters influencing cu and ag virucide efficiency as an essential step towards their application parameters such as ph availability of dissolved ag and cu2 ions versus their precipitates has been shown to significantly influence inactivation rates of bacteria choi et al 2009 lemire et al 2013 lin et al 2002 lok et al 2007 sharan et al 2010 xiu et al 2011 2012 while similar evaluation of those parameters remains elusive for viruses a notable effect on virus inactivation can be anticipated the speciation of metals is a key element in determining their bioavailability hence their toxicity and disinfection capacity lemire et al 2013 workentine et al 2008 the chemical state of the metal is also subjected to change by environmental factors such as ph temperature ionic strength and redox potential albrecht et al 2011 delahay et al 1951 lemire et al 2013 changing ph can also change virus conformation and its susceptibility to disinfection making it important factor in evaluating cu and ag antiviral efficiency thurman et al 1989 moreover susceptibility to disinfectants differs for different virus types for example the single stranded dna ssdna phage phix 174 was found to be more resistant to heat inactivation than double stranded dna dsdna adenovirus schijven et al 2019 and rna enteroviruses were more resistant to chlorine disinfection than dsdna adenovirus cromeans et al 2010 therefore the objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of cu and ag ions as antiviral agents in water conservative model viruses ms2 phage single stranded rna ssrna and phix 174 ssdna were selected as targets both cu and ag were tested individually and in combination in a solution matrix where ph was used as variable concentrations of cu and ag used were higher than the who recommendations to allow for a more feasible evaluation of metals speciation by analytical measurements the effect of ph on metal ions availability and speciation was evaluated using experimental analysis and the chemical speciation model cheaqs finally morphology of ms2 and phix 174 particles was examined before and after treatment using transmission electron microscopy tem to provide insights on possible

or phix 174 was examined in ph and temperature controlled 25 c inorganic buffer pb the reaction took place in sterilized acid washed 10 nitric acid glass beakers beakers were wrapped in aluminium foil and covered from the top with a sterile petri dish and foil to ensure dark conditions ms2 and phix 174 were tested separately each for inactivation by cu ag or both cu and ag at ph 6 7 and 8 additionally interaction between ms2 and ag was tested at ph 7 5 all conditions were examined at least in triplicates in total 26 metal inactivation experiments were conducted of which 7 were metal free control tests on the experimental day test water was prepared by adding phage suspension to pb buffer ph 6 7 or 8 to a final concentration of approximately 106 pfu ml and a 100 ml of test water were added to each beaker for metal testing the reaction was initiated by adding aliquots of metals to each beaker for a final concentration of ag 4 6 μm 0 5 mg l and 78 7 μm 5 mg l for cu solutions were placed inside a 25 c incubator and stirred continuously at 60 rpm 2mag magnetic drive at time intervals 0 0 17 0 5 1 3 and 6 h a 5 ml of sample were withdrawn using sterile syringes and directly neutralized to stop the reaction frequency of sampling was increased in some experiments ag containing samples were neutralized using 2 mm of silver neutralizer butkus et al 2004 cu containing samples were neutralized with 5 mm of edta and cu and ag samples were neutralized with both solutions metal free control samples were also neutralized to examine the neutralizer effect on phage recovery after neutralizing samples were stored on melting ice and ms2 samples were diluted in pbs buffer phix 174 in pb buffer phage enumeration followed the double agar layer method dal by assaying duplicates of 1 ml sample and serial sample dilutions as described in iso 10705 limit of detection lod was 1 pfu ml and the lowest concentration loq considered reliable was 30 pfu ml as recommended by the iso 10705 reported results represent the average values and standard deviations of triplicate tests in addition samples from metal beakers were analysed to confirm metals concentration using 1cp oes spectrometer spectro arcos eop 2 4 data analysis log removal values were calculated as log10 nt n0 where nt is the phage concentration pfu ml at time t and n0 is the concentration at time 0 first order inactivation rate constant kobs h 1 was calculated from the slope of linear regression of ln nt n0 versus time h linear regression analysis was used to calculate the kobs with 95 confidence interval and determine the significance of slope variation from zero linear regression slopes of metal free controls were compared to zero for significance of any noticeable decay kobs mean value sd and df for different conditions was compared using one way anova with tukey 2 5 speciation of metal ions the icp oes provides a measurement of the total metal ions without distinction between ionic dissolved or solid precipitates the speciation of metals is important since toxicity is often related to the metal s ionic form rather than dissolved or solid complexes pham et al 2012 thus a filtration test first provided an experimental assessment of dissolved metals vs solid complexes through solids exclusion by retention on the filter metal samples were filtered using a series of syringe filters 0 45 μm 0 22 μm 0 1 μm and 0 02 μm polyethersulfone pes sampled after passing each filter and analysed using icp oes the same was repeated on metal samples diluted in milliq which was used as control to evaluate possible metal adsorption to the filters concentration of the unfiltered samples ag 4 6 μm 0 5 mg l and 78 7 μm 5 mg l for cu was used as the total concentration lowest filtrate concentrations were considered dissolved and the difference between the total and dissolved is the filtered solid complexes average values and standard deviation are reported all values are reported as a percentage of the total metal concentration added the cheaqs next chemical equilibrium program was used to calculate the free ionic concentrations ag and cu2 in the buffer matrixes used the measured total concentrations of cu ag na and po4 were used as input together with measured ph and redox potential sentix orp t 900 2 6 tem imaging the morphology of phage particles was examined using transmission electron microscopy tem jeol jem 1400 plus since high phage concentration is required for tem a sub experiment was conducted using phage suspensions at 109 and 1011 pfu ml for phix 174 and ms2 respectively in brief 100 μl of phage suspension were treated with either ag or cu or both the concentrations used were approximately 20 μm of ag and 3 mm cu the suspension was incubated as mentioned above but in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes prior to tem grid preparation phix 174 sample buffer was exchanged for milliq by centrifugation 21 000 g 50 min 4 c a second centrifugation step was applied to further wash the sample and the supernatant was discarded for ms2 and phix 174 a 10 μl of the sample was incubated for 5 min on a copper mesh carbon type b 400 mesh ted pella the excess liquid was extracted using filter paper and the sample was stained using 2 uranyl acetate for 30 s imaging was repeated twice for each sample to ensure reproducibility additional information and images are provided in supplementary information 3 results 3 1 effect of ph on metal free controls to evaluate the stability of phix 174 ssdna and ms2 ssrna under experimental conditions metal free controls were sampled and analysed as metal samples concentrations of phix 174 fig 1 a were stable during the 6 h testing period at each tested ph kobs similar p 0 05 to slope zero same was observed for ms2 at ph 7 at ph 6 ms2 metal free control decayed over 6 h with kobs 0 22 0 01 h 1 significantly different from zero slope p 0 0001 to properly evaluate the inactivation caused by metals at ph 6 ms2 inactivation results were corrected to account for the observed decay in the control experiments the correction was applied by calculating log removal values lrv as log10 nt nc where nt is the phage concentration of test condition at time t and nc is the phage concentration of control condition also at time t kobs was calculated as the slope of ln nt nc 3 2 metal ions complexation the concentration of dissolved cu2 and ag was measured and compared against the modelling results of cheaqs next chemical software the concentration of ionic dissolved or solid metal ions is expressed as a percentage of the total experimental concentration 4 6 μm 0 5 mg l for ag and 78 7 μm 5 mg l for cu this provides more insight on ions availability free ionic form and complexation which might reflect on the antiviral activity of the metals changes in solution ph had a clear effect on speciation of cu and availability of cu2 ions cheaqs modelling results show a change in dissolved cu from 24 at ph 6 to 5 at ph 7 and 2 at ph 8 of which 16 1 and 0 2 are free ionic cu2 respectively fig 2 experimental measurement of dissolved cu yielded different percentages of dissolved cu but the trend did align with the model predictions measured dissolved cu at ph 6 7 and 8 were 43 6 and 1 respectively the higher percentage of experimentally measured dissolved cu2 could be due to the formation of copper particles smaller than the filter pore size 20 nm which are capable of passing the filter and being analysed as dissolved yet both methods model and experiment confirm a higher percentage of available dissolved cu2 at lower ph for ag changing ph had no effect on ag speciation supplementary figure s1 cheaqs predictions show 100 dissolved ag at all ph values of which free ionic ag changed from 100 at ph 6 t99 at ph 7 and 97 at ph 8 this slight drop was due to the formation of agh po4 figure s1 analytical measurements also showed 100 dissolved ag figure s1 the results for cu and ag in the combined solutions were identical to those of cu and ag alone 3 3 viral inactivation by cu antiviral efficiency of cu against phix 174 and ms2 was compared under acidic ph 6 neutral ph 7 and alkaline ph 8 conditions cu treatment caused no inactivation of phix 174 regardless of the ph kobs insignificant from control and from 0 slope p 0 05 fig 3 a inactivation kinetics of ms2 followed first order chick watson model fig 3b slowest kinetics were observed at ph 8 kobs 0 89 0 004 h 1 1 4 lrv over 6 h significantly different from kobs at ph 6 and 7 p 0 0001 however statistically similar p 0 29 inactivation kinetics at ph 6 kobs 0 79 0 06 h 1 2 2 lrv over 6 h and ph 7 kobs 0 90 0 02 h 1 2 4 lrv over 6 h were observed kobs values were significantly different p 0 0001 from metal free control slopes and zero slope validating that efficiency of cu in inactivating ms2 3 4 viral inactivation by ag ag showed a pronounced antiviral activity on both ms2 and phix 174 after 3 h of exposure to ag ions phix 174 reached the lowest concentration loq equivalent to 6 5 0 7 logs fig 4 a ph 8 ag inactivation of ms2 also reached loq 5 5 0 2 logs at ph 7 and 7 5 over 3 h fig 4b to avoid values at loq only the first hour was considered in evaluating inactivation kinetics fig 4c and d the slowest inactivation kinetics of ms2 was observed at ph 6 kobs 0 43 0 04 h 1 0 3 lrv over 1h kobs of ag treated ms2 and metal free control at ph 6 were similar p 0 94 hence ag was ineffective against ms2 at ph 6 meanwhile significantly higher p 0 05 kinetics were observed for phix 174 at ph 6 kobs 2 81 0 65 h 1 1 3 lrv over 1h at ph 7 inactivation rate constants were similar p 0 69 for ms2 kobs 4 99 0 48 and phix 174 kobs 4 09 0 57 the difference in kobs between ph 6 and 7 corresponds to an increase by a factor of 1 5 for phix 174 and by a factor 10 for ms2 kobs for phix 174 continued to increase with the same magnitude 1 5 times between ph 7 and 8 reaching 6 3 0 37 h 1 at ph 8 also kobs of ms2 doubled between ph 7 and 7 5 overall increased kobs by increasing ph was significant p 0 0001 and clear ph dependency of ms2 and phix 174 inactivation rates was observed inactivation kinetics followed chick watson model fig 4c and d except for ms2 at ph 8 the initial 10 min of interaction between ms2 and ag resulted in 3 5 lrv followed by a distinct tailing and much slower kinetics fig 4d 3 5 antiviral activity of cu and ag combined the combination of cu and ag was tested to evaluate possible synergies the experimentally observed lrvs of the cu and ag combination are compared to the mathematical sum of lrvs obtained from individual metal treatment reported as estimated the first hour results of ms2 are depicted in fig 5 results of phix 174 and the 6 h experiment are provided in supplementary material figure s2 and s3 for phix 174 observed and estimated kobs were similar p 0 7 figure s3 also observed and estimated kobs for ms2 at ph 6 were similar p 0 9 fig 5a ms2 observed inactivation kinetics at ph 7 kobs 35 95 9 4 h 1 2 7 lrv in 7 min was significantly higher p 0 05 than the estimated inactivation kinetics kobs 5 89 0 84 h 1 2 7 lrv over 1h similarly observed kobs was higher at ph 8 than the estimated rate constant 47 5 versus 16 h 1 this highlights a distinct synergetic effect of using cu and ag combined at ph 7 compared to their individual use however for the two conditions ph 7 and 8 inactivation of ms2 diverted from first order kinetics following initial drastic rapid inactivation observed inactivation of ms2 reached 3 logs after 10 min at ph 7 and 3 logs after 3 min at ph 8 both followed by subsequent tailing that decelerated the inactivation rates fig 5b ms2 diversion from first order kinetics tailing was initially observed using ag at ph 8 fig 4 which was reflected in the estimated lrvs of ms2 at ph 8 fig 5a in the three experimental settings where ms2 inactivation rapidly reached 3 logs in 10 min subsequent tailing was observed 3 6 morphological changes of ms2 and phix 174 tem imaging was used to examine morphological changes to the phage after metal treatment compared to the intact particles in metal free buffer the examination aimed to capture possible structural damage resulting from phage interaction with metals as shown in fig 6 a ms2 control particles can be seen with intact round shaped capsid the phix 174 control particles showed clear distinct capsid spikes fig 6b after exposure to cu ions ms2 particles appear with the same round morphology as the control but with darkened centre fig 6c this darkness is due to stain uranyl acetate penetration into the capsid this could be a result of defective capsid swathy et al 2014 or rna free capsid hooker et al 2004 the white non uniform particles appearing in the image were judged as chemical precipitates appearing on the grid the cu treated phix 174 fig 6d showed no difference from the control image except for debris or possible chemical precipitation similar to those in the ms2 image the ag treated ms2 particles however showed a clear difference in morphology fig 6e ms2 particles looked irregularly shaped losing their round intact structure and looking severely damaged phix 174 particles also appeared distinctly different after ag treatment fig 6f although the centre of the phix 174 capsid can still be recognized a clear loss of capsid spikes and change in particle size was observed finally no distinguishable additional structural damage was observed in ms2 samples containing both cu and ag but rather a combination of non uniform white precipitates and denatured particles as observed in the ag image image not shown 4 discussion 4 1 cu inactivation of phix 174 and ms2 cu inactivation of phix 174 and ms2 was tested to investigate the potential of cu ions as an antiviral agent against human enteric viruses in water using variable ph 6 8 speciation of cu was evaluated against inactivation rates achieved the increase in ph was associated with reduction in free ionic cu2 and dissolved cu regardless of cu2 availability phix 174 was not affected by cu treatment no inactivation was observed experimentally or change in phix 174 morphology in tem images sagripanti et al 1993 also reported no inactivation of phix 174 by cu treatment 15 mm however li and dennehy 2011 reported 3 5 lrv of phix 174 after adding 5 mm of cuso4 to the phix 174 lysate this difference cannot be explained by cu dose since the higher dose used by sagripanti et al 15 mm and the lower dose 78 7 μm used in our study did not cause phix 174 inactivation of note li and dennehy added cu to the lysate which contains organics while in our study inorganic buffer was used the interaction between organics and cu2 can lead to cu reduction to more toxic form cu 1 and possible production of h2o2 pham et al 2012 h2o2 interacts with dissolved oxygen producing ros which causes phix 174 inactivation by dna degradation lee et al 2016 ueda et al 1980 cu2 alone reportedly does not cause damage to the genomic dna unless ros were produced łȩ czkowska and vilar 2013 lemire et al 2013 sagripanti et al 1991 so the inactivation effect of cu on phix 174 reported in some studies is most probably caused by a more toxic form of cu or production of ros and cu2 alone does not cause inactivation of phix 174 regardless of its concentration and solution ph on the other hand ms2 was inactivated by cu at variable rates depending on the ph although cu concentration used in this study was higher than who recommendation of 2 mg l who 2017 lrvs achieved at same ph might not vary when who limit is applied since the reported ms2 inactivation rates at cu dose 1 mg l were similar due to solution saturation with copper armstrong et al 2017 nieto juarez et al 2010 according to nieto juarez et al 2010 inactivation of ms2 by cu is caused only by its dissolved fraction our analysis show that dissolved cu was higher at ph 6 than at ph 7 by 19 cheaqs data however the observed inactivation rates of ms2 were similar at ph 6 and 7 and lower at ph 8 in this situation the effect of ph on ms2 inactivation rates cannot be explained by cu2 solubility alone potentially the presence of ms2 in solution can influence the speciation of cu2 a study by badetti et al 2019 found that amino acids can solubilize cu2 from cu nanoparticles to form soluble complexes with cu2 however the higher inactivation kinetics at ph 7 compared to ph 8 does not support this mechanism either and point more towards conformational or structural changes in the ms2 capsid it has been reported that at ph 6 to 8 most of the cu2 binds to histidine his amino acid in proteins barber zucker et al 2017 and a small fraction to cysteine cys amino acids minoshima et al 2016 according to barber zucker et al 2017 increasing ph from 6 to 7 and 7 to 8 enhanced cu2 interaction with his by 20 and 1 but reduced cu2 interaction with cysteine cys amino acid by 2 and 1 respectively so it is likely that while ph 6 favoured cu2 dissolution ph 7 favoured the interaction between cu2 and his resulting in a similar inactivation rates as observed in our study the lower rates at ph 8 can be attributable to further loss of available cu2 which is not compensated by an increase of cu2 interaction with his the images of ms2 cu treated particles showed preservation of the circular capsid morphology with a dark centre which could be an artificial effect from the uranyl salts used as negative stain wan et al 2000 or a result of defective capsid protein swathy et al 2014 if cu caused only conformational change such as coordinating with amino acids it would not be visible under tem making the artificial interpretation more likely however the exact structure damage cannot be confirmed based on the images only so other possibilities cannot be excluded 4 2 ag inactivation of ms2 and phix 174 the results show that ag is a potent antiviral agent against both ms2 and phix 174 ag inactivation rates followed first order chick watson kinetics except for ms2 at ph 8 where tailing was observed viruses tailing has been commonly explained by aggregation of virus particles induced by solution ph close to virus isoelectric point virus type salt concentrations bacterial debris organic matter type or concentration of disinfectant gerba and betancourt 2017 the purification of ms2 stock as described in section 2 2 should remove bacterial debris organics and significantly reduce aggregation dika et al 2013 since the same ms2 stock inorganic buffer pb 1 mm and ag concentration were used in experiments where tailing was not observed it is unlikely that aggregation was the cause of observed tailing while the exact reason behind observed tailing remains unknown it is not determinative in evaluating ag antiviral efficiency since it is confined to only one condition ms2 ph 8 inactivation rates by ag were ph dependant for ms2 and phix 174 as kobs increased with increasing ph since ag was available in its ionic free form ag regardless of ph the observed dependency cannot be explained by ag speciation similar ph dependency of inactivation kinetics of bacteria by ag was reportedly associated with the increase in the negatively charged sites on the bacteria s membrane which enhanced the interaction with ag ions brown and anderson 1968 erickson et al 1998 lin et al 2002 pathak and gopal 2012 in viruses protonation of amino acids loss of h is responsible for the presence of negative sites in the protein capsid depending on its pka value since pka values differ per protein structure and the solution ph poole 2015 pka values of ms2 and phix 174 amino acids was predicted using propka 3 0 and provided in supplementary table s2 s3 the higher inactivation rates observed at ph 6 for phix 174 compared to ms2 can be attributed to the presence of cys residue with lower pka value in phix 14 spike protein g compared to the pka of cys in ms2 capsid protein see supplementary table s2 s3 although other amino acids had lower pka denaturation of cysteine has been linked to ag inactivation of viruses in literature clem gruen 1975 kim et al 2008 minoshima et al 2016 xiu et al 2011 zodrow et al 2009 tem images of ag treated phix showed a loss of the capsid spikes so we only accounted for pka values of cys in phix 174 spike protein g and cys pka in ms2 capsid protein the gradual increase of phix 174 inactivation rates with increasing ph is in agreement with the literature reported increase of the thiolates thiols ratio which enhances the interaction between ag and cys clem gruen 1975 poole 2015 meanwhile the sharp increase in ms2 kobs at ph 7 suggests involvement of both cys and rna in ag mediated inactivation mechanisms ag treated ms2 particles observed under tem support this hypothesis since the capsid is completely distorted finally similar to cu the concentration of ag used in this study was higher than who recommendations for drinking water 0 1 mg l so lower lrvs can be anticipated when applying ag in agreement with the who guidelines butkus et al 2004 4 3 inactivation of ms2 and phix 174 by cu and ag combined no synergy was observed between cu and ag for phix 174 inactivation the combination of cu and ag ions exhibited a synergistic effect on ms2 inactivation at ph 7 but not at ph 6 ag was only effective in disinfecting ms2 at ph 7 while cu has similar efficiency at ph 6 and 7 so it is likely that synergy is led by ag ions rather than cu and for synergy to occur both metals need to be individually effective in virus disinfection ag ions are strongly polarized compared to cu2 so when both ions are present in solution it is highly likely that ag would interact first lemire et al 2013 synergy of cu and ag in inactivating ms2 was also reported by yahya et al 1992 at ph 8 yet the reason behind it remains unclear chemical speciation of cu and ag was similar to the speciation of individual solutions also tem images provide no possible explanation for the synergy observed further research is needed to understand the reason behind cu and ag synergy moreover mechanistic understanding of the tailing kinetics can help evaluate if virus inactivation by metals could be self limiting under certain conditions although a promising potential of cu and ag antiviral efficiency is evident in this study evaluation of complexing factors such as natural organic matter is an important step for the complete picture of metal s antiviral efficiency and their potential application in drinking water treatment 5 conclusions our study has clarified essential aspects of evaluating antiviral activity of metals changing solution ph did not only affect the speciation of cu but also the sensitivity of viruses to disinfection free ionic ag strongly inactivated ssrna ms2 and ssdna phix 174 in neutral and alkaline conditions there is a strong synergistic effect of ag and cu for the inactivation of ms2 at ph 7 and higher no synergy was observed for phix 174 more work is needed to evaluate the efficiency of cu and ag in presence of organics to facilitate its further application as virucides for drinking water treatment although the concentrations used are higher than who recommendations the study highlights the potential of cu and ag as possible virus disinfectants in household drinking water

19992,cu and ag have been used as bactericidal agents since ancient times yet their antiviral capacity in water remains poorly understood this study tested the effect of copper cu and silver ag on model rna and dna viruses ms2 and phix 174 in solution at ph 6 8 cu caused ms2 inactivation with similar rates at ph 6 and 7 but was inert towards phix 174 regardless of ph ag inactivated both viruses causing denaturation of ms2 and loss of capsid spikes in phix 174 ag inactivation rates were ph dependent and increased with increasing ph at ph 8 6 5 logs of phix were inactivated after 3 h and 3 logs of ms2 after only 10 min the combined use of cu and ag revealed synergy in disinfecting ms2 at ph 7 although metal concentrations used were higher than the desired values for drinking water treatment the results prove a promising potential of cu and ag combinations as efficient viricidal agents graphical abstract image 1 keywords metals ms2 bacteriophage phix 174 water virus synergy 1 introduction use of metals in medicine food and water preservation is dated back to antiquity arendsen et al 2019 gadi and jeffrey 2009 konieczny and rdzawski 2012 some metals such as copper cu and silver ag display potent biocidal activity against bacteria borkow and gabbay 2005 hwang et al 2007 pathak and gopal 2012 vincent et al 2016 wijnhoven et al 2009 yeast fungi marambio jones and hoek 2010 and viruses borkow and gabbay 2005 silvestry rodriguez et al 2007 recent studies have proven the ability of metals to disinfect multidrug resistant bacteria bauer et al 2019 kaneko et al 2007 mehtar et al 2008 mikolay et al 2010 wright et al 1998 control biofilms harrison et al 2004 lehtola et al 2004 and have a synergistic effect when used with other biocides harrison et al 2008 this has boosted application of metals for disinfection in a multitude of sectors in the water sector cu ag ionization units are used globally to control legionella and other waterborne microbes that may grow in hospital water systems borkow and gabbay 2005 stout and yu 2003 triantafyllidou et al 2016 cu ag ionization was proven more effective than other disinfectants such as uv light and chlorine stout and yu 2003 triantafyllidou et al 2016 the absence of harmful by products from cu and ag has expanded their application to reduce chlorine use in swimming pools silvestry rodriguez et al 2007 yahya et al 1992 cu and ag have also been incorporated in household water treatment systems to improve their microbial disinfection capacity oyanedel craver and smith 2008 pooi and ng 2018 although cu and ag antiviral activity was first reported in 1963 and 1964 yamamoto et al 1964 research evaluating their effectiveness has been limited there is a surprising absence of studies evaluating physical and chemical parameters that affect cu and ag antiviral activity reports evaluating cu as antiviral agent focused mainly on cu doses armstrong et al 2017 nieto juarez et al 2010 and the role of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in enhancing inactivation rates kim et al 2015 nguyen et al 2013 nieto juarez et al 2010 j l sagripanti et al 1993 yamamoto 1969 cu speciation was briefly addressed by nieto juarez et al 2010 since inactivation rates of ms2 were associated with the dissolved fraction of cu ions although ag antiviral studies reported on different doses comparing results is challenging as different studies used different solution matrices and speciation of ag ions was commonly overlooked butkus et al 2004 kim et al 2008 swathy et al 2014 zodrow et al 2009 the variation in testing conditions was also accompanied by contradicting results on cu and ag antiviral efficiency and inactivation capacity this highlights the need for a systematic evaluation of chemical physical parameters influencing cu and ag virucide efficiency as an essential step towards their application parameters such as ph availability of dissolved ag and cu2 ions versus their precipitates has been shown to significantly influence inactivation rates of bacteria choi et al 2009 lemire et al 2013 lin et al 2002 lok et al 2007 sharan et al 2010 xiu et al 2011 2012 while similar evaluation of those parameters remains elusive for viruses a notable effect on virus inactivation can be anticipated the speciation of metals is a key element in determining their bioavailability hence their toxicity and disinfection capacity lemire et al 2013 workentine et al 2008 the chemical state of the metal is also subjected to change by environmental factors such as ph temperature ionic strength and redox potential albrecht et al 2011 delahay et al 1951 lemire et al 2013 changing ph can also change virus conformation and its susceptibility to disinfection making it important factor in evaluating cu and ag antiviral efficiency thurman et al 1989 moreover susceptibility to disinfectants differs for different virus types for example the single stranded dna ssdna phage phix 174 was found to be more resistant to heat inactivation than double stranded dna dsdna adenovirus schijven et al 2019 and rna enteroviruses were more resistant to chlorine disinfection than dsdna adenovirus cromeans et al 2010 therefore the objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of cu and ag ions as antiviral agents in water conservative model viruses ms2 phage single stranded rna ssrna and phix 174 ssdna were selected as targets both cu and ag were tested individually and in combination in a solution matrix where ph was used as variable concentrations of cu and ag used were higher than the who recommendations to allow for a more feasible evaluation of metals speciation by analytical measurements the effect of ph on metal ions availability and speciation was evaluated using experimental analysis and the chemical speciation model cheaqs finally morphology of ms2 and phix 174 particles was examined before and after treatment using transmission electron microscopy tem to provide insights on possible structural damage by cu and ag 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification copper sulfate 0 1 m sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate

ultracentrifugation to eliminate bacterial protein residuals broth organics or any impurities that can intervene with evaluating metals inactivation capacity moreover density gradient purification reduces phage aggregation dika et al 2013 which if occurred affects inactivation rates gerba and betancourt 2017 ms2 was suspended in iodixanol gradient optiprep stemcell and phix 174 in cesium

or phix 174 was examined in ph and temperature controlled 25 c inorganic buffer pb the reaction took place in sterilized acid washed 10 nitric acid glass beakers beakers were wrapped in aluminium foil and covered from the top with a sterile petri dish and foil to ensure dark conditions ms2 and phix 174 were tested separately each for inactivation by cu ag or both cu and ag at ph 6 7 and 8 additionally interaction between ms2 and ag was tested at ph 7 5 all conditions were examined at least in triplicates in total 26 metal inactivation experiments were conducted of which 7 were metal free control tests on the experimental day test water was prepared by adding phage suspension to pb buffer ph 6 7 or 8 to a final concentration of approximately 106 pfu ml and a 100 ml of test water were added to each beaker for metal testing the reaction was initiated by adding aliquots of metals to each beaker for a final concentration of ag 4 6 μm 0 5 mg l and 78 7 μm 5 mg l for cu solutions were placed inside a 25 c incubator and stirred continuously at 60 rpm 2mag magnetic drive at time intervals 0 0 17 0 5 1 3 and 6 h a 5 ml of sample were withdrawn using sterile syringes and directly neutralized to stop the reaction frequency of sampling was increased in some experiments ag containing samples were neutralized using 2 mm of silver neutralizer butkus et al 2004 cu containing samples were neutralized with 5 mm of edta and cu and ag samples were neutralized with both solutions metal free control samples were also neutralized to examine the neutralizer effect on phage recovery after neutralizing samples were stored on melting ice and ms2 samples were diluted in pbs buffer phix 174 in pb buffer phage enumeration followed the double agar layer method dal by assaying duplicates of 1 ml sample and serial sample dilutions as described in iso 10705 limit of detection lod was 1 pfu ml and the lowest concentration loq considered reliable was 30 pfu ml as recommended by the iso 10705 reported results represent the average values and standard deviations of triplicate tests in addition samples from metal beakers were analysed to confirm metals concentration using 1cp oes spectrometer spectro arcos eop 2 4 data analysis log removal values were calculated as log10 nt n0 where nt is the phage concentration pfu ml at time t and n0 is the concentration at time 0 first order inactivation rate constant kobs h 1 was calculated from the slope of linear regression of ln nt n0 versus time h linear regression analysis was used to calculate the kobs with 95 confidence interval and determine the significance of slope variation from zero linear regression slopes of metal free controls were compared to zero for significance of any noticeable decay kobs mean value sd and df for different conditions was compared using one way anova with tukey 2 5 speciation of metal ions the icp oes provides a measurement of the total metal ions without distinction between ionic dissolved or solid precipitates the speciation of metals is important since toxicity is often related to the metal s ionic form rather than dissolved or solid complexes pham et al 2012 thus a filtration test first provided an experimental assessment of dissolved metals vs solid complexes through solids exclusion by retention on the filter metal samples were filtered using a series of syringe filters 0 45 μm 0 22 μm 0 1 μm and 0 02 μm polyethersulfone pes sampled after passing each filter and analysed using icp oes the same was repeated on metal samples diluted in milliq which was used as control to evaluate possible metal adsorption to the filters concentration of the unfiltered samples ag 4 6 μm 0 5 mg l and 78 7 μm 5 mg l for cu was used as the total concentration lowest filtrate concentrations were considered dissolved and the difference between the total and dissolved is the filtered solid complexes average values and standard deviation are reported all values are reported as a percentage of the total metal concentration added the cheaqs next chemical equilibrium program was used to calculate the free ionic concentrations ag and cu2 in the buffer matrixes used the measured total concentrations of cu ag na and po4 were used as input together with measured ph and redox potential sentix orp t 900 2 6 tem imaging the morphology of phage particles was examined using transmission electron microscopy tem jeol jem 1400 plus since high phage concentration is required for tem a sub experiment was conducted using phage suspensions at 109 and 1011 pfu ml for phix 174 and ms2 respectively in brief 100 μl of phage suspension were treated with either ag or cu or both the concentrations used were approximately 20 μm of ag and 3 mm cu the suspension was incubated as mentioned above but in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes prior to tem grid preparation phix 174 sample buffer was exchanged for milliq by centrifugation 21 000 g 50 min 4 c a second centrifugation step was applied to further wash the sample and the supernatant was discarded for ms2 and phix 174 a 10 μl of the sample was incubated for 5 min on a copper mesh carbon type b 400 mesh ted pella the excess liquid was extracted using filter paper and the sample was stained using 2 uranyl acetate for 30 s imaging was repeated twice for each sample to ensure reproducibility additional information and images are provided in supplementary information 3 results 3 1 effect of ph on metal free controls to evaluate the stability of phix 174 ssdna and ms2 ssrna under experimental conditions metal free controls were sampled and analysed as metal samples concentrations of phix 174 fig 1 a were stable during the 6 h testing period at each tested ph kobs similar p 0 05 to slope zero same was observed for ms2 at ph 7 at ph 6 ms2 metal free control decayed over 6 h with kobs 0 22 0 01 h 1 significantly different from zero slope p 0 0001 to properly evaluate the inactivation caused by metals at ph 6 ms2 inactivation results were corrected to account for the observed decay in the control experiments the correction was applied by calculating log removal values lrv as log10 nt nc where nt is the phage concentration of test condition at time t and nc is the phage concentration of control condition also at time t kobs was calculated as the slope of ln nt nc 3 2 metal ions complexation the concentration of dissolved cu2 and ag was measured and compared against the modelling results of cheaqs next chemical software the concentration of ionic dissolved or solid metal ions is expressed as a percentage of the total experimental concentration 4 6 μm 0 5 mg l for ag and 78 7 μm 5 mg l for cu this provides more insight on ions availability free ionic form and complexation which might reflect on the antiviral activity of the metals changes in solution ph had a clear effect on speciation of cu and availability of cu2 ions cheaqs modelling results show a change in dissolved cu from 24 at ph 6 to 5 at ph 7 and 2 at ph 8 of which 16 1 and 0 2 are free ionic cu2 respectively fig 2 experimental measurement of dissolved cu yielded different percentages of dissolved cu but the trend did align with the model predictions measured dissolved cu at ph 6 7 and 8 were 43 6 and 1 respectively the higher percentage of experimentally measured dissolved cu2 could be due to the formation of copper particles smaller than the filter pore size 20 nm which are capable of passing the filter and being analysed as dissolved yet both methods model and experiment confirm a higher percentage of available dissolved cu2 at lower ph for ag changing ph had no effect on ag speciation supplementary figure s1 cheaqs predictions show 100 dissolved ag at all ph values of which free ionic ag changed from 100 at ph 6 t99 at ph 7 and 97 at ph 8 this slight drop was due to the formation of agh po4 figure s1 analytical measurements also showed 100 dissolved ag figure s1 the results for cu and ag in the combined solutions were identical to those of cu and ag alone 3 3 viral inactivation by cu antiviral efficiency of cu against phix 174 and ms2 was compared under acidic ph 6 neutral ph 7 and alkaline ph 8 conditions cu treatment caused no inactivation of phix 174 regardless of the ph kobs insignificant from control and from 0 slope p 0 05 fig 3 a inactivation kinetics of ms2 followed first order chick watson model fig 3b slowest kinetics were observed at ph 8 kobs 0 89 0 004 h 1 1 4 lrv over 6 h significantly different from kobs at ph 6 and 7 p 0 0001 however statistically similar p 0 29 inactivation kinetics at ph 6 kobs 0 79 0 06 h 1 2 2 lrv over 6 h and ph 7 kobs 0 90 0 02 h 1 2 4 lrv over 6 h were observed kobs values were significantly different p 0 0001 from metal free control slopes and zero slope validating that efficiency of cu in inactivating ms2 3 4 viral inactivation by ag ag showed a pronounced antiviral activity on both ms2 and phix 174 after 3 h of exposure to ag ions phix 174 reached the lowest concentration loq equivalent to 6 5 0 7 logs fig 4 a ph 8 ag inactivation of ms2 also reached loq 5 5 0 2 logs at ph 7 and 7 5 over 3 h fig 4b to avoid values at loq only the first hour was considered in evaluating inactivation kinetics fig 4c and d the slowest inactivation kinetics of ms2 was observed at ph 6 kobs 0 43 0 04 h 1 0 3 lrv over 1h kobs of ag treated ms2 and metal free control at ph 6 were similar p 0 94 hence ag was ineffective against ms2 at ph 6 meanwhile significantly higher p 0 05 kinetics were observed for phix 174 at ph 6 kobs 2 81 0 65 h 1 1 3 lrv over 1h at ph 7 inactivation rate constants were similar p 0 69 for ms2 kobs 4 99 0 48 and phix 174 kobs 4 09 0 57 the difference in kobs between ph 6 and 7 corresponds to an increase by a factor of 1 5 for phix 174 and by a factor 10 for ms2 kobs for phix 174 continued to increase with the same magnitude 1 5 times between ph 7 and 8 reaching 6 3 0 37 h 1 at ph 8 also kobs of ms2 doubled between ph 7 and 7 5 overall increased kobs by increasing ph was significant p 0 0001 and clear ph dependency of ms2 and phix 174 inactivation rates was observed inactivation kinetics followed chick watson model fig 4c and d except for ms2 at ph 8 the initial 10 min of interaction between ms2 and ag resulted in 3 5 lrv followed by a distinct tailing and much slower kinetics fig 4d 3 5 antiviral activity of cu and ag combined the combination of cu and ag was tested to evaluate possible synergies the experimentally observed lrvs of the cu and ag combination are compared to the mathematical sum of lrvs obtained from individual metal treatment reported as estimated the first hour results of ms2 are depicted in fig 5 results of phix 174 and the 6 h experiment are provided in supplementary material figure s2 and s3 for phix 174 observed and estimated kobs were similar p 0 7 figure s3 also observed and estimated kobs for ms2 at ph 6 were similar p 0 9 fig 5a ms2 observed inactivation kinetics at ph 7 kobs 35 95 9 4 h 1 2 7 lrv in 7 min was significantly higher p 0 05 than the estimated inactivation kinetics kobs 5 89 0 84 h 1 2 7 lrv over 1h similarly observed kobs was higher at ph 8 than the estimated rate constant 47 5 versus 16 h 1 this highlights a distinct synergetic effect of using cu and ag combined at ph 7 compared to their individual use however for the two conditions ph 7 and 8 inactivation of ms2 diverted from first order kinetics following initial drastic rapid inactivation observed inactivation of ms2 reached 3 logs after 10 min at ph 7 and 3 logs after 3 min at ph 8 both followed by subsequent tailing that decelerated the inactivation rates fig 5b ms2 diversion from first order kinetics tailing was initially observed using ag at ph 8 fig 4 which was reflected in the estimated lrvs of ms2 at ph 8 fig 5a in the three experimental settings where ms2 inactivation rapidly reached 3 logs in 10 min subsequent tailing was observed 3 6 morphological changes of ms2 and phix 174 tem imaging was used to examine morphological changes to the phage after metal treatment compared to the intact particles in metal free buffer the examination aimed to capture possible structural damage resulting from phage interaction with metals as shown in fig 6 a ms2 control particles can be seen with intact round shaped capsid the phix 174 control particles showed clear distinct capsid spikes fig 6b after exposure to cu ions ms2 particles appear with the same round morphology as the control but with darkened centre fig 6c this darkness is due to stain uranyl acetate penetration into the capsid this could be a result of defective capsid swathy et al 2014 or rna free capsid hooker et al 2004 the white non uniform particles appearing in the image were judged as chemical precipitates appearing on the grid the cu treated phix 174 fig 6d showed no difference from the control image except for debris or possible chemical precipitation similar to those in the ms2 image the ag treated ms2 particles however showed a clear difference in morphology fig 6e ms2 particles looked irregularly shaped losing their round intact structure and looking severely damaged phix 174 particles also appeared distinctly different after ag treatment fig 6f although the centre of the phix 174 capsid can still be recognized a clear loss of capsid spikes and change in particle size was observed finally no distinguishable additional structural damage was observed in ms2 samples containing both cu and ag but rather a combination of non uniform white precipitates and denatured particles as observed in the ag image image not shown 4 discussion 4 1 cu inactivation of phix 174 and ms2 cu inactivation of phix 174 and ms2 was tested to investigate the potential of cu ions as an antiviral agent against human enteric viruses in water using variable ph 6 8 speciation of cu was evaluated against inactivation rates achieved the increase in ph was associated with reduction in free ionic cu2 and dissolved cu regardless of cu2 availability phix 174 was not affected by cu treatment no inactivation was observed experimentally or change in phix 174 morphology in tem images sagripanti et al 1993 also reported no inactivation of phix 174 by cu treatment 15 mm however li and dennehy 2011 reported 3 5 lrv of phix 174 after adding 5 mm of cuso4 to the phix 174 lysate this difference cannot be explained by cu dose since the higher dose used by sagripanti et al 15 mm and the lower dose 78 7 μm used in our study did not cause phix 174 inactivation of note li and dennehy added cu to the lysate which contains organics while in our study inorganic buffer was used the interaction between organics and cu2 can lead to cu reduction to more toxic form cu 1 and possible production of h2o2 pham et al 2012 h2o2 interacts with dissolved oxygen producing ros which causes phix 174 inactivation by dna degradation lee et al 2016 ueda et al 1980 cu2 alone reportedly does not cause damage to the genomic dna unless ros were produced łȩ czkowska and vilar 2013 lemire et al 2013 sagripanti et al 1991 so the inactivation effect of cu on phix 174 reported in some studies is most probably caused by a more toxic form of cu or production of ros and cu2 alone does not cause inactivation of phix 174 regardless of its concentration and solution ph on the other hand ms2 was inactivated by cu at variable rates depending on the ph although cu concentration used in this study was higher than who recommendation of 2 mg l who 2017 lrvs achieved at same ph might not vary when who limit is applied since the reported ms2 inactivation rates at cu dose 1 mg l were similar due to solution saturation with copper armstrong et al 2017 nieto juarez et al 2010 according to nieto juarez et al 2010 inactivation of ms2 by cu is caused only by its dissolved fraction our analysis show that dissolved cu was higher at ph 6 than at ph 7 by 19 cheaqs data however the observed inactivation rates of ms2 were similar at ph 6 and 7 and lower at ph 8 in this situation the effect of ph on ms2 inactivation rates cannot be explained by cu2 solubility alone potentially the presence of ms2 in solution can influence the speciation of cu2 a study by badetti et al 2019 found that amino acids can solubilize cu2 from cu nanoparticles to form soluble complexes with cu2 however the higher inactivation kinetics at ph 7 compared to ph 8 does not support this mechanism either and point more towards conformational or structural changes in the ms2 capsid it has been reported that at ph 6 to 8 most of the cu2 binds to histidine his amino acid in proteins barber zucker et al 2017 and a small fraction to cysteine cys amino acids minoshima et al 2016 according to barber zucker et al 2017 increasing ph from 6 to 7 and 7 to 8 enhanced cu2 interaction with his by 20 and 1 but reduced cu2 interaction with cysteine cys amino acid by 2 and 1 respectively so it is likely that while ph 6 favoured cu2 dissolution ph 7 favoured the interaction between cu2 and his resulting in a similar inactivation rates as observed in our study the lower rates at ph 8 can be attributable to further loss of available cu2 which is not compensated by an increase of cu2 interaction with his the images of ms2 cu treated particles showed preservation of the circular capsid morphology with a dark centre which could be an artificial effect from the uranyl salts used as negative stain wan et al 2000 or a result of defective capsid protein swathy et al 2014 if cu caused only conformational change such as coordinating with amino acids it would not be visible under tem making the artificial interpretation more likely however the exact structure damage cannot be confirmed based on the images only so other possibilities cannot be excluded 4 2 ag inactivation of ms2 and phix 174 the results show that ag is a potent antiviral agent against both ms2 and phix 174 ag inactivation rates followed first order chick watson kinetics except for ms2 at ph 8 where tailing was observed viruses tailing has been commonly explained by aggregation of virus particles induced by solution ph close to virus isoelectric point virus type salt concentrations bacterial debris organic matter type or concentration of disinfectant gerba and betancourt 2017 the purification of ms2 stock as described in section 2 2 should remove bacterial debris organics and significantly reduce aggregation dika et al 2013 since the same ms2 stock inorganic buffer pb 1 mm and ag concentration were used in experiments where tailing was not observed it is unlikely that aggregation was the cause of observed tailing while the exact reason behind observed tailing remains unknown it is not determinative in evaluating ag antiviral efficiency since it is confined to only one condition ms2 ph 8 inactivation rates by ag were ph dependant for ms2 and phix 174 as kobs increased with increasing ph since ag was available in its ionic free form ag regardless of ph the observed dependency cannot be explained by ag speciation similar ph dependency of inactivation kinetics of bacteria by ag was reportedly associated with the increase in the negatively charged sites on the bacteria s membrane which enhanced the interaction with ag ions brown and anderson 1968 erickson et al 1998 lin et al 2002 pathak and gopal 2012 in viruses protonation of amino acids loss of h is responsible for the presence of negative sites in the protein capsid depending on its pka value since pka values differ per protein structure and the solution ph poole 2015 pka values of ms2 and phix 174 amino acids was predicted using propka 3 0 and provided in supplementary table s2 s3 the higher inactivation rates observed at ph 6 for phix 174 compared to ms2 can be attributed to the presence of cys residue with lower pka value in phix 14 spike protein g compared to the pka of cys in ms2 capsid protein see supplementary table s2 s3 although other amino acids had lower pka denaturation of cysteine has been linked to ag inactivation of viruses in literature clem gruen 1975 kim et al 2008 minoshima et al 2016 xiu et al 2011 zodrow et al 2009 tem images of ag treated phix showed a loss of the capsid spikes so we only accounted for pka values of cys in phix 174 spike protein g and cys pka in ms2 capsid protein the gradual increase of phix 174 inactivation rates with increasing ph is in agreement with the literature reported increase of the thiolates thiols ratio which enhances the interaction between ag and cys clem gruen 1975 poole 2015 meanwhile the sharp increase in ms2 kobs at ph 7 suggests involvement of both cys and rna in ag mediated inactivation mechanisms ag treated ms2 particles observed under tem support this hypothesis since the capsid is completely distorted finally similar to cu the concentration of ag used in this study was higher than who recommendations for drinking water 0 1 mg l so lower lrvs can be anticipated when applying ag in agreement with the who guidelines butkus et al 2004 4 3 inactivation of ms2 and phix 174 by cu and ag combined no synergy was observed between cu and ag for phix 174 inactivation the combination of cu and ag ions exhibited a synergistic effect on ms2 inactivation at ph 7 but not at ph 6 ag was only effective in disinfecting ms2 at ph 7 while cu has similar efficiency at ph 6 and 7 so it is likely that synergy is led by ag ions rather than cu and for synergy to occur both metals need to be individually effective in virus disinfection ag ions are strongly polarized compared to cu2 so when both ions are present in solution it is highly likely that ag would interact first lemire et al 2013 synergy of cu and ag in inactivating ms2 was also reported by yahya et al 1992 at ph 8 yet the reason behind it remains unclear chemical speciation of cu and ag was similar to the speciation of individual solutions also tem images provide no possible explanation for the synergy observed further research is needed to understand the reason behind cu and ag synergy moreover mechanistic understanding of the tailing kinetics can help evaluate if virus inactivation by metals could be self limiting under certain conditions although a promising potential of cu and ag antiviral efficiency is evident in this study evaluation of complexing factors such as natural organic matter is an important step for the complete picture of metal s antiviral efficiency and their potential application in drinking water treatment 5 conclusions our study has clarified essential aspects of evaluating antiviral activity of metals changing solution ph did not only affect the speciation of cu but also the sensitivity of viruses to disinfection free ionic ag strongly inactivated ssrna ms2 and ssdna phix 174 in neutral and alkaline conditions there is a strong synergistic effect of ag and cu for the inactivation of ms2 at ph 7 and higher no synergy was observed for phix 174 more work is needed to evaluate the efficiency of cu and ag in presence of organics to facilitate its further application as virucides for drinking water treatment although the concentrations used are higher than who recommendations the study highlights the potential of cu and ag as possible virus disinfectants in household drinking water

19993,highly variable flow has to be expected in decentralized greywater treatment and can lead to intermittent operation of the treatment system however few studies have addressed the influence of variable flow on the treatment performance of a biological activated carbon filter bac in this study we investigated the influence of intermittent flow using small scale bac columns which treat greywater as a second treatment step following a membrane bioreactor mbr three operating strategies to respond to variable flow were evaluated the activated carbon was characterized before and after the experiments in terms of biological activity and sorption capacity the performance of the bac filters was assessed based on total organic carbon toc removal toc fractions and growth potential no significant differences were observed between constant flow compared to on off operation with intermittent flow over the range of tested influent concentrations peaks with high toc during 24 h periods were attenuated by sorption and biological degradation adsorbed toc was released after switching back to normal concentrations for influent concentrations more than 5 times higher than usually observed the bac functioned as a temporary sink in line with these results the high influent toc values led to increased biological activity in the filter but did not influence the sorption capacity the experiments showed that intermittent flow does not negatively impact the performance of a bac and that there is no need for additional equalization tanks to buffer the variable flow for example in household scale greywater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords biologically activated carbon bac intermittent flow bioregeneration biofiltration greywater 1 introduction greywater reuse offers a great water saving potential and in the recent years interest in greywater treatment and reuse has increased national academies of sciences 2016 in this study we treat the greywater with a conventional membrane bioreactor mbr followed by a biological activated carbon filter bac mbrs are often installed as a first treatment step for greywater treatment friedler et al 2006 jefferson et al 2004 wu 2019 a bac after the membrane reduces the organics and helps to ensure safe water quality ziemba et al 2019 additionally a disinfection step for virus inactivation and removal of pathogens would be necessary to reach water that is hygienically safe with the chosen treatment configuration we combine physical and biological greywater treatment as suggested in literature li et al 2009 in drinking water treatment as well as in greywater treatment hygiene of the treated water needs to be ensured at all times benami et al 2016 schoen et al 2017 to ensure high quality not only after the treatment but also at the consumer biological stability of the treated water is important prest et al 2016 biological stability is therefore a requirement to reuse the greywater for higher level purposes that go beyond toilet flushing and irrigation like reuse for showers or washing machines assimilable organic carbon aoc is considered as a good indicator for growth potential and therefore also for biological stability chen et al 2018 effluent of an mbr contains mostly slowly biodegradable organic carbon where post treatment is needed to remove the high molecular weight fractions to approach biological stability schurer et al 2019 bac filters are effective in reducing the aoc in drinking water simpson 2008 and in greywater reuse ziemba et al 2019 one of the challenges with decentralized greywater treatment is the high variability both in terms of composition friedler and butler 1996 jefferson et al 2004 and in terms of flow rate fuentes et al 2018 penn et al 2012 the high variability of incoming greywater and the irregular reuse patterns lead to times without flow into the bac as a secondary treatment step and therefore periods with stagnating water additionally unexpectedly high influent concentrations into the greywater system or worse treatment performance of the mbr as the first treatment step can lead to increased carbon loadings for the bac bac filters can significantly attenuate peaks of biologically degradable compounds and therefore mitigate sudden changes in feed water quality ross et al 2019 tackaert et al 2019 biological degradation of organic carbon in a bac can be seen as a multistep process when the bulk concentration decreases due to biodegradation doc from the activated carbon desorbs and is available for further biodegradation simpson 2008 microorganisms survive starvation periods in the bac thanks to desorption of substrate hassan et al 1998 due to this desorption new adsorption sites are available for new doc entering the bac desorption of biodegradable carbon does increase the sorption capacity for non biodegradable carbon putz et al 2005 if the microorganisms are adapted to the concentrations in the bac the bioregeneration efficiency can be improved oh et al 2011 it is therefore hypothesized that bioregeneration could lead to increased sorption capacity during times of no flow in the bac filter the influence of different operating strategies like empty bed contact time ebct temperature media type and size on the performance of bac filters have been tested emelko et al 2006 kennedy et al 2015 moll et al 1999 mckie et al 2019 studied the influence of cyclical operation on the biological removal processes in a bac filter cyclical and continuously operated biofilters show similar removal for organics and an increased enzyme activity was measured for cyclical operation nemani et al 2018 showed a modest improvement of doc removal for cyclical operation and differences in bacterial communities between cyclically operated and constant flow operated filters while the biological degradation of pollutants during intermittent flow has been studied there is a lack of understanding how stagnation influences the sorption capacity of a bac so far no studies have been published about different strategies on how to optimally operate the bac filter during phases with stagnant water the objective of this study was to study the effect of intermittent flow and different strategies to deal with it on the effluent water quality of bac filters the hypothesis was that intermittent flow leads to higher bioregeneration and therefore higher sorption capacity compared to constant flow we assessed the differences between bac filter columns operated with constant and intermittent flow in buffering high influent toc concentrations for the different bac filter columns we assessed the influence of the operating conditions on the two main removal mechanisms sorption and biological degradation of organic carbon 2 material and methods 2 1 greywater treatment system the greywater treatment system is located in the water hub at nest nest is a modular research and office building in which the different wastewater streams grey yellow and blackwater are collected separately and treated in the water hub etter et al 2016 the light greywater from showers and washbasins collected in the building is treated by a two step process a membrane bioreactor mbr followed by a biological activated carbon bac filter the flow into this household scale greywater treatment is highly variable fig 1 the mbr with a median hydraulic retention time of 13 and 17 h in the first and second tank respectively cannot buffer all of the variable flow the on off operation of the filtration in the mbr leads to intermittent flow into the bac in this study we examined the effect of intermittent flow on the bac as a secondary treatment step 2 2 experimental setup small scale column studies were performed with four side by side bac filter columns 3 cm diameter the feed water was collected after a full scale mbr treating on average 413 l d of light greywater coming from showers and wash basins average composition of the mbr permeate over a 2 years period toc 5 2 mg l no3 n 9 7 mg l nh4 n 0 3 mg l po4 p 2 0 mg l a 50 l polyethylene tank was automatically emptied and refilled every one to two days with fresh mbr permeate the water was pumped from the feed tank to the four small scale columns the times of stagnation and flow were chosen in a way to represent the same statistical characteristics as typically observed for the inflow of the full scale bac fig 1 the stagnation times varied between 9 and 30 h and times with flow between 7 and 31 h the same sequence of flow and no flow was repeated every week the applied pattern is shown in supporting information s1 the experiments were conducted in two rounds first comparing different operating strategies starting with fresh gac experiment 1 and second focusing on the best strategy from the first round using already exhausted gac experiment 2 the exhausted gac was taken from the top 10 cm of the full scale bac at this time more than 30 000 empty bed volumes e b v v treated water v f i l t e r have been treated in the top part of the full scale bac 4 000 ebv if examined over the whole filter bed long term measurements in the full scale filter show that the top part has reached period c as defined in simpson 2008 data not shown the sorption capacity for this gac is significantly reduced compared to virgin gac supporting information s6 in experiment 1 the empty bed volumes per week were kept constant while for experiment 2 the empty bed contact time ebct was kept constant for all columns table 1 summarizes the hydraulic conditions in the columns for the two experiments the hydraulic conditions are representing the conditions we have in the top part of the full scale bac operated for greywater treatment in the water hub 2 2 1 experiment 1 small scale columns with 4 different operating strategies the filtration media for all four columns was fresh gac chemviron f 400 all columns had a filter height of 10 cm the filtration rate was chosen such that the weekly loading for all columns was equal three different operating strategies during times with no flow were tested i a minimum water head was maintained on top of the filter bed submerged intermittent ii the effluent was recirculated through the column during no influent to maintain constant hydraulic conditions recirculation intermittent and iii the filter bed was drained when there was no influent dry intermittent a column with continuous inflow was operated for comparison the columns with intermittent flow had flow during 50 of the time water samples were collected twice a week in the feed tank and in the effluent of all four columns the columns were operated over 56 days which corresponds to around 5000 ebvs 2 2 2 experiment 2 small scale columns with 2 different operating strategies 2 2 2 1 normal influent concentrations the filtration media for all four columns was gac chemviron f 400 obtained from the top 10 cm of the full scale bac filter from the water hub at nest that was running for more than one year all four columns were operated with the same filtration rate and a filter bed height of 5 cm the columns with intermittent flow had flow during 50 of the time nonetheless all four columns should have received the same total toc loading at the time when the high influent experiment started therefore the columns with constant flow were taken into operation when the columns with intermittent flow had already treated 860 ebv the gac for all columns was sampled at the same day and then stored in the dark at 4 c for the columns being started later every filling of the feed tank with mbr permeate was sampled for toc with this measurements the toc load the columns received was calculated to make sure all four columns receive the same total toc load over time additionally water samples were collected in the effluent of all four columns at the time when all four columns had received the same toc loading the experiment with high influent concentration was started and columns b and d were analyzed for sorption capacity and biological activity 2 2 2 2 high influent concentrations the effect of high influent loading was tested on two columns both with the same previous loading one operated with intermittent flow the other with constant flow to increase the influent toc concentration 10 l of raw greywater were sampled filtered through a 0 45 μm filter satorius cellulose nitrate filter and stored at 4 c until use with the filtered raw greywater a failure of biological toc degradation in the mbr was mimicked the influent for the columns was kept at high concentration for 24 h and was afterwards switched back to mbr permeate the influent concentration was increased to 20 40 and 70 mg l toc 2 3 gac characterization 2 3 1 quantification of biomass on gac the biomass was quantified similar as described in velten et al 2007 in short 1 g wet weight of gac particles were transferred in a muffled glass vial with 10 ml of 0 2 μm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water the sample was sonicated for 3 min bandelin sonorex 320 w and 35 khz 9 ml supernatant was collected in a separate muffled glass vial and the sample was refilled with 9 ml of 0 2 μm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water this step was repeated in total three times to recover more than 98 of the atp the collected supernatant was vortexed and 0 5 ml of the sample were incubated at 38 c for at least 4 min 100 μl of sample together with 100 μl of bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation madison wi usa were measured for relative light units rlu and converted to atp concentrations using a calibration curve supporting information s4 2 3 2 sorption capacity methylene blue fluka 66720 99 was used as a competing adsorbent to characterize the sorption capacity previous experiments with gac from the full scale bac filter showed that the adsorption of methylene blue is sensitive to the remaining sorption capacity on the gac supporting information s6 1 g of gac wet weight was added to 500 ml methylene blue solution concentration 400 mg l in a clean 1 l schott bottle the bottles with the samples were shaken with an overhead shaker for 3 d at room temperature samples at the beginning and after 3 d were analyzed for methylene blue the decrease in methylene blue over time per added mass of gac was used to characterize the sorption capacity sorption capacity was determined before experiment 2 started and then before and after high influent concentrations 2 4 growth potential growth potential measurements were based on the work of hammes and egli 2005 and prest et al 2016 in short 20 ml of 0 2 μm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd water sample was inoculated with 20 μl unfiltered sample as inoculum and incubated and agitated at room temperature 22 1 c for 5 d all glassware was muffled at 450 c for 4 h prior to use afterwards the samples were analyzed for total cell counts tcc using sybr green i stain thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa and a flow cytometer cytoflex beckman coulter brea california usa with 60 s reads on 60 μl samples the measured cell counts were not converted by a constant factor to aoc values but reported directly as growth potential 2 5 chemical analyses toc was measured

switzerland ammonium was measured with hach lange kits lck 304 hach loveland colorado usa methylene blue was measured with a spectrophotometer hach dr 3800 at 668 nm 2 5 1 lc ocd after in line

al 2011 a phosphate buffer was used as the eluent 24 mm ph 6 6 and the flow rate was set at 1 ml min all glassware was muffled at 450 c for 4 h 2 6 data analysis the different operation strategies were analyzed for differences with anova ibm spss statistics 24 the data set from experiment 2 was divided into two data sets data during normal influent conditions and data during elevated influent concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 different operating strategies experiment 1 in experiment 1 four lab scale bac filters were operated side by side with different operating conditions and toc was monitored fig 2 three strategies in response to times with no flow due to the intermittent regime were evaluated and compared to a bac with constant influent flow high toc removal was observed independently of the operating strategy the average influent concentration during the experimental period of 3 7 mg l toc was reduced to average toc effluent values of 0 7 mg l for the column with constant water head to 1 1 mg l toc for the column with recirculated flow and the one running dry during no flow and to 0 9 mg l toc for the column with constant inflow comparing the three different intermittent flow strategies one can see that the bac filter that was always submerged showed the best toc removal performance but differences between the filters were not significant p 0 06 the columns were run for around 5000 ebv a comparison of the removal after 5000 ebvs with literature shows good removal even tough in this experiment the influent toc was higher than in literature gibert et al 2013 han et al 2013 velten et al 2011b the filter that was dry during no flow showed negative removal right after the flow started again two samples this could for example be caused due to washout of particles caused by the rapid start up colton et al 1996 neither for the fresh gac at the beginning of the experiment nor for the more exhausted gac towards the end of the experiment the differences in toc removal between the columns were significant toc values over time are shown in supporting information s2 the experiment showed that more complicated operating strategies like recirculation of the effluent did not improve the removal performance based on these results constant flow was compared to submerged intermittent flow in experiment 2 in more detail for all four bac filters the atp at the end of the experiment was highest on top of the filter ranging from 3 5 10 6 gatp ggac to 8 8 10 6 gatp ggac both as was expected based on literature mckie et al 2019 velten et al 2011a atp results shown in supporting information s5 the lowest atp concentration in the top section was measured for the filter that was dry during times of no inflow for the other three filters the atp values on the top of the filter bed were close to each other from 2 to 10 cm depth of the filter bed all four columns showed very similar atp values from these values it can be concluded that biomass established on all four columns 3 2 toc removal during normal influent experiment 2 even though experiment 1 showed no significant differences between the different operating strategies the submerged regime performed slightly better therefore in experiment 2 two submerged columns with intermittent flow were compared to two columns receiving constant influent flow in more detail all columns received mbr permeate as influent columns c and d operated with constant flow were started 15 days later than columns a and b operated with intermittent flow operation was synchronized to achieve the same toc loading for all columns by the end of the experimental period fig 3 the observed overall effluent loading was very similar for all four columns regardless of the difference in operation the effluent load over the time with normal influent concentration was 225 and 208 mg toc for the columns with intermittent flow for the columns with constant flow the effluent load was 240 and 233 mg toc there are no significant differences between the effluent water quality in terms of toc for the four different columns p 0 847 supporting information s2 for toc growth potential and toc fractions over time these results are in agreement with the results of nemani et al 2018 and mckie et al 2019 who showed that the ebct is more relevant for the pollutant removal than the operation strategy in experiment 2 ebct was the same for intermittent columns a and b and constant columns c and d flow during times of filtration table 1 in addition to looking at the overall removal it is important to assess how the different bac filters react to varying influent toc for decentralized greywater treatment systems the toc concentrations in the raw greywater vary due to user behavior in the building friedler 2004 the bac is used as post treatment after the mbr and therefore the toc variations in the influent of the bac are caused both by variable concentrations in the raw greywater and variable removal performance in the preceding mbr during the experimental period the influent toc concentrations were on average 3 7 mg l varying between 2 4 mg l and 7 1 mg l the toc removed in the bac during the same period was on average 1 0 mg l varying between 0 2 mg l and 2 6 mg l all four columns removed more toc for higher influent toc concentrations fig 4 none of the columns performed superior compared to the others in buffering high toc influents the toc removal was further assessed by analyzing the removal performance in terms of growth potential and the different weight fractions of the organic carbon determined with sec figure 5 all four columns removed similar fraction of the overall toc on average 27 31 24 and 27 for columns a b c and d respectively from fig 5 it can be seen that the removal performance varied between less than 10 to nearly 50 with around 80 of the values between 20 and 40 removal the removal of growth potential was similar for all four columns varying between 55 and 86 removal fig 5 on average between 16 and 33 of the growth potential was removed in the bac filters for biopolymers no significant removal building blocks 20 30 removal and low molecular weight lmw organics around 50 removal both intermittent and constant flow show very similar results these results are in the range previously reported for bac filters gibert et al 2013 velten et al 2011b compared to experiment 1 with fresh gac the toc removal was lower in experiment 2 with the exhausted gac from the full scale bac these results indicate that sorption still played a role at the end of experiment 1 leading to the better removal performance literature reports very little aoc removal for filters with similar amount of treated bed volumes velten et al 2011a in this work we do not report aoc but the removal of growth potential that can be used as a comparable indicator as aoc since they are linked by a conversion factor there is a significant difference between the columns with intermittent and constant flow for the removal of the humic substances the low removal for the intermittent flow corresponds with values from previous research done chen et al 2016 gibert et al 2013 velten et al 2011b the removal of humic substances on average nearly 80 for the columns with constant flow is unexpectedly high humic substances are known to adsorb on gac velten et al 2011b humic substances are not easily biodegradable but are still biodegraded mainly if there is no easily biodegradable substrate available volk et al 1997 it is not clear if higher biodegradation or adsorption caused the significant difference in the removal of the humic substances in this experiment because the humic substances make on average only 25 of the influent toc the difference in removal of humic substances does not show in the toc values overall the removal performance of the different fractions is little influenced by the change of operating conditions 3 3 toc removal during high influent experiment 2 challenging the bac columns with high influent toc concentrations is interesting from two points of view firstly it is of practical value to observe if and how fast the filters can recover secondly the response to the high influent can give an indication about the relevance of sorption and biological degradation high influent toc concentrations of 20 40 and 70 mg l compared to an average normal influent toc of 3 7 mg l were fed to the bac columns for periods of 24 h each time during high influent concentrations both columns a and c received constant flow while between high influent periods there were periods with stagnating water in column a the removal of toc growth potential and weight fractions of the toc were measured over time during the experiment with elevated influent toc concentrations this data allows to have a closer look at the processes occurring in the bac filter fig 6 the results for intermittent flow and constant flow are very similar both for the growth potential as well as for most of the different toc fractions the only exception with significant differences are the humic substances compared to periods with normal influent the removal of the high molecular weight organics such as biopolymers and humic substances is lower however for these compounds the dynamics of the influent concentrations do not show in the effluent in contrast the growth potential and the low molecular weight organics show a delayed response with leaking to the influent dynamics the assimilable carbon measured with the growth potential and lmw organic carbon leak out of the column after the influent is set again to normal influent concentrations during this period higher concentrations of lmw organics are measured in the effluent than in the influent lmw organic carbon can represent the metabolic products of microorganisms living on the gac surfaces velten et al 2011b one possible explanation is that increased biological activity during high influent leads to higher metabolic activity in the bac this rapid increase in metabolic activity leads to the increased concentrations in low molecular weight organics the influent toc consist on average of 45 low molecular weight organics sd 16 so this delayed response to the high influent should not be neglected typical chromatograms are shown in supporting information s3 lmw organics do not adsorb so well and are mostly removed by biodegradation matilainen et al 2006 velten et al 2011b this highlights the importance of biological degradation for the overall toc removal because the influent toc consists to 45 of lmw organics as for the normal influent conditions the toc removal in terms of overall loading is very similar for intermittent and constant flow fig 7 during influent toc concentrations of 20 mg l a total load of 89 mg was fed to the columns both columns previously operated with intermittent or constant flow removed 52 mg of toc 58 of the influent load leaking is calculated for the 24 h after switching back to normal influent as the integrated difference between the effluent and the influent toc over 24 h only 0 7 respectively 1 1 mg of toc leaked out of the bac this indicates that the bac filters can handle influent concentrations up to 20 mg l very well for influent concentrations of 40 and 70 mg l toc the effluent concentrations were higher than the influent for a while after switching back to normal influent concentrations fig 6 for influent concentrations of 40 mg l the effluent concentrations of both columns are below the influent concentrations again after 24 h which equals to more than 100 ebvs for 70 mg l influent toc the effluent concentrations are below the influent after 24 h for the intermittent flow and after 48 h for constant flow the higher the influent load the higher the removed load for 40 and 70 mg l influent toc 34 and 37 of the influent loading are long term removed in the bac calculated as removed leaked toc fig 6 this removal indicates that toc is biologically degraded sakoda et al 1996 bourneuf et al 2016 evaluated the response of peak loading and observed only attenuation of peaks but no long term removal indicating the gac acting as a temporary sink in this study some desorption is observed but a considerable amount of toc is removed for long term therefore this data indicates some sorption desorption for the high influent but biological degradation as the main removal mechanism 3 4 characterization of gac experiment 2 3 4 1 biomass on gac atp concentrations were measured before the operation of the columns started and after the experiments at three different heights over the filter bed to characterize the biological activity fig 8 before starting the operation of the columns the atp on the gac was uniform over the filter bed already after 35 days and 1350 and 1150 ebv for columns b and d respectively a clear gradient over the filter bed is visible for normal influent toc concentrations for both intermittent and constant flow the highest atp concentrations are measured at the top of the filter bed and the lowest at the bottom after the normal influent the atp on the column with intermittent flow b is higher than for the column with constant flow d the atp content increased significantly after the high influent for both intermittent and continuous flow columns a and c generally the measured atp concentrations are high compared to values reported in literature for drinking water biofilters 102 103 ng atp cm3 media corresponds to around 10 7 to 10 6 g atp g gac are reported as typical atp concentrations but the reported values going up to nearly 2 104 ng atp cm3 pharand et al 2014 atp concentrations increase with influent toc concentrations the values reported by pharand et al 2014 were for toc concentrations up to 6 mg l so that relatively high atp concentration were to be expected for bac columns receiving mbr effluent the increased atp concentration after the high influent toc indicates additional biological activity due to the high toc concentrations velten et al 2007 and therefore increased biological degradation of the additional toc the atp and toc removal data shows that the biological activity and the biological degradation adapts very rapidly to the increased influent toc and that a relevant portion of the extra load was thereby degraded 3 4 2 sorption capacity sorption is the second important removal mechanism in a bac filter besides biodegradation the sorption capacity was characterized with methylene blue before operation of the columns and after the experiments fig 9 different from the biological activity no gradient over the filter column is observed for the sorption capacity the sorption capacity is lower compared to virgin gac 217 mg ggac for all four columns no changes of the sorption capacity are observed for different sampling times column a vs b and c vs d in comparison in the full scale bac a change of sorption capacity over the filter bed was observed data from full scale bac in supporting information the comparison of the column with intermittent and constant flow after normal influent toc concentrations columns b and d shows no relevant differences in sorption capacity no difference in sorption capacity indicates no significant influence of bioregeneration during the operation of these columns the high influent concentrations columns a and c compared with b and d did not significantly influence the sorption capacity indicating that also for high influent biological degradation is the main removal mechanism these results are in line with the results presented in previous sections showing that not as much toc leaks as entered in the bac intermittent flow and constant flow bac show the same sorption capacity after the experiments and same attenuation of peaks during high influent toc these results indicate that no significant bioregeneration of the gac happens during times of no flow 3 5 practical relevance for the application in decentralized greywater treatment treatment processes need to be sufficiently robust to provide good quality effluent even with highly variable influent concentrations and load furthermore these systems should be as simple as possible in operation and maintenance a system that can deal with this variability without intervention of humans is therefore needed our comparison of different operating strategies showed that a filter that is constantly submerged in water is therefore the most suitable solution both in terms of operation and effluent water quality in the bac columns the biological activity adapted rapidly to high influent toc with an increase in the biological degradation rate if the influent is extremely high more than 10 times higher than normal some time is needed until the system recovered and previous treatment performance is reached this recovery time is longer for biological stability than for overall toc removal therefore operators of such systems should be careful when they assess the effluent water quality solely on toc such high influent concentrations can be also of relevance for drinking water treatment for example when a treatment step breaks ross et al 2019 some guidelines for decentralized greywater treatment suggest equalization tanks to buffer the load and increase the stability of the treatment system sharvelle et al 2017 we showed that bac filter can effectively buffer influent loadings and that the effluent water quality is not worse because of intermittent flow our study therefore showed that for the chosen treatment configuration no extra equalization tanks are needed the conducted experiments with small scale columns allow to draw conclusions for full scale systems that have an established biological activity and no long term sorption capacity left the results should not be applied to activated carbon filters where sorption is the main removal mechanism 4 conclusions the main conclusions from this work are building scale greywater treatment is characterized by variable loading and flow stable operation and good effluent quality in terms of organic carbon organic carbon fractions and growth potential is possible with such intermittent flow alternative operating strategies to counteract effects of intermittent flow in the bac did not result in significant improvement of performance therefore the simplest approach submerged intermittent with stagnant water on top of the filter bed is suggested there is no benefit of using additional buffer tanks for hydraulic buffering of the influent to the bac peak toc influent concentrations 5 20 times the normal influent toc were attenuated in the bac due to sorption and biological degradation overall toc was mostly biodegraded and even during high influent concentrations sorption played a minor role no differences in toc peak attenuation and sorption capacity were observed for different operating strategies these results indicate that bioregeneration of sorption capacity did not play a relevant role during intermittent flow

19993,highly variable flow has to be expected in decentralized greywater treatment and can lead to intermittent operation of the treatment system however few studies have addressed the influence of variable flow on the treatment performance of a biological activated carbon filter bac in this study we investigated the influence of intermittent flow using small scale bac columns which treat greywater as a second treatment step following a membrane bioreactor mbr three operating strategies to respond to variable flow were evaluated the activated carbon was characterized before and after the experiments in terms of biological activity and sorption capacity the performance of the bac filters was assessed based on total organic carbon toc removal toc fractions and growth potential no significant differences were observed between constant flow compared to on off operation with intermittent flow over the range of tested influent concentrations peaks with high toc during 24 h periods were attenuated by sorption and biological degradation adsorbed toc was released after switching back to normal concentrations for influent concentrations more than 5 times higher than usually observed the bac functioned as a temporary sink in line with these results the high influent toc values led to increased biological activity in the filter but did not influence the sorption capacity the experiments showed that intermittent flow does not negatively impact the performance of a bac and that there is no need for additional equalization tanks to buffer the variable flow for example in household scale greywater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords biologically activated carbon bac intermittent flow bioregeneration biofiltration greywater 1 introduction greywater reuse offers a great water saving potential and in the recent years interest in greywater treatment and reuse has increased national academies of sciences 2016 in this study we treat the greywater with a conventional membrane bioreactor mbr followed by a biological activated carbon filter bac mbrs are often installed as a first treatment step for greywater treatment friedler et al 2006 jefferson et al 2004 wu 2019 a bac after the membrane reduces the organics and helps to ensure safe water quality ziemba et al 2019 additionally a disinfection step for virus inactivation and removal of pathogens would be necessary to reach water that is hygienically safe with the chosen treatment configuration we combine physical and biological greywater treatment as suggested in literature li et al 2009 in drinking water treatment as well as in greywater treatment hygiene of the treated water needs to be ensured at all times benami et al 2016 schoen et al 2017 to ensure high quality not only after the treatment but also at the consumer biological stability of the treated water is important prest et al 2016 biological stability is therefore a requirement to reuse the greywater for higher level purposes that go beyond toilet flushing and irrigation like reuse for showers or washing machines assimilable organic carbon aoc is considered as a good indicator for growth potential and therefore also for biological stability chen et al 2018 effluent of an mbr contains mostly slowly biodegradable organic carbon where post treatment is needed to remove the high molecular weight fractions to approach biological stability schurer et al 2019 bac filters are effective in reducing the aoc in drinking water simpson 2008 and in greywater reuse ziemba et al 2019 one of the challenges with decentralized greywater treatment is the high variability both in terms of composition friedler and butler 1996 jefferson et al 2004 and in terms of flow rate fuentes et al 2018 penn et al 2012 the high variability of incoming greywater and the irregular reuse patterns lead to times without flow into the bac as a secondary treatment step and therefore periods with stagnating water additionally unexpectedly high influent concentrations into the greywater system or worse treatment performance of the mbr as the first treatment step can lead to increased carbon loadings for the bac bac filters can significantly attenuate peaks of biologically degradable compounds and therefore mitigate sudden changes in feed water quality ross et al 2019 tackaert et al 2019 biological degradation of organic carbon in a bac can be seen as a multistep process when the bulk concentration decreases due to biodegradation doc from the activated carbon desorbs and is available for further biodegradation simpson 2008 microorganisms survive starvation periods in the bac thanks to desorption of substrate hassan et al 1998 due to this desorption new adsorption sites are available for new doc entering the bac desorption of biodegradable carbon does increase the sorption capacity for non biodegradable carbon putz et al 2005 if the microorganisms are adapted to the concentrations in the bac the bioregeneration efficiency can be improved oh et al 2011 it is therefore hypothesized that bioregeneration could lead to increased sorption capacity during times of no flow in the bac filter the influence of different operating strategies like empty bed contact time ebct temperature media type and size on the performance of bac filters have been tested emelko et al 2006 kennedy et al 2015 moll et al 1999 mckie et al 2019 studied the influence of cyclical operation on the biological removal processes in a bac filter cyclical and continuously operated biofilters show similar removal for organics and an increased enzyme activity was measured for cyclical operation nemani et al 2018 showed a modest improvement of doc removal for cyclical operation and differences in bacterial communities between cyclically operated and constant flow operated filters while the biological degradation of pollutants during intermittent flow has been studied there is a lack of understanding how stagnation influences the sorption capacity of a bac so far no studies have been published about different strategies on how to optimally operate the bac filter during phases with stagnant water the objective of this study was to study the effect of intermittent flow and different strategies to deal with it on the effluent water quality of bac filters the hypothesis was that intermittent flow leads to higher bioregeneration and therefore higher sorption capacity compared to constant flow we assessed the differences between bac filter columns operated with constant and intermittent flow in buffering high influent toc concentrations for the different bac filter columns we assessed the influence of the operating conditions on the two main removal mechanisms sorption and biological degradation of organic carbon 2 material and methods 2 1 greywater treatment system the greywater treatment system is located in the water hub at nest nest is a modular research and office building in which the different wastewater streams grey yellow and blackwater are collected separately and treated in the water hub etter et al 2016 the light greywater from showers and washbasins collected in the building is treated by a two step process a membrane bioreactor mbr followed by a biological activated carbon bac filter the flow into this household scale greywater treatment is highly variable fig 1 the mbr with a median hydraulic retention time of 13 and 17 h in the first and second tank respectively cannot buffer all of the variable flow the on off operation of the filtration in the mbr leads to intermittent flow into the bac in this study we examined the effect of intermittent flow on the bac as a secondary treatment step 2 2 experimental setup small scale column studies were performed with four side by side bac filter columns 3 cm diameter the feed water was collected after a full scale mbr treating on average 413 l d of light greywater coming from showers and wash basins average composition of the mbr permeate over a 2 years period toc 5 2 mg l no3 n 9 7 mg l nh4 n 0 3 mg l po4 p 2 0 mg l a 50 l polyethylene tank was automatically emptied and refilled every one to two days with fresh mbr permeate the water was pumped from the feed tank to the four small scale columns the times of stagnation and flow were chosen in a way to represent the same statistical characteristics as typically observed for the inflow of the full scale bac fig 1 the stagnation times varied between 9 and 30 h and times with flow between 7 and 31 h the same sequence of flow and no flow was repeated every week the applied pattern is shown in supporting information s1 the experiments were conducted in two rounds first comparing different operating strategies starting with fresh gac experiment 1 and second focusing on the best strategy from the first round using already exhausted gac experiment 2 the exhausted gac was taken from the top 10 cm of the full scale bac at this time more than 30 000 empty bed volumes e b v v treated water v f i l t e r have been treated in the top part of the full scale bac 4 000 ebv if examined over the whole filter bed long term measurements in the full scale filter show that the top part has reached period c as defined in simpson 2008 data not shown the sorption capacity for this gac is significantly reduced compared to virgin gac supporting information s6 in experiment 1 the empty bed volumes per week were kept constant while for experiment 2 the empty bed contact time ebct was kept constant for all columns table 1 summarizes the hydraulic conditions in the columns for the two experiments the hydraulic conditions are representing the conditions we have in the top part of the full scale bac operated for greywater treatment in the water hub 2 2 1 experiment 1 small scale columns with 4 different operating strategies the filtration media for all four columns was fresh gac chemviron f 400 all columns had a filter height of 10 cm the filtration rate was chosen such that the weekly loading for all columns was equal three different operating strategies during times with no flow were tested i a minimum water head was maintained on top of the filter bed submerged intermittent ii the effluent was recirculated through the column during no influent to maintain constant hydraulic conditions recirculation intermittent and iii the filter bed was drained when there was no influent dry intermittent a column with continuous inflow was operated for comparison the columns with intermittent flow had flow during 50 of the time water samples were collected twice a week in the feed tank and in the effluent of all four columns the columns were operated over 56 days which corresponds to around 5000 ebvs 2 2 2 experiment 2 small scale columns with 2 different operating strategies 2 2 2 1 normal influent concentrations the filtration media for all four columns was gac chemviron f 400 obtained from the top 10 cm of the full scale bac filter from the water hub at nest that was running for more than one year all four columns were operated with the same filtration rate and a filter bed height of 5 cm the columns with intermittent flow had flow during 50 of the time nonetheless all four columns should have received the same total toc loading at the time when the high influent experiment started therefore the columns with constant flow were taken into operation when the columns with intermittent flow had already treated 860 ebv the gac for all columns was sampled at the same day and then stored in the dark at 4 c for the columns being started later every filling of the feed tank with mbr permeate was sampled for toc with this measurements the toc load the columns received was calculated to make sure all four columns receive the same total toc load over time additionally water samples were collected in the effluent of all four columns at the time when all four columns had received the same toc loading the experiment with high influent concentration was started and columns b and d were analyzed for sorption capacity and biological activity 2 2 2 2 high influent concentrations the effect of high influent loading was tested on two columns both with the same previous loading one operated with intermittent flow the other with constant flow to increase the influent toc concentration 10 l of raw greywater were sampled filtered through a 0 45 μm filter satorius cellulose nitrate filter and stored at 4 c until use with the filtered raw greywater a failure of biological toc degradation in the mbr was mimicked the influent for the columns was kept at high concentration for 24 h and was afterwards switched back to mbr permeate the influent concentration was increased to 20 40 and 70 mg l toc 2 3 gac characterization 2 3 1 quantification of biomass on gac the biomass was quantified similar as described in velten et al 2007 in short 1 g wet weight of gac particles were transferred in a muffled glass vial with 10 ml of 0 2 μm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water the sample was sonicated for 3 min bandelin sonorex 320 w and 35 khz 9 ml supernatant was collected in a separate muffled glass vial and the sample was refilled with 9 ml of 0 2 μm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water this step was repeated in total three times to recover more than 98 of the atp the collected supernatant was vortexed and 0 5 ml of the sample were incubated at 38 c for at least 4 min 100 μl of sample together with 100 μl of bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation madison wi usa were measured for relative light units rlu and converted to atp concentrations using a calibration curve supporting information s4 2 3 2 sorption capacity methylene blue fluka 66720 99 was used as a competing adsorbent to characterize the sorption capacity previous experiments with gac from the full scale bac filter showed that the adsorption of methylene blue is sensitive to the remaining sorption capacity on the gac supporting information s6 1 g of gac wet weight was added to 500 ml methylene blue solution concentration 400 mg l in a clean 1 l schott bottle the bottles with the samples were shaken with an overhead shaker for 3 d at room temperature samples at the beginning and after 3 d were analyzed for methylene blue the decrease in methylene blue over time per added mass of gac was used to characterize the sorption capacity sorption capacity was determined before experiment 2 started and then before and after high influent concentrations 2 4 growth potential growth potential measurements were based on the work of hammes and egli 2005 and prest et al 2016 in short 20 ml of 0 2 μm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd water sample was inoculated with 20 μl unfiltered sample as inoculum and incubated and agitated at room temperature 22 1 c for 5 d all glassware was muffled at 450 c for 4 h prior to use afterwards the samples were analyzed for total cell counts tcc using sybr green i stain thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa and a flow cytometer cytoflex beckman coulter brea california usa with 60 s reads on 60 μl samples the measured cell counts were not converted by a constant factor to aoc values but reported directly as growth potential 2 5 chemical analyses toc was measured

switzerland ammonium was measured with hach lange kits lck 304 hach loveland colorado usa methylene blue was measured with a spectrophotometer hach dr 3800 at 668 nm 2 5 1 lc ocd after in line

al 2011 a phosphate buffer was used as the eluent 24 mm ph 6 6 and the flow rate was set at 1 ml min all glassware was muffled at 450 c for 4 h 2 6 data analysis the different operation strategies were analyzed for differences with anova ibm spss statistics 24 the data set from experiment 2 was divided into two data sets data during normal influent conditions and data during elevated influent concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 different operating strategies experiment 1 in experiment 1 four lab scale bac filters were operated side by side with different operating conditions and toc was monitored fig 2 three strategies in response to times with no flow due to the intermittent regime were evaluated and compared to a bac with constant influent flow high toc removal was observed independently of the operating strategy the average influent concentration during the experimental period of 3 7 mg l toc was reduced to average toc effluent values of 0 7 mg l for the column with constant water head to 1 1 mg l toc for the column with recirculated flow and the one running dry during no flow and to 0 9 mg l toc for the column with constant inflow comparing the three different intermittent flow strategies one can see that the bac filter that was always submerged showed the best toc removal performance but differences between the filters were not significant p 0 06 the columns were run for around 5000 ebv a comparison of the removal after 5000 ebvs with literature shows good removal even tough in this experiment the influent toc was higher than in literature gibert et al 2013 han et al 2013 velten et al 2011b the filter that was dry during no flow showed negative removal right after the flow started again two samples this could for example be caused due to washout of particles caused by the rapid start up colton et al 1996 neither for the fresh gac at the beginning of the experiment nor for the more exhausted gac towards the end of the experiment the differences in toc removal between the columns were significant toc values over time are shown in supporting information s2 the experiment showed that more complicated operating strategies like recirculation of the effluent did not improve the removal performance based on these results constant flow was compared to submerged intermittent flow in experiment 2 in more detail for all four bac filters the atp at the end of the experiment was highest on top of the filter ranging from 3 5 10 6 gatp ggac to 8 8 10 6 gatp ggac both as was expected based on literature mckie et al 2019 velten et al 2011a atp results shown in supporting information s5 the lowest atp concentration in the top section was measured for the filter that was dry during times of no inflow for the other three filters the atp values on the top of the filter bed were close to each other from 2 to 10 cm depth of the filter bed all four columns showed very similar atp values from these values it can be concluded that biomass established on all four columns 3 2 toc removal during normal influent experiment 2 even though experiment 1 showed no significant differences between the different operating strategies the submerged regime performed slightly better therefore in experiment 2 two submerged columns with intermittent flow were compared to two columns receiving constant influent flow in more detail all columns received mbr permeate as influent columns c and d operated with constant flow were started 15 days later than columns a and b operated with intermittent flow operation was synchronized to achieve the same toc loading for all columns by the end of the experimental period fig 3 the observed overall effluent loading was very similar for all four columns regardless of the difference in operation the effluent load over the time with normal influent concentration was 225 and 208 mg toc for the columns with intermittent flow for the columns with constant flow the effluent load was 240 and 233 mg toc there are no significant differences between the effluent water quality in terms of toc for the four different columns p 0 847 supporting information s2 for toc growth potential and toc fractions over time these results are in agreement with the results of nemani et al 2018 and mckie et al 2019 who showed that the ebct is more relevant for the pollutant removal than the operation strategy in experiment 2 ebct was the same for intermittent columns a and b and constant columns c and d flow during times of filtration table 1 in addition to looking at the overall removal it is important to assess how the different bac filters react to varying influent toc for decentralized greywater treatment systems the toc concentrations in the raw greywater vary due to user behavior in the building friedler 2004 the bac is used as post treatment after the mbr and therefore the toc variations in the influent of the bac are caused both by variable concentrations in the raw greywater and variable removal performance in the preceding mbr during the experimental period the influent toc concentrations were on average 3 7 mg l varying between 2 4 mg l and 7 1 mg l the toc removed in the bac during the same period was on average 1 0 mg l varying between 0 2 mg l and 2 6 mg l all four columns removed more toc for higher influent toc concentrations fig 4 none of the columns performed superior compared to the others in buffering high toc influents the toc removal was further assessed by analyzing the removal performance in terms of growth potential and the different weight fractions of the organic carbon determined with sec figure 5 all four columns removed similar fraction of the overall toc on average 27 31 24 and 27 for columns a b c and d respectively from fig 5 it can be seen that the removal performance varied between less than 10 to nearly 50 with around 80 of the values between 20 and 40 removal the removal of growth potential was similar for all four columns varying between 55 and 86 removal fig 5 on average between 16 and 33 of the growth potential was removed in the bac filters for biopolymers no significant removal building blocks 20 30 removal and low molecular weight lmw organics around 50 removal both intermittent and constant flow show very similar results these results are in the range previously reported for bac filters gibert et al 2013 velten et al 2011b compared to experiment 1 with fresh gac the toc removal was lower in experiment 2 with the exhausted gac from the full scale bac these results indicate that sorption still played a role at the end of experiment 1 leading to the better removal performance literature reports very little aoc removal for filters with similar amount of treated bed volumes velten et al 2011a in this work we do not report aoc but the removal of growth potential that can be used as a comparable indicator as aoc since they are linked by a conversion factor there is a significant difference between the columns with intermittent and constant flow for the removal of the humic substances the low removal for the intermittent flow corresponds with values from previous research done chen et al 2016 gibert et al 2013 velten et al 2011b the removal of humic substances on average nearly 80 for the columns with constant flow is unexpectedly high humic substances are known to adsorb on gac velten et al 2011b humic substances are not easily biodegradable but are still biodegraded mainly if there is no easily biodegradable substrate available volk et al 1997 it is not clear if higher biodegradation or adsorption caused the significant difference in the removal of the humic substances in this experiment because the humic substances make on average only 25 of the influent toc the difference in removal of humic substances does not show in the toc values overall the removal performance of the different fractions is little influenced by the change of operating conditions 3 3 toc removal during high influent experiment 2 challenging the bac columns with high influent toc concentrations is interesting from two points of view firstly it is of practical value to observe if and how fast the filters can recover secondly the response to the high influent can give an indication about the relevance of sorption and biological degradation high influent toc concentrations of 20 40 and 70 mg l compared to an average normal influent toc of 3 7 mg l were fed to the bac columns for periods of 24 h each time during high influent concentrations both columns a and c received constant flow while between high influent periods there were periods with stagnating water in column a the removal of toc growth potential and weight fractions of the toc were measured over time during the experiment with elevated influent toc concentrations this data allows to have a closer look at the processes occurring in the bac filter fig 6 the results for intermittent flow and constant flow are very similar both for the growth potential as well as for most of the different toc fractions the only exception with significant differences are the humic substances compared to periods with normal influent the removal of the high molecular weight organics such as biopolymers and humic substances is lower however for these compounds the dynamics of the influent concentrations do not show in the effluent in contrast the growth potential and the low molecular weight organics show a delayed response with leaking to the influent dynamics the assimilable carbon measured with the growth potential and lmw organic carbon leak out of the column after the influent is set again to normal influent concentrations during this period higher concentrations of lmw organics are measured in the effluent than in the influent lmw organic carbon can represent the metabolic products of microorganisms living on the gac surfaces velten et al 2011b one possible explanation is that increased biological activity during high influent leads to higher metabolic activity in the bac this rapid increase in metabolic activity leads to the increased concentrations in low molecular weight organics the influent toc consist on average of 45 low molecular weight organics sd 16 so this delayed response to the high influent should not be neglected typical chromatograms are shown in supporting information s3 lmw organics do not adsorb so well and are mostly removed by biodegradation matilainen et al 2006 velten et al 2011b this highlights the importance of biological degradation for the overall toc removal because the influent toc consists to 45 of lmw organics as for the normal influent conditions the toc removal in terms of overall loading is very similar for intermittent and constant flow fig 7 during influent toc concentrations of 20 mg l a total load of 89 mg was fed to the columns both columns previously operated with intermittent or constant flow removed 52 mg of toc 58 of the influent load leaking is calculated for the 24 h after switching back to normal influent as the integrated difference between the effluent and the influent toc over 24 h only 0 7 respectively 1 1 mg of toc leaked out of the bac this indicates that the bac filters can handle influent concentrations up to 20 mg l very well for influent concentrations of 40 and 70 mg l toc the effluent concentrations were higher than the influent for a while after switching back to normal influent concentrations fig 6 for influent concentrations of 40 mg l the effluent concentrations of both columns are below the influent concentrations again after 24 h which equals to more than 100 ebvs for 70 mg l influent toc the effluent concentrations are below the influent after 24 h for the intermittent flow and after 48 h for constant flow the higher the influent load the higher the removed load for 40 and 70 mg l influent toc 34 and 37 of the influent loading are long term removed in the bac calculated as removed leaked toc fig 6 this removal indicates that toc is biologically degraded sakoda et al 1996 bourneuf et al 2016 evaluated the response of peak loading and observed only attenuation of peaks but no long term removal indicating the gac acting as a temporary sink in this study some desorption is observed but a considerable amount of toc is removed for long term therefore this data indicates some sorption desorption for the high influent but biological degradation as the main removal mechanism 3 4 characterization of gac experiment 2 3 4 1 biomass on gac atp concentrations were measured before the operation of the columns started and after the experiments at three different heights over the filter bed to characterize the biological activity fig 8 before starting the operation of the columns the atp on the gac was uniform over the filter bed already after 35 days and 1350 and 1150 ebv for columns b and d respectively a clear gradient over the filter bed is visible for normal influent toc concentrations for both intermittent and constant flow the highest atp concentrations are measured at the top of the filter bed and the lowest at the bottom after the normal influent the atp on the column with intermittent flow b is higher than for the column with constant flow d the atp content increased significantly after the high influent for both intermittent and continuous flow columns a and c generally the measured atp concentrations are high compared to values reported in literature for drinking water biofilters 102 103 ng atp cm3 media corresponds to around 10 7 to 10 6 g atp g gac are reported as typical atp concentrations but the reported values going up to nearly 2 104 ng atp cm3 pharand et al 2014 atp concentrations increase with influent toc concentrations the values reported by pharand et al 2014 were for toc concentrations up to 6 mg l so that relatively high atp concentration were to be expected for bac columns receiving mbr effluent the increased atp concentration after the high influent toc indicates additional biological activity due to the high toc concentrations velten et al 2007 and therefore increased biological degradation of the additional toc the atp and toc removal data shows that the biological activity and the biological degradation adapts very rapidly to the increased influent toc and that a relevant portion of the extra load was thereby degraded 3 4 2 sorption capacity sorption is the second important removal mechanism in a bac filter besides biodegradation the sorption capacity was characterized with methylene blue before operation of the columns and after the experiments fig 9 different from the biological activity no gradient over the filter column is observed for the sorption capacity the sorption capacity is lower compared to virgin gac 217 mg ggac for all four columns no changes of the sorption capacity are observed for different sampling times column a vs b and c vs d in comparison in the full scale bac a change of sorption capacity over the filter bed was observed data from full scale bac in supporting information the comparison of the column with intermittent and constant flow after normal influent toc concentrations columns b and d shows no relevant differences in sorption capacity no difference in sorption capacity indicates no significant influence of bioregeneration during the operation of these columns the high influent concentrations columns a and c compared with b and d did not significantly influence the sorption capacity indicating that also for high influent biological degradation is the main removal mechanism these results are in line with the results presented in previous sections showing that not as much toc leaks as entered in the bac intermittent flow and constant flow bac show the same sorption capacity after the experiments and same attenuation of peaks during high influent toc these results indicate that no significant bioregeneration of the gac happens during times of no flow 3 5 practical relevance for the application in decentralized greywater treatment treatment processes need to be sufficiently robust to provide good quality effluent even with highly variable influent concentrations and load furthermore these systems should be as simple as possible in operation and maintenance a system that can deal with this variability without intervention of humans is therefore needed our comparison of different operating strategies showed that a filter that is constantly submerged in water is therefore the most suitable solution both in terms of operation and effluent water quality in the bac columns the biological activity adapted rapidly to high influent toc with an increase in the biological degradation rate if the influent is extremely high more than 10 times higher than normal some time is needed until the system recovered and previous treatment performance is reached this recovery time is longer for biological stability than for overall toc removal therefore operators of such systems should be careful when they assess the effluent water quality solely on toc such high influent concentrations can be also of relevance for drinking water treatment for example when a treatment step breaks ross et al 2019 some guidelines for decentralized greywater treatment suggest equalization tanks to buffer the load and increase the stability of the treatment system sharvelle et al 2017 we showed that bac filter can effectively buffer influent loadings and that the effluent water quality is not worse because of intermittent flow our study therefore showed that for the chosen treatment configuration no extra equalization tanks are needed the conducted experiments with small scale columns allow to draw conclusions for full scale systems that have an established biological activity and no long term sorption capacity left the results should not be applied to activated carbon filters where sorption is the main removal mechanism 4 conclusions the main conclusions from this work are building scale greywater treatment is characterized by variable loading and flow stable operation and good effluent quality in terms of organic carbon organic carbon fractions and growth potential is possible with such intermittent flow alternative operating strategies to counteract effects of intermittent flow in the bac did not result in significant improvement of performance therefore the simplest approach submerged intermittent with stagnant water on top of the filter bed is suggested there is no benefit of using additional buffer tanks for hydraulic buffering of the influent to the bac peak toc influent concentrations 5 20 times the normal influent toc were attenuated in the bac due to sorption and biological degradation overall toc was mostly biodegraded and even during high influent concentrations sorption played a minor role no differences in toc peak attenuation and sorption capacity were observed for different operating strategies these results indicate that bioregeneration of sorption capacity did not play a relevant role during intermittent flow

19994,a pathogenic escherichia coli e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 dose response model was set up for a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of the waterborne diseases associated with managed aquifer recharge mar practices in semiarid regions the mar facility at forcatella southern italy was selected for the qmra application the target counts of pathogens incidentally exposed to hosts by eating contaminated raw crops or while bathing at beaches of the coastal area were determined by applying the monte carlo markov chain mcmc bayesian method to the water sampling results the mcmc provided the most probable pathogen count reaching the target and allowed for the minimization of the number of water samplings and hence reducing the associated costs the sampling stations along the coast were positioned based on the results of a groundwater flow and pathogen transport model which highlighted the preferential flow pathways of the transported e coli in the fractured coastal aquifer qmra indicated tolerable 10 6 daly health risks for bathing at beaches and irrigation with wastewater with 0 4 infectious diseases per year 11 4 probability of occurrence associated with the reuse of reclaimed water via soil irrigation even though exceeding the e coli regulation limit of 10 cfu 100 ml by five times the results show negligible health risk and insignificant impacts on the coastal water quality due to pathogenic e coli in the wastewater used for mar however droughts and reclaimed water quality can be considered the main issues of mar practices in semiarid regions suggesting additional reclaimed water treatments and further stress tests via qmras by considering more persistent pathogens than e coli graphical abstract image 1 keywords reclaimed water quality managed aquifer recharge e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 dose infection model qmra 1 introduction currently managed aquifer recharge mar is used as an attractive water source recycling technology useful for both agriculture and industry productions and importantly also drinking water asano et al 2007 dillon et al 2008 moreover in coastal aquifers mar practices are also used to control the impact of seawater encroachments on groundwater quality climate change affects coastal areas leading to an increase in the sea level rise and more frequent droughts with subsequent water scarcity mar applied to the bedrock limestone coastal aquifers of the salento peninsula masciopinto et al 2011 provides an efficient dynamic barrier controlling seawater intrusion to the groundwater and recovering freshwater storage suitable for irrigation and drinking supplies in touristic coastal areas in semiarid regions accordingly sustainable and effective mar schemes have to maintain a good microbial chemical quality of the recycled water to protect human health from the potential presence of dissolved toxic compounds and suspended enteric pathogens gibson and schwab 2011 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra howard et al 2006 provides a quantitative estimate of the degree of safety the population exposed to the contamination derived from mar practices has toze et al 2010 as opposed to qualitative microbial risk assessment ayuso gabella et al 2011 although viruses and protozoa can better survive in the environment than bacteria suggesting the potential higher risk of viruses and protozoa to public health recent data collected by national and european surveillance agencies show an alarming increase of diseases from the ingestion of food contaminated by pathogenic escherichia coli e coli in particular the presence of e coli in reused irrigation water lapen 2019 kouamé et al 2017 has generally been considered as the main indicator of fecal water contamination in the last decade because of its significant impact on public health indeed the italian regulation lgs d 185 2003 for water reuse in irrigation limits the e coli count to 10 cfu 100 ml in at least 80 of monitored water samples where only one sample at an e coli count of 100 cfu ml is allowed while salmonella spp must be absent the european union eu proposal for a regulation of the minimum requirements for reclaimed water of class a used in irrigation eu commission 2018 suggests an e coli limit 10 cfu 100 ml in at least 90 of monitored water samples along with microbial limits for legionella 100 cfu 100 ml and intestinal nematodes helminth eggs 1 the eu limits are related to rawly consumed roots and crops of which the edible part is directly in contact with reclaimed water during the last 20 years specific e coli serotypes have led to cases of severe diseases with increasing incidence in europe during 2018 the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2020 recorded approximately 8161 cases of shiga toxin producing e coli stec infection also referred to as e coli vero toxin vtec in the eu with 73 of these cases recorded in italy these pathogenic e coli strains are associated with various symptoms ranging from mild gastrointestinal illness to severe disorders such as hemolytic uremic syndrome hus which can lead to acute renal failure and consequently death particularly in children in this study we aim to quantify the number of diseases caused by the pathogenic e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 ingested by hosts via raw crops i e vegetables and fruits where the edible part is directly in contact with effluent water from mar facilities in fact quantitative health risk assessments associated with waterborne infections at mar sites due to e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 have not been comprehensively investigated in the literature in contrast to foodborne infections pang et al 2017 franz et al 2010 moreover we estimate the quantitative health risk owing to the ingestion inhalation of seawater contaminated by pathogenic e coli in seasonal wastewater discharges that are frequent in coastal areas at bathing locations eregno et al 2016 ashbolt et al 2010 microbiological data collected during sampling and the results of stochastic forecasts were used to assess the quantitative health risk at a mar site on a coastal area such as the forcatella facility in the puglia region southern italy in this region because of the water scarcity exacerbated by global warming the puglia government has authorized the installation of 32 mar plants since 2016 these plants produce 128 ml day portoghese et al 2019 of reclaimed water for irrigation and managed groundwater recharge following the tertiary treatment of effluents derived from municipal wastewater treatment plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 the mar facility mar sites in coastal areas are usually in the vicinity of touristic beaches such as in the case of the forcatella mar facility the reclaimed water table 1 from the mar facility is mainly used for the irrigation of agricultural land with a remaining flowrate to control the seawater intrusion and groundwater overexploitation through the mar table 1 shows the e coli modal 10 cfu 100 ml median 5 cfu 100 ml and 95th percentile 16 cfu 100 ml from the statistical gamma distribution of concentrations in 114 routine samples processed by the water utility between 2014 and 2018 the c perfringens count was instead estimated from three water samples collected under critical operating conditions of the wastewater treatment plant the water samplings at the forcatella mar site of the present work were carried out during summer as the chemical and microbial analysis of municipal wastewater indicates that this season was the most critical for the quality of water inflow to the mar plant specifically during summer 2019 the istituto di ricerca sulle acque irsa monitored reclaimed water in five sampling stations to test the quality of the water supplied for irrigation fig 1 fig 1 also shows farmhouses and restaurants that may occasionally discharge untreated wastewater into the sea in particular we sampled the reclaimed water from the forcatella artificial basin between 15th and july 22 2019 at station s1 close to the two spillways of the ditches for the managed recharge of groundwater and at two further irrigation valve stations s2 and s9 see fig 1b groundwater was sampled in two monitoring wells s3 and s10 we also sampled bathing water at the other five sampling stations s4 to s8 along the beaches to control possible mar impacts on the seawater quality via groundwater sea outflows the locations of the sampling stations along the coast were determined through mathematical model simulations using specific in house software masciopinto et al 2008 more details on the groundwater model results showing that the sampling points intersect the plume especially in limestone fractured rock aquifers are described in section 2 2 fig 1 also shows sea sampling locations monitored during 2019 by the regional agency of environmental protection arpa http www arpa puglia it the tertiary wastewater treatments of the mar plants in puglia consist of clarification flocculation sedimentation and disinfection mainly with uv and sodium hypochlorite the forcatella facility also hosts a side stream pilot plant where three advanced wastewater treatment schemes for indirect potable reuse are currently being tested these water treatments will achieve high quality standards of recycled water piras et al 2020 for drinking purposes in this study we considered only the mainstream scenario as being implemented at the full scale in a mar site i e without the side stream treatments under the considered scenario the reclaimed water is directed to agricultural reuse via a pressurized aqueduct while overflows are collected into the downgradient water storage basin where the water depth 2 m on average is constantly controlled by piezometers the reclaimed water is mainly used for irrigation with a mean flowrate of 7 34 ml day using a network of pipelines 30 km that supplies an irrigation area of 1000 ha around the mar site the main crop production of fasano as well as the agricultural region consists of salads tomatoes cucumbers carrots olives and fruits e g cherries strawberries grapes almonds and plums the forcatella mar facility covers an area of 6 ha with a total water storage capacity of 50 000 m3 here water flows via two spillways into two underground ditches positioned along the end border of the basin with a length of 250 m and a cross section of 2 2 m2 see fig 2 the annual average recharge rate at the forcatella site was estimated to be 1 2 6 ml day the bottom of the ditches is about 3 m above the surface head of the groundwater where the water flows under low pressure into the fractured limestone to reach the adriatic sea in the n e direction see fig 1 via ditches the seepage flow of reclaimed water through the karstic limestone reaches the water table within a few hours due to the high permeability of the vertical fractures masciopinto and caputo 2011 2 2 model simulations of pathogen pathways mathematical models treating pathogens as colloids in groundwater i e as suspended particles bio colloid or biotic particulate matter fraction rather than dissolved compounds have been shown to be valuable tools for predicting pathogen counts in aquifers masciopinto et al 2011 this makes them suitable to assess potential long term health risks associated with the occurrence of enteric viruses and protozoa in fractured bedrock aquifers the mathematical model applied to the mar facility in this work was accurately investigated and validated using tracer and groundwater monitoring tests masciopinto et al 2008 the simulation results at the forcatella site have visualized the preferential pathways in fractures that are followed by pathogens fig 3 using the particle tracking computation method masciopinto et al 2019 these pathogen trajectories into horizontal fractures are highlighted in fig 3 the plume of infiltrated e coli in the groundwater was visualized by applying an e coli probability distribution to outflowing flow in fractures conditioned by higher water velocities at each fractures intersection this approach allowed us to exactly locate the positions of the sampling points along the coast to check for the possible seawater contamination by polluted groundwater outflows via mar hydrogeological and geochemical data i e water molarity and ionic strength ph temperature and charge potential of surfaces of pathogen collectors masciopinto and visino 2017 for the simulations were required to estimate groundwater flow velocities and the pathogen travel time in the fractured aquifer the flow simulations yielded a map of groundwater contour heads and vectors of the water velocities during water filtration trough the fractures under both natural red contour lines and recharge blue contour lines flow conditions see fig 3 the managed recharge increased the groundwater surface head and groundwater discharge for up to 1000 m upstream of the ditches the model simulation provided an average travel time of 18 20 3 2 d i e a mean water velocity of 32 5 8 m d for the infiltrated reclaimed water before outflowing into the sea after 600 m of filtration in the fractured aquifer moreover the e coli removal rate by the soil aquifer treatment sat i e by physical retention or straining gerba and goyal 1985 inactivation and attachment was set to 0 33 d 1 this value was estimated using data derived from a previous study masciopinto et al 2011 la mantia et al 2008 carried out at nardò salento peninsula italy these data were considered in the present work to estimate e coli persistence in the groundwater of the forcatella mar site because the hydrogeology of the two sites is quite similar e g both feature a fractured limestone aquifer thus we report the e coli counts that were monitored by irsa in two nardò wells 320 m and 500 m away from the injection location in fig 4 the travel times of 2 and 6 days for e coli in the injected reclaimed water reaching the monitoring wells were determined in this work using the mathematical model mentioned above fig 4 shows that almost a complete removal of e coli can be achieved after 10 15 days of filtration throughout the karstic fractured aquifer even considering mar operative conditions resulting in e coli concentrations of 300 mpn 100 ml in the wastewater this is because after 18 20 3 2 days of wastewater filtration in the groundwater sat ensures that only a very low count 0 2 mpn 100 ml of pathogenic e coli from the mar facility site can affect the seawater and qmra from stec vtec infections is not required the same cannot happen when seasonal untreated wastewaters are released from restaurants and farmhouses directly into the sea qmra due to pathogenic e coli ingestion inhalation was carried for wastewater reuse in irrigation and untreated wastewater discharged into the sea 2 3 sampling and sample processing at each sampling point we collected one sterile bottle 1 0 l of water to analyze its chemical constituents and three 300 ml samples for microbiological tests during each sampling temperature t ph and water electrical specific conductance ec were measured on site the bottles containing the collected samples were transported to the irsa laboratory using a mini portable refrigerator at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h standard methods apha awwa wef 2005 were applied to determine water chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nh4 nitrites no2 nitrates no3 and total nitrogen tn in the sampled water 2 4 microbial analyses the count of total coliforms tcs and e coli chik et al 2018 was determined using the colilert 18 test idexx laboratories inc www idexx co uk according to the manufacturer s protocol the number of the positive tray wells both for tcs and e coli was converted into the most probable number mpn per 100 ml using the conversion factor provided by the idexx laboratories inc however it was not possible to detect tcs in bathing seawater samples using the colilert 18 rapid method this was because there were false positives due to the enzymatic interference activities of algae plants and non coliform bacteria with the β d galactosidase enzyme which belongs to coliforms and e coli eckner et al 1998 the enterococcus number including e faecium and e faecalis was evaluated by the enterolert e approach idexx laboratories inc www idexx co uk according to the manufacturer s protocol this method required the same colilert 18 steps except for the incubation process that was carried out at 41 c for 24 h the positive samples were directly visualized with a blue white fluorescence after the exposure to a 6 w 365 nm uv light fluorescence analysis workstation cm 10a model spectroline ny usa and the enterococcus number indicated as mpn per 100 ml as was the case in the last colilert 18 step the total viable bacteria count was evaluated utilizing the plate count method with a yeast extract agar selective medium following standard methods apha et al 2005 only petri dishes containing less than 300 colonies were considered to estimate the colony forming units cfu per ml of sample 2 5 qmra method 2 5 1 exposure assessment a monte carlo based exposure dose is usually applied in the qmra of water supplies schijven et al 2011 whitaker et al 2005 rather than a deterministic point value dose assumption which is also widely used a monte carlo markov chain mcmc analysis based on the gamma prior distribution schmidt et al 2013 2019 was applied in this study to determine the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the target counts of e coli in both contaminated reclaimed water of vegetables and polluted seawater at the forcatella beaches specifically we considered the host s ingestion or consumption of raw vegetables such as salads tomatoes cucumbers and fruits e g cherries and strawberries that were contaminated by reclaimed wastewater coming from the mar plant as the primary root of the infection the ingestion inhalation of contaminated seawater during swimming or bathing was instead considered separately as the secondary root of infections caused by untreated wastewater discharges along the coast therefore the estimation of the probability of infection was split into two distinct predictions related to the quality of the reclaimed water for irrigation supplies and the seawater pollution by local wastewater discharges the mcmc analysis was performed on the microbial sampling results using the openbugs software see appendix to define the most probable pathogenic e coli concentrations at the sampled stations for both sampling groups of irrigation s1 s2 s3 s9 and s10 and bathing s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 ap1 ap2 and ap3 to get the pathogenic e coli count in the target we multiplied the sample concentrations and the volume of the contaminated water ingested by the host eating raw crops by 20 ml per day ayuso gabella et al 2011 moreover we considered a volume of 50 ml of contaminated seawater that was inhaled and ingested per bathing or swimming by the host this volume estimation mcbride et al 2013 depends on several factors such as the duration of bathing age and the ability of the host during swimming haas et al 2014 data collected using a questionnaire involving 19 000 persons of various ages in the netherlands schets et al 2011 highlighted that men swallowed a water volume of 27 34 ml per swimming event women 18 23 ml and children 31 51 ml hence we estimated an accidental inoculation of 50 ml of polluted water per bathing event and two bathing events per day to arrive at 100 ml per day since older children 4 years and adolescents 15 years old were considered for disease predictions in this work 2 5 2 dose response model of the infection probability the hus typically arises because of severe enteric stec vtec infection mainly in 70 80 of cases caused by pathogenic e coli strains that produce powerful toxins the vtec or stec these infections mainly affect immune depressed people like children and sometimes also the elderly that have been exposed to e coli via ingestion of foods contaminated by feces such as unpasteurized cheese or raw vegetables containing wastewater or to the ingestion of polluted seawater during swimming or bathing most cases of the european stec vtec infections during 2018 were caused by the e coli o157 serotype 39 2 while in italy a different e coli strain o26 h11 emerged as the significant agent of stec vtec infections 38 73 cases in the same year between 1988 and 2018 the italian istituto superiore di sanità iss 2020 recorded a mean of 38 5 hus fig 5 cases per year in italy an incidence of 0 44 per 100 000 residents the best fit of the increasing trends of hus r2 0 7 and stec vtec r2 0 8 in italy shown in fig 5 yields 1 no of hus 16 3 e x p 0 04 y e a r 1988 1a no of stec vtec 3 1 e x p 0 10 y e a r 1988 in this work we applied the above equation to estimate the stec vtec infections in the region during 2018 to have a practical verification of the qmra results against recorded infections in particular 16 tota et al 2013 of the 22 hus notified cases during the 2013 outbreak in puglia during summer involved children on the adriatic sea coast of puglia where high flowrates of secondary municipal effluents are discharged into the sea this severe hus outbreak led to 17 diseases in about 3 weeks germinario et al 2016 affecting mainly children ranging from 11 months to 15 years but no adults and causing the death of a 13 months old child infected by close relatives via secondary morbidity due to the infection trace back investigations were mainly focused on contaminated food from dairy products and raw vegetables in europe only 5 of diseases due to stec vtec infections 411 on 8161 reported cases were classified as hus diseases during 2018 while this percentage was 15 times higher in italy here 77 56 out of 73 cases of the diseases due to stec vtec infections were classified as hus disorders with the highest number of these occurring in southern italy the notified hus cases in the puglia region during 2018 iss 2020 were 13 out of the total of 60 in italy a little child aged 16 months died in this region in 2017 as a result of being affected by hus disorder in the qmra of this study the fraction of pathogenic serotypes e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 involved in stec vtec infection was assumed to be 17 on average of the total e coli count as suggested in the relevant literature soller et al 2010 truchado et al 2018 hence the e coli values derived from sample measurements and the mcmc were reduced to 17 to obtain id and id m of the dose infection probability model the infection calculations were carried out by selecting the appropriate α and β coefficients of the individual β poisson probability of the infection model as a result of pathogenic e coli ingestion by contaminated food or water teunis et al 2004 2008 in this dose response infection model we consider disaggregated pathogenic e coli poisson distributed in every single infectious dose exposed to a host to have 2 p 1 0 1 γ α β γ α γ β r α 1 1 r β 1 e r i d d r where r is the single hit value of the beta probability of the infection of each virus ingested i e host susceptibility γ is the gamma function and id or id m is the dimensionless count of the ingested inhaled pathogen 2 5 3 infection diseases prediction method the static qmra in this work was performed by multiplying the individual infection probability and the exposed population by accounting for the morbidity for an stec vtec infection and host autoimmunity masciopinto et al 2007 during the disease risk calculation in this study an immunity of 15 of hosts younger than 15 years was considered investigations carried out by ludwig et al 2002 on a control group of 327 persons in germany showed that 27 had igg antibodies against shiga toxins stx2 and or stx1 and that there was an age related immunity increase starting from 11 in children aged less than 4 years to 59 in the age group of 26 44 years moreover tozzi et al 2003 showed that evidence for an stec infection in italy was only found for 73 1 of the investigated patients 15 years that were affected by gastrointestinal disorders this means that despite the use of different diagnostic methods for 26 9 of the hus patients younger than 15 years there was no evidence for an stec infection probably because some patients may have had an infection caused by a stec strain belonging to a different e coli serogroup not included in the screening panel thus we considered the latter percentage as the maximum proportion of under reported diseases due to stec vtec infections of exposed hosts at the mar site primary and secondary morbidities due to the infection were fixed both at the rate of 10 masciopinto et al 2019 3 results 3 1 chemical and microbial quality of sampled water puglia is a semiarid region with an average rainfall of less than 600 mm during winter hence there are no natural water reservoirs but many ephemeral streams that convey surface runoff toward the sea or to the karst bedrock aquifer via sinkholes the first water monitoring was performed during a rainy day preceding several days without rainfall or a drought period at the sampling station s4 the high concentration of ammonium 5 70 mg l as n nh4 highlights the local fecal contamination of the sea caused by a regular untreated wastewater discharge that we observed during sampling the chemical constituents and microbial concentration in sampled water are reported in tables 2 and 3 respectively the s4 contamination was confirmed by the fecal indicator concentrations in table 3 thus we took the untreated wastewater discharge into consideration in the qmra via the mcmc of the pathogenic e coli count detected in the sampled water at s4 i e at the pipe outflow section of the wastewater into the sea this sampling station by affecting seawater quality characterized qmra of this work for bathing swimming at the forcatella beaches the sampled reclaimed water at s1 s2 and s9 see table 2 showed traces of ammonium with cod ranging from 41 1 to 55 1 mg l as o2 tables 2 and 3 also show an impairment of reclaimed water collected in the forcatella basin s1 for mar especially during the drought period bird and insect secretions i e nutrient load sunlight plants and algal growth had created eutrophic conditions greening and janick 2006 due to fecal pollution of the water basin used for managed recharge 3 2 exposure assessment results and target e coli counts the results of the mc simulations shown in table 4 returned 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the gamma prior probability distribution of the mean e coli concentration of each considered sampling group the maximum number of iterations performed in openbugs ensured a fixed maximum monte carlo error of the results of less than 5 5 specifically 330 000 and 35 000 iterations were required for the irrigation and bathing group predictions respectively the difference in the iteration number was due to the lower number 5 of samples available in the irrigation group compared with those in the bathing group 25 following this the parameters of the posterior poisson probability distributions of the e coli counts of each sample were obtained using the mcmc method this method starting from the gamma distribution concentrations in table 4 fitted the e coli mean concentrations collected at each sampling station using the true posterior poisson probability distribution the mcmc results are summarized in table 5 openbugs yielded the most probable e coli count poisson distribution with percentiles of 5 50 and 95 that might be incidentally exposed to hosts indeed we considered as target counts in qmra the e coli counts of the predicted percentiles table 6 corresponding to the lowest measured concentration in 100 ml during the samplings i e 14 8 for irrigation and 3 16 for bathing see bold counts in table 5 since they were the most probable values 12 and 25 respectively fig 6 with the lowest standard deviations further for qmra we also selected the mcmc percentiles corresponding to the maximum target e coli count that might be ingested and or inhaled these percentiles are provided in table 5 via the measured e coli concentrations of 42 58 and 31 01 mpn 100 ml during irrigation and bathing respectively which have a maximum posterior probability of 5 and 8 the above concentrations were selected because they are closest to the mean mu values see table 4 of the gamma distribution into the group of loading data i e 67 51 irrigation and 30 65 cfu 100 ml bathing respectively subsequently based on the openbugs results we obtained the e coli counts at the target of 9 15 and 21 cfu 100 ml 20 ml corresponding to the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the most probable 12 poisson distribution of the e coli count occurrence in contaminated reclaimed water of uncooked raw vegetables or fruits daily ingested by a single host similarly we estimated 1 0 3 0 and 6 0 cfu 100 ml 100 ml as corresponding to the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the most probable 25 occurrence of poisson distributed e coli counts in contaminated seawater ingested and inhaled daily by a single host during swimming or bathing moreover to account for the natural pathogenic e coli inactivation all irrigation doses were reduced according to an inactivation time of 72 h from the harvesting to the host ingestion of the contaminated food an e coli survival time between 3 and 6 days was experimentally estimated by vergine et al 2015 on lawn grass paspalum vaginatum while it was higher e g 10 13 days on topsoil the inactivation rate on vegetables and fruits was fixed here at 0 33 d 1 i e less than the minimum natural rate of 0 6 d 1 due to the uvb sunlight exposure proposed in the literature maraccini et al 2016 this yielded e coli counts d of 0 67 1 11 and 1 57 reported in table 6 table 6 also shows in parentheses the apparent counts of 0 37 0 74 and 1 11 given by the mcmc i e 5 10 and 15 instead of 9 15 and 21 and the successive inactivation during 72 h for the hypothetical scenario where e coli concentrations from the irrigation water of s2 and s9 are fixed at the regulation limit of 10 cfu 100 ml all the above calculations were repeated see table 6 to determine the maximum count of e coli doses d m that might be incidentally exposed to hosts via irrigation and bathing 3 3 mar infections to determine the infectious dose id and id m required for qmra the d and d m values in table 6 had to be reduced to the pathogenic fraction of e coli strains to cause stec vtec infections and hus diseases as explained in section 2 5 2 the predicted individual infection probability given by eq 2 is shown in table 7 the probability of infection was obtained selecting α 0 44 and β 49 which are close to the α 0 38 and β 37 9 values determined by teunis et al 2008 for the 1995 outbreak in oregon usa caused by e coli o157 ingestion at concentrations from 3 to 93 cfu g that were isolated from the two leftover pieces of beef jerky 200 g that were assumed to have been eaten by the host the β poisson probabilities of the infections shown in table 7 due to e coli o157 h7 o26 h11 inoculation by a host were determined by solving eq 2 in mathcad ptc prime 4 0 www ptc com 3 4 risk quantification the qmra results i e the number of diseases that might affect the population living near the mar site are shown in table 7 the irrigation risk was estimated by considering the exposure period of 48 days per year i e about 1 day per week of the fasano inhabitants 39 683 between 4 and 15 years 3 492 istat 2020 since we assumed that older hosts affected by the infection were not hospitalized and thus the cases remained unreported further due to parental control we also assumed that young children aged 4 and less did not have the opportunity to eat raw roots and vegetables contaminated by reclaimed water the older children 4 years and adolescents 15 years old comprised 12 7 of the total residents in fasano in 2018 istat 2020 seven days were considered as the exposure period for 10 000 tourists in 2 3 km of coastline in the vicinity to the mar plant who went swimming or bathing at beaches with seawater contaminated by pathogenic e coli during summer 2018 moreover only 15 1500 of the tourists were considered to be exposed to the seawater contamination considering those aged less than 15 years calculations of the expected diseases that occurred during 2018 at the mar site see table 7 were performed using microsoft excel table 7 also includes puglia hus and stec vtec infections during 2018 despite notifications of illnesses due to stec vtec infections not being mandatory in puglia and only 13 cases of hus being notified in 2018 in this region we estimated 27 cases of stec vtec regional infections 1 51 17 8 see table 7 using the average national ratio of 1 51 stec hus 5 3 3 5 infections per year reported in the ecdc database from 2007 to 2018 this estimation increased the number of the hus cases in puglia from 13 to 17 8 in 2018 based on the italian average incidence of 0 44 hus diseases per 100 000 residents recorded by the national iss 2020 between 1988 and 2018 see fig 5 with an increasing rate of about 3 5 hus diseases per year the qmra results provided the most probable cumulative risk of 0 4 diseases due to stec vtec infections of the exposed population at the mar site in 2018 with the probability of 11 4 5 percentile and uncertainty of 3 8 on average see table 5 the individual i e per capita disability adjusted life year daly corresponding to stec vtec disease burden was 4 98 10 7 daly in 2018 using the conversion factor of 54 7 10 3 of daly per disease published by the world health organization who havelaar and melse 2003 p 32 for the symptomatic diseases due to stec o157 infections in the netherlands the resulting burden of diseases provided a daly per year below the tolerable 10 6 upper limit of the reference level of risk set out in the who guidelines for drinking water who 2011 p 132 in high income countries this latter value however should not be considered a sharp threshold to classify the supplied water quality due to the uncertainty involved in risk assessment 4 discussion the mcmc bayesian analysis provided the probability distribution of the target concentrations by minimizing the required number and related costs of field water samplings since a small data set is the main weakness in qmra the probability was then used for the prediction of stec vtec infections and diseases at the forcatella mar site shown in table 7 uniformly extending the forcatella reclaimed water health risk to all 32 mar sites of the puglia region we arrived at a cumulative risk probability of 11 4 to have 12 8 i e 0 4 32 diseases per year with an individual probability of infection of 1 41 10 3 this is a reasonable number when we assume the same quality of reclaimed water supplied for irrigation by all 32 regional mar plants along with the managed recharge scheme and groundwater flow uniform conditions in puglia are quite realistic because almost all mar plants are managed by the regional water utility aqp s p a www aqp it and groundwater flows into the same karstic fractured limestone to check the consistency of the results we made a comparison between the estimated diseases and the recorded cases in puglia in 2018 shown in table 7 the comparison of regional diseases presented in this table shows that the total predicted e g the most probable number of diseases 12 8 or 9 6 when the maximum e coli concentration was at 10 100 ml with an occurrence of 11 4 or an expected count of roughly 1 46 diseases per year is plausible in comparison with the total of 27 stec vtec recorded cases in 2018 qmra for polluted seawater during bathing provided a cumulative risk of 0 04 diseases due to stec vtec infection with a probability of 23 8 5 percentile in 2018 with an uncertainty of 1 6 the disease burden at the beaches with polluted seawater provided in 2018 a daly of 2 0 10 7 due to the incidental ingestion inhalation of pathogenic e coli during bathing or swimming close to the wastewater discharge s4 along the coast likewise this daly is below the tolerable level provided by the who nevertheless since the illnesses caused by stec vtec infections may increase with the number of untreated wastewater discharges along with the volumes and degree of pollution of wastewater and wastes coming from offshore a higher disease burden is expected in the anthropic coastal areas of the region the results of qmra highlight that a small increase in the e coli count concerning the regulation limit in irrigation can produce a health risk in 2018 with a tolerable daly at mar sites at the investigated mar site the increase in the e coli concentration in reused water for irrigation from 10 cfu 100 ml to 14 8 24 8 cfu 100 ml in s9 and 118 5 cfu 100 ml in s2 led to a negligible risk increase from 0 3 to 0 4 diseases caused by stec vtec infections per year this is because the rate 0 33 d 1 of natural inactivation allows rapid decay of e coli during 72 h i e the minimum time between the last irrigation and the ingestion of contaminated raw crops by hosts hence an increase in the e coli regulation limit of 10 could reduce the operating costs at mar sites finally the sampling results of this work and the data provided by the water utility show that the quality of reclaimed water is affected by drought periods in fact reclaimed water from mar had a lower quality after many days without rainfalls as compared with that sampled during the rainy day indeed droughts are the main issues affecting the reclaimed water quality of mar sites in coastal areas especially where touristic presence abruptly increases the flowrate of wastewater inflow to the treatment plants supplementary reclaimed water disinfection trains pecson et al 2017 ottoson et al 2006 and qmra should then provide further insights during droughts at mar sites in semiarid regions by controlling wastewater treatment requirements to avoid public health risks this could be achieved by monitoring the possible occurrence of protozoa and enteric viruses in reclaimed water during droughts by means of pathogen indicators such as spores of c perfringens and somatic coliphages respectively which are more persistent than e coli to the water chlorination treatments masciopinto et al 2007 since the laboratory methods to detect the above indicators are very inexpensive they should be mandatory in semiarid regions and included in current regulations for water reuse in italy d lgs 185 03 and europe these indicators would greatly reduce the possible risk of infection from protozoa and or enteric viruses under critical operating conditions of wastewater treatment plants qmra stress tests could then determine for instance the most critical conditions requiring extra disinfection treatments conversely supplementary qmra stress test results could define possible disease burdens caused by enteric virus ingestion as a result of wastewater irrigation mok et al 2014 and groundwater pollution by managed recharge in qmra stress tests the exposure assessment should consider that the upper limit of the survival time of viruses in fractures has been estimated to be 15 months 460 days in groundwater borchardt et al 2007 nevecherya et al 2005 and that neither somatic coliphages nor c perfringens can emulate viruses or protozoa removal in wastewater indeed gerba and betancourt 2017 showed that most of the enteric viruses in polluted water samples appear in aggregated forms to increase their survival or resistance to the water disinfection treatments furthermore during droughts the quality of reclaimed water should be improved at mar sites of coastal areas by for instance eliminating potential seawater infiltrations into sewage collectors moreover a dilution of reclaimed water collected into recharge basins using treated rainfall runoff outflows schijven et al 2011 may improve water quality for managed recharge by providing a more efficient action to control seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers due to the subsequent increase of the recharge flowrate additionally an increase in freshwater depth in the recharge basins can reduce eutrophication 5 conclusions the merits of the qmra approach discussed in this paper combined with the groundwater flow and transport modeling output lie in the possibility to forecast microbial water concentrations based on the probabilistic model based analysis of the water quality obtained in field measurements this approach is suitable to provide a comprehensive set of information the groundwater flow and pathogen transport model allowed us to properly select the locations for seawater sampling by ensuring that pathogenic e coli cannot affect the quality of seawater at batches whereas the bayesian mcmc minimized the number and related costs of field water samples required to define the poisson distributed target concentrations the risk assessment provided in 2018 a tolerable disease burden corresponding to a daly of 4 98 10 7 with a probability of 11 4 of the cumulative risk of disease occurrence during mar operations the daly was instead 2 0 10 7 23 8 of occurrence during bathing at forcatella s beaches due to the ingestion inhalation of pathogenic e coli in the vicinity of wastewater discharges to the sea the uncertainty of the mcmc results ranged from 3 8 for irrigation to 1 6 for bathing risk estimations and it was inversely correlated with the number of samplings the results of qmra highlight that even if the e coli concentrations exceeded the regulation limit of 10 cfu 100 ml in irrigation water by 5 3 times the health risk was yet tolerable due to the rapid natural e coli inactivation during the elapsed time 72 h from the last irrigation before harvesting and the ingestion of raw vegetables and fruits the potential increase in the regulation limit could reduce wastewater treatment costs however droughts have been demonstrated to be the main problem affecting the water quality of the effluent from mar sites in coastal areas of semiarid regions here supplementary reclaimed water treatments for water disinfection and qmra stress tests of infections from the ingestion of protozoa and enteric viruses are recommended during the critical operating conditions of wastewater treatment plants to improve the efficacy of mar practices and ensure tolerable public health risks declaration of

19994,a pathogenic escherichia coli e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 dose response model was set up for a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of the waterborne diseases associated with managed aquifer recharge mar practices in semiarid regions the mar facility at forcatella southern italy was selected for the qmra application the target counts of pathogens incidentally exposed to hosts by eating contaminated raw crops or while bathing at beaches of the coastal area were determined by applying the monte carlo markov chain mcmc bayesian method to the water sampling results the mcmc provided the most probable pathogen count reaching the target and allowed for the minimization of the number of water samplings and hence reducing the associated costs the sampling stations along the coast were positioned based on the results of a groundwater flow and pathogen transport model which highlighted the preferential flow pathways of the transported e coli in the fractured coastal aquifer qmra indicated tolerable 10 6 daly health risks for bathing at beaches and irrigation with wastewater with 0 4 infectious diseases per year 11 4 probability of occurrence associated with the reuse of reclaimed water via soil irrigation even though exceeding the e coli regulation limit of 10 cfu 100 ml by five times the results show negligible health risk and insignificant impacts on the coastal water quality due to pathogenic e coli in the wastewater used for mar however droughts and reclaimed water quality can be considered the main issues of mar practices in semiarid regions suggesting additional reclaimed water treatments and further stress tests via qmras by considering more persistent pathogens than e coli graphical abstract image 1 keywords reclaimed water quality managed aquifer recharge e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 dose infection model qmra 1 introduction currently managed aquifer recharge mar is used as an attractive water source recycling technology useful for both agriculture and industry productions and importantly also drinking water asano et al 2007 dillon et al 2008 moreover in coastal aquifers mar practices are also used to control the impact of seawater encroachments on groundwater quality climate change affects coastal areas leading to an increase in the sea level rise and more frequent droughts with subsequent water scarcity mar applied to the bedrock limestone coastal aquifers of the salento peninsula masciopinto et al 2011 provides an efficient dynamic barrier controlling seawater intrusion to the groundwater and recovering freshwater storage suitable for irrigation and drinking supplies in touristic coastal areas in semiarid regions accordingly sustainable and effective mar schemes have to maintain a good microbial chemical quality of the recycled water to protect human health from the potential presence of dissolved toxic compounds and suspended enteric pathogens gibson and schwab 2011 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra howard et al 2006 provides a quantitative estimate of the degree of safety the population exposed to the contamination derived from mar practices has toze et al 2010 as opposed to qualitative microbial risk assessment ayuso gabella et al 2011 although viruses and protozoa can better survive in the environment than bacteria suggesting the potential higher risk of viruses and protozoa to public health recent data collected by national and european surveillance agencies show an alarming increase of diseases from the ingestion of food contaminated by pathogenic escherichia coli e coli in particular the presence of e coli in reused irrigation water lapen 2019 kouamé et al 2017 has generally been considered as the main indicator of fecal water contamination in the last decade because of its significant impact on public health indeed the italian regulation lgs d 185 2003 for water reuse in irrigation limits the e coli count to 10 cfu 100 ml in at least 80 of monitored water samples where only one sample at an e coli count of 100 cfu ml is allowed while salmonella spp must be absent the european union eu proposal for a regulation of the minimum requirements for reclaimed water of class a used in irrigation eu commission 2018 suggests an e coli limit 10 cfu 100 ml in at least 90 of monitored water samples along with microbial limits for legionella 100 cfu 100 ml and intestinal nematodes helminth eggs 1 the eu limits are related to rawly consumed roots and crops of which the edible part is directly in contact with reclaimed water during the last 20 years specific e coli serotypes have led to cases of severe diseases with increasing incidence in europe during 2018 the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2020 recorded approximately 8161 cases of shiga toxin producing e coli stec infection also referred to as e coli vero toxin vtec in the eu with 73 of these cases recorded in italy these pathogenic e coli strains are associated with various symptoms ranging from mild gastrointestinal illness to severe disorders such as hemolytic uremic syndrome hus which can lead to acute renal failure and consequently death particularly in children in this study we aim to quantify the number of diseases caused by the pathogenic e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 ingested by hosts via raw crops i e vegetables and fruits where the edible part is directly in contact with effluent water from mar facilities in fact quantitative health risk assessments associated with waterborne infections at mar sites due to e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 have not been comprehensively investigated in the literature in contrast to foodborne infections pang et al 2017 franz et al 2010 moreover we estimate the quantitative health risk owing to the ingestion inhalation of seawater contaminated by pathogenic e coli in seasonal wastewater discharges that are frequent in coastal areas at bathing locations eregno et al 2016 ashbolt et al 2010 microbiological data collected during sampling and the results of stochastic forecasts were used to assess the quantitative health risk at a mar site on a coastal area such as the forcatella facility in the puglia region southern italy in this region because of the water scarcity exacerbated by global warming the puglia government has authorized the installation of 32 mar plants since 2016 these plants produce 128 ml day portoghese et al 2019 of reclaimed water for irrigation and managed groundwater recharge following the tertiary treatment of effluents derived from municipal wastewater treatment plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 the mar facility mar sites in coastal areas are usually in the vicinity of touristic beaches such as in the case of the forcatella mar facility the reclaimed water table 1 from the mar facility is mainly used for the irrigation of agricultural land with a remaining flowrate to control the seawater intrusion and groundwater overexploitation through the mar table 1 shows the e coli modal 10 cfu 100 ml median 5 cfu 100 ml and 95th percentile 16 cfu 100 ml from the statistical gamma distribution of concentrations in 114 routine samples processed by the water utility between 2014 and 2018 the c perfringens count was instead estimated from three water samples collected under critical operating conditions of the wastewater treatment plant the water samplings at the forcatella mar site of the present work were carried out during summer as the chemical and microbial analysis of municipal wastewater indicates that this season was the most critical for the quality of water inflow to the mar plant specifically during summer 2019 the istituto di ricerca sulle acque irsa monitored reclaimed water in five sampling stations to test the quality of the water supplied for irrigation fig 1 fig 1 also shows farmhouses and restaurants that may occasionally discharge untreated wastewater into the sea in particular we sampled the reclaimed water from the forcatella artificial basin between 15th and july 22 2019 at station s1 close to the two spillways of the ditches for the managed recharge of groundwater and at two further irrigation valve stations s2 and s9 see fig 1b groundwater was sampled in two monitoring wells s3 and s10 we also sampled bathing water at the other five sampling stations s4 to s8 along the beaches to control possible mar impacts on the seawater quality via groundwater sea outflows the locations of the sampling stations along the coast were determined through mathematical model simulations using specific in house software masciopinto et al 2008 more details on the groundwater model results showing that the sampling points intersect the plume especially in limestone fractured rock aquifers are described in section 2 2 fig 1 also shows sea sampling locations monitored during 2019 by the regional agency of environmental protection arpa http www arpa puglia it the tertiary wastewater treatments of the mar plants in puglia consist of clarification flocculation sedimentation and disinfection mainly with uv and sodium hypochlorite the forcatella facility also hosts a side stream pilot plant where three advanced wastewater treatment schemes for indirect potable reuse are currently being tested these water treatments will achieve high quality standards of recycled water piras et al 2020 for drinking purposes in this study we considered only the mainstream scenario as being implemented at the full scale in a mar site i e without the side stream treatments under the considered scenario the reclaimed water is directed to agricultural reuse via a pressurized aqueduct while overflows are collected into the downgradient water storage basin where the water depth 2 m on average is constantly controlled by piezometers the reclaimed water is mainly used for irrigation with a mean flowrate of 7 34 ml day using a network of pipelines 30 km that supplies an irrigation area of 1000 ha around the mar site the main crop production of fasano as well as the agricultural region consists of salads tomatoes cucumbers carrots olives and fruits e g cherries strawberries grapes almonds and plums the forcatella mar facility covers an area of 6 ha with a total water storage capacity of 50 000 m3 here water flows via two spillways into two underground ditches positioned along the end border of the basin with a length of 250 m and a cross section of 2 2 m2 see fig 2 the annual average recharge rate at the forcatella site was estimated to be 1 2 6 ml day the bottom of the ditches is about 3 m above the surface head of the groundwater where the water flows under low pressure into the fractured limestone to reach the adriatic sea in the n e direction see fig 1 via ditches the seepage flow of reclaimed water through the karstic limestone reaches the water table within a few hours due to the high permeability of the vertical fractures masciopinto and caputo 2011 2 2 model simulations of pathogen pathways mathematical models treating pathogens as colloids in groundwater i e as suspended particles bio colloid or biotic particulate matter fraction rather than dissolved compounds have been shown to be valuable tools for predicting pathogen counts in aquifers masciopinto et al 2011 this makes them suitable to assess potential long term health risks associated with the occurrence of enteric viruses and protozoa in fractured bedrock aquifers the mathematical model applied to the mar facility in this work was accurately investigated and validated using tracer and groundwater monitoring tests masciopinto et al 2008 the simulation results at the forcatella site have visualized the preferential pathways in fractures that are followed by pathogens fig 3 using the particle tracking computation method masciopinto et al 2019 these pathogen trajectories into horizontal fractures are highlighted in fig 3 the plume of infiltrated e coli in the groundwater was visualized by applying an e coli probability distribution to outflowing flow in fractures conditioned by higher water velocities at each fractures intersection this approach allowed us to exactly locate the positions of the sampling points along the coast to check for the possible seawater contamination by polluted groundwater outflows via mar hydrogeological and geochemical data i e water molarity and ionic strength ph temperature and charge potential of surfaces of pathogen collectors masciopinto and visino 2017 for the simulations were required to estimate groundwater flow velocities and the pathogen travel time in the fractured aquifer the flow simulations yielded a map of groundwater contour heads and vectors of the water velocities during water filtration trough the fractures under both natural red contour lines and recharge blue contour lines flow conditions see fig 3 the managed recharge increased the groundwater surface head and groundwater discharge for up to 1000 m upstream of the ditches the model simulation provided an average travel time of 18 20 3 2 d i e a mean water velocity of 32 5 8 m d for the infiltrated reclaimed water before outflowing into the sea after 600 m of filtration in the fractured aquifer moreover the e coli removal rate by the soil aquifer treatment sat i e by physical retention or straining gerba and goyal 1985 inactivation and attachment was set to 0 33 d 1 this value was estimated using data derived from a previous study masciopinto et al 2011 la mantia et al 2008 carried out at nardò salento peninsula italy these data were considered in the present work to estimate e coli persistence in the groundwater of the forcatella mar site because the hydrogeology of the two sites is quite similar e g both feature a fractured limestone aquifer thus we report the e coli counts that were monitored by irsa in two nardò wells 320 m and 500 m away from the injection location in fig 4 the travel times of 2 and 6 days for e coli in the injected reclaimed water reaching the monitoring wells were determined in this work using the mathematical model mentioned above fig 4 shows that almost a complete removal of e coli can be achieved after 10 15 days of filtration throughout the karstic fractured aquifer even considering mar operative conditions resulting in e coli concentrations of 300 mpn 100 ml in the wastewater this is because after 18 20 3 2 days of wastewater filtration in the groundwater sat ensures that only a very low count 0 2 mpn 100 ml of pathogenic e coli from the mar facility site can affect the seawater and qmra from stec vtec infections is not required the same cannot happen when seasonal untreated wastewaters are released from restaurants and farmhouses directly into the sea qmra due to pathogenic e coli ingestion inhalation was carried for wastewater reuse in irrigation and untreated wastewater discharged into the sea 2 3 sampling and sample processing at each sampling point we collected one sterile bottle 1 0 l of water to analyze its chemical constituents and three 300 ml samples for microbiological tests during each sampling temperature t ph and water electrical specific conductance ec were measured on site the bottles containing the collected samples were transported to the irsa laboratory using a mini portable refrigerator at 4 c and analyzed within 24 h standard methods apha awwa wef 2005 were applied to determine water chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nh4 nitrites no2 nitrates no3 and total nitrogen tn in the sampled water 2 4 microbial analyses the count of total coliforms tcs and e coli chik et al 2018 was determined using the colilert 18 test idexx laboratories inc www idexx co uk according to the manufacturer s protocol the number of the positive tray wells both for tcs and e coli was converted into the most probable number mpn per 100 ml using the conversion factor provided by the idexx laboratories inc however it was not possible to detect tcs in bathing seawater samples using the colilert 18 rapid method this was because there were false positives due to the enzymatic interference activities of algae plants and non coliform bacteria with the β d galactosidase enzyme which belongs to coliforms and e coli eckner et al 1998 the enterococcus number including e faecium and e faecalis was evaluated by the enterolert e approach idexx laboratories inc www idexx co uk according to the manufacturer s protocol this method required the same colilert 18 steps except for the incubation process that was carried out at 41 c for 24 h the positive samples were directly visualized with a blue white fluorescence after the exposure to a 6 w 365 nm uv light fluorescence analysis workstation cm 10a model spectroline ny usa and the enterococcus number indicated as mpn per 100 ml as was the case in the last colilert 18 step the total viable bacteria count was evaluated utilizing the plate count method with a yeast extract agar selective medium following standard methods apha et al 2005 only petri dishes containing less than 300 colonies were considered to estimate the colony forming units cfu per ml of sample 2 5 qmra method 2 5 1 exposure assessment a monte carlo based exposure dose is usually applied in the qmra of water supplies schijven et al 2011 whitaker et al 2005 rather than a deterministic point value dose assumption which is also widely used a monte carlo markov chain mcmc analysis based on the gamma prior distribution schmidt et al 2013 2019 was applied in this study to determine the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the target counts of e coli in both contaminated reclaimed water of vegetables and polluted seawater at the forcatella beaches specifically we considered the host s ingestion or consumption of raw vegetables such as salads tomatoes cucumbers and fruits e g cherries and strawberries that were contaminated by reclaimed wastewater coming from the mar plant as the primary root of the infection the ingestion inhalation of contaminated seawater during swimming or bathing was instead considered separately as the secondary root of infections caused by untreated wastewater discharges along the coast therefore the estimation of the probability of infection was split into two distinct predictions related to the quality of the reclaimed water for irrigation supplies and the seawater pollution by local wastewater discharges the mcmc analysis was performed on the microbial sampling results using the openbugs software see appendix to define the most probable pathogenic e coli concentrations at the sampled stations for both sampling groups of irrigation s1 s2 s3 s9 and s10 and bathing s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 ap1 ap2 and ap3 to get the pathogenic e coli count in the target we multiplied the sample concentrations and the volume of the contaminated water ingested by the host eating raw crops by 20 ml per day ayuso gabella et al 2011 moreover we considered a volume of 50 ml of contaminated seawater that was inhaled and ingested per bathing or swimming by the host this volume estimation mcbride et al 2013 depends on several factors such as the duration of bathing age and the ability of the host during swimming haas et al 2014 data collected using a questionnaire involving 19 000 persons of various ages in the netherlands schets et al 2011 highlighted that men swallowed a water volume of 27 34 ml per swimming event women 18 23 ml and children 31 51 ml hence we estimated an accidental inoculation of 50 ml of polluted water per bathing event and two bathing events per day to arrive at 100 ml per day since older children 4 years and adolescents 15 years old were considered for disease predictions in this work 2 5 2 dose response model of the infection probability the hus typically arises because of severe enteric stec vtec infection mainly in 70 80 of cases caused by pathogenic e coli strains that produce powerful toxins the vtec or stec these infections mainly affect immune depressed people like children and sometimes also the elderly that have been exposed to e coli via ingestion of foods contaminated by feces such as unpasteurized cheese or raw vegetables containing wastewater or to the ingestion of polluted seawater during swimming or bathing most cases of the european stec vtec infections during 2018 were caused by the e coli o157 serotype 39 2 while in italy a different e coli strain o26 h11 emerged as the significant agent of stec vtec infections 38 73 cases in the same year between 1988 and 2018 the italian istituto superiore di sanità iss 2020 recorded a mean of 38 5 hus fig 5 cases per year in italy an incidence of 0 44 per 100 000 residents the best fit of the increasing trends of hus r2 0 7 and stec vtec r2 0 8 in italy shown in fig 5 yields 1 no of hus 16 3 e x p 0 04 y e a r 1988 1a no of stec vtec 3 1 e x p 0 10 y e a r 1988 in this work we applied the above equation to estimate the stec vtec infections in the region during 2018 to have a practical verification of the qmra results against recorded infections in particular 16 tota et al 2013 of the 22 hus notified cases during the 2013 outbreak in puglia during summer involved children on the adriatic sea coast of puglia where high flowrates of secondary municipal effluents are discharged into the sea this severe hus outbreak led to 17 diseases in about 3 weeks germinario et al 2016 affecting mainly children ranging from 11 months to 15 years but no adults and causing the death of a 13 months old child infected by close relatives via secondary morbidity due to the infection trace back investigations were mainly focused on contaminated food from dairy products and raw vegetables in europe only 5 of diseases due to stec vtec infections 411 on 8161 reported cases were classified as hus diseases during 2018 while this percentage was 15 times higher in italy here 77 56 out of 73 cases of the diseases due to stec vtec infections were classified as hus disorders with the highest number of these occurring in southern italy the notified hus cases in the puglia region during 2018 iss 2020 were 13 out of the total of 60 in italy a little child aged 16 months died in this region in 2017 as a result of being affected by hus disorder in the qmra of this study the fraction of pathogenic serotypes e coli o157 h7 and o26 h11 involved in stec vtec infection was assumed to be 17 on average of the total e coli count as suggested in the relevant literature soller et al 2010 truchado et al 2018 hence the e coli values derived from sample measurements and the mcmc were reduced to 17 to obtain id and id m of the dose infection probability model the infection calculations were carried out by selecting the appropriate α and β coefficients of the individual β poisson probability of the infection model as a result of pathogenic e coli ingestion by contaminated food or water teunis et al 2004 2008 in this dose response infection model we consider disaggregated pathogenic e coli poisson distributed in every single infectious dose exposed to a host to have 2 p 1 0 1 γ α β γ α γ β r α 1 1 r β 1 e r i d d r where r is the single hit value of the beta probability of the infection of each virus ingested i e host susceptibility γ is the gamma function and id or id m is the dimensionless count of the ingested inhaled pathogen 2 5 3 infection diseases prediction method the static qmra in this work was performed by multiplying the individual infection probability and the exposed population by accounting for the morbidity for an stec vtec infection and host autoimmunity masciopinto et al 2007 during the disease risk calculation in this study an immunity of 15 of hosts younger than 15 years was considered investigations carried out by ludwig et al 2002 on a control group of 327 persons in germany showed that 27 had igg antibodies against shiga toxins stx2 and or stx1 and that there was an age related immunity increase starting from 11 in children aged less than 4 years to 59 in the age group of 26 44 years moreover tozzi et al 2003 showed that evidence for an stec infection in italy was only found for 73 1 of the investigated patients 15 years that were affected by gastrointestinal disorders this means that despite the use of different diagnostic methods for 26 9 of the hus patients younger than 15 years there was no evidence for an stec infection probably because some patients may have had an infection caused by a stec strain belonging to a different e coli serogroup not included in the screening panel thus we considered the latter percentage as the maximum proportion of under reported diseases due to stec vtec infections of exposed hosts at the mar site primary and secondary morbidities due to the infection were fixed both at the rate of 10 masciopinto et al 2019 3 results 3 1 chemical and microbial quality of sampled water puglia is a semiarid region with an average rainfall of less than 600 mm during winter hence there are no natural water reservoirs but many ephemeral streams that convey surface runoff toward the sea or to the karst bedrock aquifer via sinkholes the first water monitoring was performed during a rainy day preceding several days without rainfall or a drought period at the sampling station s4 the high concentration of ammonium 5 70 mg l as n nh4 highlights the local fecal contamination of the sea caused by a regular untreated wastewater discharge that we observed during sampling the chemical constituents and microbial concentration in sampled water are reported in tables 2 and 3 respectively the s4 contamination was confirmed by the fecal indicator concentrations in table 3 thus we took the untreated wastewater discharge into consideration in the qmra via the mcmc of the pathogenic e coli count detected in the sampled water at s4 i e at the pipe outflow section of the wastewater into the sea this sampling station by affecting seawater quality characterized qmra of this work for bathing swimming at the forcatella beaches the sampled reclaimed water at s1 s2 and s9 see table 2 showed traces of ammonium with cod ranging from 41 1 to 55 1 mg l as o2 tables 2 and 3 also show an impairment of reclaimed water collected in the forcatella basin s1 for mar especially during the drought period bird and insect secretions i e nutrient load sunlight plants and algal growth had created eutrophic conditions greening and janick 2006 due to fecal pollution of the water basin used for managed recharge 3 2 exposure assessment results and target e coli counts the results of the mc simulations shown in table 4 returned 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the gamma prior probability distribution of the mean e coli concentration of each considered sampling group the maximum number of iterations performed in openbugs ensured a fixed maximum monte carlo error of the results of less than 5 5 specifically 330 000 and 35 000 iterations were required for the irrigation and bathing group predictions respectively the difference in the iteration number was due to the lower number 5 of samples available in the irrigation group compared with those in the bathing group 25 following this the parameters of the posterior poisson probability distributions of the e coli counts of each sample were obtained using the mcmc method this method starting from the gamma distribution concentrations in table 4 fitted the e coli mean concentrations collected at each sampling station using the true posterior poisson probability distribution the mcmc results are summarized in table 5 openbugs yielded the most probable e coli count poisson distribution with percentiles of 5 50 and 95 that might be incidentally exposed to hosts indeed we considered as target counts in qmra the e coli counts of the predicted percentiles table 6 corresponding to the lowest measured concentration in 100 ml during the samplings i e 14 8 for irrigation and 3 16 for bathing see bold counts in table 5 since they were the most probable values 12 and 25 respectively fig 6 with the lowest standard deviations further for qmra we also selected the mcmc percentiles corresponding to the maximum target e coli count that might be ingested and or inhaled these percentiles are provided in table 5 via the measured e coli concentrations of 42 58 and 31 01 mpn 100 ml during irrigation and bathing respectively which have a maximum posterior probability of 5 and 8 the above concentrations were selected because they are closest to the mean mu values see table 4 of the gamma distribution into the group of loading data i e 67 51 irrigation and 30 65 cfu 100 ml bathing respectively subsequently based on the openbugs results we obtained the e coli counts at the target of 9 15 and 21 cfu 100 ml 20 ml corresponding to the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the most probable 12 poisson distribution of the e coli count occurrence in contaminated reclaimed water of uncooked raw vegetables or fruits daily ingested by a single host similarly we estimated 1 0 3 0 and 6 0 cfu 100 ml 100 ml as corresponding to the 5 50 and 95 percentiles of the most probable 25 occurrence of poisson distributed e coli counts in contaminated seawater ingested and inhaled daily by a single host during swimming or bathing moreover to account for the natural pathogenic e coli inactivation all irrigation doses were reduced according to an inactivation time of 72 h from the harvesting to the host ingestion of the contaminated food an e coli survival time between 3 and 6 days was experimentally estimated by vergine et al 2015 on lawn grass paspalum vaginatum while it was higher e g 10 13 days on topsoil the inactivation rate on vegetables and fruits was fixed here at 0 33 d 1 i e less than the minimum natural rate of 0 6 d 1 due to the uvb sunlight exposure proposed in the literature maraccini et al 2016 this yielded e coli counts d of 0 67 1 11 and 1 57 reported in table 6 table 6 also shows in parentheses the apparent counts of 0 37 0 74 and 1 11 given by the mcmc i e 5 10 and 15 instead of 9 15 and 21 and the successive inactivation during 72 h for the hypothetical scenario where e coli concentrations from the irrigation water of s2 and s9 are fixed at the regulation limit of 10 cfu 100 ml all the above calculations were repeated see table 6 to determine the maximum count of e coli doses d m that might be incidentally exposed to hosts via irrigation and bathing 3 3 mar infections to determine the infectious dose id and id m required for qmra the d and d m values in table 6 had to be reduced to the pathogenic fraction of e coli strains to cause stec vtec infections and hus diseases as explained in section 2 5 2 the predicted individual infection probability given by eq 2 is shown in table 7 the probability of infection was obtained selecting α 0 44 and β 49 which are close to the α 0 38 and β 37 9 values determined by teunis et al 2008 for the 1995 outbreak in oregon usa caused by e coli o157 ingestion at concentrations from 3 to 93 cfu g that were isolated from the two leftover pieces of beef jerky 200 g that were assumed to have been eaten by the host the β poisson probabilities of the infections shown in table 7 due to e coli o157 h7 o26 h11 inoculation by a host were determined by solving eq 2 in mathcad ptc prime 4 0 www ptc com 3 4 risk quantification the qmra results i e the number of diseases that might affect the population living near the mar site are shown in table 7 the irrigation risk was estimated by considering the exposure period of 48 days per year i e about 1 day per week of the fasano inhabitants 39 683 between 4 and 15 years 3 492 istat 2020 since we assumed that older hosts affected by the infection were not hospitalized and thus the cases remained unreported further due to parental control we also assumed that young children aged 4 and less did not have the opportunity to eat raw roots and vegetables contaminated by reclaimed water the older children 4 years and adolescents 15 years old comprised 12 7 of the total residents in fasano in 2018 istat 2020 seven days were considered as the exposure period for 10 000 tourists in 2 3 km of coastline in the vicinity to the mar plant who went swimming or bathing at beaches with seawater contaminated by pathogenic e coli during summer 2018 moreover only 15 1500 of the tourists were considered to be exposed to the seawater contamination considering those aged less than 15 years calculations of the expected diseases that occurred during 2018 at the mar site see table 7 were performed using microsoft excel table 7 also includes puglia hus and stec vtec infections during 2018 despite notifications of illnesses due to stec vtec infections not being mandatory in puglia and only 13 cases of hus being notified in 2018 in this region we estimated 27 cases of stec vtec regional infections 1 51 17 8 see table 7 using the average national ratio of 1 51 stec hus 5 3 3 5 infections per year reported in the ecdc database from 2007 to 2018 this estimation increased the number of the hus cases in puglia from 13 to 17 8 in 2018 based on the italian average incidence of 0 44 hus diseases per 100 000 residents recorded by the national iss 2020 between 1988 and 2018 see fig 5 with an increasing rate of about 3 5 hus diseases per year the qmra results provided the most probable cumulative risk of 0 4 diseases due to stec vtec infections of the exposed population at the mar site in 2018 with the probability of 11 4 5 percentile and uncertainty of 3 8 on average see table 5 the individual i e per capita disability adjusted life year daly corresponding to stec vtec disease burden was 4 98 10 7 daly in 2018 using the conversion factor of 54 7 10 3 of daly per disease published by the world health organization who havelaar and melse 2003 p 32 for the symptomatic diseases due to stec o157 infections in the netherlands the resulting burden of diseases provided a daly per year below the tolerable 10 6 upper limit of the reference level of risk set out in the who guidelines for drinking water who 2011 p 132 in high income countries this latter value however should not be considered a sharp threshold to classify the supplied water quality due to the uncertainty involved in risk assessment 4 discussion the mcmc bayesian analysis provided the probability distribution of the target concentrations by minimizing the required number and related costs of field water samplings since a small data set is the main weakness in qmra the probability was then used for the prediction of stec vtec infections and diseases at the forcatella mar site shown in table 7 uniformly extending the forcatella reclaimed water health risk to all 32 mar sites of the puglia region we arrived at a cumulative risk probability of 11 4 to have 12 8 i e 0 4 32 diseases per year with an individual probability of infection of 1 41 10 3 this is a reasonable number when we assume the same quality of reclaimed water supplied for irrigation by all 32 regional mar plants along with the managed recharge scheme and groundwater flow uniform conditions in puglia are quite realistic because almost all mar plants are managed by the regional water utility aqp s p a www aqp it and groundwater flows into the same karstic fractured limestone to check the consistency of the results we made a comparison between the estimated diseases and the recorded cases in puglia in 2018 shown in table 7 the comparison of regional diseases presented in this table shows that the total predicted e g the most probable number of diseases 12 8 or 9 6 when the maximum e coli concentration was at 10 100 ml with an occurrence of 11 4 or an expected count of roughly 1 46 diseases per year is plausible in comparison with the total of 27 stec vtec recorded cases in 2018 qmra for polluted seawater during bathing provided a cumulative risk of 0 04 diseases due to stec vtec infection with a probability of 23 8 5 percentile in 2018 with an uncertainty of 1 6 the disease burden at the beaches with polluted seawater provided in 2018 a daly of 2 0 10 7 due to the incidental ingestion inhalation of pathogenic e coli during bathing or swimming close to the wastewater discharge s4 along the coast likewise this daly is below the tolerable level provided by the who nevertheless since the illnesses caused by stec vtec infections may increase with the number of untreated wastewater discharges along with the volumes and degree of pollution of wastewater and wastes coming from offshore a higher disease burden is expected in the anthropic coastal areas of the region the results of qmra highlight that a small increase in the e coli count concerning the regulation limit in irrigation can produce a health risk in 2018 with a tolerable daly at mar sites at the investigated mar site the increase in the e coli concentration in reused water for irrigation from 10 cfu 100 ml to 14 8 24 8 cfu 100 ml in s9 and 118 5 cfu 100 ml in s2 led to a negligible risk increase from 0 3 to 0 4 diseases caused by stec vtec infections per year this is because the rate 0 33 d 1 of natural inactivation allows rapid decay of e coli during 72 h i e the minimum time between the last irrigation and the ingestion of contaminated raw crops by hosts hence an increase in the e coli regulation limit of 10 could reduce the operating costs at mar sites finally the sampling results of this work and the data provided by the water utility show that the quality of reclaimed water is affected by drought periods in fact reclaimed water from mar had a lower quality after many days without rainfalls as compared with that sampled during the rainy day indeed droughts are the main issues affecting the reclaimed water quality of mar sites in coastal areas especially where touristic presence abruptly increases the flowrate of wastewater inflow to the treatment plants supplementary reclaimed water disinfection trains pecson et al 2017 ottoson et al 2006 and qmra should then provide further insights during droughts at mar sites in semiarid regions by controlling wastewater treatment requirements to avoid public health risks this could be achieved by monitoring the possible occurrence of protozoa and enteric viruses in reclaimed water during droughts by means of pathogen indicators such as spores of c perfringens and somatic coliphages respectively which are more persistent than e coli to the water chlorination treatments masciopinto et al 2007 since the laboratory methods to detect the above indicators are very inexpensive they should be mandatory in semiarid regions and included in current regulations for water reuse in italy d lgs 185 03 and europe these indicators would greatly reduce the possible risk of infection from protozoa and or enteric viruses under critical operating conditions of wastewater treatment plants qmra stress tests could then determine for instance the most critical conditions requiring extra disinfection treatments conversely supplementary qmra stress test results could define possible disease burdens caused by enteric virus ingestion as a result of wastewater irrigation mok et al 2014 and groundwater pollution by managed recharge in qmra stress tests the exposure assessment should consider that the upper limit of the survival time of viruses in fractures has been estimated to be 15 months 460 days in groundwater borchardt et al 2007 nevecherya et al 2005 and that neither somatic coliphages nor c perfringens can emulate viruses or protozoa removal in wastewater indeed gerba and betancourt 2017 showed that most of the enteric viruses in polluted water samples appear in aggregated forms to increase their survival or resistance to the water disinfection treatments furthermore during droughts the quality of reclaimed water should be improved at mar sites of coastal areas by for instance eliminating potential seawater infiltrations into sewage collectors moreover a dilution of reclaimed water collected into recharge basins using treated rainfall runoff outflows schijven et al 2011 may improve water quality for managed recharge by providing a more efficient action to control seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers due to the subsequent increase of the recharge flowrate additionally an increase in freshwater depth in the recharge basins can reduce eutrophication 5 conclusions the merits of the qmra approach discussed in this paper combined with the groundwater flow and transport modeling output lie in the possibility to forecast microbial water concentrations based on the probabilistic model based analysis of the water quality obtained in field measurements this approach is suitable to provide a comprehensive set of information the groundwater flow and pathogen transport model allowed us to properly select the locations for seawater sampling by ensuring that pathogenic e coli cannot affect the quality of seawater at batches whereas the bayesian mcmc minimized the number and related costs of field water samples required to define the poisson distributed target concentrations the risk assessment provided in 2018 a tolerable disease burden corresponding to a daly of 4 98 10 7 with a probability of 11 4 of the cumulative risk of disease occurrence during mar operations the daly was instead 2 0 10 7 23 8 of occurrence during bathing at forcatella s beaches due to the ingestion inhalation of pathogenic e coli in the vicinity of wastewater discharges to the sea the uncertainty of the mcmc results ranged from 3 8 for irrigation to 1 6 for bathing risk estimations and it was inversely correlated with the number of samplings the results of qmra highlight that even if the e coli concentrations exceeded the regulation limit of 10 cfu 100 ml in irrigation water by 5 3 times the health risk was yet tolerable due to the rapid natural e coli inactivation during the elapsed time 72 h from the last irrigation before harvesting and the ingestion of raw vegetables and fruits the potential increase in the regulation limit could reduce wastewater treatment costs however droughts have been demonstrated to be the main problem affecting the water quality of the effluent from mar sites in coastal areas of semiarid regions here supplementary reclaimed water treatments for water disinfection and qmra stress tests of infections from the ingestion of protozoa and enteric viruses are recommended during the critical operating conditions of wastewater treatment plants to improve the efficacy of mar practices and ensure tolerable public health risks declaration of
