18690,bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital hw a community cw and the receiving urban uw wastewater treatment plant wwtp we compared levels of antibiotic resistance in the different types of wastewater and identified whether resistant strains were endemic in the wastewater system if so implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots e g hospital outlets could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater e coli from hw n 2644 cw n 2525 and uw n 2693 were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping pheneplate system and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics areb system the phenotypic diversities of the total e coli populations were similar for all three sites simpson s diversity index di 0 973 however for individual samples hw showed low diversities median di 0 800 and the e coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals the diversities in cw samples was higher median di 0 936 and uw samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates median di 0 971 resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45 of the hw isolates 44 of cw isolates and 33 of uw isolates resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon 3 2 and 5 3 respectively whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common 24 and 31 respectively extended spectrum beta lactamase producing e coli esbl ec were more common in hw 11 5 and in cw 6 9 compared to uw 3 7 a high diversity di 0 974 was observed among esbl ec isolates from uw n 99 indicating absence of any clonal structure among these isolates common php types of esbl ec often dominated in each hw sample but were not identified across different samples whereas esbl ec in cw showed low diversity di 0 857 and were dominated by a specific php type that was found across almost all cw samples the antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater but surprisingly they were also high in the studied community wastewater compared to the urban wastewater the relative contribution of hw seemed low in terms of dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria to the wwtp graphical abstract image

increasing global problem in both human and animal health care transfer of antimicrobial resistance between bacteria and development of new resistance mechanisms are inevitable consequences of the continued use of antibiotics the widespread use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to the spread of resistant bacteria into many environments kümmerer 2009 kolář et al 2001 gaskins et al 2002 resistant bacteria are especially common in hospital environments from where they may reach the wastewater treatment plants wwtps via hospital wastewater hw hocquet et al 2016 little is known about the further fate of these bacteria and although some have found no evidence for selection for antibiotic resistance in wwtps flach et al 2018 others have found that large amounts of resistant bacteria possibly of hospital origin remain alive during the wastewater treatment process and are released into recipient waters rizzo et al 2013 monitoring antimicrobial resistance through national and international surveillance programs has increased the knowledge of dissemination of resistant bacteria a number of surveillance programs have been set up such as the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network ears net european centre for disease prevention and control 2017 eco sens kahlmeter and poulsen 2012 and central asian and eastern european surveillance of antimicrobial resistance caesar world health organization 2015 veterinary equivalents are run by the european food safety authority efsa and focus on monitoring antimicrobial resistance in commensal bacteria such as e coli in fecal samples collected from healthy animals large numbers of fecal samples from healthy humans are more difficult to obtain and therefore less is known about the normal human microbiota and its role as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria analyzing untreated wastewater collected from urban wwtps is an alternate method to sampling hundreds of individuals in the population from which the wwtp receives its wastewater kühn et al 2003 this method can be used as an early warning system for the emergence of new or rare types of antibiotic resistance as proposed already in the seventies by linton et al 1974 wastewater may work as a favorable niche for resistant bacteria and resistance genes originating from a population that produces the wastewater gao et al 2012 kümmerer 2003 munir et al 2011 reinthaler et al 2013 increasing resistance rates in urban wastewater uw has been found to correspond well to increasing antibiotic resistance rates in the human population reinthaler et al 2013 identification of the resistance rates in indicator bacteria in wastewater may also serve as a convenient tool to monitor changes in the resistance in the intestinal microbiota of the total human population e g to find out if changes to the antibiotic policy in a region would affect resistance rates of bacteria in human microbiota in that region some swedish studies have also described a correlation between resistance rates among bacteria in wastewater and in the corresponding human population blanch et al 2006 kühn et al 2003 a swedish clone of enterococcus faecium carrying ampicillin and fluoroquinolone resistance could be followed from its hospital origin torell et al 2003 to its presence in the hospital s wastewater iversen et al 2004 the clone was found further enriched in uw and also found in many samples from receiving waters iversen et al 2004 revealing a likely source for colonization of humans and animals with antibiotic resistant bacteria of hospital origin in the same study vancomycin resistant enterococci vre were found in 60 of uw samples in sweden and in 36 of hw samples iversen et al 2002 despite claims at the time that sweden was free of vre as a consequence of its restrictive antibiotic policy later a clonal group of e faecium vanb with the same resistance pattern as that isolated from hw a few years earlier was found to be the cause of a large proportion of 487 reported healthcare related vre in 2007 2009 iversen et al 2002 another study on 1300 e coli in wastewater in sweden using phenotyping php combined with resistance determination revealed high occurrences of resistant bacteria both in uw 34 of all e coli and in hw 55 kwak et al 2015 identifying wastewater outlets that can act as hotspots for antibiotic resistance may be of great importance berendonk et al 2015 in the present study we have analyzed the frequencies of antibiotic resistance in the e coli flora in wastewater from three sites connected to a sewage system in oslo norway the aims were to compare the diversities and the different antibiotic resistance levels in a hospital a community and in the total urban wastewater hopefully this could support a future decision on whether implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots could reduce the total load of resistant bacteria in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample origins and collection of samples three sampling sites were selected specifically to be able to compare hospital effluents to non hospital effluents fig 1 hw was collected from the main outlet of oslo university hospital rikshospitalet a medium sized tertiary care hospital with over 500 hospital beds community wastewater cw was collected at a wastewater pump station in an area outside oslo city selected because its effluents exclusively originated from a residential area with approximately 510 inhabitants thus providing wastewater with no contributions from health care institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes and excluding any form of agricultural impact uw was collected at the inlet of the wwtp vestfjorden avløpsselskap veas this plant treats wastewater from more than 600 000 human inhabitants in the municipalities oslo asker bærum røyken and nesodden including wastewater from the hospital and community sampling sites used in this study to collect parallel wastewater samples in the wwtp compared to those collected from the two prior locations compensation was made for the estimated travel time of the wastewater from the hospital 6 h and community 4 h outlets to the wwtp inlet by sampling at three specific time points 8 a m hw 10 a m cw and 2 p m uw respectively raw untreated wastewater was collected at the same time from three locations every month from june 2016 through may 2017 three samples were collected monthly one per day during three consecutive days each sample was composited of 24 aliquots of 200 ml collected at hourly intervals for 24 h using two isco 2900 portable automatic water samplers hw and uw and one isco 3700 full size portable sampler cw teledyne isco lincoln nebraska usa all samplers were rinsed with water between daily samples and rinsed with water cleaned with 0 1 1 sodium hypochlorite klorin and bathed in 70 ethanol between monthly sampling occasions 2 2 isolation of e coli samples were kept at 4 c and analyzed within 12 h serial dilutions were made in phosphate buffered saline pbs and aliquots of 250 μl were plated on 14 cm petri dishes containing a chromogenic medium for e coli chromagar orientation chromagar microbiology paris france preheated to 37 c to reduce cellular stress using the plating bead method https www zymoresearch de rattler plating beads the plates were incubated overnight 16 18 h at 44 c to inhibit growth of non thermotolerant bacteria pink to dark red colonies with a surrounding halo on the chromagar orientation plates were regarded as presumptive e coli and further analyzed 2 3 analysis of e coli isolates 2 3 1 combined phenotyping and resistance determination after incubation 80 separately growing e coli colonies when available were picked from the chromagar plates with sterile toothpicks the colonies were inoculated into the first columns of ten php re plates of the pheneplate system 96 well microtiter plates containing eight sets of 11 dehydrated reagents phplate ab stockholm sweden www phplate se pre filled with 300 μl php suspension medium phplate ab kühn and möllby 1993 as described by colque et al 2014 aliquots of 10 μl were transferred from the inoculation column to each well on the corresponding row of the php re plate and then twice 20 μl to the first column of ten antibiotic resistance breakpoint areb plates phplate ab pre filled with 200 μl bbl mueller hinton ii broth bd le pont de claix france areb plates consist of round bottomed 96 well microtiter plates containing one column for preparing bacterial suspensions ten columns with dehydrated antibiotics and a growth control well for each bacterial isolate in the rightmost column antibiotics and their final concentrations in mg l were the same as described by kwak et al 2015 namely ampicillin 32 cefotaxime 2 ceftazidime 16 chloramphenicol 32 ciprofloxacin 4 gentamicin 16 nalidixic acid 32 cefpodoxime 3 tetracycline 16 and trimethoprim 16 with the modification that ceftazidime was excluded from the analysis bacterial suspensions of 10 μl were transferred from the first column of each areb plate to each well on the corresponding row the php re and areb plates were incubated for 24 2 hours at 37 c and images of each plate were produced using a desktop scanner hp g4050 fig s1a 2 3 2 data analysis each php re plate image was translated into 96 absorbance values by the pheneplate software phplate ab each well in the php re plates was assigned a numerical value based on its color with a gradient ranging from 0 bright yellow to 25 dark blue growth in each well in the areb plates was determined by size and density of the pellets formed in the round bottomed plates and resistance to each antibiotic was determined by the software as relative growth in its respective well compared to the control well column 12 results were read as 0 susceptible growth 10 of control well 1 intermediate requiring visual inspection growth 10 25 of control well and 2 resistant growth 25 of control well the absorbance profiles from the php plates were used to cluster the isolates and assign them to php types isolates with positive fermentation results in the negative control column of the php re plate column 2 cellobiose as well as isolates giving negative results on all tests were regarded as contaminated or non e coli and excluded from further analysis the pheneplate software was used to cluster the php re plate data and the diversity was calculated for each population of e coli as simpson s diversity index di as described by kwak et al 2015 the mann whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons of di values from the different sample types isolates showing susceptibility to all the 9 antibiotics used were regarded as sensitive whereas isolates showing resistance to at least one antibiotic or showing intermediate values to two or more antibiotics were regarded as resistant isolates showing resistance to cefotaxime and cefpodoxime were regarded as extended spectrum beta lactamase producing e coli esbl ec kwak et al 2015 the mar multiple antibiotic resistance index is a measure of the total resistance in a population of bacterial isolates krumperman 1983 martotal indices were calculated for bacterial populations by counting the total number of resistance features divided by the number of all resistance analyses for the isolates in the population removal of data for php replicates within individual samples i e multiple isolates with identical php patterns were only counted once yielded a martype index comparison between the martotal and martype indices indicates the prevalence of resistant isolates in the sample as the martype index will increase relative to the martotal when susceptible isolates are disregarded and vice versa phenotyping of 80 isolates per sample resulted in a number of common php types c types containing at least 5 of the isolates and major types m types containing at least 25 of the isolates less abundant types were defined as single types s types 3 results 3 1 sample and population structure in total 8 640 presumptive e coli isolates from chromagar were subject to typing and resistance determination table 1 of these 778 9 could not be confirmed as pure e coli and were excluded from further analysis all samples contained high numbers of e coli but concentrations varied much between sampling occasions table 2 the diversities of the total e coli populations were similar for all sites however for the 80 isolates analyzed from each individual sample there was a clear difference between the sample sources table 2 the composition of e coli in individual samples from hw often consisted of isolates belonging to the same php and resistance type and therefore showed low diversities e coli from cw samples were more diverse than those from hw samples p 0 001 whilst e coli in uw samples showed the highest diversity values for individual samples p 0 0001 similar to those of the whole collection of studied isolates fig 2 3 2 antibiotic resistance in total 42 of all studied e coli isolates were resistant to at least one of the nine antibiotics used here the rates of resistance to each individual antibiotic were calculated for each sample type fig 3 hw isolates showed the highest rates of resistance to all included antibiotics whilst isolates from uw presented the lowest resistance rates fig 3 the martype was reduced in comparison to the martotal for cw table 3 this indicates that the high resistance rates seen among cw isolates are to some extent due to the presence of resistant m or c types in contrast hw and uw displayed relatively higher php type specific martype indices compared to their overall populations of sampled isolates table 3 3 2 1 multiple antibiotic resistance only 53 of 7 862 0 7 isolates were found to be simultaneously resistant to gentamicin and chloramphenicol out of which 38 were isolated from hospital wastewater and the majority n 21 of these had identical phenotypes and resistance patterns and were isolated from the same sample thus probably being a single clone multiple resistance to at least eight of the nine included antibiotics was found in only 73 isolates 0 9 fig 4 only ten isolates seven unique phenotypes in nine samples were completely resistant to all nine antibiotics and they were also the only isolates expressing resistance towards both gentamicin and chloramphenicol i e no isolates showing resistance to 8 antibiotics or less were simultaneously resistant to gentamicin and chloramphenicol 3 2 2 extended beta lactamase producing e coli esbl ec esbl ec were more common in hw than in cw and uw table 4 the esbl ec isolated from uw showed the same high diversity as the total e coli population in uw indicating absence of clonal structures among these isolates esbl ec in hw showed a lower diversity this was mainly due to a dominance of specific esbl ec phenotypes in some samples in fact 160 of the 303 esbl ec isolated from hw belonged to common php types that were not identified in more than one sample in contrast in cw an esbl ec with a specific php type and with a consistent resistance pattern was found across almost all sampling occasions resulting in a low diversity for the population of esbl ec in these samples table 4 this specific php areb phenotype and resistance pattern was rare and almost completely absent in all other samples collected throughout the study another php type with an identical resistance profile as the aforementioned was also found in lower numbers eight isolates but on multiple occasions in the community site such persistence of specific types occurring over time was not observed for the other sampling sites most probably these isolates all belong to specific clones that were endemic to this sampling site for the duration of the study 3 2 3 co occurrence of antibiotic resistances the correlations between occurrences of resistance against the nine antibiotics for all 7 862 isolates were visualized in a dendrogram fig 5 resistance to the esbl marking antibiotics cefotaxime and cefpodoxime showed the highest correlation 0 82 but also the quinolones ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid showed high co occurrences 0 67 resistance to ampicillin tetracycline and trimethoprim appeared to be correlated but to a lesser extent whereas resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol were not correlated to any other resistances 3 3 similarities between antibiotic resistant e coli populations in order to visualize the similarities between antibiotic resistant e coli populations in different sampling sites i e can we observe the same resistant bacteria in the wwtp as in the sources hw and cw the combined php areb data for the resistant isolates were used to calculate population similarity coefficients sp kühn et al 1991 between the e coli populations of the different sampling sites table 5 both hw and cw showed higher similarities to the resistant e coli population in the uw from veas wwtp than they do to each other or to the population in non related uw from stockholm it thus appears to exist some influence from both the hw and cw on the resistant e coli population reaching the wwtp 4 discussion we have identified and compared e coli in wastewater from hospital and non hospital outlets with regard to their relative prevalence of antibiotic resistant e coli only a few studies have previously investigated antibiotic resistant bacteria in norwegian wastewaters jørgensen et al 2017 schwermer et al 2018 a country with a relatively low consumption of antibiotics in both the human and veterinary medical sectors also a relatively low prevalence of antibiotic resistant fecal coliforms and enterococci was found in norwegian wastewater compared to that of other southern european countries regarded as high consumers of antibiotics pärnänen et al 2019 in our study we found that hw contains high numbers of multi resistant e coli including esbl ec compared to community derived wastewater we also found that uw has a relatively low prevalence of resistant bacteria compared to the hw and cw investigated in this study we have compared resistance rates from the present study in oslo during 2016 2017 to data from a previous study made in stockholm during the years 2013 2014 kwak et al 2015 the two studies show very similar resistance rates despite being performed in different countries and years norway and sweden share many cultural factors including regulations of antibiotic use the similarity between resistance rates in the hospital samples of the two studies also highlight the usefulness and consistency of the screening method for antibiotic resistance applied despite lower and more fluctuating diversity levels observed in hw samples from both studies in the previous study performed in sweden it was found that the prevalence of antibiotic resistant e coli in uw and hw seemed to follow the trends of resistance development over time in the urban population and in clinical isolates respectively kwak et al 2015 it was concluded that analyzing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial isolates from wastewater could be an easy way to monitor antibiotic resistance among fecal bacteria in the society this method could also be used as an early warning system to detect new emerging resistances although the popularity and potency of molecular technologies have rapidly increased in the last 20 years loman and pallen 2015 cultivation based methods remain important tools in research and clinical diagnostics an essential aspect in utilizing wastewater as a surveillance tool for the corresponding population of individuals is the question of representability only 2 5 μl of urban wastewater were analyzed to yield the required 80 e coli isolates as a comparison roughly 290 000 m3 of wastewater runs through the veas wwtp every day thus we are only analyzing one in every 1014 bacteria nevertheless results obtained from the uw samples are surprisingly consistent as seen in fig 2 where diversity levels in all individual uw samples matched the discriminatory potential of the php system supporting the applicability of this sample type as a screening tool for the status of resistance in a human population in contrast individual hospital samples had lower diversities possibly reflecting their origin in a small population the distinct and relatively consistent results for each sample site are probably an indication that small samples of uw can be representative of a large population such as the one observed in this study php typing is also valuable as a quality control of individual wastewater samples as for instance samples containing clumps of fecal material holding multiple copies of the same strain would be easily recognized by their low diversity site wise comparisons of the combined php areb data in the resistant populations of e coli was performed by analyzing the percentage of isolates in a given population whose php areb profiles could be identified in one or several isolates present in the other and vice versa comparisons between urban wastewater and the hospital outlet and between urban wastewater and the community outlet from this study revealed a higher similarity to uw for both outlets than when comparing the community and hospital outlets to each other or to urban wastewater from a similar study in sweden table 5 kwak et al 2015 this indicates the baseline similarity between independent e coli populations the higher similarity between uw and the hospital and community outlets studied here however indicates that both cw and hw may have some influence on the composition of e coli present in the receiving wwtp on the other hand the volumes of wastewater expelled from the hospital and community outlets are similar to one another but only about 0 025 when compared to the total volume that the wwtp receives data not shown greatly limiting the impact of each individual outlet on the diversity and antibiotic resistance of e coli in the wwtp an interesting observation was the finding of reoccurring multiresistant php types in the cw indicating that the community outlet was constantly colonized by endemic strains of multiresistant e coli each sample consisted of 24 pooled aliquots of 200 ml wastewater thus diluting the potential inhabitants in the sampler tube in roughly 5 l before the sample was brought back for cultivation this drastically reduces the possibility that the low diversity and repeated observations of identical php types with the same resistance patterns during twelve months of sampling occasions in the community site could be artifacts from an improperly cleaned sampler sampling equipment was rigorously cleaned between sampling occasions see section 2 1 sample origin and collection of samples to reduce the risk of any carry over bacteria thus it is more reasonable to hypothesize that some e coli strains are surviving in the wastewater system in fact during a four year study on coliforms and aeromonas sp in tap water from a drinking water well a recurring clone of aeromonas was observed throughout the study period supporting the hypothesis of potential long time bacterial colonization in these harsh environments kühn et al 1997 the di of a bacterial population is valuable in determining if isolates are related for php re typing of e coli populations this index was 0 967 for the 2 693 urban wastewater isolates in the present study in the previous study on 1 325 isolates from urban wastewater in stockholm the di was almost identical 0 965 kwak et al 2015 several studies have indicated that this di value is stable in normal e coli populations and that lower di values indicate that the studied e coli do not belong to a randomized normal population but that the population contains many replicates of the same strain e g from the same fecal microbiota reyes et al 2009 landgren et al 2005 transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria can be due to spread of resistant bacterial clones in the population or a consequence of horizontal transfer of resistance genes between different bacterial clones or species andersson and diarmaid 2017 clonal spread is expected to yield a lower phenotypic diversity among resistant versus susceptible bacteria whereas similar diversities among resistant and susceptible bacteria would be expected in the case of horizontal transfer of resistance genes for e coli from the wwtp in our study di for all 1 800 susceptible e coli was surprisingly enough lower than for the 893 resistant isolates di 0 960 and 0 972 respectively although this difference is small it indicates that the clonal number is low among the resistant e coli in the wwtp but higher among the susceptible e coli thus clonal groups of susceptible e coli that do not easily assimilate resistance genes could exist in the urban wastewater this finding is also supported by previous results obtained in the study by kwak et al 2015 the mar index can be a useful tool when comparing resistance rates in different bacterial populations we have calculated the mar index in two different ways the martotal index denotes the value obtained when data for all isolates were included whereas the martype index denotes the value obtained when data from isolates belonging to common types only were included once per individual sample aligning them with single types a higher martype index than martotal index indicates that even though resistance levels were high as in the hospital effluents phenotypes which were more prevalent in the sample common and major types were in fact less resistant compared to the single types and as presented in table 3 the martype index in uw was also higher than the martot index this is an interesting observation since resistant bacteria have often been considered to be more successful than their susceptible counterparts in antibiotic containing environments such as hospital effluents which exert a continuous selective pressure towards antibiotic resistant bacteria hocquet et al 2016 on the other hand resistance is often considered to exert a fitness cost compared to the wild type hernando amado et al 2017 a theory that is supported by our findings in contrast the difference between martotal and martype indices in the cw population depicts a different situation in which resistance was more often found among common phenotypes it seems that some of these strains are endemic to the community outlet and as some of them were highly resistant esbl ec further investigation is needed in order to determine whether actions should be taken to eliminate such bacteria at the source in a study on esbl ecs in hospital and urban wastewaters gündoğdu et al observed a dominating phenotype present in all hospital samples making up 35 of the 198 esbl isolates analyzed gündoğdu et al 2013 in contrast we rarely identified recurring php types with esbl properties in different hospital samples in our study although we did observe reoccurring php types of esbl ec in the community samples we also found that the diversity of esbl ec in urban wastewater was identical to that of the total population of e coli this indicates that the presence of esbl carrying strains is not due to the spread of specific clones but rather that most e coli types may be capable of harboring esbl resistance genes although ctx m producing e coli commonly belong to the sequence type st131 bevan et al 2017 similar to the study in stockholm kwak et al 2015 the prevalence of esbl ec in our study was rather low 11 5 for hw and 3 7 for uw e g compared to the situation in poland where 37 hw isolates and 18 uw isolates were esbl ec korzeniewska et al 2013 in another study in spain esbl ec were found to constitute 12 of examined e coli from human and animal wastewater samples sabaté et al 2008 thus these studies detected presence of esbl at several times the frequency reported here to answer whether hospital outlets should be treated locally it is therefore important to define risks associated with multiple resistant bacteria in the country specific wastewater outlets kwak et al observed increasing resistance rates for e coli in uw during the years 2013 2014 kwak et al 2015 in our study we did not see increasing resistance rates over time in uw for any of the antibiotics during 2016 2017 data not shown this finding correlates well with the norwegian norm norm vet 2016 and 2017 reports that noted only slight variations in resistance rates in clinical isolates of e coli from urinary and blood samples between the two years norm norm vet 2016 usage of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in norway 2017 norm norm vet 2017 usage of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in norway 2018 as an example the frequency of esbl ec in the norm norm vet reports increased from 5 8 to 6 6 in blood cultures between the two years but remained unchanged for urinary isolates we observed a frequency of esbl ec in hospital wastewater collected during 2016 and 2017 of nearly twice that of the norm norm vet reports however data in the norm norm vet reports are collected from a different type of samples a total of 1471 e coli from all human clinical samples taken between june 1 2016 and may 31 2017 at the hospital from where the hw samples in this study originated were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing ast data not shown five of the nine antibiotics included in this study were routinely included in the clinical ast panel namely ampicillin cefotaxime ciprofloxacin gentamicin and trimethoprim these 1471 clinical isolates were collected from the same group of patients as those that contributed to the wastewater that was analyzed in this study therefore one could assume that these clinical resistance rates would mirror the rates found in our study however e coli isolated from the clinical setting showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance compared to what we observed in the corresponding hospital wastewater the antimicrobial susceptibility break points applied on the clinical isolates were two 2 fold dilutions below those used in this study which may have contributed to the discrepancy observed between these two populations of e coli it could also be an effect of a dilution prior to our sampling point antibiotic resistant bacteria are likely diluted between the hospital outlet and the wwtp inlet by other sources that contain relatively few antibiotic resistant bacteria in the same way patients not treated with antibiotics for their disease and employees whose microbiotas may comprise fewer antibiotic resistant bacteria could dilute the resistant e coli from the hospital setting visitors staff and patients with non infectious illnesses also use hospital lavatories all of which are groups with lower predisposition toward carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria this highlights the importance of identifying high risk outlets in terms of antibiotic resistant bacteria and that accommodation specifically designated patients with antibiotic resistant infections could be a potential approach in controlling this issue on the other hand the relative volumes of such outlets compared to the total volume of urban wastewater are negligible data not shown selective pressure caused by presence of antibiotics can lead to co occurrence of antibiotic resistance traits in the form of co and cross resistance in our collection of e coli isolates we observed predictably high co occurrences between antibiotics from the same antibiotic classes cefotaxime and cefpodoxime and ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid fig 5 we also identified a noteworthy co occurrence between the three unrelated antibiotics ampicillin tetracycline and trimethoprim which have completely different mechanisms for how they inhibit bacteria targeting cell wall synthesis protein synthesis and nucleic acid synthesis respectively co occurrence of resistance to the three unrelated antibiotics was most common in hw samples and least common in uw samples corresponding well with the frequencies of multiple resistance phenotypes observed in the various types of wastewater this finding is not new but emphasizes the impact that the use of antibiotics has on the evolution of resistance where the use of one antibiotic group can lead to simultaneous selection of resistance against several others we would likely have found an equally high correlation between resistances to trimethoprim and antibiotics from the sulfa group due to their similar and synergistic mechanisms hitchings 1973 but as this antibiotic is rarely used except in combination with trimethoprim it was not included in the study co occurrences with chloramphenicol were low in all samples for all antibiotics occurrences of resistance features against chloramphenicol and the antibiotics gentamicin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid and the cephalosporins were completely unrelated and in fact gave rise to weak negative correlations for all but ciprofloxacin this would indicate that the analyzed material is devoid of any mechanisms of cross resistance or plasmids carrying resistance genes against chloramphenicol together with any of the other antibiotics included in this study although previous studies have examined non hospital wastewater outlets only a few have to our knowledge compared occurrences of antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospital and urban wastewaters to specifically non hospital residential outlets like the community site investigated here bäumlisberger et al 2015 brown et al 2006 li et al 2015 the finding that non hospital wastewater like that of the community outlet studied here has a higher occurrence of resistant bacteria than the average urban wastewater highlight the importance of identifying other potential hotspots for antibiotic resistance contaminants besides the well recognized hospital outlets 5 conclusions measuring levels of antibiotic resistance in e coli from wastewater samples can be representative for the level of antibiotic resistance in the corresponding human population and can be used as an early warning system changes to resistance patterns in the society reliable results depend on precise and thorough sampling as well as quality controls to avoid conclusions based on replicate analysis of the same strains e coli in urban wastewater samples were highly diverse and seemed to represent well the e coli flora in the urban population whereas e coli in samples from hospital and community wastewater were less diverse and were frequently dominated by isolates from either single individuals or that were growing in the wastewater system high levels of resistant e coli in hospital and community wastewater but lower in the wwtp were found a seemingly endemic strain of multiresistant e coli was found in most community wastewater samples collected during one year a majority of the antibiotic resistant bacteria in wwtps are likely derived from the presence of such bacteria in the total population of the urban society as the relative contribution of the studied hospital wastewater was low the levels of antibiotic resistant e coli in hospital wastewater relative to the other sites included here were not sufficient to recommend implementation of local

18690,bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance patterns among the indicator organism escherichia coli were monitored in wastewater samples collected over one year from a hospital hw a

endemic in the wastewater system if so implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots e g hospital outlets could be used to decrease the amount of resistant bacteria in the wastewater e coli from hw n 2644 cw n 2525 and uw n 2693 were analyzed by biochemical phenotyping pheneplate system and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics areb system the phenotypic diversities of the total e coli populations were similar for all three sites simpson s diversity index di 0 973 however for individual samples hw showed low diversities median di 0 800 and the e coli flora was often dominated by strains that may have originated from the fecal flora of single individuals the diversities in cw samples was higher median di 0 936 and uw samples showed similar diversities as the whole collection of isolates median di 0 971 resistance to at least one of the nine antibiotics was observed in 45 of the hw isolates 44 of cw isolates and 33 of uw isolates resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol was uncommon 3 2 and 5 3 respectively whereas resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin was most common 24 and 31 respectively extended spectrum beta

clonal structure among these isolates common php types of esbl ec often dominated in each hw sample but were not identified across different samples whereas esbl ec in cw showed low diversity di 0 857 and were dominated by a specific php type that was found across almost all cw samples the antibiotic resistance rates were highest in hospital wastewater but surprisingly they were also high in the

increasing global problem in both human and animal health care transfer of antimicrobial resistance between bacteria and development of new resistance mechanisms are inevitable consequences of the continued use of antibiotics the widespread use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to the spread of resistant bacteria into many environments kümmerer 2009 kolář et al 2001 gaskins et al 2002 resistant bacteria are especially common in hospital environments from where they may reach the wastewater treatment plants wwtps via hospital wastewater hw hocquet et al 2016 little is known about the further fate of these bacteria and although some have found no evidence for selection for antibiotic resistance in wwtps flach et al 2018 others have found that large amounts of resistant bacteria possibly of hospital origin remain alive during the wastewater treatment process and are released into recipient waters rizzo et al 2013 monitoring antimicrobial resistance through national and international surveillance programs has increased the knowledge of dissemination of resistant bacteria a number of surveillance programs have been set up such as the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network ears net european centre for disease prevention and control 2017 eco sens kahlmeter and poulsen 2012 and central asian and eastern european surveillance of antimicrobial resistance caesar world health organization 2015 veterinary equivalents are run by the european food safety authority efsa and focus on monitoring antimicrobial resistance in commensal bacteria such as e coli in fecal samples collected from healthy animals large numbers of fecal samples from healthy humans are more difficult to obtain and therefore less is known about the normal human microbiota and its role as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria analyzing untreated wastewater collected from urban wwtps is an alternate method to sampling hundreds of individuals in the population from which the wwtp receives its wastewater kühn et al 2003 this method can be used as an early warning system for the emergence of new or rare types of antibiotic resistance as proposed already in the seventies by linton et al 1974 wastewater may work as a favorable niche for resistant bacteria and resistance genes originating from a population that produces the wastewater gao et al 2012 kümmerer 2003 munir et al 2011 reinthaler et al 2013 increasing resistance rates in urban wastewater uw has been found to correspond well to increasing antibiotic resistance rates in the human population reinthaler et al 2013 identification of the resistance rates in indicator bacteria in wastewater may also serve as a convenient tool to monitor changes in the resistance in the intestinal microbiota of the total human population e g to find out if changes to the antibiotic policy in a region would affect resistance rates of bacteria in human microbiota in that region some swedish studies have also described a correlation between resistance rates among bacteria in wastewater and in the corresponding human population blanch et al 2006 kühn et al 2003 a swedish clone of enterococcus faecium carrying ampicillin and fluoroquinolone resistance could be followed from its hospital origin torell et al 2003 to its presence in the hospital s wastewater iversen et al 2004 the clone was found further enriched in uw and also found in many samples from receiving waters iversen et al 2004 revealing a likely source for colonization of humans and animals with antibiotic resistant bacteria of hospital origin in the same study vancomycin resistant enterococci vre were found in 60 of uw samples in sweden and in 36 of hw samples iversen et al 2002 despite claims at the time that sweden was free of vre as a consequence of its restrictive antibiotic policy later a clonal group of e faecium vanb with the same resistance pattern as that isolated from hw a few years earlier was found to be the cause of a large proportion of 487 reported healthcare related vre in 2007 2009 iversen et al 2002 another study on 1300 e coli in wastewater in sweden using phenotyping php combined with resistance determination revealed high occurrences of resistant bacteria both in uw 34 of all e coli and in hw 55 kwak et al 2015 identifying wastewater outlets that can act as hotspots for antibiotic resistance may be of great importance berendonk et al 2015 in the present study we have analyzed the frequencies of antibiotic resistance in the e coli flora in wastewater from three sites connected to a sewage system in oslo norway the aims were to compare the diversities and the different antibiotic resistance levels in a hospital a community and in the total urban wastewater hopefully this could support a future decision on whether implementation of local treatment at certain resistance hotspots could reduce the total load of resistant bacteria in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample origins and collection of samples three sampling sites were selected specifically to be able to compare hospital effluents to non hospital effluents fig 1 hw was collected from the main outlet of oslo university hospital rikshospitalet a medium sized tertiary care hospital with over 500 hospital beds community wastewater cw was collected at a wastewater pump station in an area outside oslo city selected because its effluents exclusively originated from a residential area with approximately 510 inhabitants thus providing wastewater with no contributions from health care institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes and excluding any form of agricultural impact uw was collected at the inlet of the wwtp vestfjorden avløpsselskap veas this plant treats wastewater from more than 600 000 human inhabitants in the municipalities oslo asker bærum røyken and nesodden including wastewater from the hospital and community sampling sites used in this study to collect parallel wastewater samples in the wwtp compared to those collected from the two prior locations compensation was made for the estimated travel time of the wastewater from the hospital 6 h and community 4 h outlets to the wwtp inlet by sampling at three specific time points 8 a m hw 10 a m cw and 2 p m uw respectively raw untreated wastewater was collected at the same time from three locations every month from june 2016 through may 2017 three samples were collected monthly one per day during three consecutive days each sample was composited of 24 aliquots of 200 ml collected at hourly intervals for 24 h using two isco 2900 portable automatic water samplers hw and uw and one isco 3700 full size portable sampler cw teledyne isco lincoln nebraska usa all samplers were rinsed with water between daily samples and rinsed with water cleaned with 0 1 1 sodium hypochlorite klorin and bathed in 70 ethanol between monthly sampling occasions 2 2 isolation of e coli samples were kept at 4 c and analyzed within 12 h serial dilutions were made in phosphate buffered saline pbs and aliquots of 250 μl were plated on 14 cm petri dishes containing a chromogenic medium for e coli chromagar orientation chromagar microbiology paris france preheated to 37 c to reduce cellular stress using the plating bead method https www zymoresearch de rattler plating beads the plates were incubated overnight 16 18 h at 44 c to inhibit growth of non thermotolerant bacteria pink to dark red colonies with a surrounding halo on the chromagar orientation plates were regarded as presumptive e coli and further analyzed 2 3 analysis of e coli isolates 2 3 1 combined phenotyping and resistance determination after incubation 80 separately growing e coli colonies when available were picked from the chromagar plates with sterile toothpicks the colonies were inoculated into the first columns of ten php re plates of the pheneplate system 96 well microtiter plates containing eight sets of 11 dehydrated reagents phplate ab stockholm sweden www phplate se pre filled with 300 μl php suspension medium phplate ab kühn and möllby 1993 as described by colque et al 2014 aliquots of 10 μl were transferred from the inoculation column to each well on the corresponding row of the php re plate and then twice 20 μl to the first column of ten antibiotic resistance breakpoint areb plates phplate ab pre filled with 200 μl bbl mueller hinton ii broth bd le pont de claix france areb plates consist of round bottomed 96 well microtiter plates containing one column for preparing bacterial suspensions ten columns with dehydrated antibiotics and a growth control well for each bacterial isolate in the rightmost column antibiotics and their final concentrations in mg l were the same as described by kwak et al 2015 namely ampicillin 32 cefotaxime 2 ceftazidime 16 chloramphenicol 32 ciprofloxacin 4 gentamicin 16 nalidixic acid 32 cefpodoxime 3 tetracycline 16 and trimethoprim 16 with the modification that ceftazidime was excluded from the analysis bacterial suspensions of 10 μl were transferred from the first column of each areb plate to each well on the corresponding row the php re and areb plates were incubated for 24 2 hours at 37 c and images of each plate were produced using a desktop scanner hp g4050 fig s1a 2 3 2 data analysis each php re plate image was translated into 96 absorbance values by the pheneplate software phplate ab each well in the php re plates was assigned a numerical value based on its color with a gradient ranging from 0 bright yellow to 25 dark blue growth in each well in the areb plates was determined by size and density of the pellets formed in the round bottomed plates and resistance to each antibiotic was determined by the software as relative growth in its respective well compared to the control well column 12 results were read as 0 susceptible growth 10 of control well 1 intermediate requiring visual inspection growth 10 25 of control well and 2 resistant growth 25 of control well the absorbance profiles from the php plates were used to cluster the isolates and assign them to php types isolates with positive fermentation results in the negative control column of the php re plate column 2 cellobiose as well as isolates giving negative results on all tests were regarded as contaminated or non e coli and excluded from further analysis the pheneplate software was used to cluster the php re plate data and the diversity was calculated for each population of e coli as simpson s diversity index di as described by kwak et al 2015 the mann whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons of di values from the different sample types isolates showing susceptibility to all the 9 antibiotics used were regarded as sensitive whereas isolates showing resistance to at least one antibiotic or showing intermediate values to two or more antibiotics were regarded as resistant isolates showing resistance to cefotaxime and cefpodoxime were regarded as extended spectrum beta lactamase producing e coli esbl ec kwak et al 2015 the mar multiple antibiotic resistance index is a measure of the total resistance in a population of bacterial isolates krumperman 1983 martotal indices were calculated for bacterial populations by counting the total number of resistance features divided by the number of all resistance analyses for the isolates in the population removal of data for php replicates within individual samples i e multiple isolates with identical php patterns were only counted once yielded a martype index comparison between the martotal and martype indices indicates the prevalence of resistant isolates in the sample as the martype index will increase relative to the martotal when susceptible isolates are disregarded and vice versa phenotyping of 80 isolates per sample resulted in a number of common php types c types containing at least 5 of the isolates and major types m types containing at least 25 of the isolates less abundant types were defined as single types s types 3 results 3 1 sample and population structure in total 8 640 presumptive e coli isolates from chromagar were subject to typing and resistance determination table 1 of these 778 9 could not be confirmed as pure e coli and were excluded from further analysis all samples contained high numbers of e coli but concentrations varied much between sampling occasions table 2 the diversities of the total e coli populations were similar for all sites however for the 80 isolates analyzed from each individual sample there was a clear difference between the sample sources table 2 the composition of e coli in individual samples from hw often consisted of isolates belonging to the same php and resistance type and therefore showed low diversities e coli from cw samples were more diverse than those from hw samples p 0 001 whilst e coli in uw samples showed the highest diversity values for individual samples p 0 0001 similar to those of the whole collection of studied isolates fig 2 3 2 antibiotic resistance in total 42 of all studied e coli isolates were resistant to at least one of the nine antibiotics used here the rates of resistance to each individual antibiotic were calculated for each sample type fig 3 hw isolates showed the highest rates of resistance to all included antibiotics whilst isolates from uw presented the lowest resistance rates fig 3 the martype was reduced in comparison to the martotal for cw table 3 this indicates that the high resistance rates seen among cw isolates are to some extent due to the presence of resistant m or c types in contrast hw and uw displayed relatively higher php type specific martype indices compared to their overall populations of sampled isolates table 3 3 2 1 multiple antibiotic resistance only 53 of 7 862 0 7 isolates were found to be simultaneously resistant to gentamicin and chloramphenicol out of which 38 were isolated from hospital wastewater and the majority n 21 of these had identical phenotypes and resistance patterns and were isolated from the same sample thus probably being a single clone multiple resistance to at least eight of the nine included antibiotics was found in only 73 isolates 0 9 fig 4 only ten isolates seven unique phenotypes in nine samples were completely resistant to all nine antibiotics and they were also the only isolates expressing resistance towards both gentamicin and chloramphenicol i e no isolates showing resistance to 8 antibiotics or less were simultaneously resistant to gentamicin and chloramphenicol 3 2 2 extended beta lactamase producing e coli esbl ec esbl ec were more common in hw than in cw and uw table 4 the esbl ec isolated from uw showed the same high diversity as the total e coli population in uw indicating absence of clonal structures among these isolates esbl ec in hw showed a lower diversity this was mainly due to a dominance of specific esbl ec phenotypes in some samples in fact 160 of the 303 esbl ec isolated from hw belonged to common php types that were not identified in more than one sample in contrast in cw an esbl ec with a specific php type and with a consistent resistance pattern was found across almost all sampling occasions resulting in a low diversity for the population of esbl ec in these samples table 4 this specific php areb phenotype and resistance pattern was rare and almost completely absent in all other samples collected throughout the study another php type with an identical resistance profile as the aforementioned was also found in lower numbers eight isolates but on multiple occasions in the community site such persistence of specific types occurring over time was not observed for the other sampling sites most probably these isolates all belong to specific clones that were endemic to this sampling site for the duration of the study 3 2 3 co occurrence of antibiotic resistances the correlations between occurrences of resistance against the nine antibiotics for all 7 862 isolates were visualized in a dendrogram fig 5 resistance to the esbl marking antibiotics cefotaxime and cefpodoxime showed the highest correlation 0 82 but also the quinolones ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid showed high co occurrences 0 67 resistance to ampicillin tetracycline and trimethoprim appeared to be correlated but to a lesser extent whereas resistance to gentamicin and chloramphenicol were not correlated to any other resistances 3 3 similarities between antibiotic resistant e coli populations in order to visualize the similarities between antibiotic resistant e coli populations in different sampling sites i e can we observe the same resistant bacteria in the wwtp as in the sources hw and cw the combined php areb data for the resistant isolates were used to calculate population similarity coefficients sp kühn et al 1991 between the e coli populations of the different sampling sites table 5 both hw and cw showed higher similarities to the resistant e coli population in the uw from veas wwtp than they do to each other or to the population in non related uw from stockholm it thus appears to exist some influence from both the hw and cw on the resistant e coli population reaching the wwtp 4 discussion we have identified and compared e coli in wastewater from hospital and non hospital outlets with regard to their relative prevalence of antibiotic resistant e coli only a few studies have previously investigated antibiotic resistant bacteria in norwegian wastewaters jørgensen et al 2017 schwermer et al 2018 a country with a relatively low consumption of antibiotics in both the human and veterinary medical sectors also a relatively low prevalence of antibiotic resistant fecal coliforms and enterococci was found in norwegian wastewater compared to that of other southern european countries regarded as high consumers of antibiotics pärnänen et al 2019 in our study we found that hw contains high numbers of multi resistant e coli including esbl ec compared to community derived wastewater we also found that uw has a relatively low prevalence of resistant bacteria compared to the hw and cw investigated in this study we have compared resistance rates from the present study in oslo during 2016 2017 to data from a previous study made in stockholm during the years 2013 2014 kwak et al 2015 the two studies show very similar resistance rates despite being performed in different countries and years norway and sweden share many cultural factors including regulations of antibiotic use the similarity between resistance rates in the hospital samples of the two studies also highlight the usefulness and consistency of the screening method for antibiotic resistance applied despite lower and more fluctuating diversity levels observed in hw samples from both studies in the previous study performed in sweden it was found that the prevalence of antibiotic resistant e coli in uw and hw seemed to follow the trends of resistance development over time in the urban population and in clinical isolates respectively kwak et al 2015 it was concluded that analyzing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial isolates from wastewater could be an easy way to monitor antibiotic resistance among fecal bacteria in the society this method could also be used as an early warning system to detect new emerging resistances although the popularity and potency of molecular technologies have rapidly increased in the last 20 years loman and pallen 2015 cultivation based methods remain important tools in research and clinical diagnostics an essential aspect in utilizing wastewater as a surveillance tool for the corresponding population of individuals is the question of representability only 2 5 μl of urban wastewater were analyzed to yield the required 80 e coli isolates as a comparison roughly 290 000 m3 of wastewater runs through the veas wwtp every day thus we are only analyzing one in every 1014 bacteria nevertheless results obtained from the uw samples are surprisingly consistent as seen in fig 2 where diversity levels in all individual uw samples matched the discriminatory potential of the php system supporting the applicability of this sample type as a screening tool for the status of resistance in a human population in contrast individual hospital samples had lower diversities possibly reflecting their origin in a small population the distinct and relatively consistent results for each sample site are probably an indication that small samples of uw can be representative of a large population such as the one observed in this study php typing is also valuable as a quality control of individual wastewater samples as for instance samples containing clumps of fecal material holding multiple copies of the same strain would be easily recognized by their low diversity site wise comparisons of the combined php areb data in the resistant populations of e coli was performed by analyzing the percentage of isolates in a given population whose php areb profiles could be identified in one or several isolates present in the other and vice versa comparisons between urban wastewater and the hospital outlet and between urban wastewater and the community outlet from this study revealed a higher similarity to uw for both outlets than when comparing the community and hospital outlets to each other or to urban wastewater from a similar study in sweden table 5 kwak et al 2015 this indicates the baseline similarity between independent e coli populations the higher similarity between uw and the hospital and community outlets studied here however indicates that both cw and hw may have some influence on the composition of e coli present in the receiving wwtp on the other hand the volumes of wastewater expelled from the hospital and community outlets are similar to one another but only about 0 025 when compared to the total volume that the wwtp receives data not shown greatly limiting the impact of each individual outlet on the diversity and antibiotic resistance of e coli in the wwtp an interesting observation was the finding of reoccurring multiresistant php types in the cw indicating that the community outlet was constantly colonized by endemic strains of multiresistant e coli each sample consisted of 24 pooled aliquots of 200 ml wastewater thus diluting the potential inhabitants in the sampler tube in roughly 5 l before the sample was brought back for cultivation this drastically reduces the possibility that the low diversity and repeated observations of identical php types with the same resistance patterns during twelve months of sampling occasions in the community site could be artifacts from an improperly cleaned sampler sampling equipment was rigorously cleaned between sampling occasions see section 2 1 sample origin and collection of samples to reduce the risk of any carry over bacteria thus it is more reasonable to hypothesize that some e coli strains are surviving in the wastewater system in fact during a four year study on coliforms and aeromonas sp in tap water from a drinking water well a recurring clone of aeromonas was observed throughout the study period supporting the hypothesis of potential long time bacterial colonization in these harsh environments kühn et al 1997 the di of a bacterial population is valuable in determining if isolates are related for php re typing of e coli populations this index was 0 967 for the 2 693 urban wastewater isolates in the present study in the previous study on 1 325 isolates from urban wastewater in stockholm the di was almost identical 0 965 kwak et al 2015 several studies have indicated that this di value is stable in normal e coli populations and that lower di values indicate that the studied e coli do not belong to a randomized normal population but that the population contains many replicates of the same strain e g from the same fecal microbiota reyes et al 2009 landgren et al 2005 transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria can be due to spread of resistant bacterial clones in the population or a consequence of horizontal transfer of resistance genes between different bacterial clones or species andersson and diarmaid 2017 clonal spread is expected to yield a lower phenotypic diversity among resistant versus susceptible bacteria whereas similar diversities among resistant and susceptible bacteria would be expected in the case of horizontal transfer of resistance genes for e coli from the wwtp in our study di for all 1 800 susceptible e coli was surprisingly enough lower than for the 893 resistant isolates di 0 960 and 0 972 respectively although this difference is small it indicates that the clonal number is low among the resistant e coli in the wwtp but higher among the susceptible e coli thus clonal groups of susceptible e coli that do not easily assimilate resistance genes could exist in the urban wastewater this finding is also supported by previous results obtained in the study by kwak et al 2015 the mar index can be a useful tool when comparing resistance rates in different bacterial populations we have calculated the mar index in two different ways the martotal index denotes the value obtained when data for all isolates were included whereas the martype index denotes the value obtained when data from isolates belonging to common types only were included once per individual sample aligning them with single types a higher martype index than martotal index indicates that even though resistance levels were high as in the hospital effluents phenotypes which were more prevalent in the sample common and major types were in fact less resistant compared to the single types and as presented in table 3 the martype index in uw was also higher than the martot index this is an interesting observation since resistant bacteria have often been considered to be more successful than their susceptible counterparts in antibiotic containing environments such as hospital effluents which exert a continuous selective pressure towards antibiotic resistant bacteria hocquet et al 2016 on the other hand resistance is often considered to exert a fitness cost compared to the wild type hernando amado et al 2017 a theory that is supported by our findings in contrast the difference between martotal and martype indices in the cw population depicts a different situation in which resistance was more often found among common phenotypes it seems that some of these strains are endemic to the community outlet and as some of them were highly resistant esbl ec further investigation is needed in order to determine whether actions should be taken to eliminate such bacteria at the source in a study on esbl ecs in hospital and urban wastewaters gündoğdu et al observed a dominating phenotype present in all hospital samples making up 35 of the 198 esbl isolates analyzed gündoğdu et al 2013 in contrast we rarely identified recurring php types with esbl properties in different hospital samples in our study although we did observe reoccurring php types of esbl ec in the community samples we also found that the diversity of esbl ec in urban wastewater was identical to that of the total population of e coli this indicates that the presence of esbl carrying strains is not due to the spread of specific clones but rather that most e coli types may be capable of harboring esbl resistance genes although ctx m producing e coli commonly belong to the sequence type st131 bevan et al 2017 similar to the study in stockholm kwak et al 2015 the prevalence of esbl ec in our study was rather low 11 5 for hw and 3 7 for uw e g compared to the situation in poland where 37 hw isolates and 18 uw isolates were esbl ec korzeniewska et al 2013 in another study in spain esbl ec were found to constitute 12 of examined e coli from human and animal wastewater samples sabaté et al 2008 thus these studies detected presence of esbl at several times the frequency reported here to answer whether hospital outlets should be treated locally it is therefore important to define risks associated with multiple resistant bacteria in the country specific wastewater outlets kwak et al observed increasing resistance rates for e coli in uw during the years 2013 2014 kwak et al 2015 in our study we did not see increasing resistance rates over time in uw for any of the antibiotics during 2016 2017 data not shown this finding correlates well with the norwegian norm norm vet 2016 and 2017 reports that noted only slight variations in resistance rates in clinical isolates of e coli from urinary and blood samples between the two years norm norm vet 2016 usage of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in norway 2017 norm norm vet 2017 usage of antimicrobial agents and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in norway 2018 as an example the frequency of esbl ec in the norm norm vet reports increased from 5 8 to 6 6 in blood cultures between the two years but remained unchanged for urinary isolates we observed a frequency of esbl ec in hospital wastewater collected during 2016 and 2017 of nearly twice that of the norm norm vet reports however data in the norm norm vet reports are collected from a different type of samples a total of 1471 e coli from all human clinical samples taken between june 1 2016 and may 31 2017 at the hospital from where the hw samples in this study originated were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing ast data not shown five of the nine antibiotics included in this study were routinely included in the clinical ast panel namely ampicillin cefotaxime ciprofloxacin gentamicin and trimethoprim these 1471 clinical isolates were collected from the same group of patients as those that contributed to the wastewater that was analyzed in this study therefore one could assume that these clinical resistance rates would mirror the rates found in our study however e coli isolated from the clinical setting showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance compared to what we observed in the corresponding hospital wastewater the antimicrobial susceptibility break points applied on the clinical isolates were two 2 fold dilutions below those used in this study which may have contributed to the discrepancy observed between these two populations of e coli it could also be an effect of a dilution prior to our sampling point antibiotic resistant bacteria are likely diluted between the hospital outlet and the wwtp inlet by other sources that contain relatively few antibiotic resistant bacteria in the same way patients not treated with antibiotics for their disease and employees whose microbiotas may comprise fewer antibiotic resistant bacteria could dilute the resistant e coli from the hospital setting visitors staff and patients with non infectious illnesses also use hospital lavatories all of which are groups with lower predisposition toward carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria this highlights the importance of identifying high risk outlets in terms of antibiotic resistant bacteria and that accommodation specifically designated patients with antibiotic resistant infections could be a potential approach in controlling this issue on the other hand the relative volumes of such outlets compared to the total volume of urban wastewater are negligible data not shown selective pressure caused by presence of antibiotics can lead to co occurrence of antibiotic resistance traits in the form of co and cross resistance in our collection of e coli isolates we observed predictably high co occurrences between antibiotics from the same antibiotic classes cefotaxime and cefpodoxime and ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid fig 5 we also identified a noteworthy co occurrence between the three unrelated antibiotics ampicillin tetracycline and trimethoprim which have completely different mechanisms for how they inhibit bacteria targeting cell wall synthesis protein synthesis and nucleic acid synthesis respectively co occurrence of resistance to the three unrelated antibiotics was most common in hw samples and least common in uw samples corresponding well with the frequencies of multiple resistance phenotypes observed in the various types of wastewater this finding is not new but emphasizes the impact that the use of antibiotics has on the evolution of resistance where the use of one antibiotic group can lead to simultaneous selection of resistance against several others we would likely have found an equally high correlation between resistances to trimethoprim and antibiotics from the sulfa group due to their similar and synergistic mechanisms hitchings 1973 but as this antibiotic is rarely used except in combination with trimethoprim it was not included in the study co occurrences with chloramphenicol were low in all samples for all antibiotics occurrences of resistance features against chloramphenicol and the antibiotics gentamicin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid and the cephalosporins were completely unrelated and in fact gave rise to weak negative correlations for all but ciprofloxacin this would indicate that the analyzed material is devoid of any mechanisms of cross resistance or plasmids carrying resistance genes against chloramphenicol together with any of the other antibiotics included in this study although previous studies have examined non hospital wastewater outlets only a few have to our knowledge compared occurrences of antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospital and urban wastewaters to specifically non hospital residential outlets like the community site investigated here bäumlisberger et al 2015 brown et al 2006 li et al 2015 the finding that non hospital wastewater like that of the community outlet studied here has a higher occurrence of resistant bacteria than the average urban wastewater highlight the importance of identifying other potential hotspots for antibiotic resistance contaminants besides the well recognized hospital outlets 5 conclusions measuring levels of antibiotic resistance in e coli from wastewater samples can be representative for the level of antibiotic resistance in the corresponding human population and can be used as an early warning system changes to resistance patterns in the society reliable results depend on precise and thorough sampling as well as quality controls to avoid conclusions based on replicate analysis of the same strains e coli in urban wastewater samples were highly diverse and seemed to represent well the e coli flora in the urban population whereas e coli in samples from hospital and community wastewater were less diverse and were frequently dominated by isolates from either single individuals or that were growing in the wastewater system high levels of resistant e coli in hospital and community wastewater but lower in the wwtp were found a seemingly endemic strain of multiresistant e coli was found in most community wastewater samples collected during one year a majority of the antibiotic resistant bacteria in wwtps are likely derived from the presence of such bacteria in the total population of the urban society as the relative contribution of the studied hospital wastewater was low the levels of antibiotic resistant e coli in hospital wastewater relative to the other sites included here were not sufficient to recommend implementation of local

of acidogenesis that occurs within the reactor guang et al 2018 algapani et al 2017 which include butyric acid type propionic acid type mixed acid type and ethanol type the main products in mixed acid type fermentation are butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol propionic acid and acetic acid are the main products in propionic acid type fermentation which exhibits low hydrogen production capson tojo et al 2017 butyric acid and acetic acid are the main products in butyric acid type fermentation which has a hydrogen production capacity 4 5 times greater than that of propionic acid type fermentation suo et al 2017 ethanol and acetic acid are the main products in ethanol type fermentation which has a hydrogen production capacity 14 5 times greater than that of propionic acid type fermentation wu et al 2016 in the acidogenic process carbohydrates are more easily converted to propionic acid than butyric acid or ethanol the conversion of carbohydrates to propionic acid also provides more energy to the acidogenic fermentative microflora uhlenhut et al 2017 however according to chemical thermodynamics the degradation of propionic acid is more difficult than that of other acidogenic products which is detrimental to methanogenesis in anaerobic digestive systems li et al 2017 thus regulating the character of the acidogenic phase is essential to promote anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2017 during the acidogenic process high hydrogen partial pressures ph2 have an inhibitory effect on acidogenesis and hydrogen producing acetogenesis zhou et al 2017 high ph2 also inhibits methanogenesis thus the ph2 represents a major constraint in anaerobic digestion sarkar et al 2017 as the physiological and ecological characteristics of microflora are various in anaerobic digestions environmental factors such as ph have an influence on growth and metabolism the appropriate ph values for functional microflora also differ greatly chen et al 2017 low ph has been shown to inhibit acidogenesis and hydrogen producing acetogenesis which can restrict the growth of microbes in acidogenic fermentation rao et al 2018 propionic acid type fermentation can be changed to butyric acid type or ethanol type fermentation through ph regulation fang et al 2017 consequently ph also has an influence on anaerobic digestion predicting and regulating the acidogenic process is essential to promote methane production in anaerobic digestion systems and hydrogen production in acidogenic phase reactors numerous mathematical models have been developed to describe the anaerobic digestion process jeppsson et al 2007 arnell et al 2016 flores alsina et al 2016 among them anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 is the most widely used because of its strong generality and expandability girault et al 2011 in many studies of carbohydrate acidogenesis in adm1 the recommended stoichiometric coefficient values from the technical report of iwa have been employed these coefficients are based on the assumption that all the products of carbohydrate acidogenesis are produced in constant proportions because of this inaccurate assumption they did not adequately reproduce the experimental results uhlenhut et al 2017 by using experimentally determined variable product and biomass yields for the glucose degradation process the adm1 model can be applied to describe fermentative bio hydrogen processes this requires a minimum parameter calibration in addition to experimental determination of the pseudo steady state biomass and product yields penumathsa et al 2008 rodríguez et al 2006 reported that the use of a variable stoichiometry for the glucose degradation process is a suitable way to integrate metabolic variation into adm1 which is a generalised modelling approach for the anaerobic co digestion of fermentable substrates simulation results indicated that the type of fermentation products obtained is influenced by the operational conditions of ph2 and ph mosey 1983 costello et al 1991 romli et al 1994 the objective of this study was to investigate and extend the applicability of adm1 to butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentative systems for this purpose a modification of adm1 using a variable stoichiometric approach based on the ph2 and ph is presented calibration and validation of the modelling approach were conducted against experimental data from butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation in an anaerobic baffled reactor abr and continuous stirring tank reactor cstr 2 materials and methods 2 1 abr operation a four compartment abr was used to collect the basic data for the modification of adm1 to model the performance of acidogenic fermentation under anaerobic fermentation conditions fig s1 all four compartments of the abr had a volume of 7 1 l and included an up flow zone and a down flow zone with a volume ratio of 4 6 1 li et al 2016 the feed was pumped from a storage tank into the down flow zone of the first compartment using a peristaltic pump and the effluent flowed out of the reactor through a water tank that was attached to the last compartment and used as a water level controller the reactor was operated under mesophilic conditions 35 1 c for the treatment of wastewater full details of the reactor can be found in li et al 2016 the synthetic wastewater was a sucrose solution with added nahco3 nh4cl and k2hpo4 the influent chemical oxygen demand cod nahco3 nh4cl and k2hpo4 concentrations were maintained at 4000 3360 300 and 410 mg l 1 respectively this abr has been previously operated for 192 days by stages with a constant influent cod of 4000 mg l 1 li et al 2016 during the last stage the reactor was operated for 26 days with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and a cod removal of 94 4 was obtained during the steady phase with a hydrogen methane and co2 yield of 1 1 23 2 and 25 8 l d 1 respectively in the present research the reactor was continuously operated for 74 days and the operation process was divided into two stages in the first stage the hrt and organic loading rate olr were set to 16 h and 6 kg cod m 3 d 1 respectively from day 43 onwards the reactor was operated under double load conditions hrt 8 h olr 12 kg cod m 3 d 1 the sludge retention time srt in the reactor was 100 days due to the high cell retention time 2 2 model description the type of carbohydrate fermentation that occurs in an anaerobic reactor is influenced by the ratio of nadh nad θ and the ph2 mosey 1983 ruzicka 1996 yan et al 2014 as the substrate is oxidised to pyruvate the coenzyme nad is reduced to nadh and protons h are produced simultaneously cell mass and other products are produced from pyruvate these reactions are accompanied by the oxidation of nadh to nad as a consequence the continuous fermentation process is determined by the chemical equilibrium of reactions 6 and 7 the reactions involving the production and consumption of nadh and nad during acidogenesis are as follows 6 glucose nad pyruvate nadh h 7 pyruvate nadh cell products nad the reaction between hydrogen and nad can be expressed as 8 nad h 2e nadh 9 e mv e nad 0 29 55 log nadh nad h where e is the redox potential mv and e nad 0 is the standard redox potential of nadh nad which is 113 mv mosey 1983 at equilibrium e can be computed from the half reaction of h and h2 as follows 10 2h 2e h2 11 e mv e h 0 29 55 log p h 2 h 2 where e h 0 is the standard redox potential of h2 h which is 0 mv using the above reactions θ can be derived from the ph and ph2 as follows mosey 1983 masse and droste 2000 12 29 55 log p h 2 29 55 ph 113 29 55 log nadh nad 13 nadh nad p h 2 10 ph 3 82 θ the experimental ph and ph2 data were used to calculate θ traditionally the main products of carbohydrate fermentation are acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid yuan et al 2014 li et al 2009 in the present model the production and uptake of ethanol were introduced into the acidogenesis fermentation process thus the acidogenesis fermentation reactions can be described as follows 14 c6h12o6 4h2o 2nad 2ch3coo 2hco3 2nadh 2h2 6h 15 c6h12o6 2nadh 2ch3ch2coo 2h2o 2nad 16

producing propionic acid butyric acid and ethanol thus carbohydrate fermentation is regulated by θ based on the stoichiometry and mass balance the rates of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and ethanol production can be expressed by equation 18 21 masse and droste 2000 ruzicka 1996 mosey 1983 18 d ac d t 2 1 θ 2 ρ 19 d pro d t 2 θ 1 θ ρ 20 d bu d t θ 1 θ 2 ρ 21 d et d t θ 1 θ 2 ρ where ρ is the carbohydrate uptake rate the regulation factors η i for the production of acetic acid η 1 propionic acid η 2 butyric acid η 3 and ethanol η 4 via carbohydrate fermentation are shown in equation 22 25 22 η 1 2 1 θ 2 23 η 2 2 θ 1 θ 24 η 3 θ 1 θ 2 25 η 4 θ 1 θ 2 consequently the reaction stoichiometry is determined by η i and the mass balance as follows 26 f ac su 0 67 η 1 27 f bu su 0 83 η 3 28 f

expressions which are shown in the peterson matrix in table s1 the developed model consisted of 16 dynamic state variables and involved 14 biochemical rate processes the nomenclature and units applied were the same as those in adm1 batstone et al 2002 a monod type kinetic equation was used to express the uptake rates of sugars butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and hydrogen ethanol s et and ethanol degraders x et were also introduced into the dynamic state variables of the model to simulate the production and consumption of ethanol the initial biomasses of acidogens x su h2 producing acetogens x et x bu and x pro and methanogens x ac and x h2 were treated as random values during the optimisation of the model table s1 the initial biomass of each functional population was then estimated using the simulation data the stoichiometric coefficients for acetic acid and hydrogen production were 0 67 and 0 33 respectively as derived from the following reaction 31 c2h5oh h2o ch3cooh 2h2 the ethanol uptake rate was expressed as 32 ρ et k m et s et k s et s et x et i 2 2 3 biogas prediction at equilibrium the dynamic equations for the liquid gas transfer processes of ch4 h2 and co2 can be described by henry s law using equation 33 35 below respectively 33 ρ ch 4 k l a ch 4 s ch 4 64 k h ch 4 p gas ch 4 34 ρ h 2 k l a h 2 s h 2 16 k h h 2 p gas h 2 35 ρ co 2 k l a co 2 s co 2 k h co 2 p gas co 2 where k h ch4 p gas ch4 and s ch4 are the henry s law equilibrium constant kmol m 3 10 5 pa the gas phase partial pressure 105 pa and the liquid concentration kg cod m 3 of ch4 respectively k h h2 p gas h2 and s h2 represent the corresponding quantities for h2 and k h co2 p gas co2 and s co2 are those of co2 k l a ch4 k l a h2 and k l a co2 are the liquid gas transfer coefficients of ch4 h2 and co2 respectively the unit of s co2 is kmol m 3 the denominators 64 in equations 33 and 16 in equation 34 correspond to the cod equivalents kgcod kmol 1 of ch4 and h2 respectively however liquid gas transfer varies widely depending on the reactor size liquid flow gas flow and diffusivity values smith and stöckle 2010 in order to take the differences among the biogases into account three coefficients k l a ch4 k l a h2 and k l a co2 were used for ch4 h2 and co2 respectively ramirez et al 2009 because the mass transfer coefficient of a gas in a medium is proportional to the square root of its diffusivity smith and stöckle 2010 k l a co2 and k l a h2 could be calculated as follows from k l a ch4 36 k l a co 2 k l a ch 4 d co 2 d ch 4 1 2 37 k l a h 2 k

predict gas production are listed in table 1 k l a was then calibrated using experimental data obtained from the anaerobic fermentation systems the gas phase partial pressures of co2 ch4 and h2 were derived from the experimental data 2 4 model calibration and validation simulations were conducted using the software aquasim version 2 1 with the developed model the mixed reactor model provided by aquasim was used to simulate the mass transfer and conversion processes occurring in the bulk liquid of each compartment of the four compartment abr li et al 2016 four mixed reactors with a volume of 7 1 l each were modelled to represent the four compartments the reactors were connected in series by links to simulate the transfer and diffusion of soluble and particulate components along the compartments the integration of the gas state variables into the dynamic state variables allowed the proposed model to predict biogas production in the abr the calibration of the kinetics parameters was carried out using the iteration method blumensaat and keller 2005 to minimise the sum of squared errors between the predicted and experimental data obtained when the lab scale abr was operated in stages at hrts of 16 and 8 h the process variables including the acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid ethanol co2 ch4 h2 cod concentrations and the ph were applied for model calibration model validation was performed using two case studies in case 1 three mixed reactors each with a volume of 9 2 l were constructed using aquasim to simulate the mass transfer and transformation processes of the substances in the bulk liquid and gas phase in the three compartment abr experiment conducted by li et al 2007 the modified adm1 was applied to predict the vfa ethanol and h2 production model validation was implemented by comparing the deviations between the predicted data and experimental data in case 2 a mixed reactor model with a volume of 9 6 l which was the same as that of the laboratory scale cstr was constructed using aquasim to predict the vfa and ethanol production in the cstr via butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation the corresponding experimental data were reported in li et al 2009 the sum of squared error sse which measures the total deviation of the experimental data from the model outputs was used for the model validation and was calculated as shown below 38 sse i 1 n t 1 n y exp t y pre t x 2 where y exp is the experimental data y pre is the predicted data x is the model parameter and n is the number of measurements 2 5 analytical methods the influent and effluent of each compartment were sampled daily and their ph alkalinity and cod and vfa concentrations were measured the analyses of alkalinity and cod were carried out following the standard methods apha 2005 the ph was determined using a ph meter delta320 mettler toledo the samples for vfa measurements were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant was acidified using 25 h3po4 vfa analysis was carried out using a gas chromatograph sp6890 shandong lunan instrument factory china with injector column and fid temperatures of 210 c 190 c and 210 c respectively li et al 2009 the biogas produced in each compartment was measured using wet gas meters model lml 1 changchun filter co ltd after the water lock the biogas was sampled daily from the gas outlets using airtight syringes and 0 5 ml of biogas was injected into another gas chromatograph sp 6800a shandong lunan instrument factory china for the determination of ch4 h2 and co2 li et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between the ph2 and the acidogenic stoichiometry in the abr table 2 presents the h2 ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas and the average values of ph and cod removal in the four compartment abr during the final ten days of each operation phase the co2 concentration decreased while the ch4 concentration increased along the four compartments of the abr indicating that methanogenesis was enhanced in successive compartments at an hrt of 16 h the h2 ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas were 4 0 21 1 and 74 9 respectively in the first compartment while no hydrogen was detected in the latter three compartments these results suggested that fermentative acidogenesis dominated the first compartment the ch4 contents of the latter three compartments were 52 0 56 2 and 58 3 which indicated that methanogenesis dominated in these compartments when the hrt was further decreased to 8 h the h2 content increased to 9 1 in the first compartment this result suggested that the ph2 increased due to the higher loading rate leading to more acidogenic fermentation lower ph and greater inhibition of methanogenesis the ch4 content was obviously lower in the reactor operated at an hrt of 8 h than in that operated at an hrt of 16 h which suggested that methanogenesis was inhibited at the decreased hrt the ph and alkalinity showed an increasing trend along the four compartments table 2 at an hrt of 16 h the ph and alkalinity were 5 4 and 1635 2 mg caco3 l 1 6 2 and 1854 7 mg caco3 l 1 6 4 and 1981 5 mg caco3 l 1 and 6 6 and 2031 0 mg caco3 l 1 in the first second third and fourth compartments respectively when the hrt was decreased to 8 h the ph decreased by about 0 2 in each compartment the cod removals were 22 8 32 7 12 1 and 20 1 in the first second third and fourth compartments respectively at an hrt of 16 h and decreased to 14 7 12 2 10 3 and 5 9 when the hrt was decreased to 8 h the results also suggested that the mineralisation of organic matter occurred in all compartments the value of θ was derived from the ph and ph2 according to equation 13 and then the stoichiometry parameters f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su were estimated using equations 22 and 24 30 the average ph value of the four compartments of the abr was 6 0 0 4 fig s2 as shown in fig 1 at a ph2 of 0 04 atm and a ph of 6 0 f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su were 0 21 0 20 0 20 0 21 and 0 18 respectively in the results reported by aceves lara et al 2008 the stoichiometric parameters of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and hydrogen were 0 18 0 22 0 14 and 0 01 respectively ethanol production was not considered in their pseudo stoichiometric dynamic model aceves lara et al 2008 when the ph2 was further increased to 0 09 atm f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su became 0 15 0 34 0 18 0 19 and 0 14 respectively increasing the ph2 remarkably inhibited the production of acetic acid butyric acid ethanol and hydrogen via carbohydrate degradation which consequently resulted in decreased values of f ac su f bu su f et su and f h2 su the results confirmed that fermentative acidogenesis was influenced by the ph2 in the abr system 3 2 model calibration the model was calibrated using 74 days of experimental data during this time the hrt of the abr was decreased stepwise from 16 h to 8 h which resulted in the organic loading rate olr increasing from 6 to 12 kg cod m 3 d 1 the values of the parameters used in the model were derived from the reports of batstone et al 2002 romli et al 1994 and kalyuzhnyi 1997 table s2 based on the effect of ph2 on the acidogenesis fermentation the stoichiometry parameters f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su were estimated according to equation 13 30 fig 2 shows the predicted and experimental data for the vfa ethanol cod and biogas production in the abr the dynamic simulation of the vfa and ethanol concentrations using the calibrated model was accurate fig 2d e f g i j k m n o q r and s which indicated that the model was able to achieve good prediction of the experimental data collected from mixed acid type fermentation using the standard adm1 parameter values without any parameter fitting beyond the implementation of the variable acidogenic stoichiometry the predicted ch4 h2 and co2 production were in good agreement with the experimental data fig 2a b and c indicating that the liquid gas mass transfer of ch4 h2 and co2 could be described by equations 33 35 the estimated dynamic liquid gas transfer coefficients k l a ch4 k l a h2 and k l a co2 were 1 00 1 72 and 1 12 d 1 respectively which were appropriate for use in describing the liquid gas transfer of biogas in the abr the model predicted an instantaneous increase in biogas production in response to the shortened hrt during the 45th 74th days fig 2a b and c both h2 and ethanol were observed only in the first compartment meanwhile the ethanol concentration increased as did the hydrogen production a decline in the butyric acid concentration in the first compartment was predicted which indicated that the fermentation acidogenesis was influenced by the increased ph2 at an hrt of 16 h the highest vfa concentration was found in the first compartment fig 2e f and g and decreased along the following three compartments which indicated that the degradability of propionic acid butyric acid and acetic acid by the h2 producing acetogens and methanogens was enhanced in the latter three compartments li et al 2016 shi et al 2016 when the hrt was subsequently decreased to 8 h a remarkable increase in the acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid concentrations was observed in the latter three compartments the simulation results suggested that the first compartment of abr was an acidogenic phase which led to the accumulation of vfa and ethanol the increased vfa concentration resulted in a decrease in the ph and an increase in the ph2 which subsequently influenced the acidogenic pathway at an hrt of 8 h the accuracy of the cod prediction was reduced fig 2h l p and t at this higher flow velocity excess sludge floated into the liquid phase the organic matter in the excess sludge was detected as cod which resulted in an underestimation of the cod concentration furthermore the cod concentration in the latter three compartments was obviously higher when the reactor was operated at an hrt of 8 h than at an hrt of 16 h the significant increase in the cod was due to the accumulation of vfas in each compartment although the cod removal decreased to 43 1 in the reactor operated at an hrt of 8 h table 2 and an overload situation occurred the predicted data for the vfa ethanol and biogas production agreed well with the experimental data the results suggested that the model could accurately simulate anaerobic digestion in an abr 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 case 1 modelling ethanol type fermentation in an abr an investigation into ethanol type fermentation and hydrogen production from diluted molasses in a three compartment abr was conducted by li et al 2007 the experimental data obtained from their abr operated at a cod of 5000 mg l 1 and a temperature of 35 c was used to validate the model developed in this work during model validation the values of the biochemical and physicochemical parameters were in accord with those presented in table 1 and table s2 the acidogenic stoichiometry was estimated using equation 13 30 with an average ph of 4 25 and a ph2 of 0 51 atm the stoichiometry parameters f bu f pro f ac f et and f h2 were 0 10 0 12 0 32 0 27 and 0 20 respectively a comparison of predicted and experimental data including vfa ethanol and h2 production is shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the vfa ethanol and h2 production were predicted accurately in the three compartments the sse of butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol were lower than 0 04 fig s3 the results suggested that the developed model can be used to simulate ethanol type fermentation in an abr the three compartments showed variations in their biogas and hydrogen production during the acclimatisation period li et al 2007 during the 1st 13th and 14th 25th days which corresponded to the lag and acceleration stages the reactor showed mixed acid type and butyric acid type fermentation respectively li et al 2007 as h2 accumulated f et and f h2 increased while f bu and f pro decreased finally the mixed acid type and butyric acid type fermentation gradually transitioned into ethanol type fermentation on the 26th 55th days which corresponded to the stabilised stage the model predicted an average hydrogen production of 7 2 15 1 and 10 2 l d 1 in the first second and third compartments respectively which agreed well with the measured data the model also predicted average acetic acid concentrations of 0 432 0 767 and 1 094 g l 1 as well as ethanol concentrations of 0 443 0 634 and 0 908 g l 1 in the first second and third compartments respectively which were much higher than those of butyric acid and propionic acid fig 3 the ethanol type fermentation in the three compartment abr was simulated well by the present model 3 3 2 case 2 modelling butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation in a cstr the control of butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation in a cstr was investigated by li et al 2009 the estimated values of f bu su f pro su f ac su f et su and f h2 su in this cstr with ethanol type fermentation were 0 08 0 02 0 35 0 31 and 0 24 respectively table 3 the stoichiometry parameters f bu su and f pro su were lower than 0 1 indicating that the production of butyric and propionic acid was inhibited when the ph and orp of the acidogenesis system were further adjusted to 4 6 0 2 and 230 20 mv respectively by adding nahco3 to the influent the ph2 decreased to 0 31 atm and the estimated values of f bu su f pro su f ac su f et su and f h2 su were 0 42 0 08 0 21 0 09 and 0 20 respectively the simulation results indicated that the production of propionic acid and ethanol was inhibited and that butyric acid type fermentation occurred furthermore the value of f h2 su was lower than that during ethanol type fermentation the results suggested that the ph2 and ph clearly influenced the stoichiometry parameters of carbohydrate fermentation in the cstr finally when the ph was adjusted to 5 0 and the ph2 was further decreased to 0 065 atm the fermentation type switched from butyric acid type to propionic acid type the values of f bu su f pro su f ac su f et su and f h2 su were 0 05 0 50 0 24 0 07 and 0 14 respectively f h2 su had the lowest value in propionic acid type fermentation but the highest in ethanol type fermentation the simulation results confirmed that ethanol type fermentation was more suitable for hydrogen production although the vfa and ethanol concentrations showed great variations during the three types of fermentation the deviation expressed as the sse of the experimental data from the predicted data for butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol was small fig 4 since the sse method represents the square of the distance between the experimental data points and the models the sse value provides a numerical value that allows the goodness of fit of a given mathematical model to the data to be interpreted cheung et al 2001 this suggested that the developed model can be applied to simulate butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation in the cstr during ethanol type fermentation the predicted concentrations of butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol were 0 180 0 056 0 786 and 0 696 g l 1 respectively the sses of acetic acid and ethanol were lower than 0 02 indicating that the prediction of these products was more accurate during butyric acid type fermentation the predicted concentrations of butyric acid and propionic acid increased to 1 034 and 0 197 g l 1 respectively while those of acetic acid and ethanol decreased to 0 529 and 0 221 g l 1 during propionic acid type fermentation the concentration of propionic acid increased to 0 914 g l 1 which was highest among the vfas while those of butyric acid acetic acid and ethanol decreased to 0 091 0 439 and 0 128 g l 1 respectively the sses of butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol were lower than 0 04 indicating that the predicted results agreed well with the measured data thus the developed model can be applied to accurately simulate these three types of fermentation in a cstr 4 conclusion adm1 was modified by introducing a variable acidogenic stoichiometry determined using the ph2 ph and concentration of ethanol in the metabolites the modified adm1 modelled butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation systems with satisfactory prediction accuracy the predicted data which included the concentrations of vfas ethanol cod and hydrogen produced agreed well with experimental data obtained in an abr and a cstr which indicated that the modified adm1 can be used to simulate these four types of fermentation when the ph was increased from 5 2 to 6 6 acetic acid butyric acid and ethanol production were inhibited by the increased ph2 in the abr however at a ph of 4 25 and ph2 of 0 51 atm ethanol type fermentation could be achieved in another abr in the cstr the stoichiometry of acidogenesis was estimated using the ph and ph2 when the ph was increased from 4 2 to 5 0 the ph2 decreased from 0 50 to 0 065 atm f et su and f h2 su decreased from 0 31 to 0 24 to 0 07 and 0 14 respectively but f pro su increased from 0 02 to 0 50 as a result the fermentation changed from ethanol type to propionic acid type the thresholds of ph2 and ph in butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation systems can be predicted using this model which represents a valid mathematical tool for the regulation of fermentation type declaration of interests the

shenyang 110168 china school of material science and engineering shenyang jianzhu university shenyang 110168 china corresponding author iwa anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 is the most widely recognised and popular mathematical model for anaerobic digestion processes however the application of adm1 to acidogenic fermentation is limited by its use of constant stoichiometry to describe the formation of products via carbohydrate fermentation this study presents a modification of adm1 using a variable acidogenic stoichiometric approach in which the hydrogen partial pressure ph2 and ph are used to predict and regulate the acidogenic process the fermentation of ethanol and its kinetics were introduced into the model structure experimental data from mixed acid type fermentation in a 28 4 l anaerobic baffled reactor abr fed with a sucrose solution with a chemical oxygen demand of 4000 mg l 1 were used to calibrate the model parameters two case studies involving continuous ethanol type fermentation in an abr and a continuous stirring tank reactor cstr were used to validate the approach the modified model achieved good predictions of the experimental data collected from butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation in the abr and cstr using the standard adm1 parameter values without any parameter fitting beyond implementation of the variable acidogenic stoichiometry the ph2 and ph thresholds in butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation could be predicted using this model which was shown to be a valid mathematical tool for the regulation of fermentation type graphical abstract image 1 keywords modelling fermentation type variable stoichiometry adm1 hydrogen partial pressure 1 introduction due to the high microbial flora

of acidogenesis that occurs within the reactor guang et al 2018 algapani et al 2017 which include butyric acid type propionic acid type mixed acid type and ethanol type the main products in mixed acid type fermentation are butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol propionic acid and acetic acid are the main products in propionic acid type fermentation which exhibits low hydrogen production capson tojo et al 2017 butyric acid and acetic acid are the main products in butyric acid type fermentation which has a hydrogen production capacity 4 5 times greater than that of propionic acid type fermentation suo et al 2017 ethanol and acetic acid are the main products in ethanol type fermentation which has a hydrogen production capacity 14 5 times greater than that of propionic acid type fermentation wu et al 2016 in the acidogenic process carbohydrates are more easily converted to propionic acid than butyric acid or ethanol the conversion of carbohydrates to propionic acid also provides more energy to the acidogenic fermentative microflora uhlenhut et al 2017 however according to chemical thermodynamics the degradation of propionic acid is more difficult than that of other acidogenic products which is detrimental to methanogenesis in anaerobic digestive systems li et al 2017 thus regulating the character of the acidogenic phase is essential to promote anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2017 during the acidogenic process high hydrogen partial pressures ph2 have an inhibitory effect on acidogenesis and hydrogen producing acetogenesis zhou et al 2017 high ph2 also inhibits methanogenesis thus the ph2 represents a major constraint in anaerobic digestion sarkar et al 2017 as the physiological and ecological characteristics of microflora are various in anaerobic digestions environmental factors such as ph have an influence on growth and metabolism the appropriate ph values for functional microflora also differ greatly chen et al 2017 low ph has been shown to inhibit acidogenesis and hydrogen producing acetogenesis which can restrict the growth of microbes in acidogenic fermentation rao et al 2018 propionic acid type fermentation can be changed to butyric acid type or ethanol type fermentation through ph regulation fang et al 2017 consequently ph also has an influence on anaerobic digestion predicting and regulating the acidogenic process is essential to promote methane production in anaerobic digestion systems and hydrogen production in acidogenic phase reactors numerous mathematical models have been developed to describe the anaerobic digestion process jeppsson et al 2007 arnell et al 2016 flores alsina et al 2016 among them anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 is the most widely used because of its strong generality and expandability girault et al 2011 in many studies of carbohydrate acidogenesis in adm1 the recommended stoichiometric coefficient values from the technical report of iwa have been employed these coefficients are based on the assumption that all the products of carbohydrate acidogenesis are produced in constant proportions because of this inaccurate assumption they did not adequately reproduce the experimental results uhlenhut et al 2017 by using experimentally determined variable product and biomass yields for the glucose degradation process the adm1 model can be applied to describe fermentative bio hydrogen processes this requires a minimum parameter calibration in addition to experimental determination of the pseudo steady state biomass and product yields penumathsa et al 2008 rodríguez et al 2006 reported that the use of a variable stoichiometry for the glucose degradation process is a suitable way to integrate metabolic variation into adm1 which is a generalised modelling approach for the anaerobic co digestion of fermentable substrates simulation results indicated that the type of fermentation products obtained is influenced by the operational conditions of ph2 and ph mosey 1983 costello et al 1991 romli et al 1994 the objective of this study was to investigate and extend the applicability of adm1 to butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentative systems for this purpose a modification of adm1 using a variable stoichiometric approach based on the ph2 and ph is presented calibration and validation of the modelling approach were conducted against experimental data from butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation in an anaerobic baffled reactor abr and continuous stirring tank reactor cstr 2 materials and methods 2 1 abr operation a four compartment abr was used to collect the basic data for the modification of adm1 to model the performance of acidogenic fermentation under anaerobic fermentation conditions fig s1 all four compartments of the abr had a volume of 7 1 l and included an up flow zone and a down flow zone with a volume ratio of 4 6 1 li et al 2016 the feed was pumped from a storage tank into the down flow zone of the first compartment using a peristaltic pump and the effluent flowed out of the reactor through a water tank that was attached to the last compartment and used as a water level controller the reactor was operated under mesophilic conditions 35 1 c for the treatment of wastewater full details of the reactor can be found in li et al 2016 the synthetic wastewater was a sucrose solution with added nahco3 nh4cl and k2hpo4 the influent chemical oxygen demand cod nahco3 nh4cl and k2hpo4 concentrations were maintained at 4000 3360 300 and 410 mg l 1 respectively this abr has been previously operated for 192 days by stages with a constant influent cod of 4000 mg l 1 li et al 2016 during the last stage the reactor was operated for 26 days with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and a cod removal of 94 4 was obtained during the steady phase with a hydrogen methane and co2 yield of 1 1 23 2 and 25 8 l d 1 respectively in the present research the reactor was continuously operated for 74 days and the operation process was divided into two stages in the first stage the hrt and organic loading rate olr were set to 16 h and 6 kg cod m 3 d 1 respectively from day 43 onwards the reactor was operated under double load conditions hrt 8 h olr 12 kg cod m 3 d 1 the sludge retention time srt in the reactor was 100 days due to the high cell retention time 2 2 model description the type of carbohydrate fermentation that occurs in an anaerobic reactor is influenced by the ratio of nadh nad θ and the ph2 mosey 1983 ruzicka 1996 yan et al 2014 as the substrate is oxidised to pyruvate the coenzyme nad is reduced to nadh and protons h are produced simultaneously cell mass and other products are produced from pyruvate these reactions are accompanied by the oxidation of nadh to nad as a consequence the continuous fermentation process is determined by the chemical equilibrium of reactions 6 and 7 the reactions involving the production and consumption of nadh and nad during acidogenesis are as follows 6 glucose nad pyruvate nadh h 7 pyruvate nadh cell products nad the reaction between hydrogen and nad can be expressed as 8 nad h 2e nadh 9 e mv e nad 0 29 55 log nadh nad h where e is the redox potential mv and e nad 0 is the standard redox potential of nadh nad which is 113 mv mosey 1983 at equilibrium e can be computed from the half reaction of h and h2 as follows 10 2h 2e h2 11 e mv e h 0 29 55 log p h 2 h 2 where e h 0 is the standard redox potential of h2 h which is 0 mv using the above reactions θ can be derived from the ph and ph2 as follows mosey 1983 masse and droste 2000 12 29 55 log p h 2 29 55 ph 113 29 55 log nadh nad 13 nadh nad p h 2 10 ph 3 82 θ the experimental ph and ph2 data were used to calculate θ traditionally the main products of carbohydrate fermentation are acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid yuan et al 2014 li et al 2009 in the present model the production and uptake of ethanol were introduced into the acidogenesis fermentation process thus the acidogenesis fermentation reactions can be described as follows 14 c6h12o6 4h2o 2nad 2ch3coo 2hco3 2nadh 2h2 6h 15 c6h12o6 2nadh 2ch3ch2coo 2h2o 2nad 16

producing propionic acid butyric acid and ethanol thus carbohydrate fermentation is regulated by θ based on the stoichiometry and mass balance the rates of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and ethanol production can be expressed by equation 18 21 masse and droste 2000 ruzicka 1996 mosey 1983 18 d ac d t 2 1 θ 2 ρ 19 d pro d t 2 θ 1 θ ρ 20 d bu d t θ 1 θ 2 ρ 21 d et d t θ 1 θ 2 ρ where ρ is the carbohydrate uptake rate the regulation factors η i for the production of acetic acid η 1 propionic acid η 2 butyric acid η 3 and ethanol η 4 via carbohydrate fermentation are shown in equation 22 25 22 η 1 2 1 θ 2 23 η 2 2 θ 1 θ 24 η 3 θ 1 θ 2 25 η 4 θ 1 θ 2 consequently the reaction stoichiometry is determined by η i and the mass balance as follows 26 f ac su 0 67 η 1 27 f bu su 0 83 η 3 28 f et su 0 86 η 4 29 f h 2 su 0 33 η 1 0 17 η 3 0 14 η 4 30 f pro su f ac su f bu su f et su f h 2 su 1 the stoichiometry parameters derived from the ph2 were integrated into the biological kinetic rate expressions which are shown in the peterson matrix in table s1 the developed model consisted of 16 dynamic state variables and involved 14 biochemical rate processes the nomenclature and units applied were the same as those in adm1 batstone et al 2002 a monod type kinetic equation was used to express the uptake rates of sugars butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and hydrogen ethanol s et and ethanol degraders x et were also introduced into the dynamic state variables of the model to simulate the production and consumption of ethanol the initial biomasses of acidogens x su h2 producing acetogens x et x bu and x pro and methanogens x ac and x h2 were treated as random values during the optimisation of the model table s1 the initial biomass of each functional population was then estimated using the simulation data the stoichiometric coefficients for acetic acid and hydrogen production were 0 67 and 0 33 respectively as derived from the following reaction 31 c2h5oh h2o ch3cooh 2h2 the ethanol uptake rate was expressed as 32 ρ et k m et s et k s et s et x et i 2 2 3 biogas prediction at equilibrium the dynamic equations for the liquid gas transfer processes of ch4 h2 and co2 can be described by henry s law using equation 33 35 below respectively 33 ρ ch 4 k l a ch 4 s ch 4 64 k h ch 4 p gas ch 4 34 ρ h 2 k l a h 2 s h 2 16 k h h 2 p gas h 2 35 ρ co 2 k l a co 2 s co 2 k h co 2 p gas co 2 where k h ch4 p gas ch4 and s ch4 are the henry s law equilibrium constant kmol m 3 10 5 pa the gas phase partial pressure 105 pa and the liquid concentration kg cod m 3 of ch4 respectively k h h2 p gas h2 and s h2 represent the corresponding quantities for h2 and k h co2 p gas co2 and s co2 are those of co2 k l a ch4 k l a h2 and k l a co2 are the liquid gas transfer coefficients of ch4 h2 and co2 respectively the unit of s co2 is kmol m 3 the denominators 64 in equations 33 and 16 in equation 34 correspond to the cod equivalents kgcod kmol 1 of ch4 and h2 respectively however liquid gas transfer varies widely depending on the reactor size liquid flow gas flow and diffusivity values smith and stöckle 2010 in order to take the differences among the biogases into account three coefficients k l a ch4 k l a h2 and k l a co2 were used for ch4 h2 and co2 respectively ramirez et al 2009 because the mass transfer coefficient of a gas in a medium is proportional to the square root of its diffusivity smith and stöckle 2010 k l a co2 and k l a h2 could be calculated as follows from k l a ch4 36 k l a co 2 k l a ch 4 d co 2 d ch 4 1 2 37 k l a h 2 k

predict gas production are listed in table 1 k l a was then calibrated using experimental data obtained from the anaerobic fermentation systems the gas phase partial pressures of co2 ch4 and h2 were derived from the experimental data 2 4 model calibration and validation simulations were conducted using the software aquasim version 2 1 with the developed model the mixed reactor model provided by aquasim was used to simulate the mass transfer and conversion processes occurring in the bulk liquid of each compartment of the four compartment abr li et al 2016 four mixed reactors with a volume of 7 1 l each were modelled to represent the four compartments the reactors were connected in series by links to simulate the transfer and diffusion of soluble and particulate components along the compartments the integration of the gas state variables into the dynamic state variables allowed the proposed model to predict biogas production in the abr the calibration of the kinetics parameters was carried out using the iteration method blumensaat and keller 2005 to minimise the sum of squared errors between the predicted and experimental data obtained when the lab scale abr was operated in stages at hrts of 16 and 8 h the process variables including the acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid ethanol co2 ch4 h2 cod concentrations and the ph were applied for model calibration model validation was performed using two case studies in case 1 three mixed reactors each with a volume of 9 2 l were constructed using aquasim to simulate the mass transfer and transformation processes of the substances in the bulk liquid and gas phase in the three compartment abr experiment conducted by li et al 2007 the modified adm1 was applied to predict the vfa ethanol and h2 production model validation was implemented by comparing the deviations between the predicted data and experimental data in case 2 a mixed reactor model with a volume of 9 6 l which was the same as that of the laboratory scale cstr was constructed using aquasim to predict the vfa and ethanol production in the cstr via butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation the corresponding experimental data were reported in li et al 2009 the sum of squared error sse which measures the total deviation of the experimental data from the model outputs was used for the model validation and was calculated as shown below 38 sse i 1 n t 1 n y exp t y pre t x 2 where y exp is the experimental data y pre is the predicted data x is the model parameter and n is the number of measurements 2 5 analytical methods the influent and effluent of each compartment were sampled daily and their ph alkalinity and cod and vfa concentrations were measured the analyses of alkalinity and cod were carried out following the standard methods apha 2005 the ph was determined using a ph meter delta320 mettler toledo the samples for vfa measurements were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant was acidified using 25 h3po4 vfa analysis was carried out using a gas chromatograph sp6890 shandong lunan instrument factory china with injector column and fid temperatures of 210 c 190 c and 210 c respectively li et al 2009 the biogas produced in each compartment was measured using wet gas meters model lml 1 changchun filter co ltd after the water lock the biogas was sampled daily from the gas outlets using airtight syringes and 0 5 ml of biogas was injected into another gas chromatograph sp 6800a shandong lunan instrument factory china for the determination of ch4 h2 and co2 li et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between the ph2 and the acidogenic stoichiometry in the abr table 2 presents the h2 ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas and the average values of ph and cod removal in the four compartment abr during the final ten days of each operation phase the co2 concentration decreased while the ch4 concentration increased along the four compartments of the abr indicating that methanogenesis was enhanced in successive compartments at an hrt of 16 h the h2 ch4 and co2 contents of the biogas were 4 0 21 1 and 74 9 respectively in the first compartment while no hydrogen was detected in the latter three compartments these results suggested that fermentative acidogenesis dominated the first compartment the ch4 contents of the latter three compartments were 52 0 56 2 and 58 3 which indicated that methanogenesis dominated in these compartments when the hrt was further decreased to 8 h the h2 content increased to 9 1 in the first compartment this result suggested that the ph2 increased due to the higher loading rate leading to more acidogenic fermentation lower ph and greater inhibition of methanogenesis the ch4 content was obviously lower in the reactor operated at an hrt of 8 h than in that operated at an hrt of 16 h which suggested that methanogenesis was inhibited at the decreased hrt the ph and alkalinity showed an increasing trend along the four compartments table 2 at an hrt of 16 h the ph and alkalinity were 5 4 and 1635 2 mg caco3 l 1 6 2 and 1854 7 mg caco3 l 1 6 4 and 1981 5 mg caco3 l 1 and 6 6 and 2031 0 mg caco3 l 1 in the first second third and fourth compartments respectively when the hrt was decreased to 8 h the ph decreased by about 0 2 in each compartment the cod removals were 22 8 32 7 12 1 and 20 1 in the first second third and fourth compartments respectively at an hrt of 16 h and decreased to 14 7 12 2 10 3 and 5 9 when the hrt was decreased to 8 h the results also suggested that the mineralisation of organic matter occurred in all compartments the value of θ was derived from the ph and ph2 according to equation 13 and then the stoichiometry parameters f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su were estimated using equations 22 and 24 30 the average ph value of the four compartments of the abr was 6 0 0 4 fig s2 as shown in fig 1 at a ph2 of 0 04 atm and a ph of 6 0 f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su were 0 21 0 20 0 20 0 21 and 0 18 respectively in the results reported by aceves lara et al 2008 the stoichiometric parameters of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid and hydrogen were 0 18 0 22 0 14 and 0 01 respectively ethanol production was not considered in their pseudo stoichiometric dynamic model aceves lara et al 2008 when the ph2 was further increased to 0 09 atm f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su became 0 15 0 34 0 18 0 19 and 0 14 respectively increasing the ph2 remarkably inhibited the production of acetic acid butyric acid ethanol and hydrogen via carbohydrate degradation which consequently resulted in decreased values of f ac su f bu su f et su and f h2 su the results confirmed that fermentative acidogenesis was influenced by the ph2 in the abr system 3 2 model calibration the model was calibrated using 74 days of experimental data during this time the hrt of the abr was decreased stepwise from 16 h to 8 h which resulted in the organic loading rate olr increasing from 6 to 12 kg cod m 3 d 1 the values of the parameters used in the model were derived from the reports of batstone et al 2002 romli et al 1994 and kalyuzhnyi 1997 table s2 based on the effect of ph2 on the acidogenesis fermentation the stoichiometry parameters f ac su f pro su f bu su f et su and f h2 su were estimated according to equation 13 30 fig 2 shows the predicted and experimental data for the vfa ethanol cod and biogas production in the abr the dynamic simulation of the vfa and ethanol concentrations using the calibrated model was accurate fig 2d e f g i j k m n o q r and s which indicated that the model was able to achieve good prediction of the experimental data collected from mixed acid type fermentation using the standard adm1 parameter values without any parameter fitting beyond the implementation of the variable acidogenic stoichiometry the predicted ch4 h2 and co2 production were in good agreement with the experimental data fig 2a b and c indicating that the liquid gas mass transfer of ch4 h2 and co2 could be described by equations 33 35 the estimated dynamic liquid gas transfer coefficients k l a ch4 k l a h2 and k l a co2 were 1 00 1 72 and 1 12 d 1 respectively which were appropriate for use in describing the liquid gas transfer of biogas in the abr the model predicted an instantaneous increase in biogas production in response to the shortened hrt during the 45th 74th days fig 2a b and c both h2 and ethanol were observed only in the first compartment meanwhile the ethanol concentration increased as did the hydrogen production a decline in the butyric acid concentration in the first compartment was predicted which indicated that the fermentation acidogenesis was influenced by the increased ph2 at an hrt of 16 h the highest vfa concentration was found in the first compartment fig 2e f and g and decreased along the following three compartments which indicated that the degradability of propionic acid butyric acid and acetic acid by the h2 producing acetogens and methanogens was enhanced in the latter three compartments li et al 2016 shi et al 2016 when the hrt was subsequently decreased to 8 h a remarkable increase in the acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid concentrations was observed in the latter three compartments the simulation results suggested that the first compartment of abr was an acidogenic phase which led to the accumulation of vfa and ethanol the increased vfa concentration resulted in a decrease in the ph and an increase in the ph2 which subsequently influenced the acidogenic pathway at an hrt of 8 h the accuracy of the cod prediction was reduced fig 2h l p and t at this higher flow velocity excess sludge floated into the liquid phase the organic matter in the excess sludge was detected as cod which resulted in an underestimation of the cod concentration furthermore the cod concentration in the latter three compartments was obviously higher when the reactor was operated at an hrt of 8 h than at an hrt of 16 h the significant increase in the cod was due to the accumulation of vfas in each compartment although the cod removal decreased to 43 1 in the reactor operated at an hrt of 8 h table 2 and an overload situation occurred the predicted data for the vfa ethanol and biogas production agreed well with the experimental data the results suggested that the model could accurately simulate anaerobic digestion in an abr 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 case 1 modelling ethanol type fermentation in an abr an investigation into ethanol type fermentation and hydrogen production from diluted molasses in a three compartment abr was conducted by li et al 2007 the experimental data obtained from their abr operated at a cod of 5000 mg l 1 and a temperature of 35 c was used to validate the model developed in this work during model validation the values of the biochemical and physicochemical parameters were in accord with those presented in table 1 and table s2 the acidogenic stoichiometry was estimated using equation 13 30 with an average ph of 4 25 and a ph2 of 0 51 atm the stoichiometry parameters f bu f pro f ac f et and f h2 were 0 10 0 12 0 32 0 27 and 0 20 respectively a comparison of predicted and experimental data including vfa ethanol and h2 production is shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the vfa ethanol and h2 production were predicted accurately in the three compartments the sse of butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol were lower than 0 04 fig s3 the results suggested that the developed model can be used to simulate ethanol type fermentation in an abr the three compartments showed variations in their biogas and hydrogen production during the acclimatisation period li et al 2007 during the 1st 13th and 14th 25th days which corresponded to the lag and acceleration stages the reactor showed mixed acid type and butyric acid type fermentation respectively li et al 2007 as h2 accumulated f et and f h2 increased while f bu and f pro decreased finally the mixed acid type and butyric acid type fermentation gradually transitioned into ethanol type fermentation on the 26th 55th days which corresponded to the stabilised stage the model predicted an average hydrogen production of 7 2 15 1 and 10 2 l d 1 in the first second and third compartments respectively which agreed well with the measured data the model also predicted average acetic acid concentrations of 0 432 0 767 and 1 094 g l 1 as well as ethanol concentrations of 0 443 0 634 and 0 908 g l 1 in the first second and third compartments respectively which were much higher than those of butyric acid and propionic acid fig 3 the ethanol type fermentation in the three compartment abr was simulated well by the present model 3 3 2 case 2 modelling butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation in a cstr the control of butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation in a cstr was investigated by li et al 2009 the estimated values of f bu su f pro su f ac su f et su and f h2 su in this cstr with ethanol type fermentation were 0 08 0 02 0 35 0 31 and 0 24 respectively table 3 the stoichiometry parameters f bu su and f pro su were lower than 0 1 indicating that the production of butyric and propionic acid was inhibited when the ph and orp of the acidogenesis system were further adjusted to 4 6 0 2 and 230 20 mv respectively by adding nahco3 to the influent the ph2 decreased to 0 31 atm and the estimated values of f bu su f pro su f ac su f et su and f h2 su were 0 42 0 08 0 21 0 09 and 0 20 respectively the simulation results indicated that the production of propionic acid and ethanol was inhibited and that butyric acid type fermentation occurred furthermore the value of f h2 su was lower than that during ethanol type fermentation the results suggested that the ph2 and ph clearly influenced the stoichiometry parameters of carbohydrate fermentation in the cstr finally when the ph was adjusted to 5 0 and the ph2 was further decreased to 0 065 atm the fermentation type switched from butyric acid type to propionic acid type the values of f bu su f pro su f ac su f et su and f h2 su were 0 05 0 50 0 24 0 07 and 0 14 respectively f h2 su had the lowest value in propionic acid type fermentation but the highest in ethanol type fermentation the simulation results confirmed that ethanol type fermentation was more suitable for hydrogen production although the vfa and ethanol concentrations showed great variations during the three types of fermentation the deviation expressed as the sse of the experimental data from the predicted data for butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol was small fig 4 since the sse method represents the square of the distance between the experimental data points and the models the sse value provides a numerical value that allows the goodness of fit of a given mathematical model to the data to be interpreted cheung et al 2001 this suggested that the developed model can be applied to simulate butyric acid propionic acid and ethanol type fermentation in the cstr during ethanol type fermentation the predicted concentrations of butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol were 0 180 0 056 0 786 and 0 696 g l 1 respectively the sses of acetic acid and ethanol were lower than 0 02 indicating that the prediction of these products was more accurate during butyric acid type fermentation the predicted concentrations of butyric acid and propionic acid increased to 1 034 and 0 197 g l 1 respectively while those of acetic acid and ethanol decreased to 0 529 and 0 221 g l 1 during propionic acid type fermentation the concentration of propionic acid increased to 0 914 g l 1 which was highest among the vfas while those of butyric acid acetic acid and ethanol decreased to 0 091 0 439 and 0 128 g l 1 respectively the sses of butyric acid propionic acid acetic acid and ethanol were lower than 0 04 indicating that the predicted results agreed well with the measured data thus the developed model can be applied to accurately simulate these three types of fermentation in a cstr 4 conclusion adm1 was modified by introducing a variable acidogenic stoichiometry determined using the ph2 ph and concentration of ethanol in the metabolites the modified adm1 modelled butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation systems with satisfactory prediction accuracy the predicted data which included the concentrations of vfas ethanol cod and hydrogen produced agreed well with experimental data obtained in an abr and a cstr which indicated that the modified adm1 can be used to simulate these four types of fermentation when the ph was increased from 5 2 to 6 6 acetic acid butyric acid and ethanol production were inhibited by the increased ph2 in the abr however at a ph of 4 25 and ph2 of 0 51 atm ethanol type fermentation could be achieved in another abr in the cstr the stoichiometry of acidogenesis was estimated using the ph and ph2 when the ph was increased from 4 2 to 5 0 the ph2 decreased from 0 50 to 0 065 atm f et su and f h2 su decreased from 0 31 to 0 24 to 0 07 and 0 14 respectively but f pro su increased from 0 02 to 0 50 as a result the fermentation changed from ethanol type to propionic acid type the thresholds of ph2 and ph in butyric acid propionic acid mixed acid and ethanol type fermentation systems can be predicted using this model which represents a valid mathematical tool for the regulation of fermentation type declaration of interests the

18692,while the visible light driven photocatalytic disinfection techniques for drinking water have recently attracted tremendous attentions it is necessary to further improve the solar energy utilization efficiency in this study we synthesized pb bifeo3 photocatalysts doped with different amounts of reduced graphene oxide pb bifeo3 rgo the photocatalytic disinfection efficiencies toward gram negative escherichia coli e coli and gram positive staphylococcus aureus s aureus were evaluated under visible light irradiation λ 400 nm the results indicated that pb bifeo3 with 0 5 wt rgo pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited the highest disinfection efficiency complete inactivation was reached within 30 min and 90 min for e coli and s aureus respectively the transcriptomic analysis results indicated that pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo deregulates the genes in e coli cells that are involved in the cell membrane damage and oxidative stress responses this was validated by the cell leakage of nucleic acids or proteins transmission electron microscopy images of the bacteria and the disinfection efficiency decrease caused by the introduction of scavenger of hydroxyl radical ho metal ions pb2 bi2 and fe3 released from the photocatalysts did not contribute to the disinfection process for the first time our results elucidated that the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism of pb bifeo3 rgo toward e coli was mainly associated with oxidative stress due to ho generation and the loss of membrane integrity from direct contact with the photocatalyst after four consecutive cycles the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst exhibited a strong antibacterial efficiency the excellent disinfection efficiency and stability of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo suggests that this photocatalyst shows great potential for drinking water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords visible light pb bifeo3 rgo disinfection transcriptomics oxidative stress membrane damage 1 introduction microbiological contamination of drinking water is a cause of major disease outbreaks in both developing and developed countries ashbolt 2004 dobrowsky et al 2014 in recent years microbial contamination has caused an adverse effect on organisms and became a major concern to the global population ashbolt 2004 wright et al 2004 although filtration chlorination ozone and light exposure ultraviolet or visible light have been demonstrated to be efficient means of drinking water disinfection these technologies were found to have several limitations such as high cost generation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts and regrowth of resistant bacteria carr et al 2016 li et al 2008 miranda et al 2016 therefore it is essential to develop effective and economical water purification technologies for treating microbially contaminated water photocatalytic techniques have recently attracted tremendous attention for the disinfection of microbes in water especially visible light driven photocatalytic techniques levchuk et al 2018 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 perovskite type bismuth ferrite bifeo3 one of the most important multiferroic materials possessing simultaneous magnetic and electric ordering has recently received considerable attention as a promising photocatalyst li et al 2010 2013 shang et al 2018 due to their small band gap 2 2 ev bifeo3 photocatalysts are sensitive to visible light and exhibit a high photocatalytic efficiency in the visible range li et al 2010 2013 however the fast recombination of photogenerated electron e hole h pairs and the low utilization efficiency of visible light have considerably limited their application li et al 2013 shang et al 2018 improvements of the antibacterial efficiency of bifeo3 in the visible light range are still being actively explored for its practical use different materials have been incorporated into bifeo3 photocatalysts to improve their disinfection efficiencies gurunathan et al 2012 liu et al 2011 among these materials reduced graphene oxide rgo a fascinating photosensitizer with strong antibacterial activity gurunathan et al 2012 liu et al 2011 has been incorporated into bifeo3 to improve its photocatalytic efficiency soltani and lee 2016 zhou et al 2018 given its high charge mobility and high electrical conductivity rgo may promote the transportation of e away from the surface of bifeo3 and thus reduce the recombination rate of the charge carriers e h pairs and improve the photocatalytic performance of bifeo3 soltani and lee 2016 zhou et al 2018 moreover the intercalated pb dopants can coordinate with bi3 to provide active reaction sites thus promoting the photocatalytic performance of bifeo3 li et al 2017 therefore we speculate that decorating bifeo3 with rgo and pb may similarly enhance the antibacterial activity of bifeo3 which is a method that has not yet been elaborated on in the literature the visible light driven photocatalytic disinfection mechanisms have been summarized there is much debate with respect to the reactive species that play critical roles in the photocatalytic disinfection process several studies have reported that the photocatalytic disinfection is an oxidation process that is initiated by hydroxyl radicals ho and or photogenerated holes deng et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 however other studies have elucidated that the photocatalytic disinfection is a reductive process based on the photoinduced electrons in the photocatalyst jin et al 2013 several studies have demonstrated that either o2 or h2o2 may also play important roles in the photocatalytic disinfection process maness et al 1999 however the possible bactericidal mechanisms responsible for the photocatalytic disinfection activities of pb bifeo3 rgo are not clear and require systematic investigation pb bifeo3 rgo was synthesized by decorating pb and rgo nanoparticles onto the surface of bifeo3 via a hydrothermal method the objective of this study was to investigate the disinfection efficiencies of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts on gram negative escherichia coli e coli and gram positive staphylococcus aureus s aureus under visible light irradiation e coli were chosen as a model organism to elucidate the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism because their genome has been well studied and they are the best microbial indicator in drinking water for public health edberg et al 2000 welch et al 2002 a transcriptomic approach was used to elucidate the disinfection mechanism of pb bifeo3 rgo which was supported by biochemical studies focusing on damage of bacterial cell membrane reactive oxygen species ros related processes and dissolution of the photocatalyst the stability of the photocatalyst was assessed to investigate its stability and reusability 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts the chemicals used in this study are provided in section s1 the detailed preparation methods of the pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts with different doping amounts of rgo pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 0 25 0 38 0 50 and 1 00 have been reported previously li et al 2017 in brief 0 25 0 38 0 5 or 1 0 wt of rgo was added to a mixture of fe no3 3 9h2o pb no3 2 at 2 0 wt of bifeo3 and bi no3 3 5h2o after stirring for 15 min 1 0 m naoh was added to the mixture to produce a brown precipitate and the entire solution was then transferred to a teflon container and heated in a microwave oven the powder was washed with water and ethanol filtered dried and ground into a fine powder the morphologies of the photocatalysts were

instruments worcestershire uk the absorption spectra of the photocatalysts were recorded on a uv vis spectrophotometer specord 200 analytik jena germany over a wavelength range of 200 800 nm 2 2 photocatalytic disinfection experiment both e coli and s aureus were cultured and harvested according to the reported method deng et al 2017 li et al 2018 the disinfection assays were conducted in a double walled beaker under irradiation from a xenon lamp 300 w osram instruments usa with a 400 nm uv cutoff filter to simulate visible light the light intensity on the surface of the reaction suspension was 58 2 mw cm 2 in each disinfection experiment 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs 2 mm phosphate ph 7 2 with bacteria added at a cell density

method li et al 2018 shang et al 2017a 2017b five parallel experiments were conducted to confirm their reproducibility 2 3 transcriptomic analysis the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 ml of pbs at a final concentration of 100 mg l 1 with e coli after irradiation for 30 min the bacterial suspensions were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min the control experiment was untreated e coli without light irradiation the extraction of the total rna fragmentation of mrna cdna synthesis end reparation and single nucleotide a addition were performed by igenecode biotech co ltd beijing china then suitable fragments were selected for pcr amplification after agarose gel electrophoresis an agilent 2100 bioanaylzer agilent technologies palo alto ca usa and an abi steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems foster city ca usa were used in the quantification and qualification of the sample library finally the library was sequenced using an illumina hiseqtm 2000 illumina san diego ca usa 2 4 nucleic acid and protein leakage of e coli during each photocatalytic disinfection experiment the release of intercellular components from e coli cells was measured at various visible light irradiation intervals five ml of each sample were collected and centrifuged at 4 c for 15 min at 7000 g the levels of nucleic acid released into the supernatants were analyzed by measuring the absorbance of the samples at 260 nm using the same uv vis spectrophotometer as above the released contents of protein in the supernatants were measured at 595 nm using the bradford protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard protein woo et al 2000 all of the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 5 reactive species involved in the photocatalytic disinfection process electron spin resonance spectrometry esr bruker instruments karlsruhe germany was employed to detect ros generated by pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo under the same xenon lamp irradiation the production of o2 and ho was monitored using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping agent 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was used as a spin trapping agent for 1o2 the detailed measurement methods are provided in section s2 the molecular probe assays were conducted to confirm the photogeneration of ros briefly 100 ml of photocatalyst at 100 mg l 1 was placed into a beaker and irradiated by the same xenon lamp furfuryl alcohol ffa 0 85 mm p chlorobenzoic acid pcba 20 mm and xtt 200 mm were selected as the probe molecules for 1o2 ho and o2 respectively to confirm the photogeneration of ros li et al 2012 yang et al 2015 the concentrations of h2o2 produced by the photocatalyst were analyzed by potassium iodide and ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate jin et al 2013 the photocatalytic disinfection experiments were conducted under scavenger loaded conditions to remove the corresponding active species and clarify the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo sodium oxalate na2c2o4 isopropanol ipa and cr6 were utilized to remove photogenerated h diffusing ho and e respectively cho et al 2005 liang et al 2015 shi et al 2014 xia et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 2 6 dissolution concentrations of metal ions under visible light irradiation an aqueous suspension of 100 mg l 1 of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was irradiated by the xenon lamp after different visible light exposure times 5 ml of the suspension was collected and added into an amicon ultra 4 centrifugal ultrafilter with a particle size of 1 2 nm amicon ultracel 3k millipore

metal ions dissolved from the pb bifeo3 x rgo photocatalysts were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc ii perkinelmer usa all dissolution experiments were conducted in triplicate to confirm their reproducibility and the data points are presented as mean values standard deviations 2 7 characterization of the morphology of e coli exposed to photocatalyst after visible light irradiation for 30 min the morphological changes of e coli exposed to the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst were visualized by tem tecnai spirit tem d1297 fei usa the preparation procedures for the tem samples can be found in the published work shang et al 2017b briefly the bacterial samples were prefixed with 2 5 w v glutaraldehyde in 0 1 m pbs ph 7 2 overnight and then postfixed in a 1 aqueous osmium tetroxide solution for 2 h at room temperature after dehydration ultrathin sections 60 nm thickness were cut on an ultramicrotome leica microsystems gmbh vienna austria subsequently the sections were examined and visualized using a tem 2 8 stability of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst the stability of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was investigated by cyclical disinfection experiments that were carried out under the same conditions as mentioned in section 2 2 after evaluating the disinfection efficiency of the photocatalyst for the first cycle the powders were filtered by a 0 22 μm membrane washed with deionized di water and stocked in a 70 ethanol solution overnight to dissolve the hydrophobic residues of the bacteria then the photocatalysts were washed with di water separated by membrane filtration and dried at 60 c overnight prior to their use in the next cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst the physicochemical properties of the pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts with different rgo doping amounts including surface elemental compositions crystallite sizes and functional groups have been characterized in our previously published work shang et al 2018 our previous works have demonstrated that the doping amount of rgo played minor role in the surface elemental compositions crystallite sizes and functional groups of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts li et al 2017 shang et al 2018 in this study only the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst was characterized because of its high disinfection activity as demonstrated in section 3 2 as shown in fig 1 a the tem image shows that the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalysts are close to spherical with a relatively uniform size distribution the average diameter of the photocatalyst particles measured from the tem image using imagej software was 22 8 3 1 nm as shown in the size distribution histogram fig s1 the diameter of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst measured by tem was larger than the crystallite size measured by xrd 3 1 nm in our previous works li et al 2017 shang et al 2018 which was primarily because of the aggregation of photocatalyst in water fig 1b shows the edx spectrum of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst which confirms the existence of bi fe and pb elements in the nanocomposite xps results have also demonstrated that pb ions were doped into the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst li et al 2017 shang et al 2018 fig 1c illustrates the uv vis absorption spectrum of the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst this indicates that the photocatalyst can absorb light in the range of 250 700 nm which is in agreement with the orange color of the synthesized photocatalyst fig 1d shows the psd of pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo dispersed in di water the intensity averaged hydrodynamic diameter of the photocatalyst was 98 1 nm the polydispersity index value 0 544 was higher than 0 25 indicating that the photocatalyst was unstable and formed aggregates the dls diameters were larger than the average crystallite sizes determined by tem or xrd 3 1 nm and reported in our previously published work shang et al 2018 this discrepancy was likely due to the formation of aggregates in water 3 2 disinfection efficiency of photocatalyst the disinfection activities of bifeo3 pb bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 0 25 0 38 0 50 and 1 00 photocatalysts at initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 toward e coli were investigated under visible light irradiation no obvious decrease in the viable cell density was observed in the dark control experiments fig s2 suggesting that the viability of e coli can not be affected by the photocatalysts in the dark moreover as shown in fig 2 a the viable cell density in the absence of photocatalyst changes slightly under visible light irradiation indicating that visible light irradiation has a minor effect on the cell viability negligible inactivation of e coli is obtained for the bifeo3 photocatalyst when exposed to visible light for 30 min the weak bactericidal performance can be attributed to the high recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers li et al 2010 2013 the antibacterial efficiency of bifeo3 was improved by doping pb resulting in 1 1 log removal which was primarily because the pb dopants can coordinate with bi3 to provide active reaction sites shang et al 2018 the disinfection activities of pb bifeo3 were significantly enhanced after decoration with rgo particles specifically increasing the doping amount of rgo from 0 25 to 0 5 significantly improved the disinfection activity with a 2 8 log 4 7 log and 6 7 log decrease in the viable cell density for pb bifeo3 0 25 rgo pb bifeo3 0 38 rgo and pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalysts after visible light irradiation for 30 min respectively fig 2a this is consistent with previous works which show that the incorporation of rgo onto bifeo3 could significantly improve the photocatalytic activity madhusudan et al 2012 wang et al 2012 the improved performance of the photocatalysts by graphene decoration was attributed to efficient electron hole separation li et al 2013 madhusudan et al 2012 wang et al 2012 higher doping amount of rgo provides more reactive sites for electron hole separation however further increasing the doping amount of rgo to 1 0 resulted in a decrease in the photocatalytic disinfection activity with a removal rate of 3 9 log this was primarily because higher rgo loading increased the opacity of the pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalyst and prevented the photocatalyst from absorbing light dong et al 2014 li et al 2013 obviously pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited the highest photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of the pb bifeo3 x rgo photocatalysts and was selected to investigate the disinfection activity toward s aureus the effect of photocatalyst concentrations on the disinfection activity of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward e coli was assessed we found that the disinfection activity increased from 3 2 log to 4 7 log decrease in the viable cell density with the increase of the photocatalyst concentration from 50 to 100 mg l 1 this was probably because more photocatalysts absorb more visible light for bacterial disinfection however the disinfection activity of 200 mg l 1 pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo showed significant decrease with a 2 4 log decrease in the viable cell density higher concentration of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo can result in aggregation of photocatalyst therefore 100 mg l 1 was selected as the optimal initial concentration of photocatalyst for the other assays in this study our previous work has also demonstrated that 100 mg l 1 was the optimal initial photocatalyst concentration for perfluorooctanoic acid degradation shang et al 2018 no significant change in the viable cell density of s aureus was observed in the dark fig s2 or blank control experiments fig 2b these observations indicate that the viability of s aureus is not affected by either visible light irradiation or pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo particles in the dark negligible disinfection activity was also observed for pure bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 due to the high recombination rate between the e and h pairs li et al 2010 2013 pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited excellent bactericidal effects toward s aureus complete inactivation of s aureus was obtained after visible light irradiation for 90 min the disinfection rate of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward s aureus was much slower than that of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward e coli the weaker resistance to photocatalysts of gram negative bacteria compared to that of gram positive bacteria has also been previously reported and is due to their different cell wall structures deng et al 2017 jin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 s aureus has a three dimensional spatial network structure composed of many layers of teichoic acids and peptidoglycan while e coli has only a single layer scattered structure deng et al 2017 jin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 as will be elucidated below in sections 3 3 and 3 4 the loss of membrane integrity from direct contact with the photocatalyst played important role in the disinfection activity of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst therefore it is more difficult for a photocatalyst to break the thicker cell walls of s aureus resulting in a lower bactericidal effect of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward s aureus than toward e coli bao et al 2011 3 3 transcriptomic analysis to elucidate the primary antibacterial mechanism of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst gene expression changes in e coli after exposure to the photocatalyst for 30 min were assessed the results were compared to those of treatments without photocatalysts after filtering and normalization 4026 genes were analyzed overall 623 genes were differentially expressed in e coli exposed to the photocatalyst log2fc 1 p 0 05 among which 338 genes were downregulated and 285 genes were upregulated table s1 the gene ontology go analysis shown in table 1 mainly identifies the biological process bp terms and kegg pathways associated with responses to the oxidation reduction processes the biosynthetic processes the aerobic respiration processes and the uptake metabolism of other endogenous and exogenous compounds the cellular component cc and molecular function mf terms indicated that the gene products affected by the photocatalyst are involved in the oxidative stress and cellular respiration processes gene expression potentially related to cytoplasmic membrane damage and repair is shown in table s2 kang et al 2008 sohm et al 2015 some transporters were suppressed in the photocatalyst exposed cells suggesting the bacterial membrane was damaged or some channels for metal entrance into the cells were blocked for example some transporters involved in the entry of oxidant species such as ompf and ompw are downregulated monrás et al 2014 the downregulation of the major porin ompf suggests that the entry of some molecules into the bacterial cell is shut down monrás et al 2014 in addition the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst suppressed the expression of ompw encoding the membrane protein that allows the incorporation of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite kang et al 2008 monrás et al 2014 this result indicated that the cellular membrane might be destabilized by the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst which had been confirmed by the tem images of bacteria in section 3 4 the treatment of e coli with the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst also induces the transcription of a number of genes associated with oxidative stress several of the genes expressed are part of the soxrs system involved in the defense against oxidative stress such as soda superoxide dismutase chou et al 1993 pelletier et al 2010 other evidence of oxidative damage from the photocatalyst exposure comes from the increased expression of genes related to oxidative stress table s3 among them are the following genes lysu encoding the oxidative stress related alarmone cui et al 2012 monrás et al 2014 trxc encoding the oxidative defense related thioredoxin 2 cui et al 2012 monrás et al 2014 and cydb induced by oxidative stress monrás et al 2014 pelletier et al 2010 lower suca expression favors the accumulation of 2 oxoglutarate which is related to oxidative stress protection cui et al 2012 monrás et al 2014 a high modulation of the genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle was observed table 1 thus our transcriptomic results support the hypothesis that the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst has a negative effect on the cells through damage to the bacterial membrane and oxidative stress as previously described in the procaryotic literature monrás et al 2014 sohm et al 2015 3 4 intracellular component leakage and tem images of the bacteria to confirm the transcriptomic results regarding the cell membrane damage in the e coli cells the leakage of nucleic acids and proteins from e coli cells exposed to the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst under visible light irradiation was measured as shown in fig 3 a the absorbance at 260 nm increases when e coli cells are exposed to photocatalyst for increasing light irradiation time and the amount of nucleic acids released from the e coli cells exposed to the photocatalyst is much higher than that from cells in the absence of the photocatalyst p 0 05 however there was no change in the amount of nucleic acid leakage from cells in the control group as shown in fig 3b the amount of protein released from the e coli cells shows the same pattern as that of nucleic acid the initial protein leakage amount was insignificant for cells with or without photocatalyst p 0 05 there was no change in the amount of protein leakage from e coli cells in the control group after the addition of the photocatalyst the amount of protein leakage from the bacteria was significantly enhanced p 0 05 and the amount released grew with prolonged light irradiation times both the nucleic acid and protein leakage results demonstrated that the photocatalyst can increase the membrane permeability and damage the bacterial cell membranes and outer membrane tem images were used to visualize the morphological changes of the cell membranes of e coli during the photocatalytic disinfection process as shown in fig 4 a the normal bacterial cells display an intact and smooth morphology the untreated e coli cells show a multilayered cell surface consisting of a cytoplasmic membrane a peptidoglycan layer in the periplasmic space and an outer membrane after 10 min of visible light irradiation and photocatalyst exposure e coli cells were irregularly shaped and caused the cytoplasm membrane to shrink and became detached from the cell wall as shown by the blue arrow in fig 4b after 30 min of light irradiation the outer membrane outside the cell wall of e coli cells the first line of defense against photocatalyst is serisoulsy damaged as shown in fig 4c the bacterial cells were severely damaged and killed in addition the nucleic acid and protein leakage results also demonstrated that the photocatalyst can increase the membrane permeability and damage the outer membrane as well as cytoplasm membrane photocatalyst exposed bacteria have often been demonstrated to release intracellular components due to cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane damage rincón and pulgarin 2004 zhang et al 2010 3 5 effect of reactive species on the disinfection activity of photocatalyst to evaluate whether the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo was related to oxidative stress esr was employed to explore which kind of ros was generated by the photocatalyst during visible light irradiation as shown in fig 5 a no tempo and dmpo o2 signals are observed demonstrating that o2 and 1o2 are not generated by the photocatalyst the characteristic four peaks of the dmpo ho adduct with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 were observed indicating that ho was generated by the photocatalyst the molecular probe method was used to confirm the photogeneration of ros the photolysis of pcba and ffa in the absence of the photocatalyst were negligible 5 after the addition of photocatalyst only pcba was degraded fig 5b indicating that the photocatalyst produced a noticeable amount of ho as shown in fig 5c no absorption peaks are observed in aqueous suspensions of the photocatalyst indicating that no measurable amount of o2 is generated by the photocatalyst similarly no measurable amount of h2o2 is detected during the photocatalytic disinfection process these results confirmed that only ho was generated and may govern the photocatalytic disinfection activity of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst the valence band vb potential of perovskite type bifeo3 photocatalyst is 2 55 ev vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe li et al 2012 meng et al 2016 the doping of pb results in the upshift of vb less than 0 2 ev such as basno3 and srtio3 borse et al 2007 irie et al 2007 the vb potential of pb bifeo3 photocatalysts is more positive than the standard redox potential of ho h2o 2 2 ev vs nhe li et al 2012 meng et al 2016 indicating that the photoexcited holes on the vb of pb bifeo3 can oxidize h2o to generate ho rgo could act as an electron collector to efficiently separate the electron hole pairs in bifeo3 which can prolong the lifetime of hole and increase the generation concentration of ho therefore the hole of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalyst is able to oxidize water to produce ho to determine the role of each active species in the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo different scavengers were added to quench their corresponding active species generated under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 6 a the cell density changes slightly in the control experiments without the photocatalysts indicating that none of the scavengers are toxic to the e coli cells the h scavenger na2c2o4 deng et al 2017 had a minor effect on the disinfection efficiency of the photocatalyst indicating that h was not involved in the sterilization process after the addition of 0 02 m ipa a ho scavenger shi et al 2014 wang et al 2018a the disinfection efficiency of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was significantly decreased and the addition of 0 05 m ipa completely inhibited the disinfection efficiency these results indicated that ho generated in the aqueous suspensions of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst also resulted in the cellular distraction in addition to the ho dependent indirect disinfection mechanism the photogenerated electrons e may directly kill e coli cells chen et al 2011 however the addition of cr6 an e scavenger deng et al 2017 had a minor effect on the disinfection efficiency indicating that neither e nor its derived reactive species played a role in bacterial cell death the quenching of e would directly reduce the recombination rate of e and h and the amount of h would be enhanced but the disinfection activity did not improve this also suggested that h had a minor effect on the photocatalytic disinfection process the above observations showed that ho played a significant role in the photocatalytic disinfection of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst 3 6 effects of released metal ions on the disinfection activity metal ions can be released from the nanomaterials and react with the thiol groups sh of cysteines which has been shown to result in cellular membrane damage and bacterial death visnapuu et al 2018 to determine the effect of released metal ions of pb bifeo3 x rgo photocatalysts on the bactericidal activity the leaching concentrations of metal ions from bifeo3 pb bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 25 0 38 0 50 and 1 00 under visible light irradiation were measured as shown in fig 7 the released concentrations of bi2 fe3 and pb2 increase with prolonged visible light irradiation after 90 min the concentrations of bi2 fe3 and pb2 released from six types of photocatalysts were below 20 30 and 10 μg l 1 respectively at initial ph of 7 4 the viability of e coli after exposure to bi no3 2 fe no3 3 and pb no3 2 at the same concentrations of bi2 fe3 and pb2 released from pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo under visible light irradiation was investigated however a minor inhibitory effect was observed when e coli were exposed to three meal ions fig 7 previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of e coli changes slightly in the presence of 0 4 mg l 1 pb2 100 μg l 1 bi2 or 0 5 mg l 1 fe3 domenico et al 1997 sarin et al 2000 schwegmann et al 2010 therefore the released metal ions had an insignificant bactericidal effect on e coli it is widely accepted that pb2 is not essential to living organisms and has hazardous effect on their growth reproduction and behavior eisler 1988 maar et al 2018 shahsavani et al 2017 in our work no measurable amount of pb2 could be detected in the aqueous suspensions of bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 photocatalysts the released pb2 concentrations of pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 25 0 38 0 50 1 00 photocatalysts are far below the guideline for drinking water quality of 10 μg l 1 reported by the world health organization u s environmental protection agency and standards for drinking water quality in china organization 2008 thus the released pb2 was not toxic toward humans or aquatic life previous works have demonstrated that the leaching of pb2 from pb containing materials was more favorable in acidic condition than in alkali condition hailili et al 2017 niu and xu 2019 rehana et al 2017 in addition the photocatalyst can be removed by filter after drinking water disinfection process which can not pose toxic effect toward humans or aquatic life thus it is safe to apply the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst for drinking water disinfection in alkali condition 3 7 reusability of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst the stability of the photocatalyst is important for its practical application therefore a series of photocatalytic disinfection assays with recycled pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst for e coli were conducted as shown in fig 8 complete inactivation of 5 0 106 cfu ml 1 e coli cells could be achieved within 30 min before three cycles the released concentrations of metal ions had minor effect on the bacterial activity of e coli cells in the fourth cycle complete inactivation of e coli cells could still be achieved but with longer reaction time 45 min indicating that the disinfection activity of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst decreased gradually probably due to the metal ion releasing from phototactalys in addition the slightly decreased antibacterial activity was primarily because some bacterial residues can accumulate on the surfaces of the photocatalyst and block the active sites of photocatalysts even after they are washed with di water and an ethanol solution liang et al 2016 the results demonstrate that the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst is stable for the photocatalytic disinfection of drinking water for three recycle times although small amount of metal ions were released after photocatalytic reaction the photocatalysts were separated and characterized by xrd and sem as shown in fig a 3 the structure and morphology of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst after disinfection for three cycles are similar to those of the photocatalysts before the first cycle shang et al 2018 therefore the photocatalysts are suitable for drinking water disinfection because of their excellent reactivity high stability and easy separation from the reaction suspensions the optimal initial concentration of photocatalyst was 100 mg l 1 for disinfection of water in our study the cost estimates for preparation of 1 kg pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts were provided in section s8 of si if we treat 1000 l drinking water the cost of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalyst is approximate 8 0 which is economical for disinfection of drinking water 4 conclusions the inactivation of waterborne bacteria is a top priority for the public because the microbiological contamination of drinking water poses a potential risk to human health in this study the visible light responsive pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts were synthesized and their disinfection efficiencies toward e coli and s aureus were investigated several conclusions can be drawn as follows the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst exhibited the strongest bactericidal properties toward e coli 100 and s aureus 99 7 after 1 h of visible light irradiation the results indicate that the synthesized photocatalysts facilitate energy utilization of clean and renewable sunlight to inactivate bacteria to improve the solar harvesting efficiency and disinfection efficiency of photocatalysts for practical applications the effect factors including operational parameters and water chemistries i e ph dissolved oxygen temperature inorganic ions and other water matrices are needed to be optimized the disinfection mechanism for pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst toward e coli is proposed after contact with the bacteria cells the photocatalyst generates membrane stress that results in the emission of intracellular components nucleic acids and proteins and oxidative stress due to the generation of ho the elucidation of disinfection mechanisms contributes to improvement of the bactericidal properties which allows the photocatalytic technique to become more competitive with other traditional disinfection techniques and facilitates the application of photocatalytic technique in drinking water disinfection pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited a strong antibacterial activity toward e coli even after four reuse cycles this indicate that the photocatalyst shows high stability for drinking water disinfection while the recycle process using membrane filtration is complicated and time consuming great efforts are needed to design immobilized photocatalyts using sunlight for efficient and sustainable water disinfection from the perspective of technology and economics in conclusion taking into account its easy preparation method high disinfection efficiency and high chemical stability pb bifeo3 rgo is an ideal

18692,while the visible light driven photocatalytic disinfection techniques for drinking water have recently attracted tremendous attentions it is necessary to further improve the solar energy utilization efficiency in this study we synthesized pb bifeo3 photocatalysts doped with different amounts of reduced graphene oxide pb bifeo3 rgo the photocatalytic disinfection efficiencies toward gram negative escherichia coli e coli and gram positive staphylococcus aureus s aureus were evaluated under visible light irradiation λ 400 nm the results indicated that pb bifeo3 with 0 5 wt rgo pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited the highest disinfection efficiency complete inactivation was reached within 30 min and 90 min for e coli and s aureus respectively the transcriptomic analysis results indicated that pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo deregulates the genes in e coli cells that are involved in the cell membrane damage and oxidative stress responses this was validated by the cell leakage of nucleic acids or proteins transmission electron microscopy images of the bacteria and the disinfection efficiency decrease caused by the introduction of scavenger of hydroxyl radical ho metal ions pb2 bi2 and fe3 released from the photocatalysts did not contribute to the disinfection process for the first time our results elucidated that the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism of pb bifeo3 rgo toward e coli was mainly associated with oxidative stress due to ho generation and the loss of membrane integrity from direct contact with the photocatalyst after four consecutive cycles the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst exhibited a strong antibacterial efficiency the excellent disinfection efficiency and stability of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo suggests that this photocatalyst shows great potential for drinking water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords visible light pb bifeo3 rgo disinfection transcriptomics oxidative stress membrane damage 1 introduction microbiological contamination of drinking water is a cause of major disease outbreaks in both developing and developed countries ashbolt 2004 dobrowsky et al 2014 in recent years microbial contamination has caused an adverse effect on organisms and became a major concern to the global population ashbolt 2004 wright et al 2004 although filtration chlorination ozone and light exposure ultraviolet or visible light have been demonstrated to be efficient means of drinking water disinfection these technologies were found to have several limitations such as high cost generation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts and regrowth of resistant bacteria carr et al 2016 li et al 2008 miranda et al 2016 therefore it is essential to develop effective and economical water purification technologies for treating microbially contaminated water photocatalytic techniques have recently attracted tremendous attention for the disinfection of microbes in water especially visible light driven photocatalytic techniques levchuk et al 2018 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 perovskite type bismuth ferrite bifeo3 one of the most important multiferroic materials possessing simultaneous magnetic and electric ordering has recently received considerable attention as a promising photocatalyst li et al 2010 2013 shang et al 2018 due to their small band gap 2 2 ev bifeo3 photocatalysts are sensitive to visible light and exhibit a high photocatalytic efficiency in the visible range li et al 2010 2013 however the fast recombination of photogenerated electron e hole h pairs and the low utilization efficiency of visible light have considerably limited their application li et al 2013 shang et al 2018 improvements of the antibacterial efficiency of bifeo3 in the visible light range are still being actively explored for its practical use different materials have been incorporated into bifeo3 photocatalysts to improve their disinfection efficiencies gurunathan et al 2012 liu et al 2011 among these materials reduced graphene oxide rgo a fascinating photosensitizer with strong antibacterial activity gurunathan et al 2012 liu et al 2011 has been incorporated into bifeo3 to improve its photocatalytic efficiency soltani and lee 2016 zhou et al 2018 given its high charge mobility and high electrical conductivity rgo may promote the transportation of e away from the surface of bifeo3 and thus reduce the recombination rate of the charge carriers e h pairs and improve the photocatalytic performance of bifeo3 soltani and lee 2016 zhou et al 2018 moreover the intercalated pb dopants can coordinate with bi3 to provide active reaction sites thus promoting the photocatalytic performance of bifeo3 li et al 2017 therefore we speculate that decorating bifeo3 with rgo and pb may similarly enhance the antibacterial activity of bifeo3 which is a method that has not yet been elaborated on in the literature the visible light driven photocatalytic disinfection mechanisms have been summarized there is much debate with respect to the reactive species that play critical roles in the photocatalytic disinfection process several studies have reported that the photocatalytic disinfection is an oxidation process that is initiated by hydroxyl radicals ho and or photogenerated holes deng et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 however other studies have elucidated that the photocatalytic disinfection is a reductive process based on the photoinduced electrons in the photocatalyst jin et al 2013 several studies have demonstrated that either o2 or h2o2 may also play important roles in the photocatalytic disinfection process maness et al 1999 however the possible bactericidal mechanisms responsible for the photocatalytic disinfection activities of pb bifeo3 rgo are not clear and require systematic investigation pb bifeo3 rgo was synthesized by decorating pb and rgo nanoparticles onto the surface of bifeo3 via a hydrothermal method the objective of this study was to investigate the disinfection efficiencies of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts on gram negative escherichia coli e coli and gram positive staphylococcus aureus s aureus under visible light irradiation e coli were chosen as a model organism to elucidate the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism because their genome has been well studied and they are the best microbial indicator in drinking water for public health edberg et al 2000 welch et al 2002 a transcriptomic approach was used to elucidate the disinfection mechanism of pb bifeo3 rgo which was supported by biochemical studies focusing on damage of bacterial cell membrane reactive oxygen species ros related processes and dissolution of the photocatalyst the stability of the photocatalyst was assessed to investigate its stability and reusability 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts the chemicals used in this study are provided in section s1 the detailed preparation methods of the pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts with different doping amounts of rgo pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 0 25 0 38 0 50 and 1 00 have been reported previously li et al 2017 in brief 0 25 0 38 0 5 or 1 0 wt of rgo was added to a mixture of fe no3 3 9h2o pb no3 2 at 2 0 wt of bifeo3 and bi no3 3 5h2o after stirring for 15 min 1 0 m naoh was added to the mixture to produce a brown precipitate and the entire solution was then transferred to a teflon container and heated in a microwave oven the powder was washed with water and ethanol filtered dried and ground into a fine powder the morphologies of the photocatalysts were

also obtained by the same tem the average hydrodynamic diameters particle size distributions psds and zeta potentials of the photocatalysts were measured using a zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern instruments worcestershire uk the absorption spectra of the photocatalysts were recorded on a uv vis spectrophotometer specord 200 analytik jena germany over a wavelength range of 200 800 nm 2 2 photocatalytic disinfection experiment both e coli and s aureus were cultured and harvested according to the reported method deng et al 2017 li et al 2018 the disinfection assays were conducted in a double walled beaker under irradiation from a xenon lamp 300 w osram instruments usa with a 400 nm uv cutoff filter to simulate visible light the light intensity on the surface of the reaction suspension was 58 2 mw cm 2 in each disinfection experiment 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs 2 mm phosphate ph 7 2 with bacteria added at a cell density of approximately 5 106 colony forming units cfu ml 1 the mixture was constantly stirred with a magnetic stirrer 78hw 1 shanghai china at 500 r min 1 the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 0 2 c by a circulating cooling water bath at the outer layer of the beaker after different exposure times the suspension was collected to assess the bacterial viability using the traditional plate count method li et al 2018 shang et al 2017a 2017b five parallel experiments were conducted to confirm their reproducibility 2 3 transcriptomic analysis the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 ml of pbs at a final concentration of 100 mg l 1 with e coli after irradiation for 30 min the bacterial suspensions were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min the control experiment was untreated e coli without light irradiation the extraction of the total rna fragmentation of mrna cdna synthesis end reparation and single nucleotide a addition were performed by igenecode biotech co ltd beijing china then suitable fragments were selected for pcr amplification after agarose gel electrophoresis an agilent 2100 bioanaylzer agilent technologies palo alto ca usa and an abi steponeplus real time pcr system applied biosystems foster city ca usa were used in the quantification and qualification of the sample library finally the library was sequenced using an illumina hiseqtm 2000 illumina san diego ca usa 2 4 nucleic acid and protein leakage of e coli during each photocatalytic disinfection experiment the release of intercellular components from e coli cells was measured at various visible light irradiation intervals five ml of each sample were collected and centrifuged at 4 c for 15 min at 7000 g the levels of nucleic acid released into the supernatants were analyzed by measuring the absorbance of the samples at 260 nm using the same uv vis spectrophotometer as above the released contents of protein in the supernatants were measured at 595 nm using the bradford protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard protein woo et al 2000 all of the experiments were carried out in triplicate 2 5 reactive species involved in the photocatalytic disinfection process electron spin resonance spectrometry esr bruker instruments karlsruhe germany was employed to detect ros generated by pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo under the same xenon lamp irradiation the production of o2 and ho was monitored using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping agent 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp was used as a spin trapping agent for 1o2 the detailed measurement methods are provided in section s2 the molecular probe assays were conducted to confirm the photogeneration of ros briefly 100 ml of photocatalyst at 100 mg l 1 was placed into a beaker and irradiated by the same xenon lamp furfuryl alcohol ffa 0 85 mm p chlorobenzoic acid pcba 20 mm and xtt 200 mm were selected as the probe molecules for 1o2 ho and o2 respectively to confirm the photogeneration of ros li et al 2012 yang et al 2015 the concentrations of h2o2 produced by the photocatalyst were analyzed by potassium iodide and ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate jin et al 2013 the photocatalytic disinfection experiments were conducted under scavenger loaded conditions to remove the corresponding active species and clarify the photocatalytic disinfection mechanism of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo sodium oxalate na2c2o4 isopropanol ipa and cr6 were utilized to remove photogenerated h diffusing ho and e respectively cho et al 2005 liang et al 2015 shi et al 2014 xia et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 2 6 dissolution concentrations of metal ions under visible light irradiation an aqueous suspension of 100 mg l 1 of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was irradiated by the xenon lamp after different visible light exposure times 5 ml of the suspension was collected and added into an amicon ultra 4 centrifugal ultrafilter with a particle size of 1 2 nm amicon ultracel 3k millipore

metal ions dissolved from the pb bifeo3 x rgo photocatalysts were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc ii perkinelmer usa all dissolution experiments were conducted in triplicate to confirm their reproducibility and the data points are presented as mean values standard deviations 2 7 characterization of the morphology of e coli exposed to photocatalyst after visible light irradiation for 30 min the morphological changes of e coli exposed to the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst were visualized by tem tecnai spirit tem d1297 fei usa the preparation procedures for the tem samples can be found in the published work shang et al 2017b briefly the bacterial samples were prefixed with 2 5 w v glutaraldehyde in 0 1 m pbs ph 7 2 overnight and then postfixed in a 1 aqueous osmium tetroxide solution for 2 h at room temperature after dehydration ultrathin sections 60 nm thickness were cut on an ultramicrotome leica microsystems gmbh vienna austria subsequently the sections were examined and visualized using a tem 2 8 stability of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst the stability of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was investigated by cyclical disinfection experiments that were carried out under the same conditions as mentioned in section 2 2 after evaluating the disinfection efficiency of the photocatalyst for the first cycle the powders were filtered by a 0 22 μm membrane washed with deionized di water and stocked in a 70 ethanol solution overnight to dissolve the hydrophobic residues of the bacteria then the photocatalysts were washed with di water separated by membrane filtration and dried at 60 c overnight prior to their use in the next cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst the physicochemical properties of the pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts with different rgo doping amounts including surface elemental compositions crystallite sizes and functional groups have been characterized in our previously published work shang et al 2018 our previous works have demonstrated that the doping amount of rgo played minor role in the surface elemental compositions crystallite sizes and functional groups of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts li et al 2017 shang et al 2018 in this study only the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst was characterized because of its high disinfection activity as demonstrated in section 3 2 as shown in fig 1 a the tem image shows that the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalysts are close to spherical with a relatively uniform size distribution the average diameter of the photocatalyst particles measured from the tem image using imagej software was 22 8 3 1 nm as shown in the size distribution histogram fig s1 the diameter of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst measured by tem was larger than the crystallite size measured by xrd 3 1 nm in our previous works li et al 2017 shang et al 2018 which was primarily because of the aggregation of photocatalyst in water fig 1b shows the edx spectrum of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst which confirms the existence of bi fe and pb elements in the nanocomposite xps results have also demonstrated that pb ions were doped into the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst li et al 2017 shang et al 2018 fig 1c illustrates the uv vis absorption spectrum of the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst this indicates that the photocatalyst can absorb light in the range of 250 700 nm which is in agreement with the orange color of the synthesized photocatalyst fig 1d shows the psd of pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo dispersed in di water the intensity averaged hydrodynamic diameter of the photocatalyst was 98 1 nm the polydispersity index value 0 544 was higher than 0 25 indicating that the photocatalyst was unstable and formed aggregates the dls diameters were larger than the average crystallite sizes determined by tem or xrd 3 1 nm and reported in our previously published work shang et al 2018 this discrepancy was likely due to the formation of aggregates in water 3 2 disinfection efficiency of photocatalyst the disinfection activities of bifeo3 pb bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 0 25 0 38 0 50 and 1 00 photocatalysts at initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 toward e coli were investigated under visible light irradiation no obvious decrease in the viable cell density was observed in the dark control experiments fig s2 suggesting that the viability of e coli can not be affected by the photocatalysts in the dark moreover as shown in fig 2 a the viable cell density in the absence of photocatalyst changes slightly under visible light irradiation indicating that visible light irradiation has a minor effect on the cell viability negligible inactivation of e coli is obtained for the bifeo3 photocatalyst when exposed to visible light for 30 min the weak bactericidal performance can be attributed to the high recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers li et al 2010 2013 the antibacterial efficiency of bifeo3 was improved by doping pb resulting in 1 1 log removal which was primarily because the pb dopants can coordinate with bi3 to provide active reaction sites shang et al 2018 the disinfection activities of pb bifeo3 were significantly enhanced after decoration with rgo particles specifically increasing the doping amount of rgo from 0 25 to 0 5 significantly improved the disinfection activity with a 2 8 log 4 7 log and 6 7 log decrease in the viable cell density for pb bifeo3 0 25 rgo pb bifeo3 0 38 rgo and pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalysts after visible light irradiation for 30 min respectively fig 2a this is consistent with previous works which show that the incorporation of rgo onto bifeo3 could significantly improve the photocatalytic activity madhusudan et al 2012 wang et al 2012 the improved performance of the photocatalysts by graphene decoration was attributed to efficient electron hole separation li et al 2013 madhusudan et al 2012 wang et al 2012 higher doping amount of rgo provides more reactive sites for electron hole separation however further increasing the doping amount of rgo to 1 0 resulted in a decrease in the photocatalytic disinfection activity with a removal rate of 3 9 log this was primarily because higher rgo loading increased the opacity of the pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalyst and prevented the photocatalyst from absorbing light dong et al 2014 li et al 2013 obviously pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited the highest photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of the pb bifeo3 x rgo photocatalysts and was selected to investigate the disinfection activity toward s aureus the effect of photocatalyst concentrations on the disinfection activity of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward e coli was assessed we found that the disinfection activity increased from 3 2 log to 4 7 log decrease in the viable cell density with the increase of the photocatalyst concentration from 50 to 100 mg l 1 this was probably because more photocatalysts absorb more visible light for bacterial disinfection however the disinfection activity of 200 mg l 1 pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo showed significant decrease with a 2 4 log decrease in the viable cell density higher concentration of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo can result in aggregation of photocatalyst therefore 100 mg l 1 was selected as the optimal initial concentration of photocatalyst for the other assays in this study our previous work has also demonstrated that 100 mg l 1 was the optimal initial photocatalyst concentration for perfluorooctanoic acid degradation shang et al 2018 no significant change in the viable cell density of s aureus was observed in the dark fig s2 or blank control experiments fig 2b these observations indicate that the viability of s aureus is not affected by either visible light irradiation or pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo particles in the dark negligible disinfection activity was also observed for pure bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 due to the high recombination rate between the e and h pairs li et al 2010 2013 pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited excellent bactericidal effects toward s aureus complete inactivation of s aureus was obtained after visible light irradiation for 90 min the disinfection rate of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward s aureus was much slower than that of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward e coli the weaker resistance to photocatalysts of gram negative bacteria compared to that of gram positive bacteria has also been previously reported and is due to their different cell wall structures deng et al 2017 jin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 s aureus has a three dimensional spatial network structure composed of many layers of teichoic acids and peptidoglycan while e coli has only a single layer scattered structure deng et al 2017 jin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 as will be elucidated below in sections 3 3 and 3 4 the loss of membrane integrity from direct contact with the photocatalyst played important role in the disinfection activity of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst therefore it is more difficult for a photocatalyst to break the thicker cell walls of s aureus resulting in a lower bactericidal effect of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo toward s aureus than toward e coli bao et al 2011 3 3 transcriptomic analysis to elucidate the primary antibacterial mechanism of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst gene expression changes in e coli after exposure to the photocatalyst for 30 min were assessed the results were compared to those of treatments without photocatalysts after filtering and normalization 4026 genes were analyzed overall 623 genes were differentially expressed in e coli exposed to the photocatalyst log2fc 1 p 0 05 among which 338 genes were downregulated and 285 genes were upregulated table s1 the gene ontology go analysis shown in table 1 mainly identifies the biological process bp terms and kegg pathways associated with responses to the oxidation reduction processes the biosynthetic processes the aerobic respiration processes and the uptake metabolism of other endogenous and exogenous compounds the cellular component cc and molecular function mf terms indicated that the gene products affected by the photocatalyst are involved in the oxidative stress and cellular respiration processes gene expression potentially related to cytoplasmic membrane damage and repair is shown in table s2 kang et al 2008 sohm et al 2015 some transporters were suppressed in the photocatalyst exposed cells suggesting the bacterial membrane was damaged or some channels for metal entrance into the cells were blocked for example some transporters involved in the entry of oxidant species such as ompf and ompw are downregulated monrás et al 2014 the downregulation of the major porin ompf suggests that the entry of some molecules into the bacterial cell is shut down monrás et al 2014 in addition the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst suppressed the expression of ompw encoding the membrane protein that allows the incorporation of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite kang et al 2008 monrás et al 2014 this result indicated that the cellular membrane might be destabilized by the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst which had been confirmed by the tem images of bacteria in section 3 4 the treatment of e coli with the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst also induces the transcription of a number of genes associated with oxidative stress several of the genes expressed are part of the soxrs system involved in the defense against oxidative stress such as soda superoxide dismutase chou et al 1993 pelletier et al 2010 other evidence of oxidative damage from the photocatalyst exposure comes from the increased expression of genes related to oxidative stress table s3 among them are the following genes lysu encoding the oxidative stress related alarmone cui et al 2012 monrás et al 2014 trxc encoding the oxidative defense related thioredoxin 2 cui et al 2012 monrás et al 2014 and cydb induced by oxidative stress monrás et al 2014 pelletier et al 2010 lower suca expression favors the accumulation of 2 oxoglutarate which is related to oxidative stress protection cui et al 2012 monrás et al 2014 a high modulation of the genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle was observed table 1 thus our transcriptomic results support the hypothesis that the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst has a negative effect on the cells through damage to the bacterial membrane and oxidative stress as previously described in the procaryotic literature monrás et al 2014 sohm et al 2015 3 4 intracellular component leakage and tem images of the bacteria to confirm the transcriptomic results regarding the cell membrane damage in the e coli cells the leakage of nucleic acids and proteins from e coli cells exposed to the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst under visible light irradiation was measured as shown in fig 3 a the absorbance at 260 nm increases when e coli cells are exposed to photocatalyst for increasing light irradiation time and the amount of nucleic acids released from the e coli cells exposed to the photocatalyst is much higher than that from cells in the absence of the photocatalyst p 0 05 however there was no change in the amount of nucleic acid leakage from cells in the control group as shown in fig 3b the amount of protein released from the e coli cells shows the same pattern as that of nucleic acid the initial protein leakage amount was insignificant for cells with or without photocatalyst p 0 05 there was no change in the amount of protein leakage from e coli cells in the control group after the addition of the photocatalyst the amount of protein leakage from the bacteria was significantly enhanced p 0 05 and the amount released grew with prolonged light irradiation times both the nucleic acid and protein leakage results demonstrated that the photocatalyst can increase the membrane permeability and damage the bacterial cell membranes and outer membrane tem images were used to visualize the morphological changes of the cell membranes of e coli during the photocatalytic disinfection process as shown in fig 4 a the normal bacterial cells display an intact and smooth morphology the untreated e coli cells show a multilayered cell surface consisting of a cytoplasmic membrane a peptidoglycan layer in the periplasmic space and an outer membrane after 10 min of visible light irradiation and photocatalyst exposure e coli cells were irregularly shaped and caused the cytoplasm membrane to shrink and became detached from the cell wall as shown by the blue arrow in fig 4b after 30 min of light irradiation the outer membrane outside the cell wall of e coli cells the first line of defense against photocatalyst is serisoulsy damaged as shown in fig 4c the bacterial cells were severely damaged and killed in addition the nucleic acid and protein leakage results also demonstrated that the photocatalyst can increase the membrane permeability and damage the outer membrane as well as cytoplasm membrane photocatalyst exposed bacteria have often been demonstrated to release intracellular components due to cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane damage rincón and pulgarin 2004 zhang et al 2010 3 5 effect of reactive species on the disinfection activity of photocatalyst to evaluate whether the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo was related to oxidative stress esr was employed to explore which kind of ros was generated by the photocatalyst during visible light irradiation as shown in fig 5 a no tempo and dmpo o2 signals are observed demonstrating that o2 and 1o2 are not generated by the photocatalyst the characteristic four peaks of the dmpo ho adduct with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 were observed indicating that ho was generated by the photocatalyst the molecular probe method was used to confirm the photogeneration of ros the photolysis of pcba and ffa in the absence of the photocatalyst were negligible 5 after the addition of photocatalyst only pcba was degraded fig 5b indicating that the photocatalyst produced a noticeable amount of ho as shown in fig 5c no absorption peaks are observed in aqueous suspensions of the photocatalyst indicating that no measurable amount of o2 is generated by the photocatalyst similarly no measurable amount of h2o2 is detected during the photocatalytic disinfection process these results confirmed that only ho was generated and may govern the photocatalytic disinfection activity of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst the valence band vb potential of perovskite type bifeo3 photocatalyst is 2 55 ev vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe li et al 2012 meng et al 2016 the doping of pb results in the upshift of vb less than 0 2 ev such as basno3 and srtio3 borse et al 2007 irie et al 2007 the vb potential of pb bifeo3 photocatalysts is more positive than the standard redox potential of ho h2o 2 2 ev vs nhe li et al 2012 meng et al 2016 indicating that the photoexcited holes on the vb of pb bifeo3 can oxidize h2o to generate ho rgo could act as an electron collector to efficiently separate the electron hole pairs in bifeo3 which can prolong the lifetime of hole and increase the generation concentration of ho therefore the hole of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalyst is able to oxidize water to produce ho to determine the role of each active species in the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo different scavengers were added to quench their corresponding active species generated under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 6 a the cell density changes slightly in the control experiments without the photocatalysts indicating that none of the scavengers are toxic to the e coli cells the h scavenger na2c2o4 deng et al 2017 had a minor effect on the disinfection efficiency of the photocatalyst indicating that h was not involved in the sterilization process after the addition of 0 02 m ipa a ho scavenger shi et al 2014 wang et al 2018a the disinfection efficiency of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst was significantly decreased and the addition of 0 05 m ipa completely inhibited the disinfection efficiency these results indicated that ho generated in the aqueous suspensions of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst also resulted in the cellular distraction in addition to the ho dependent indirect disinfection mechanism the photogenerated electrons e may directly kill e coli cells chen et al 2011 however the addition of cr6 an e scavenger deng et al 2017 had a minor effect on the disinfection efficiency indicating that neither e nor its derived reactive species played a role in bacterial cell death the quenching of e would directly reduce the recombination rate of e and h and the amount of h would be enhanced but the disinfection activity did not improve this also suggested that h had a minor effect on the photocatalytic disinfection process the above observations showed that ho played a significant role in the photocatalytic disinfection of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst 3 6 effects of released metal ions on the disinfection activity metal ions can be released from the nanomaterials and react with the thiol groups sh of cysteines which has been shown to result in cellular membrane damage and bacterial death visnapuu et al 2018 to determine the effect of released metal ions of pb bifeo3 x rgo photocatalysts on the bactericidal activity the leaching concentrations of metal ions from bifeo3 pb bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 25 0 38 0 50 and 1 00 under visible light irradiation were measured as shown in fig 7 the released concentrations of bi2 fe3 and pb2 increase with prolonged visible light irradiation after 90 min the concentrations of bi2 fe3 and pb2 released from six types of photocatalysts were below 20 30 and 10 μg l 1 respectively at initial ph of 7 4 the viability of e coli after exposure to bi no3 2 fe no3 3 and pb no3 2 at the same concentrations of bi2 fe3 and pb2 released from pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo under visible light irradiation was investigated however a minor inhibitory effect was observed when e coli were exposed to three meal ions fig 7 previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of e coli changes slightly in the presence of 0 4 mg l 1 pb2 100 μg l 1 bi2 or 0 5 mg l 1 fe3 domenico et al 1997 sarin et al 2000 schwegmann et al 2010 therefore the released metal ions had an insignificant bactericidal effect on e coli it is widely accepted that pb2 is not essential to living organisms and has hazardous effect on their growth reproduction and behavior eisler 1988 maar et al 2018 shahsavani et al 2017 in our work no measurable amount of pb2 could be detected in the aqueous suspensions of bifeo3 and pb bifeo3 photocatalysts the released pb2 concentrations of pb bifeo3 x rgo x 0 25 0 38 0 50 1 00 photocatalysts are far below the guideline for drinking water quality of 10 μg l 1 reported by the world health organization u s environmental protection agency and standards for drinking water quality in china organization 2008 thus the released pb2 was not toxic toward humans or aquatic life previous works have demonstrated that the leaching of pb2 from pb containing materials was more favorable in acidic condition than in alkali condition hailili et al 2017 niu and xu 2019 rehana et al 2017 in addition the photocatalyst can be removed by filter after drinking water disinfection process which can not pose toxic effect toward humans or aquatic life thus it is safe to apply the pb bifeo3 0 05 rgo photocatalyst for drinking water disinfection in alkali condition 3 7 reusability of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst the stability of the photocatalyst is important for its practical application therefore a series of photocatalytic disinfection assays with recycled pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst for e coli were conducted as shown in fig 8 complete inactivation of 5 0 106 cfu ml 1 e coli cells could be achieved within 30 min before three cycles the released concentrations of metal ions had minor effect on the bacterial activity of e coli cells in the fourth cycle complete inactivation of e coli cells could still be achieved but with longer reaction time 45 min indicating that the disinfection activity of pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst decreased gradually probably due to the metal ion releasing from phototactalys in addition the slightly decreased antibacterial activity was primarily because some bacterial residues can accumulate on the surfaces of the photocatalyst and block the active sites of photocatalysts even after they are washed with di water and an ethanol solution liang et al 2016 the results demonstrate that the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst is stable for the photocatalytic disinfection of drinking water for three recycle times although small amount of metal ions were released after photocatalytic reaction the photocatalysts were separated and characterized by xrd and sem as shown in fig a 3 the structure and morphology of the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst after disinfection for three cycles are similar to those of the photocatalysts before the first cycle shang et al 2018 therefore the photocatalysts are suitable for drinking water disinfection because of their excellent reactivity high stability and easy separation from the reaction suspensions the optimal initial concentration of photocatalyst was 100 mg l 1 for disinfection of water in our study the cost estimates for preparation of 1 kg pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts were provided in section s8 of si if we treat 1000 l drinking water the cost of pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalyst is approximate 8 0 which is economical for disinfection of drinking water 4 conclusions the inactivation of waterborne bacteria is a top priority for the public because the microbiological contamination of drinking water poses a potential risk to human health in this study the visible light responsive pb bifeo3 rgo photocatalysts were synthesized and their disinfection efficiencies toward e coli and s aureus were investigated several conclusions can be drawn as follows the pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst exhibited the strongest bactericidal properties toward e coli 100 and s aureus 99 7 after 1 h of visible light irradiation the results indicate that the synthesized photocatalysts facilitate energy utilization of clean and renewable sunlight to inactivate bacteria to improve the solar harvesting efficiency and disinfection efficiency of photocatalysts for practical applications the effect factors including operational parameters and water chemistries i e ph dissolved oxygen temperature inorganic ions and other water matrices are needed to be optimized the disinfection mechanism for pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo photocatalyst toward e coli is proposed after contact with the bacteria cells the photocatalyst generates membrane stress that results in the emission of intracellular components nucleic acids and proteins and oxidative stress due to the generation of ho the elucidation of disinfection mechanisms contributes to improvement of the bactericidal properties which allows the photocatalytic technique to become more competitive with other traditional disinfection techniques and facilitates the application of photocatalytic technique in drinking water disinfection pb bifeo3 0 5 rgo exhibited a strong antibacterial activity toward e coli even after four reuse cycles this indicate that the photocatalyst shows high stability for drinking water disinfection while the recycle process using membrane filtration is complicated and time consuming great efforts are needed to design immobilized photocatalyts using sunlight for efficient and sustainable water disinfection from the perspective of technology and economics in conclusion taking into account its easy preparation method high disinfection efficiency and high chemical stability pb bifeo3 rgo is an ideal

18693,the underlying physical and biogeochemical mechanisms associated with low dissolved oxygen do levels below 5 mg l 1 were examined through field data analyses and water quality modeling of the lower 40 miles of the minnesota river insights into flow and water quality data of nineteen years 1999 2017 at five sites demonstrate that low do levels parallel the obvious longitudinal upstream to downstream decline in phytoplankton biomass and increase in ammonium nitrogen nh4 and dissolved orthophosphate po4 in the last 22 mile river reach i e navigation channel during late summer low flow conditions river discharge is inversely related to the magnitude of the longitudinal change in do phytoplankton biomass nh4 and po4 indicating that the late summer low flow hydrodynamics in the navigation channel with a longer residence time deeper water and slower velocity provide an extended opportunity for the biogeochemical reactions involving phytoplankton do and nutrients moreover the ratio of the longitudinal decline in do versus the longitudinal increase in nh4 is particularly close to the redfield o n ratio suggesting that the decline in do and increase in nutrients most likely result from the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus under aerobic conditions this is further proved by the water quality modeling of the lower minnesota river the primary reasons for impaired water quality are substantially elevated sediment oxygen consumption and nutrient release derived from the decomposition of settled phytoplankton detritus in the navigation channel therefore we recommend that active prevention of abrupt phytoplankton blooms and collapses through regulation of river discharge and local hydrodynamics may assist in maintaining acceptable water quality in eutrophic rivers with a high level of phytoplankton biomass graphical abstract image 1 keywords river eutrophication low do levels summer low flows concurrent change in do and nh4 sediment oxygen consumption redfield ratio 1 introduction as a longitudinal transport dominated system a river receives nutrients and pollutants from upstream and lateral inflows and delivers them downstream vannote et al 1980 magnitude of river discharge that determines residence time and hydrodynamics is a critical factor affecting river water quality hilton et al 2006 o hare et al 2018 nutrients and pollutants under high discharges with short residence times may not have adequate time to participate in significant chemical and biological processes therefore river water quality is primarily determined by physical processes such as tributary dilution boundary loading downstream transport and vertical settling or resuspension reynolds and descy 1996 dodd 2007 houser et al 2015 descy et al 2017 water quality constituents in rivers with long residence times are more likely to be dominated by a large number of biogeochemical processes such as decay and transformation of nutrients and pollutants growth and death of plankton benthic algae and macrophytes biggs 2000 reynolds 2000 volkmar and dahlgren 2006 oliver et al 2014 since river discharge is highly variable seasonally key processes that dominate river water quality may shift rapidly following the dynamic flow regime reynolds 2000 nilsson and renöfält 2008 minaudo et al 2015 for river reaches with impaired water quality it is necessary to understand under which flow conditions river water quality is primarily determined by physical processes and which chemical and or biological processes dominate water quality when the physical processes play a smaller role bowes et al 2016 eutrophication is a widespread water quality problem in many rivers worldwide dodds and smith 2016 with high levels of nutrients and phytoplankton eutrophic rivers occasionally suffer low dissolved oxygen do levels below 5 mg l 1 causing stress to aquatic organisms volkmar and dahlgren 2006 although excessive nutrient loading is the most direct reason of eutrophication other factors such as an increase in residence time changes in grazer control as well as global warming play significant roles in driving or intensifying river eutrophication heffernan et al 2010 for instance the fundamental shift away from free flowing water from river to reservoir after dam construction led to severe algal blooms in the tributary bays of the three gorges reservoir china liu et al 2012 changes in the critical threshold in summer and winter discharges can potentially tilt the eel river of northwestern california usa from a recovering salmon supporting ecosystem to a cyanobacterially degraded river power et al 2015 in some cases river water quality degrades simply because it receives highly eutrophic water from upstream reservoirs lakes or lateral sewage oliver et al 2014 dodds and smith 2016 high phytoplankton concentrations and low do levels observed in the klamath river were associated with the development of large algal blooms just upstream in upper klamath lake doyle and lynch 2005 since the nutrient levels in a river are unlikely to be reduced to the oligotrophic level within a short period carpenter 2005 it is worthwhile to investigate the underlying mechanisms and alternative solutions for water quality degradation based on the physical chemical and biological characteristics of eutrophic rivers the lower 40 miles of the minnesota river from jordon minnesota to the confluence with the mississippi river is a highly eutrophic reach with peak chlorophyll a chl a exceeding 0 2 g l 1 in the summer months james and larson 2008 in addition to high levels of nutrients and chl a from upstream this reach also receives discharges from several point sources and tributaries moreover the last 22 miles of the lower minnesota river is a navigation channel with an average depth of 6 m which is approximately 3 m deeper and has a longer residence time than the upstream natural reach in the late summer low do level in the range of 4 5 mg l 1 may occur in the navigation channel the low do levels in the lower minnesota river are of major concern because they impact a wide range of plant and animal species metropolitan council 2010 meanwhile it is observed that both chl a and do concurrently declined from the upstream to downstream smith et al 2010 this study addresses the following questions 1 what is the relationship between a decline in chl a and a low do level and 2 how do physical and biogeochemical processes interact to affect the water quality of the lower minnesota river through long term flow and water quality data analysis and river water quality modeling in this study water quality data of nineteen years 1999 2017 at five sites along the lower minnesota river were analyzed to investigate the upstream to downstream variations in chl a do ammonium nitrogen nh4 and dissolved orthophosphate po4 and their correlation with magnitude of river discharge the ratios of variation in do versus variations in nh4 and po4 were compared to redfield ratios to indicate the possible relationship between downstream decline in phytoplankton and nutrient regeneration a latest one dimensional 1d riverine water quality model was applied to the lower minnesota river to explain the identified upstream to downstream variations in chl a do nh4 and po4 the effects of low flow and high phytoplankton levels on water quality in eutrophic rivers were also discussed this study provides insight on how to improve do problems in eutrophic rivers through regulating residence time local hydrodynamics and phytoplankton dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lower minnesota river begins in jordon minnesota river mile rm 39 4 to the river mouth where the minnesota river joins the mississippi river as shown in fig 1 this reach has ten tributaries and receives discharge from two large wastewater treatment plants wwtp blue lake and seneca respectively storm water discharges from the minneapolis st paul international airport and cooling water discharges from the black dog power plant also enter this reach metropolitan council maintains five water quality monitoring stations in the lower minnesota river i e rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 unlike the upper portion of the lower minnesota river the lower 22 mile from rm 22 to the mouth of the minnesota river is a deep 4 m and wide navigation channel the lower minnesota river appears on the state s list of impaired waters for the low do levels below 5 mg l 1 observed in the navigation channel during late summer metropolitan council 2010 hydrology and hydrodynamics play prominent roles in the water quality conditions of the lower minnesota river smith et al 2010 metropolitan council 2010 daily discharge data at jordon usgs station 05330000 close to rm 39 4 show that seasonal discharge varies greatly high flow greater than 1000 m3 s 1 occurs in spring early summer from april to june low flow with several pulses dominates in late summer from july to september extremely low flow in the range of 11 28 m3 s 1 prevails in winter in most years summer low flow frequently drops below 50 m3 s 1 even as low as winter low flow rates resulting in very slow moving waters in the navigation channel with velocities less than 0 2 m s 1 as shown in fig 2 a the residence time through the lower minnesota river varies with river discharge using cross section average velocities computed by a 1d hydraulic model under different flow rates the estimated residence time of the lower minnesota river is shorter than 2 days for discharges larger than 100 m3 s 1 but increases to 4 10 days as the discharge drops below 50 m3 s 1 fig 2b the long residence time of water in the navigation channel may cause oxygen poor environments since organic matter will have a longer time to decompose and consume oxygen 2 2 water quality data and statistical analysis weekly and biweekly water quality data were collected between 1999 and 2017 at five stations along the lower minnesota river rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 see fig 1 this information was used to identify the longitudinal variation patterns of phytoplankton do and river nutrients and build a water quality model the data were downloaded from metropolitan council website https eims metc state mn us worth noting is that data at rm 25 1 and rm 14 1 were not as complete as the other three stations the two stations have complete water quality data only in 2004 2006 the water quality constituents analyzed in this study include temperature do chl a pheophytin a pheo a nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 filtered and unfiltered total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn filtered and unfiltered po4 filtered and unfiltered total phosphorus tp dissolved organic carbon doc volatile suspended solids vss turbidity carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod 5 day and cbod ultimate the chl a level represents the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass while the pheo a level represents the biomass of dead phytoplankton phytoplankton were divided into three major functional groups diatoms cyanobacteria and others diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton group but amounts vary slightly each month table 1 phytoplankton are the main aquatic plants in the lower minnesota river because high turbidity and low light inhibit periphyton and macrophyte growth metropolitan council 2010 the water quality data were analyzed in two ways first the net upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 were estimated by computing the differences between the upstream rm 39 4 and downstream rm 3 5 measurements during the period obvious upstream to downstream change occurred water quality constituents measured at all five stations on the same day or on two consecutive days were compared to identify the specific reach in which the longitudinal changes began and ended due to incomplete data collection at rm 25 1 and rm 14 3 only water quality data from 2004 to 2006 were analyzed for this purpose next the main factor that causes the upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 during late summer july september was discerned from three potential factors water temperature turbidity and river discharge by using canonical correlation analysis the ratios of the downstream change in do versus the downstream changes in nh4 and po4 were estimated and compared to the theoretical ratio of o n oxygen nitrogen and o p oxygen phosphorous involved in the biochemical process of decomposing phytoplankton detritus 2 3 river water quality modeling a 1d nutrient simulation model nsmii was applied to the lower minnesota river to simulate water quality dynamics from april 2001 september 2006 the nsmii simulates the following 20 constituents zhang and johnson 2016 three phytoplankton groups do nh4 no3 total po4 dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphorus dop labile and refractory dissolved organic carbon ldoc and rdoc labile and refractory particulate organic carbon lpoc and rpoc labile and refractory particulate organic nitrogen lpon and rpon labile and refractory particulate organic phosphorus lpop and rpop and three groups of cbod the three cbod groups represented discharges from blue lake wwtp and black dog plant cbod1 seneca wwtp cbod2 and airport cbod3 respectively a sediment diagenesis module in nsmii was turned on to simulate sediment oxygen demand and nutrient fluxes from bed sediments the biogeochemical processes among the 20 constituents are sketched in fig 3 a detailed description about the nsmii is provided in the supplementary information si 1 the total 40 miles of the lower minnesota river were divided into two water quality reaches using rm 22 as the border so that different parameter values could be assigned to each reach according to hydrodynamic conditions settling velocities of phytoplankton and particulate organic matter in the lower reach were assigned higher values than in the upper reach based on the fact that pheo a at rm 3 5 was greater than that at rm 39 4 fig s1 the death rate of diatoms in the lower reach was assumed to be slightly higher remaining water quality model parameters were given the same values for both reaches the key parameter values used for the lower minnesota river nsmii model are listed in table s2 model s ability to predict the temporal and spatial dynamics of chl a do nh4 no3 po4 doc poc total nitrogen tn and tp was evaluated by calculating the root mean square errors and relative errors between the predicted and measured water quality constituents the calibrated model was then used to investigate the underlying mechanisms that cause the observed longitudinal variation patterns of phytoplankton do and nh4 during late summer low flow conditions monthly average sources and sinks of modeled do nh4 and diatoms at the five stations rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 were analyzed the contributions of every source and sink to the net kinetic change of do nh4 and diatoms in the upper and lower reaches of the lower minnesota river were compared to indicate main causes of downstream decline in phytoplankton and low do levels in the navigation channel 3 results 3 1 the concurrent upstream to downstream change in phytoplankton do and river nutrients during low flows measured chl a do nh4 and po4 concentration at the upstream rm 39 4 and downstream rm 3 5 stations are shown in fig 4 the discharge data at rm 39 4 are also presented in this figure the no3 levels are not included in this figure because there wasn t any significant change less than 10 during this period in the maximum upstream to downstream values this figure reveals a decline in chl a levels at the downstream station paralleling the reduction in do during the late summer july september of 2002 2003 2006 2009 2012 and 2013 as shown in the grey dash box concurrently increases in nh4 and po4 concentrations were also observed at the downstream station moreover the downstream increase in nh4 was more significant than the downstream increase in po4 in 2009 2012 the downstream increase in nh4 in late summer was substantial approaching its maximum level observed in winter 0 3 0 4 mg l 1 the earlier study conducted by the metropolitan council 2010 indicated the annual budget of nh4 increased downstream but there was a lack of information on how and why that occurred the long term observation data presented in fig 4 clearly suggests that a great amount of nh4 was released in late summer coincident with the substantial reduction in do although the nh4 concentration occasionally increases due to the discharge of point sources into the river for instance the increase of nh4 in spring 2015 point sources have not been a major contributor to the elevated nutrient levels in late summer since the update of wwtps in 1992 smith et al 2010 metropolitan council 2010 the other causes for the downstream increase in nh4 need further investigation in the meantime it is worth noticing that the substantial downstream changes in chl a do nh4 and po4 in late summer only took place during low flow conditions in contrast no obvious downstream changes in chl a do and river nutrients were observed in late summer with high flows in 2011 2016 and 2017 during the nineteen year period only one large scale phytoplankton bloom was observed in winter 2003 this phytoplankton bloom lasted more than two months from late november to january when water temperature and discharge were extremely low temperature ranged from 0 to 5 c and discharge was between 10 and 15 m3 s 1 this indicates that the bloom of diatoms in the lower minnesota river preferred low water temperature slow flow velocity and long residence time during the bloom the increase in do and decrease in nh4 and po4 were accompanied by an increase in chl a in the downstream direction see the green dash box fig 4 by analyzing the three year 2004 2006 water quality data measured at the five stations along the lower minnesota river rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 we found that the decline in phytoplankton biomass during late summer primarily started from below rm 25 1 and continued to the mouth of the minnesota river at rm 3 5 in the three years chl a level either increased or decreased by no more than 10 between rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 as presented in fig 5 a d the concentration of chl a do nh4 and po4 did not change very much along the upper reach between rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 but the longitudinal decline in chl a and do as well as the increase in nh4 and po4 were distinctive in the lower reach between rm 14 3 and rm 3 5 the longitudinal decrease in chl a and do accompanied by the increase in nh4 and po4 took place in the lower reach between rm 22 and the mouth of the minnesota river which is also a deep navigation channel with slow flow velocity and a long residence time in addition the low levels of nh4 and po4 dominating the upper reach rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 indicate that nitrate might be the main nitrogen source for phytoplankton growth and po4 becomes a limiting nutrient in the upper reach during late summer the longitudinal variations in chl a do nh4 and po4 during the only algal bloom which occurred in winter 2003 are shown in fig 5 e h during this algal bloom event the chl a level continuously rose in parallel with the increase in do and the decrease in nh4 and po4 along the entire lower minnesota river this pattern concurs with the general relationship between phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake in a river system allan and castillo 2007 moreover the longitudinal variations in chl a do nh4 and po4 along the lower reach rm 14 3 rm 3 5 during this event were slightly greater than the longitudinal variations in the upper reach rm 39 4 rm 25 1 this is mainly because the lower reach had a longer residence time than the upper during the extremely low winter flow conditions providing a longer period of time for the growth of phytoplankton 3 2 relationships among discharge and upstream to downstream change in phytoplankton do and river nutrients the values of water temperature turbidity and river discharge as well as upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 during the late summer from 1999 to 2017 are listed in table s3 the canonical correlations of the first second and third canonical variate pairs are 0 90 0 44 and 0 21 respectively this suggests only the first canonical correlation is important the correlations between the first canonical variable for environmental factors and the three environmental factors water temperature turbidity and river discharge are 0 59 0 61 and 0 99 respectively the first canonical variable for environmental factors is most strongly related to river discharge indicating that river discharge is the most significant factor correlated to upstream to downstream change in phytoplankton do nh4 and po4 the relationship between river discharge and upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 is shown in fig 6 the detailed result about the canonical correlation analysis is provided in the supplementary information si 2 as showed in fig 6a discharge has an approximately linear relationship with the upstream to downstream decline in chl a additionally fig 6b d illustrates that discharge is strongly correlated to the upstream to downstream change in do nh4 and po4 in non linear ways these figures also demonstrate that the absolute upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 all increases with reduced river discharge of interest is the dramatic decline in do by more than 1 mg l 1 and the obvious increase in nh4 and po4 occur when the average discharges is lower than 103 m3 s 1 this analysis confirms that hydrodynamics play a prominent role in the water quality of the lower minnesota river described by the metropolitan council 2010 the summer low flow conditions provide a longer residence time in the lower reach for the biogeochemical reactions to occur therefore they become a driving force for the water quality degradation in this reach in addition the upstream to downstream decline in chl a is significantly correlated to the reduction of do and the increase in nh4 and po4 the pearson correlation coefficients of δchl a versus δdo δchl a versus δnh4 and δchl a versus δpo4 are 0 61 0 64 and 0 75 respectively the strong inter correlation among δchl a δdo δnh4 and δpo4 implies that these upstream to downstream changes result from the biogeochemical reactions involved in the phytoplankton do and nutrient cycles fig 7 a shows a remarkably linear relationship between the upstream to downstream decline in do and the increase in nh4 the correlation coefficient between them reaches 0 83 more importantly the linear regression equation between δdo and δnh4 indicates that the mass ratio of δdo δnh4 is 15 278 which is approximately equal to the theoretical ratio of oxygen consumption versus nh4 release when phytoplankton detritus is completely decomposed under aerobic conditions bailey et al 2003 based on the redfield ratio in phytoplankton redfield 1934 the molar ratio of c n p equals 106 16 1 and the mass ratio of c n p equals 41 7 23 1 the theoretical ratios of oxygen consumption vs nh4 release and oxygen consumption vs po4 release are calculated as 15 14 and 109 42 respectively assuming that 32 g oxygen is needed to oxidize 12 g carbon a ratio of do decline versus nh4 increase that is comparable to the expected redfield o n ratio implies that low do levels and elevated nh4 concentration in the lower minnesota river most likely result from decomposition of phytoplankton detritus remaining in this reach the ratio of δdo δpo4 and the corresponding correlation coefficient shown in fig 7b are lower than those associated with the theoretical ratio of oxygen consumption versus po4 release these results suggest that additional sources of po4 are discharged into the lower reach the increase in po4 is greater than the release of po4 that would result from decomposing phytoplankton detritus the point sources from seneca wwtp airport and black dog power plant see fig 1 may contribute to the downstream increase in po4 moreover the source of the elevated po4 may be the dissolution of particulate po4 in the water column james and larson 2008 in contrast to po4 the external point sources of nh4 have been substantially reduced since the update of wwtp in 1992 metropolitan council 2010 and its concentration was low in late summer with the exception of the years with substantial nh4 release from the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus see fig 4 3 3 performance of water quality model for predicting phytoplankton do and river nutrients the root mean square errors and relative errors of modeled water quality constituents at the four stations rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 rm 3 5 for the six years 2001 2006 are listed in table 2 the nsmii model reproduced observed do no3 doc and tn accurately with relative errors that were less than 12 in particular the root mean square errors of modeled do are generally less than 1 2 mg l 1 the relative errors of modeled chl a a pivotal element in the eutrophication model are less than 30 for all four stations the relative errors for nh4 po4 poc and tp are between 15 and 40 similar to or slightly better than the results of the two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 developed for the lower minnesota river smith et al 2010 comparisons between the measured and predicted chl a do nh4 and po4 at the four stations are provided in figs s2 5 water quality modeling results indicate that the nsmii model was able to reproduce the upstream to downstream decline in chl a and do as well as the concurrent increase in nh4 and po4 in late summer therefore it is reasonable to use this model to investigate the cause for the concurrent changes in chl a do nh4 and po4 during late summer low flow conditions 3 4 sources and sinks of modeled do nh4 and phytoplankton during late summer monthly average sources and sinks of modeled do and nh4 for the late summer july to september at five stations along the lower minnesota river are shown in fig 8 a and b major oxygen sources and sinks for the upper reach rm 39 4 rm 25 1 include oxygen produced by photosynthesis consumed by phytoplankton respiration and decomposition of labile organic carbon phytoplankton detritus as well as air water reaeration sediment oxygen consumption becomes an important sink of oxygen in the lower reach rm 14 3 rm 3 5 for the entire lower minnesota river oxygen consumed by refractory organic carbon nitrification and point sources from blue lake and seneca wwtps the airport and black dog power plant represented as cbod in fig 8a only account for a small fraction of the total oxygen sinks the air water reaeration shifts from an oxygen sink in the upper reach to an important oxygen source in the lower reach signifying that oxygen level declines from saturation to under saturation in the downstream direction during late summer based on the longitudinal variations in oxygen sources and sinks the summer low do levels in the lower reach navigation channel are caused by 1 significantly elevated sediment oxygen consumption 2 a decline in oxygen produced by phytoplankton photosynthesis 3 slightly increased oxygen demand by downstream point sources and 4 nitrification due to the downstream increase in nh4 meanwhile field surveys conducted by hydro2 2007 in july and september 2006 also confirmed that sediment oxygen consumption on the lower reach ranged from 0 26 to 4 g o2 m 2 d 1 with an average value of 1 84 g o2 m 2 d 1 much higher than 0 0 21 g o2 m 2 d 1 for the upper reach overall the sediment oxygen consumption accounts for approximately 1 4 to 1 3 of the total oxygen consumption in the lower reach based on model results as presented in fig 8b the net source of modeled nh4 is roughly equal to the net sink for the upper reach rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 nh4 produced by the death and basal metabolism of phytoplankton and by the mineralization of dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen are consumed by phytoplankton growth and nitrification resulting in a nearly zero concentration of nh4 in late summer of most years see measured nh4 at rm 39 4 in fig 4 in contrast the net gains of nh4 in the lower reach rm 14 3 rm 3 5 contribute to the obvious increase in nh4 levels downstream compared with the upper reach nh4 release from benthic sediments increases substantially and nh4 absorbed through phytoplankton photosynthesis decreases slightly in the lower reach this phenomenon is similar to the primary causes for the upstream to downstream decline in oxygen mentioned previously there is a significant increase in sediment oxygen consumption and a slight decline in oxygen production by phytoplankton photosynthesis in the lower reach therefore the coupled nitrogen and carbon processes that occur during photosynthesis and sediment diagenesis most likely result in the concurrent decline in do and increase in nh4 in addition nitrification in the lower reach increases slightly due to the elevated nh4 concentration since both nh4 released from mineralizing organic nitrogen and oxygen used by decomposing organic carbon do not vary much along the entire lower minnesota river the decomposition of non living organic matter in the water column is not responsible for the upstream to downstream change in nh4 and do monthly average sources and sinks of phytoplankton group 1 diatoms in late summer computed at five stations along the lower minnesota river are presented in fig 9 a the gain and loss of diatom biomass are almost equal in the upper reach rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 but this equilibrium does not exist in the lower reach due to reduced diatom growth and increased mortality and settling settling velocity and mortality rate for the diatoms in the lower reach are defined greater than those in the upper reach table s2 moreover the model predicts the growth of diatoms decreases from the upper reach to the lower reach because light limitations may intensify when diatoms that previously grew in a shallow well mixed upper reach enter a deeper mixed zone where a fraction of the diatoms are passively entrained to a deeper layer out of the euphotic zone the calculated values of the limiting factors for diatom growth light temperature nitrogen and phosphorus at the upstream rm 39 4 and downstream rm 3 5 sites are shown in fig 9b here a higher value associated with a limiting factor actually means fewer limitations on phytoplankton growth the model results show that the light limitation slightly increases while the nitrogen and phosphorus limitations decrease from upstream to downstream temperature is always a limiting factor for diatom growth during late summer for the entire lower minnesota river because diatom growth prefers cooler temperatures bowes et al 2016 and the only diatom bloom in the lower minnesota river occurred in winter 2003 see fig 4 for the other two phytoplankton groups cyanobacteria and others observed data and model results show their concentrations decline downstream in late summer the decline could also be due to an increase in settling rate or a decrease in light availability furthermore a reduction in velocity and a longer residence time in the lower reach make the net upstream to downstream loss of phytoplankton biomass more evident 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of low flow in eutrophic rivers studies on rivers such as the upper mississippi river and the eel river in usa the darling river in australia and the danube river in europe houser et al 2015 power et al 2015 dokulil 2014 found that river discharge was inversely related to phytoplankton biomass the low flows often promote phytoplankton blooms whereas the high flows inhibit phytoplankton growth due to the high turbidity stimulated by suspended solids however this study reveals a contrary relationship between river discharges and phytoplankton biomass in the lower minnesota river the lower flows correspond to greater downstream decline in chl a levels while higher flows result in no obvious longitudinal variation in chl a levels in late summer as discussed by metropolitan council 2010 hydrodynamics play a prominent role in the water quality conditions of the lower reach compared with the natural state of the river upstream the lower 22 mile human made navigation channel is deep and has slow moving waters with reduced mixing and turbulence jäger et al 2008 suggest that the water column depth and mixing intensity strongly affect phytoplankton biomass and functional community composition motile versus sinking taxa as non buoyant phytoplankton diatoms adapt to the highly turbulent and well mixed rivers jäger et al 2008 power et al 2015 descy et al 2017 thus settle quickly in the navigation channel therefore a greater portion of living and non living diatoms settle in the navigation channel resulting in a dramatic increase in sediment oxygen consumption and nutrient release under summer low flows in addition the mortality rate of phytoplankton may also increase in the navigation channel because the predation efficiency of grazers generally increases in slow moving waters hart 1992 low flow conditions in unidirectional eutrophic rivers substantially increase residence time and allow the phytoplankton to have sufficient time to grow settle or die in the rivers reynolds and descy 1996 hilton et al 2006 phytoplankton biomass in a river may increase or decrease temporally and spatially depending on temperature salinity and local hydrodynamics as well as the availability of nutrients and light leland et al 2001 but the magnitude of river discharge controls the amount of time available for net gain and loss under high flow conditions phytoplankton and pollutants may be washed out rapidly resulting in no significant concentration changes along the river as river discharge is reduced to a certain level the residence time of the river may become long enough to allow phytoplankton to uptake and deplete nutrients along the river continuum leading to downstream phytoplankton biomass decline in addition to an extended residence time low flow conditions also create more intermediate hydraulic storages i e dead zones of non flowing water which are capable of detaining algal rich waters for a sufficient amount of time to exacerbate downstream algal enrichment and loss reynolds 2000 allan and castillo 2007 moreover the air water reaeration rate decreases under low flow conditions reducing a river s capability to transfer oxygen from air and thus alleviate low do levels 4 2 impacts of phytoplankton dynamics on river water quality it has been well recognized that phytoplankton play a pivotal role in determining the do and nutrient dynamics of lakes and reservoirs but our understanding of how the phytoplankton affect river water quality has lagged behind allan and castillo 2007 the criterion used to assess eutrophication levels and classify the trophic state of rivers and streams are often determined based on nutrient concentration n and p and benthic algae biomass but not on phytoplankton biomass biggs 2000 dodds 2007 however this study finds that the upstream to downstream decline in do varies concurrently and linearly with the downstream increase in nh4 and the δdo δnh4 ratio is particularly close to the expected redfield o n ratio indicating that the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus is the primary reason for the low do levels and the increased nh4 and po4 concentration in the lower minnesota river previous studies on low do levels in eutrophic rivers found that the biological oxygen demand was strongly related to the chl a level in river water samples volkmar and dahlgren 2006 but there was no solid evidence from field observations to prove that low do levels are directly caused by the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus in a river system the study on the klamath river conjectured that the low do levels and the amount of nitrogen appeared to be strongly driven by algal blooms oliver et al 2014 field surveys on sediment oxygen consumption and benthic nutrient flux in the anacostia river usa in summer 2002 found that the sediment o n flux ratios at most locations were close to the redfield atomic ratio of 106 8 suggesting sediment oxygen and nutrient releases also resulted from the aerobic decomposition of settled phytoplankton detritus bailey et al 2003 the water depth and sediment oxygen demand of the anacostia river were 3 8 m and 2 2 g o2 m 2 d 1 respectively similar to the values in the navigation channel of the lower minnesota river during late summer hydro2 2007 it is highly possible that the sediment o n flux ratio is also close to the redfield ratio in the lower minnesota river therefore high levels of phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic rivers may impair river water quality when massive die offs and settling of phytoplankton biomass take place under low flow conditions due to the potential detrimental impact of phytoplankton it is important to identify where the phytoplankton come from and then propose effective water quality control measures the chl a level at the upstream boundary of the lower minnesota river rm 39 4 in late summer is very high with an average of 0 09 mg l 1 furthermore measured chl a levels in 2001 2004 at rm 120 and rm 89 7 approximately 80 and 50 miles upstream of the lower minnesota river see fig 1 indicate that most phytoplankton come from upstream of rm 120 as shown in fig 10 the chl a level either declines slightly or increases by a maximum of 35 from rm 120 to rm 25 1 this implies that the in stream phytoplankton growth is relatively low in late summer and most phytoplankton blooms may come from further upstream e g the lac qui parle reservoir at rm 284 or from upstream tributaries accordingly controlling the algal blooms that occur farthermost upstream is the key to alleviating the water quality degradation in the lower minnesota river on the other hand the acceptable water quality between rm 120 and rm 25 1 with normal oxygen levels also suggests that it is possible for a eutrophic river to carry high but relatively stable levels of phytoplankton chl a is around 0 1 mg l 1 without causing severe water quality degradation in the river reaches that have short residence times 4 3 synergistic effects of low flows and high levels of phytoplankton on river water quality eutrophic rivers commonly have high levels of phytoplankton biomass in summer coming from upstream lakes and reservoirs or through in stream growth due to enriched nutrients global warming and hydrological alterations volkmar and dahlgren 2006 allan and castillo 2007 heffernan et al 2010 yet low do level or hypoxia in rivers occur less frequently than those in lakes reservoirs and estuaries hydrodynamics and turbulent mixing under normal flow conditions play a significant role in maintaining good water quality of a river nilsson and renöfält 2008 liu et al 2012 however as river discharge decreases to certain low level eutrophic rivers behave more like eutrophic lakes and reservoirs hilton et al 2006 algal blooms and bloom collapses become more frequent and the variations in do and nutrient concentration are higher and more related to growth and death of phytoplankton dodds 2007 o hare et al 2018 it is the low flows and high levels of phytoplankton biomass working together results in the impaired water quality low do level and nutrient regeneration therefore one possible way to maintain acceptable water quality in eutrophic rivers is to avoid the concurrence of low flows and high levels of phytoplankton for the rivers that have already had a high level of phytoplankton it is critical to find the threshold discharge that can prevent phytoplankton collapse through analyzing the relationship between river discharge and downstream change in phytoplankton biomass this threshold discharge can be used as a minimum environmental flow or as an emergent method for water quality improvement during a sudden bloom collapse 5 concluding remarks long term flow and water quality monitoring data suggest that the upstream to downstream decline in phytoplankton biomass parallels the lowered do and the elevated nh4 and po4 that takes place during late summer low flow conditions in the lower minnesota river the obvious longitudinal changes in phytoplankton biomass do and river nutrients primarily originate in the 22 mile navigation channel which has greater water depth and slower flow velocity the river discharge during late summer was inversely correlated with the magnitude of phytoplankton biomass decline and the obvious downstream changes in chl a do nh4 and po4 all occurred under river discharges that were lower than 102 m3 s 1 a low discharge combined with the deepened navigation channel morphology reduced the in channel mixing and turbulence resulting in greater settling rates of living and non living phytoplankton predominated by diatoms the ratio of do change versus the nh4 change is particularly close to the redfield o n ratio indicating that the obvious downstream changes in do and nutrient content most likely resulted from the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus under aerobic conditions the river water quality model and the field survey data on sediment oxygen demand together demonstrate that the substantial increase in sediment oxygen consumption and nutrient release produced by decomposing settled phytoplankton detritus could be the primary reason for the low do levels and the increased nutrient concentration downstream this study of the lower minnesota river water quality provides a new paradigm which suggests that slow moving hydrodynamics in a deep navigation channel under late summer low flow conditions can shift a finely balanced eutrophic river system to a degraded state with low do levels and high regenerated nutrient concentrations the high level of phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic rivers may impair river water quality when the massive die off or settling of phytoplankton occurs under summer low flow conditions since the phytoplankton in eutrophic rivers may come from in stream growth or from upstream lakes reservoirs and tributaries river water quality management first needs to identify the source of phytoplankton both phytoplankton blooms and collapses are most likely to take place under low flow conditions or in a deep channel with long residence time therefore regulating river discharge local channel geometry and hydrodynamics to prevent the abrupt phytoplankton blooms and collapses may be an alternative way to maintain acceptable water quality in eutrophic rivers acknowledgements the study was partially funded by the u s army corps of engineers ecosystem

18693,the underlying physical and biogeochemical mechanisms associated with low dissolved oxygen do levels below 5 mg l 1 were examined through field data analyses and water quality modeling of the lower 40 miles of the minnesota river insights into flow and water quality data of nineteen years 1999 2017 at five sites demonstrate that low do levels parallel the obvious longitudinal upstream to downstream decline in phytoplankton biomass and increase in ammonium nitrogen nh4 and dissolved orthophosphate po4 in the last 22 mile river reach i e navigation channel during late summer low flow conditions river discharge is inversely related to the magnitude of the longitudinal change in do phytoplankton biomass nh4 and po4 indicating that the late summer low flow hydrodynamics in the navigation channel with a longer residence time deeper water and slower velocity provide an extended opportunity for the biogeochemical reactions involving phytoplankton do and nutrients moreover the ratio of the longitudinal decline in do versus the longitudinal increase in nh4 is particularly close to the redfield o n ratio suggesting that the decline in do and increase in nutrients most likely result from the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus under aerobic conditions this is further proved by the water quality modeling of the lower minnesota river the primary reasons for impaired water quality are substantially elevated sediment oxygen consumption and nutrient release derived from the decomposition of settled phytoplankton detritus in the navigation channel therefore we recommend that active prevention of abrupt phytoplankton blooms and collapses through regulation of river discharge and local hydrodynamics may assist in maintaining acceptable water quality in eutrophic rivers with a high level of phytoplankton biomass graphical abstract image 1 keywords river eutrophication low do levels summer low flows concurrent change in do and nh4 sediment oxygen

et al 1980 magnitude of river discharge that determines residence time and hydrodynamics is a critical factor affecting river water quality hilton et al 2006 o hare et al 2018 nutrients and pollutants under high discharges with short residence times may not have adequate time to participate in significant chemical and biological processes therefore river water quality is primarily determined by physical processes such as tributary dilution boundary loading downstream transport and vertical settling or resuspension reynolds and descy 1996 dodd 2007 houser et al 2015 descy et al 2017 water quality constituents in rivers with long residence times are more likely to be dominated by a large number of biogeochemical processes such as decay and transformation of nutrients and pollutants growth and death of plankton benthic algae and macrophytes biggs 2000 reynolds 2000 volkmar and dahlgren 2006 oliver et al 2014 since river discharge is highly variable seasonally key processes that dominate river water quality may shift rapidly following the dynamic flow regime reynolds 2000 nilsson and renöfält 2008 minaudo et al 2015 for river reaches with impaired water quality it is necessary to understand under which flow conditions river water quality is primarily determined by physical processes and which chemical and or biological processes dominate water quality when the physical processes play a smaller role bowes et al 2016 eutrophication is a widespread water quality problem in many rivers worldwide dodds and smith 2016 with high levels of nutrients and phytoplankton eutrophic rivers occasionally suffer low dissolved oxygen do levels below 5 mg l 1 causing stress to aquatic organisms volkmar and dahlgren 2006 although excessive nutrient loading is the most direct reason of eutrophication other factors such as an increase in residence time changes in grazer control as well as global warming play significant roles in driving or intensifying river eutrophication heffernan et al 2010 for instance the fundamental shift away from free flowing water from river to reservoir after dam construction led to severe algal blooms in the tributary bays of the three gorges reservoir china liu et al 2012 changes in the critical threshold in summer and winter discharges can potentially tilt the eel river of northwestern california usa from a recovering salmon supporting ecosystem to a cyanobacterially degraded river power et al 2015 in some cases river water quality degrades simply because it receives highly eutrophic water from upstream reservoirs lakes or lateral sewage oliver et al 2014 dodds and smith 2016 high phytoplankton concentrations and low do levels observed in the klamath river were associated with the development of large algal blooms just upstream in upper klamath lake doyle and lynch 2005 since the nutrient levels in a river are unlikely to be reduced to the oligotrophic level within a short period carpenter 2005 it is worthwhile to investigate the underlying mechanisms and alternative solutions for water quality degradation based on the physical chemical and biological characteristics of eutrophic rivers the lower 40 miles of the minnesota river from jordon minnesota to the confluence with the mississippi river is a highly eutrophic reach with peak chlorophyll a chl a exceeding 0 2 g l 1 in the summer months james and larson 2008 in addition to high levels of nutrients and chl a from upstream this reach also receives discharges from several point sources and tributaries moreover the last 22 miles of the lower minnesota river is a navigation channel with an average depth of 6 m which is approximately 3 m deeper and has a longer residence time than the upstream natural reach in the late summer low do level in the range of 4 5 mg l 1 may occur in the navigation channel the low do levels in the lower minnesota river are of major concern because they impact a wide range of plant and animal species metropolitan council 2010 meanwhile it is observed that both chl a and do concurrently declined from the upstream to downstream smith et al 2010 this study addresses the following questions 1 what is the relationship between a decline in chl a and a low do level and 2 how do physical and biogeochemical processes interact to affect the water quality of the lower minnesota river through long term flow and water quality data analysis and river water quality modeling in this study water quality data of nineteen years 1999 2017 at five sites along the lower minnesota river were analyzed to investigate the upstream to downstream variations in chl a do ammonium nitrogen nh4 and dissolved orthophosphate po4 and their correlation with magnitude of river discharge the ratios of variation in do versus variations in nh4 and po4 were compared to redfield ratios to indicate the possible relationship between downstream decline in phytoplankton and nutrient regeneration a latest one dimensional 1d riverine water quality model was applied to the lower minnesota river to explain the identified upstream to downstream variations in chl a do nh4 and po4 the effects of low flow and high phytoplankton levels on water quality in eutrophic rivers were also discussed this study provides insight on how to improve do problems in eutrophic rivers through regulating residence time local hydrodynamics and phytoplankton dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lower minnesota river begins in jordon minnesota river mile rm 39 4 to the river mouth where the minnesota river joins the mississippi river as shown in fig 1 this reach has ten tributaries and receives discharge from two large wastewater treatment plants wwtp blue lake and seneca respectively storm water discharges from the minneapolis st paul international airport and cooling water discharges from the black dog power plant also enter this reach metropolitan council maintains five water quality monitoring stations in the lower minnesota river i e rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 unlike the upper portion of the lower minnesota river the lower 22 mile from rm 22 to the mouth of the minnesota river is a deep 4 m and wide navigation channel the lower minnesota river appears on the state s list of impaired waters for the low do levels below 5 mg l 1 observed in the navigation channel during late summer metropolitan council 2010 hydrology and hydrodynamics play prominent roles in the water quality conditions of the lower minnesota river smith et al 2010 metropolitan council 2010 daily discharge data at jordon usgs station 05330000 close to rm 39 4 show that seasonal discharge varies greatly high flow greater than 1000 m3 s 1 occurs in spring early summer from april to june low flow with several pulses dominates in late summer from july to september extremely low flow in the range of 11 28 m3 s 1 prevails in winter in most years summer low flow frequently drops below 50 m3 s 1 even as low as winter low flow rates resulting in very slow moving waters in the navigation channel with velocities less than 0 2 m s 1 as shown in fig 2 a the residence time through the lower minnesota river varies with river discharge using cross section average velocities computed by a 1d hydraulic model under different flow rates the estimated residence time of the lower minnesota river is shorter than 2 days for discharges larger than 100 m3 s 1 but increases to 4 10 days as the discharge drops below 50 m3 s 1 fig 2b the long residence time of water in the navigation channel may cause oxygen poor environments since organic matter will have a longer time to decompose and consume oxygen 2 2 water quality data and statistical analysis weekly and biweekly water quality data were collected between 1999 and 2017 at five stations along the lower minnesota river rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 see fig 1 this information was used to identify the longitudinal variation patterns of phytoplankton do and river nutrients and build a water quality model the data were downloaded from metropolitan council website https eims metc state mn us worth noting is that data at rm 25 1 and rm 14 1 were not as complete as the other three stations the two stations have complete water quality data only in 2004 2006 the water quality constituents analyzed in this study include temperature do chl a pheophytin a pheo a nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 filtered and unfiltered total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn filtered and unfiltered po4 filtered and unfiltered total phosphorus tp dissolved organic carbon doc volatile suspended solids vss turbidity carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod 5 day and cbod ultimate the chl a level represents the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass while the pheo a level represents the biomass of dead phytoplankton phytoplankton were divided into three major functional groups diatoms cyanobacteria and others diatoms are the dominant phytoplankton group but amounts vary slightly each month table 1 phytoplankton are the main aquatic plants in the lower minnesota river because high turbidity and low light inhibit periphyton and macrophyte growth metropolitan council 2010 the water quality data were analyzed in two ways first the net upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 were estimated by computing the differences between the upstream rm 39 4 and downstream rm 3 5 measurements during the period obvious upstream to downstream change occurred water quality constituents measured at all five stations on the same day or on two consecutive days were compared to identify the specific reach in which the longitudinal changes began and ended due to incomplete data collection at rm 25 1 and rm 14 3 only water quality data from 2004 to 2006 were analyzed for this purpose next the main factor that causes the upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 during late summer july september was discerned from three potential factors water temperature turbidity and river discharge by using canonical correlation analysis the ratios of the downstream change in do versus the downstream changes in nh4 and po4 were estimated and compared to the theoretical ratio of o n oxygen nitrogen and o p oxygen phosphorous involved in the biochemical process of decomposing phytoplankton detritus 2 3 river water quality modeling a 1d nutrient simulation model nsmii was applied to the lower minnesota river to simulate water quality dynamics from april 2001 september 2006 the nsmii simulates the following 20 constituents zhang and johnson 2016 three phytoplankton groups do nh4 no3 total po4 dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphorus dop labile and refractory dissolved organic carbon ldoc and rdoc labile and refractory particulate organic carbon lpoc and rpoc labile and refractory particulate organic nitrogen lpon and rpon labile and refractory particulate organic phosphorus lpop and rpop and three groups of cbod the three cbod groups represented discharges from blue lake wwtp and black dog plant cbod1 seneca wwtp cbod2 and airport cbod3 respectively a sediment diagenesis module in nsmii was turned on to simulate sediment oxygen demand and nutrient fluxes from bed sediments the biogeochemical processes among the 20 constituents are sketched in fig 3 a detailed description about the nsmii is provided in the supplementary information si 1 the total 40 miles of the lower minnesota river were divided into two water quality reaches using rm 22 as the border so that different parameter values could be assigned to each reach according to hydrodynamic conditions settling velocities of phytoplankton and particulate organic matter in the lower reach were assigned higher values than in the upper reach based on the fact that pheo a at rm 3 5 was greater than that at rm 39 4 fig s1 the death rate of diatoms in the lower reach was assumed to be slightly higher remaining water quality model parameters were given the same values for both reaches the key parameter values used for the lower minnesota river nsmii model are listed in table s2 model s ability to predict the temporal and spatial dynamics of chl a do nh4 no3 po4 doc poc total nitrogen tn and tp was evaluated by calculating the root mean square errors and relative errors between the predicted and measured water quality constituents the calibrated model was then used to investigate the underlying mechanisms that cause the observed longitudinal variation patterns of phytoplankton do and nh4 during late summer low flow conditions monthly average sources and sinks of modeled do nh4 and diatoms at the five stations rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 were analyzed the contributions of every source and sink to the net kinetic change of do nh4 and diatoms in the upper and lower reaches of the lower minnesota river were compared to indicate main causes of downstream decline in phytoplankton and low do levels in the navigation channel 3 results 3 1 the concurrent upstream to downstream change in phytoplankton do and river nutrients during low flows measured chl a do nh4 and po4 concentration at the upstream rm 39 4 and downstream rm 3 5 stations are shown in fig 4 the discharge data at rm 39 4 are also presented in this figure the no3 levels are not included in this figure because there wasn t any significant change less than 10 during this period in the maximum upstream to downstream values this figure reveals a decline in chl a levels at the downstream station paralleling the reduction in do during the late summer july september of 2002 2003 2006 2009 2012 and 2013 as shown in the grey dash box concurrently increases in nh4 and po4 concentrations were also observed at the downstream station moreover the downstream increase in nh4 was more significant than the downstream increase in po4 in 2009 2012 the downstream increase in nh4 in late summer was substantial approaching its maximum level observed in winter 0 3 0 4 mg l 1 the earlier study conducted by the metropolitan council 2010 indicated the annual budget of nh4 increased downstream but there was a lack of information on how and why that occurred the long term observation data presented in fig 4 clearly suggests that a great amount of nh4 was released in late summer coincident with the substantial reduction in do although the nh4 concentration occasionally increases due to the discharge of point sources into the river for instance the increase of nh4 in spring 2015 point sources have not been a major contributor to the elevated nutrient levels in late summer since the update of wwtps in 1992 smith et al 2010 metropolitan council 2010 the other causes for the downstream increase in nh4 need further investigation in the meantime it is worth noticing that the substantial downstream changes in chl a do nh4 and po4 in late summer only took place during low flow conditions in contrast no obvious downstream changes in chl a do and river nutrients were observed in late summer with high flows in 2011 2016 and 2017 during the nineteen year period only one large scale phytoplankton bloom was observed in winter 2003 this phytoplankton bloom lasted more than two months from late november to january when water temperature and discharge were extremely low temperature ranged from 0 to 5 c and discharge was between 10 and 15 m3 s 1 this indicates that the bloom of diatoms in the lower minnesota river preferred low water temperature slow flow velocity and long residence time during the bloom the increase in do and decrease in nh4 and po4 were accompanied by an increase in chl a in the downstream direction see the green dash box fig 4 by analyzing the three year 2004 2006 water quality data measured at the five stations along the lower minnesota river rm 39 4 rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 and rm 3 5 we found that the decline in phytoplankton biomass during late summer primarily started from below rm 25 1 and continued to the mouth of the minnesota river at rm 3 5 in the three years chl a level either increased or decreased by no more than 10 between rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 as presented in fig 5 a d the concentration of chl a do nh4 and po4 did not change very much along the upper reach between rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 but the longitudinal decline in chl a and do as well as the increase in nh4 and po4 were distinctive in the lower reach between rm 14 3 and rm 3 5 the longitudinal decrease in chl a and do accompanied by the increase in nh4 and po4 took place in the lower reach between rm 22 and the mouth of the minnesota river which is also a deep navigation channel with slow flow velocity and a long residence time in addition the low levels of nh4 and po4 dominating the upper reach rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 indicate that nitrate might be the main nitrogen source for phytoplankton growth and po4 becomes a limiting nutrient in the upper reach during late summer the longitudinal variations in chl a do nh4 and po4 during the only algal bloom which occurred in winter 2003 are shown in fig 5 e h during this algal bloom event the chl a level continuously rose in parallel with the increase in do and the decrease in nh4 and po4 along the entire lower minnesota river this pattern concurs with the general relationship between phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake in a river system allan and castillo 2007 moreover the longitudinal variations in chl a do nh4 and po4 along the lower reach rm 14 3 rm 3 5 during this event were slightly greater than the longitudinal variations in the upper reach rm 39 4 rm 25 1 this is mainly because the lower reach had a longer residence time than the upper during the extremely low winter flow conditions providing a longer period of time for the growth of phytoplankton 3 2 relationships among discharge and upstream to downstream change in phytoplankton do and river nutrients the values of water temperature turbidity and river discharge as well as upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 during the late summer from 1999 to 2017 are listed in table s3 the canonical correlations of the first second and third canonical variate pairs are 0 90 0 44 and 0 21 respectively this suggests only the first canonical correlation is important the correlations between the first canonical variable for environmental factors and the three environmental factors water temperature turbidity and river discharge are 0 59 0 61 and 0 99 respectively the first canonical variable for environmental factors is most strongly related to river discharge indicating that river discharge is the most significant factor correlated to upstream to downstream change in phytoplankton do nh4 and po4 the relationship between river discharge and upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 is shown in fig 6 the detailed result about the canonical correlation analysis is provided in the supplementary information si 2 as showed in fig 6a discharge has an approximately linear relationship with the upstream to downstream decline in chl a additionally fig 6b d illustrates that discharge is strongly correlated to the upstream to downstream change in do nh4 and po4 in non linear ways these figures also demonstrate that the absolute upstream to downstream change in chl a do nh4 and po4 all increases with reduced river discharge of interest is the dramatic decline in do by more than 1 mg l 1 and the obvious increase in nh4 and po4 occur when the average discharges is lower than 103 m3 s 1 this analysis confirms that hydrodynamics play a prominent role in the water quality of the lower minnesota river described by the metropolitan council 2010 the summer low flow conditions provide a longer residence time in the lower reach for the biogeochemical reactions to occur therefore they become a driving force for the water quality degradation in this reach in addition the upstream to downstream decline in chl a is significantly correlated to the reduction of do and the increase in nh4 and po4 the pearson correlation coefficients of δchl a versus δdo δchl a versus δnh4 and δchl a versus δpo4 are 0 61 0 64 and 0 75 respectively the strong inter correlation among δchl a δdo δnh4 and δpo4 implies that these upstream to downstream changes result from the biogeochemical reactions involved in the phytoplankton do and nutrient cycles fig 7 a shows a remarkably linear relationship between the upstream to downstream decline in do and the increase in nh4 the correlation coefficient between them reaches 0 83 more importantly the linear regression equation between δdo and δnh4 indicates that the mass ratio of δdo δnh4 is 15 278 which is approximately equal to the theoretical ratio of oxygen consumption versus nh4 release when phytoplankton detritus is completely decomposed under aerobic conditions bailey et al 2003 based on the redfield ratio in phytoplankton redfield 1934 the molar ratio of c n p equals 106 16 1 and the mass ratio of c n p equals 41 7 23 1 the theoretical ratios of oxygen consumption vs nh4 release and oxygen consumption vs po4 release are calculated as 15 14 and 109 42 respectively assuming that 32 g oxygen is needed to oxidize 12 g carbon a ratio of do decline versus nh4 increase that is comparable to the expected redfield o n ratio implies that low do levels and elevated nh4 concentration in the lower minnesota river most likely result from decomposition of phytoplankton detritus remaining in this reach the ratio of δdo δpo4 and the corresponding correlation coefficient shown in fig 7b are lower than those associated with the theoretical ratio of oxygen consumption versus po4 release these results suggest that additional sources of po4 are discharged into the lower reach the increase in po4 is greater than the release of po4 that would result from decomposing phytoplankton detritus the point sources from seneca wwtp airport and black dog power plant see fig 1 may contribute to the downstream increase in po4 moreover the source of the elevated po4 may be the dissolution of particulate po4 in the water column james and larson 2008 in contrast to po4 the external point sources of nh4 have been substantially reduced since the update of wwtp in 1992 metropolitan council 2010 and its concentration was low in late summer with the exception of the years with substantial nh4 release from the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus see fig 4 3 3 performance of water quality model for predicting phytoplankton do and river nutrients the root mean square errors and relative errors of modeled water quality constituents at the four stations rm 25 1 rm 14 3 rm 8 5 rm 3 5 for the six years 2001 2006 are listed in table 2 the nsmii model reproduced observed do no3 doc and tn accurately with relative errors that were less than 12 in particular the root mean square errors of modeled do are generally less than 1 2 mg l 1 the relative errors of modeled chl a a pivotal element in the eutrophication model are less than 30 for all four stations the relative errors for nh4 po4 poc and tp are between 15 and 40 similar to or slightly better than the results of the two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 developed for the lower minnesota river smith et al 2010 comparisons between the measured and predicted chl a do nh4 and po4 at the four stations are provided in figs s2 5 water quality modeling results indicate that the nsmii model was able to reproduce the upstream to downstream decline in chl a and do as well as the concurrent increase in nh4 and po4 in late summer therefore it is reasonable to use this model to investigate the cause for the concurrent changes in chl a do nh4 and po4 during late summer low flow conditions 3 4 sources and sinks of modeled do nh4 and phytoplankton during late summer monthly average sources and sinks of modeled do and nh4 for the late summer july to september at five stations along the lower minnesota river are shown in fig 8 a and b major oxygen sources and sinks for the upper reach rm 39 4 rm 25 1 include oxygen produced by photosynthesis consumed by phytoplankton respiration and decomposition of labile organic carbon phytoplankton detritus as well as air water reaeration sediment oxygen consumption becomes an important sink of oxygen in the lower reach rm 14 3 rm 3 5 for the entire lower minnesota river oxygen consumed by refractory organic carbon nitrification and point sources from blue lake and seneca wwtps the airport and black dog power plant represented as cbod in fig 8a only account for a small fraction of the total oxygen sinks the air water reaeration shifts from an oxygen sink in the upper reach to an important oxygen source in the lower reach signifying that oxygen level declines from saturation to under saturation in the downstream direction during late summer based on the longitudinal variations in oxygen sources and sinks the summer low do levels in the lower reach navigation channel are caused by 1 significantly elevated sediment oxygen consumption 2 a decline in oxygen produced by phytoplankton photosynthesis 3 slightly increased oxygen demand by downstream point sources and 4 nitrification due to the downstream increase in nh4 meanwhile field surveys conducted by hydro2 2007 in july and september 2006 also confirmed that sediment oxygen consumption on the lower reach ranged from 0 26 to 4 g o2 m 2 d 1 with an average value of 1 84 g o2 m 2 d 1 much higher than 0 0 21 g o2 m 2 d 1 for the upper reach overall the sediment oxygen consumption accounts for approximately 1 4 to 1 3 of the total oxygen consumption in the lower reach based on model results as presented in fig 8b the net source of modeled nh4 is roughly equal to the net sink for the upper reach rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 nh4 produced by the death and basal metabolism of phytoplankton and by the mineralization of dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen are consumed by phytoplankton growth and nitrification resulting in a nearly zero concentration of nh4 in late summer of most years see measured nh4 at rm 39 4 in fig 4 in contrast the net gains of nh4 in the lower reach rm 14 3 rm 3 5 contribute to the obvious increase in nh4 levels downstream compared with the upper reach nh4 release from benthic sediments increases substantially and nh4 absorbed through phytoplankton photosynthesis decreases slightly in the lower reach this phenomenon is similar to the primary causes for the upstream to downstream decline in oxygen mentioned previously there is a significant increase in sediment oxygen consumption and a slight decline in oxygen production by phytoplankton photosynthesis in the lower reach therefore the coupled nitrogen and carbon processes that occur during photosynthesis and sediment diagenesis most likely result in the concurrent decline in do and increase in nh4 in addition nitrification in the lower reach increases slightly due to the elevated nh4 concentration since both nh4 released from mineralizing organic nitrogen and oxygen used by decomposing organic carbon do not vary much along the entire lower minnesota river the decomposition of non living organic matter in the water column is not responsible for the upstream to downstream change in nh4 and do monthly average sources and sinks of phytoplankton group 1 diatoms in late summer computed at five stations along the lower minnesota river are presented in fig 9 a the gain and loss of diatom biomass are almost equal in the upper reach rm 39 4 and rm 25 1 but this equilibrium does not exist in the lower reach due to reduced diatom growth and increased mortality and settling settling velocity and mortality rate for the diatoms in the lower reach are defined greater than those in the upper reach table s2 moreover the model predicts the growth of diatoms decreases from the upper reach to the lower reach because light limitations may intensify when diatoms that previously grew in a shallow well mixed upper reach enter a deeper mixed zone where a fraction of the diatoms are passively entrained to a deeper layer out of the euphotic zone the calculated values of the limiting factors for diatom growth light temperature nitrogen and phosphorus at the upstream rm 39 4 and downstream rm 3 5 sites are shown in fig 9b here a higher value associated with a limiting factor actually means fewer limitations on phytoplankton growth the model results show that the light limitation slightly increases while the nitrogen and phosphorus limitations decrease from upstream to downstream temperature is always a limiting factor for diatom growth during late summer for the entire lower minnesota river because diatom growth prefers cooler temperatures bowes et al 2016 and the only diatom bloom in the lower minnesota river occurred in winter 2003 see fig 4 for the other two phytoplankton groups cyanobacteria and others observed data and model results show their concentrations decline downstream in late summer the decline could also be due to an increase in settling rate or a decrease in light availability furthermore a reduction in velocity and a longer residence time in the lower reach make the net upstream to downstream loss of phytoplankton biomass more evident 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of low flow in eutrophic rivers studies on rivers such as the upper mississippi river and the eel river in usa the darling river in australia and the danube river in europe houser et al 2015 power et al 2015 dokulil 2014 found that river discharge was inversely related to phytoplankton biomass the low flows often promote phytoplankton blooms whereas the high flows inhibit phytoplankton growth due to the high turbidity stimulated by suspended solids however this study reveals a contrary relationship between river discharges and phytoplankton biomass in the lower minnesota river the lower flows correspond to greater downstream decline in chl a levels while higher flows result in no obvious longitudinal variation in chl a levels in late summer as discussed by metropolitan council 2010 hydrodynamics play a prominent role in the water quality conditions of the lower reach compared with the natural state of the river upstream the lower 22 mile human made navigation channel is deep and has slow moving waters with reduced mixing and turbulence jäger et al 2008 suggest that the water column depth and mixing intensity strongly affect phytoplankton biomass and functional community composition motile versus sinking taxa as non buoyant phytoplankton diatoms adapt to the highly turbulent and well mixed rivers jäger et al 2008 power et al 2015 descy et al 2017 thus settle quickly in the navigation channel therefore a greater portion of living and non living diatoms settle in the navigation channel resulting in a dramatic increase in sediment oxygen consumption and nutrient release under summer low flows in addition the mortality rate of phytoplankton may also increase in the navigation channel because the predation efficiency of grazers generally increases in slow moving waters hart 1992 low flow conditions in unidirectional eutrophic rivers substantially increase residence time and allow the phytoplankton to have sufficient time to grow settle or die in the rivers reynolds and descy 1996 hilton et al 2006 phytoplankton biomass in a river may increase or decrease temporally and spatially depending on temperature salinity and local hydrodynamics as well as the availability of nutrients and light leland et al 2001 but the magnitude of river discharge controls the amount of time available for net gain and loss under high flow conditions phytoplankton and pollutants may be washed out rapidly resulting in no significant concentration changes along the river as river discharge is reduced to a certain level the residence time of the river may become long enough to allow phytoplankton to uptake and deplete nutrients along the river continuum leading to downstream phytoplankton biomass decline in addition to an extended residence time low flow conditions also create more intermediate hydraulic storages i e dead zones of non flowing water which are capable of detaining algal rich waters for a sufficient amount of time to exacerbate downstream algal enrichment and loss reynolds 2000 allan and castillo 2007 moreover the air water reaeration rate decreases under low flow conditions reducing a river s capability to transfer oxygen from air and thus alleviate low do levels 4 2 impacts of phytoplankton dynamics on river water quality it has been well recognized that phytoplankton play a pivotal role in determining the do and nutrient dynamics of lakes and reservoirs but our understanding of how the phytoplankton affect river water quality has lagged behind allan and castillo 2007 the criterion used to assess eutrophication levels and classify the trophic state of rivers and streams are often determined based on nutrient concentration n and p and benthic algae biomass but not on phytoplankton biomass biggs 2000 dodds 2007 however this study finds that the upstream to downstream decline in do varies concurrently and linearly with the downstream increase in nh4 and the δdo δnh4 ratio is particularly close to the expected redfield o n ratio indicating that the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus is the primary reason for the low do levels and the increased nh4 and po4 concentration in the lower minnesota river previous studies on low do levels in eutrophic rivers found that the biological oxygen demand was strongly related to the chl a level in river water samples volkmar and dahlgren 2006 but there was no solid evidence from field observations to prove that low do levels are directly caused by the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus in a river system the study on the klamath river conjectured that the low do levels and the amount of nitrogen appeared to be strongly driven by algal blooms oliver et al 2014 field surveys on sediment oxygen consumption and benthic nutrient flux in the anacostia river usa in summer 2002 found that the sediment o n flux ratios at most locations were close to the redfield atomic ratio of 106 8 suggesting sediment oxygen and nutrient releases also resulted from the aerobic decomposition of settled phytoplankton detritus bailey et al 2003 the water depth and sediment oxygen demand of the anacostia river were 3 8 m and 2 2 g o2 m 2 d 1 respectively similar to the values in the navigation channel of the lower minnesota river during late summer hydro2 2007 it is highly possible that the sediment o n flux ratio is also close to the redfield ratio in the lower minnesota river therefore high levels of phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic rivers may impair river water quality when massive die offs and settling of phytoplankton biomass take place under low flow conditions due to the potential detrimental impact of phytoplankton it is important to identify where the phytoplankton come from and then propose effective water quality control measures the chl a level at the upstream boundary of the lower minnesota river rm 39 4 in late summer is very high with an average of 0 09 mg l 1 furthermore measured chl a levels in 2001 2004 at rm 120 and rm 89 7 approximately 80 and 50 miles upstream of the lower minnesota river see fig 1 indicate that most phytoplankton come from upstream of rm 120 as shown in fig 10 the chl a level either declines slightly or increases by a maximum of 35 from rm 120 to rm 25 1 this implies that the in stream phytoplankton growth is relatively low in late summer and most phytoplankton blooms may come from further upstream e g the lac qui parle reservoir at rm 284 or from upstream tributaries accordingly controlling the algal blooms that occur farthermost upstream is the key to alleviating the water quality degradation in the lower minnesota river on the other hand the acceptable water quality between rm 120 and rm 25 1 with normal oxygen levels also suggests that it is possible for a eutrophic river to carry high but relatively stable levels of phytoplankton chl a is around 0 1 mg l 1 without causing severe water quality degradation in the river reaches that have short residence times 4 3 synergistic effects of low flows and high levels of phytoplankton on river water quality eutrophic rivers commonly have high levels of phytoplankton biomass in summer coming from upstream lakes and reservoirs or through in stream growth due to enriched nutrients global warming and hydrological alterations volkmar and dahlgren 2006 allan and castillo 2007 heffernan et al 2010 yet low do level or hypoxia in rivers occur less frequently than those in lakes reservoirs and estuaries hydrodynamics and turbulent mixing under normal flow conditions play a significant role in maintaining good water quality of a river nilsson and renöfält 2008 liu et al 2012 however as river discharge decreases to certain low level eutrophic rivers behave more like eutrophic lakes and reservoirs hilton et al 2006 algal blooms and bloom collapses become more frequent and the variations in do and nutrient concentration are higher and more related to growth and death of phytoplankton dodds 2007 o hare et al 2018 it is the low flows and high levels of phytoplankton biomass working together results in the impaired water quality low do level and nutrient regeneration therefore one possible way to maintain acceptable water quality in eutrophic rivers is to avoid the concurrence of low flows and high levels of phytoplankton for the rivers that have already had a high level of phytoplankton it is critical to find the threshold discharge that can prevent phytoplankton collapse through analyzing the relationship between river discharge and downstream change in phytoplankton biomass this threshold discharge can be used as a minimum environmental flow or as an emergent method for water quality improvement during a sudden bloom collapse 5 concluding remarks long term flow and water quality monitoring data suggest that the upstream to downstream decline in phytoplankton biomass parallels the lowered do and the elevated nh4 and po4 that takes place during late summer low flow conditions in the lower minnesota river the obvious longitudinal changes in phytoplankton biomass do and river nutrients primarily originate in the 22 mile navigation channel which has greater water depth and slower flow velocity the river discharge during late summer was inversely correlated with the magnitude of phytoplankton biomass decline and the obvious downstream changes in chl a do nh4 and po4 all occurred under river discharges that were lower than 102 m3 s 1 a low discharge combined with the deepened navigation channel morphology reduced the in channel mixing and turbulence resulting in greater settling rates of living and non living phytoplankton predominated by diatoms the ratio of do change versus the nh4 change is particularly close to the redfield o n ratio indicating that the obvious downstream changes in do and nutrient content most likely resulted from the decomposition of phytoplankton detritus under aerobic conditions the river water quality model and the field survey data on sediment oxygen demand together demonstrate that the substantial increase in sediment oxygen consumption and nutrient release produced by decomposing settled phytoplankton detritus could be the primary reason for the low do levels and the increased nutrient concentration downstream this study of the lower minnesota river water quality provides a new paradigm which suggests that slow moving hydrodynamics in a deep navigation channel under late summer low flow conditions can shift a finely balanced eutrophic river system to a degraded state with low do levels and high regenerated nutrient concentrations the high level of phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic rivers may impair river water quality when the massive die off or settling of phytoplankton occurs under summer low flow conditions since the phytoplankton in eutrophic rivers may come from in stream growth or from upstream lakes reservoirs and tributaries river water quality management first needs to identify the source of phytoplankton both phytoplankton blooms and collapses are most likely to take place under low flow conditions or in a deep channel with long residence time therefore regulating river discharge local channel geometry and hydrodynamics to prevent the abrupt phytoplankton blooms and collapses may be an alternative way to maintain acceptable water quality in eutrophic rivers acknowledgements the study was partially funded by the u s army corps of engineers ecosystem

18694,the carbonate radical co3 is a strong oxidative radical that is generated via the reactions of hco3 co3 2 with hydroxyl radical ho or triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom in sunlit surface water the bimolecular reaction rate constants of co3 with various dom isolates k co 3 d o m were calculated as 15 239 mg of c l 1 s 1 and were correlate to the bulk dom properties such as the content of phenolic moieties the specific uv absorbance suva the e2 e3 value and the fluorescence index fi the spectroscopic e2 e3 values was found to strongly correlated r2 0 93 with k co 3 d o m and an empirical equation was established our results also demonstrate that co3 is involved in the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter dom and in particular reacts with electron donor moieties leading to faster decay rates at long wavelengths of uv vis absorption furthermore a model was developed to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 during dom photobleaching these results allow us to estimate the reactivity of dom with co3 and to evaluate the role of co3 in sunlit surface water it will also allow a better assessment of the concentration and utilization of co3 during the application of advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbonate radical dissolved organic matters photobleaching 1 introduction carbonate radical co3 is a selective oxidant that is involved in a series of aquatic reactions in sunlit surface waters co3 can be generated via the reaction of hydroxyl radical ho with carbonate bicarbonate anions co3 2 hco3 and it can also be produced through the triplet states of photo sensitizer 3sens oxidation eqs 1 4 canonica et al 2005 chen and hoffman 1973 larson and zepp 1988 1 ho co 3 2 oh co 3 k 1 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 2 ho hco

et al 2015 and it shows broad optical absorption in the visible range with λ max at 600 nm ε 600nm 1850 m 1 cm 1 busset et al 2007 the reactions of co3 with organic contaminants have been recently investigated and their environmental significance has been recognized not only in environmental photochemistry but also in advanced oxidation processes aops for water treatment behar et al 1970 canonica et al 2005 huie et al 1991 zhang et al 2015 in comparison with well studied ho co3 is selective toward organic compounds the rate constants for the reactions involving the carbonate radical are in the range of 102 109 m 1 s 1 behar et al 1970 chen et al 1975 cope et al 1978 moore et al 1977 co3 was found to primarily react with electron rich compounds such as phenols amines and sulfur compounds via electron transfer mechanisms lilie et al 1978 stenman et al 2003 umschlag and herrmann 1999 the steady state concentrations of co3 in sunlit surface waters have been estimated to be approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the ho concentrations sulzberger et al 1997 which indicates that co3 may play an important role in dom involved aquatic photochemistry solar irradiation of dom solutions results in the loss of uv vis absorbance photobleaching which could involve two processes 1 the chromophores absorb light leading to direct photochemical destruction and 2 indirect photochemical processes via the generation of the triplet states of dom 3dom and numerous reactive oxygen species ros such as ho and singlet oxygen 1o2 burns et al 2012 sun et al 2015 vione et al 2006 these reactive intermediates ultimately lead to the destruction of the chromophores and hence the loss of chromophoric dom absorption previous studies implied that indirect photobleaching may play an important role in dom photobleaching del vecchio and blough 2002 loiselle et al 2012 in sunlit freshwater ho alone could account for no more than 20 of absorbance bleaching and the contributions of other reactive intermediates remain unclear brinkmann et al 2003 goldstone et al 2002 recently it was found that secondary radicals such as co3 and reactive halogen species rhs can be produced through the reactions of 3dom ho with inorganic anions those transient species are further consumed by natural scavengers such as dom larson and zepp 1988 mitch and coworkers found that the rhs generated by the scavenging of ho in oceanic environments have a profound effect on dom photo transformations on account of rhs targeting electron rich chromophores within dom grebel et al 2009 parker and mitch 2016 compared with rhs which have important effects in seawater co3 has broader impacts owing to the ubiquity of co3 2 hco3 in natural waters however little attention has been paid to the reaction between co3 and dom to the best of our knowledge only three studies have investigated the reaction rate constants of co3 with dom the first value for the reaction rate constant reported to be 40 mg of c l 1s 1 was determined by competition kinetics with aniline using the hydrophobic extracts from the suwannee river the second 280 mg of c l 1s 1 was obtained by flash photolysis of suwannee river fulvic acid srfa canonica et al 2005 larson and zepp 1988 the third calculated using a photolysis model used a sample collected from a pilot scale open water unit process wetland located in discovery bay ca jasper and sedlak 2013 nevertheless the effect of co3 on the photochemical transformations of dom is worth investigating in recent years there have been more published work describing the utilization of spectroscopic methods such as uv absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy to correlate the chemical composition with the reactivity of dom for example e2 e3 in combination with other absorbance values were used to predict the photochemical formation quantum yields of 1o2 bodhipaksha et al 2015 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva and fluorescence index fi were used to predict the reaction rates between ho and dom keen et al 2014 however there have been no studies investigating the relationship between the co3 reaction rate constants and the optical properties of the dom this study focused on the reaction between co3 and dom the bimolecular reaction rate constants of co3 with various dom isolates k co 3 d o m were measured and the relationship between the optical properties of the dom with k co 3 d o m was established meanwhile the impacts of co3 2 hco3 on dom photobleaching under environmentally relevant conditions were evaluated the reaction rate constants for 3dom quenching by co3 2 hco3 were estimated and the contributions of ho and 3dom to the generation of co3 were calculated under different ph

which the radicals can be generated under 254 nm irradiation chen et al 1973 this method was selected because it does not involve the formation of intermediate radicals such as hydroxyl radicals the ctc salt was prepared according to the literature lamb and damon 1937 and the details can be found in the text s3 of si the reaction rate constants of co3 with the doms were measured using a competitive method in brief co3 was generated by uv 254 nm irradiation of ctc 1 0 mm chen and hoffman 1973 chen et al 1975 a low concentration of phenol 31 9 μm was employed as a reference compound under our experimental conditions the direct photolysis of phenol was negligible comparing to co3 oxidation the reaction rate constant of phenol with carbonate radicals k c o 3 p h e n o l was reported to be 2 2 107 m 1 s 1 ph 7 chen and hoffman 1973 the working solutions were spiked with various concentrations of dom 0 3 mgc l 1 and the degradation rates of phenol were measured using hplc uv the pseudo first order decay rate constants of phenol decreased with increasing dom concentrations therefore the bimolecular reaction rate constants of co3 with dom k co 3 d o m can be described by

developed by canonica and laubscher canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2011 the determination of if can be obtained in text s6 of si in this study the values of ifphenol were measured at various concentration of 3 doms 2s101h 1r107f and s3 ppl and shown in fig s4 according to the result the inhibition effect of dom to phenol can be ignored when dom 5 mgc l 1 the competition for lamp irradiance between ctc and dom can be omitted since the absorbance of ctc 1 0 mm ε 254nm 8500 m 1 cm 1 was two orders of magnitude higher than the one from dom 3 0 mgc l 1 ε 254nm 0 034 mg of c l 1 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 measuring and predicting the reaction rate constants of co3 with dom due to the low reaction rates with inorganic ions carbonate radical in natural waters likely reacts mainly with dom larson and zepp 1988 considering that co3 is much more selective than ho its reactivity toward different types of dom is expected to vary over a wider range than that of ho 1 4 3 3 104 mg of c l 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 to understand the mechanisms of the reactions between dom and co3 the reaction rate constants of co3 with 17 different dom samples k co 3 d o m were measured using the competition method the measured values are listed in table s1 of the si and ranged from 15 to 239 mg of c l 1 s 1 the reaction rate measured for srha was 220 6 mg of c l 1 s 1 which is in a good agreement with the literature value 280 90 mg of c l 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 it further validates the methodology used in this study the dom samples obtained from effluent and effluent dominated natural waters present lower co3 reaction rate constants than those of natural organic matters noms this difference may be due to the low concentrations of phenolic moieties in the effluent organic matters efoms thus the correlation between the concentrations of phenolic moieties and the k co 3 d o m values for diverse dom samples was investigated as shown in fig 1 a for all the dom samples k co 3 d o m is linearly related to the concentration of phenolic moieties r2 0 93 considering that the phenolic contents of the dom samples are strongly correlated with the spectroscopic properties boyle et al 2009 dalrymple et al 2010 the k co 3 d o m values can be predicted using easily measured optical properties therefore the relationship between the k co 3 d o m values and those optical properties was evaluated the measured optical parameters of the various dom samples are provided in table s1 of the si according to these results dom samples from effluent dominated aquatic systems present higher e2 e3 ratios and fi values as well as lower suva254 values than nom samples arnold 2014 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017a in this study the k co 3 d o m values were first plotted versus e2 e3 and a strong negative correlation was observed the correlation was based on the linear regression of log k co 3 d o m values and e2 e3 r2 0 93 as demonstrated in fig s5 of the si fig 1b shows these data along with the regression line and the 95 confidence prediction interval as an empirical surrogate the e2 e3 value was established to provide an indicator of how rapidly the absorption decreases with increasing wavelengths recent studies have reported that the e2 e3 ratios have an inverse relationship with the content of electron donor moieties in aquatic dom samples and are strongly dependent on the phenolic contents sharpless et al 2014 the negative relationship between the k co 3 d o m and e2 e3 values indicates that co3 is prone to reacting with the electron donating components edcs in the dom the suva values for 17 dom samples versus their k co 3 d o m values were compared a clear positive correlation r2 0 84 exists between the suva and k co 3 d o m data fig 1c suva is a useful parameter for estimating the dissolved aromatic carbon content in aquatic systems weishaar et al 2003 this parameter has also been employed to estimate the bimolecular rate constants between hydroxyl radical and dom rosario ortiz et al 2008 compared with e2 e3 the relationship data for suva was more scattered indicating that the aromatic groups in the dom samples do not consist of only the edcs moreover besides the e2 e3 and suva values a weak correlation with r2 0 52 was found between k co 3 d o m and fi a proxy for microbially or terrestrially derived dom as illustrated in fig 1d these results suggest that while the fi values are good predictors of the general source of the dom they do not provide reliable information about the reactivity of the dom with co3 in summary the results of these experiments show that although phenolic moieties content allows for a more precise prediction of k co 3 d o m e2 e3 can easily measure in a sufficiently robust way the value of k co 3 d o m the fitting curve prepared from these 17 dom samples resulted in the following expression eq 8 for the prediction of k co 3 d o m by using e2 e3 values to the best of our knowledge this is the first detailed investigation to assess the reaction rate constants of co3 with dom 8 k co 3 d o m 1738 1 3 10 0 25 0 02 e 2 e 3 3 2 impact of bicarbonate anion on the photobleaching of dom in this study srnom cat 1r101n was selected as a model dom to investigate the impact of carbonate anion on the photobleaching of dom fig 2 a shows that the uv vis absorbance gradually decreased under simulated solar irradiation considering that the spectral dependence of the photobleaching process is important for understanding the dynamics of dom the photobleaching rates of dom at individual wavelengths were examined under various experimental conditions the photobleaching rates as measured by the absorption coefficients are first order decays with respect to the dom concentrations to simulate the environmental relevant concentrations of bicarbonate the dom photobleaching was also investigated in 2 0 mm hco3 solutions the photobleaching rates of dom increased with hco3 spiking the differential rates of loss in absorption are clearer when considering the photobleaching rates versus wavelength in the presence or absence of carbonates as shown in fig 2b with increasing absorption wavelengths the enhancement of the photobleaching rate due to hco3 is more significant a 12 0 4 0 faster photobleaching rate was observed at 400 nm when the dom solution was spiked with 2 mm hco3 this consequence is assigned to be the co3 specific effect vide infra to explore whether the observed enhancement in photobleaching was associated with ionic strength one set of samples was supplemented with perchlorate ion to make the ionic strength equal to that in the hco3 spiked solution fig 2b ionic strength did not show a statistically significant effect implying that the enhancement in photobleaching rates was a result of carbonate anion specific chemistry not the ionic strength herein we assumed that co3 formed via carbonate anion scavenging of ho and or 3dom enhanced the dom photobleaching rates and γ radiolysis experiments were conducted to further prove the assumption as a dark source of ho γ radiolysis experiments eliminated the influence of direct photolysis the dom degradation rate constants at 250 400 nm were examined with without 20 mm hco3 moreover the ho formation in the γ radiolysis experiment was carefully controlled such that it was equivalent the ho formation in the simulated solar irradiation experiments which allowed us to explore the role of ho and its derivative co3 in the photobleaching of dom the detailed conversion procedure is illustrated in text s7 of the si as shown in fig s6 of the si ho alone led to equal degradation rates all over the wavelengths in the presence of hco3 the dom bleaching rates caused by ho induced co3 are wavelength dependent with increasing absorption wavelength the enhancement of the degradation rate was observed it is evident that co3 can enhance the dom photobleaching rates at long wavelength furthermore the effects of various concentrations of hco3 0 10 mm on the photobleaching rate of dom were evaluated as illustrated in fig 3 a increasing concentrations had minor effects at short wavelengths 300 nm however at long wavelengths especially 350 nm the first order decay rates were considerably enhanced by increasing concentrations of hco3 that further prove the assumption in general the uv absorption of short wavelength 300 nm by dom originates from aromatic components korshin et al 1997 ma et al 2010 to explain the minor effects of hco3 on the photobleaching rates at short wavelengths we suggest two possibilities 1 co3 has low reaction rate constants with aromatic components or 2 the reaction products of co3 with aromatic components also show uv absorption in other words co3 didn t lead to loss of the aromaticity of dom regarding the long wavelength absorption tail of dom 350 nm many studies have adopted the charge transfer ct model to interpret this unique optical property it appears to arise through charge transfer interactions between hydroxyl aromatic electron donors and quinoid acceptors formed by the partial oxidation of lignin precursors boyle et al 2009 sharpless and blough 2014 these chromophores are believed to play an important role in dom photochemistry aeschbacher et al 2012 golanoski et al 2012 richard and canonica 2005 the accelerated photodegradation rate at long wavelengths indicates that co3 may disturb the continuum coupled states of electron donors and acceptors recently there has been an argument about the ct model mckay and co workers suggested ct complexes are not the main mechanism explaining the photophysical properties of dom blough and del vecchio 2018 mckay et al 2018a b therefore the superposition model can also be applied to explicate the visible absorption of the humic substance superposition model postulates that the absorption spectrum of dom results from a simple linear superposition of the absorption spectra of an ensemble of independent chromophores if the superposition model is engaged we could suggest that co3 reactive components absorb at longer wavelengths in addition the k measured at different ph values in 10 0 mm hco3 illustrate that the highest degradation rate was obtained at high ph and long wavelengths as shown in fig 3b because the fraction of co3 2 increased with increasing ph and led to high steady state concentrations of co3 to understand the specificity of carbonate ion chemistry the co3 reactive portion of the dom will be discussed in the following section 3 3 the photobleaching of the co3 reactive portion of carbonate rich waters based on the ct model the removal change of either the donor or acceptor moieties will eliminate the ct interactions and reduce the absorption at long wavelengths accordingly the bimolecular reaction rate constants of co3 with model compounds for the electron donor and electron acceptor moieties in dom were measured using the competition method and are summarized in table 1 seven monomeric models p coumaric acid ferulic acid syringic acid vanillic acid vanillin acetovanillone and syringaldehyde representing the lignin s phenolic end groups were chosen to stand for the electron donating moieties in the dom three quinone phenones were selected to stand in for the electron accepting moieties the second order reaction rate constants measured for the phenolic compounds ranged from 108 109 m 1 s 1 and the average value was 6 9 108 m 1 s 1 which was 2 4 orders of magnitude faster than that of the quinone phenones moieties average value 9 3 105 m 1 s 1 thus the co3 reactive portions of the dom could be assigned as the electron rich species especially the phenolic moieties the assignment can also be supported by the correlations of k co 3 d o m with phenolic and e2 e3 this result indicates that co3 can selectively react with electron donor groups in dom and interrupt the ct interactions enhancing the photobleaching rate at 360 400 nm again if the superposition model not ct model dominated the dom photochemistry the co3 reactive portions long wavelengths absorption chromophores can be proposed to be enriched in phenolic moieties 3 4 assessment of the contributions of ho and 3dom in co3 generation to evaluate the contribution of ho initiated co3 in dom enriched solutions ipa scavenging experiments were performed as illustrated in fig 4 a and b the experiments were conducted under two ph conditions ph 8 3 for hco3 and ph 11 6 for co3 2 the solutions were spiked with 2 0 mm ipa to minimize the concentrations of ho and ho initiated co3 but ipa has negligible effects on 3dom grebel et al 2012 parker and mitch 2016 therefore four photobleaching rate constants k d o m k d o m i p a k d o m h c o 3 c o 3 2 and k d o m i p a h c o 3 c o 3 2 under various experimental conditions were obtained as shown in fig 4 the value of k d o m i p a c o 3 2 is higher than the value of k d o m i p a indicating that 3dom initiated co3 has significant effects on the photobleaching rates of dom to compare these reaction rates we calculated the contribution ratios of ho and 3dom to the formation of co3 the detailed procedure for the calculation is discussed in text s8 of the si the ratio of the ho related co3 formation rate to the 3dom related co3 formation rate was found to be 71 29 in the 0 5 mm co3 2 solution ph 11 6 and 82 18 in the 10 mm hco3 solution ph 8 3 based on these ratios the bimolecular reaction rates between 3dom and hco3 co3 2 k 3 k 4 were estimated by using the following equations eq 9 and eq 10 9 r co 3 from ho r co 3 from d 3 om k 1 ho ss co 3 2 k 3 d 3 om ss co 3 2 ph 11 6 co 3 2 dominated 10 r co 3 from ho r co 3 from d 3 om k 2 ho ss hco 3 k 4 d 3 om ss hco 3 ph 8 3 hco 3 dominated where r c o 3 f r o m h o and r c o 3 f r o m d 3 o m are the formation rates of co3 from ho and 3dom respectively the calculation of the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and 3dom d 3 om ss is described in text s9 and fig s7 of the si based on these calculations the values of k 3 and k 4 can be estimated to be 2 1 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 and 9 6 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 respectively the k 3 value estimated in this study is similar with the previous studies which was tentatively set to 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to estimate a value for k 4 finally a model was developed to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 during dom photobleaching considering the contributions of both 3dom and ho as shown in eq 11 11 co 3 s s r h o r d 3 o m k d o m c o 3 d o m k 1 h o s s c o 3 2 k 2 h o s s h c o 3 k 3 d 3 o m s s c o 3 2 k 4 d 3 o m s s h c o 3 1738 e 0 25 e 2 e 3 d o m to compare the generation of co3 by ho and 3dom in dom photobleaching the model was used to predict the concentration of co3 ss generated in doc 5 0 mgc l 1 solution at various ph levels 6 0 10 0 and co3 2 tot 0 0 5 0 mm as shown in fig 5 a the total co3 ss increased with increasing ph and co3 2 tot values which is consistent with our experiment data shown in fig 3 notably the 3dom generated co3 ss fig 5c monotonically increases as a function of co3 2 tot and ph value however the ho generated co3 ss fig 5b increased slowly at high co3 2 tot and ph value additionally the co3 ss was also predicted as a function of ph and doc fig 5d the concentration of dic no3 and no2 was set as 1 0 mm 150 μmol l 1 and 1 5 μmol l 1 respectively no3 and no2 was reported to be the predominate source of ho at low doc values 5 mgc l 1 mostofa et al 2013 the model indicated that the co3 ss is inversely proportional to the concentrations of doc fig 5d thus co3 is more common in low doc waters where ho plays the main role in its generation overall we proposed that the contribution of 3dom to the generation of co3 was non negligible in high carbonate ph and doc environments 4 conclusion since co3 has low reaction rate constants with the main inorganic ions in natural water dom is thought to be the major co3 sink considering that co3 is more selective than ho the reaction rates of co3 with various dom samples k co 3 d o m were expected to vary only three k co 3 d o m values 40 280 and 370 mg of c l 1 s 1 have been reported in the literature and these values have been frequently referred to by other studies to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 co3 ss jasper and sedlak 2013 lian et al 2017 vione et al 2009 considering the variations in dom samples the use of previously reported k co 3 d o m values might result in imprecise estimates in this study k co 3 d o m values for various sources of dom were reported the measured k co 3 d o m values agree with the previous study which validates the current methodology a reliable relationship between e2 e3 and k co 3 d o m for aquatic dom samples was found this relationship indicates that the k co 3 d o m value can be predicted by using the e2 e3 value of the dom the prediction range of the equation shows that the k co 3 d o m values can lead to up to two orders of magnitude of variance photobleaching is an important transformation pathway for dom and it controls photic zone depths and impacts a variety of photochemical reactions we have demonstrated that the photobleaching rates of dom are slightly improved by the carbonate bicarbonate anions through the photochemical generation of co3 the enhancement of the photobleaching rates caused by hco3 co3 2 is more significant at longer absorption wavelengths and an increased photobleaching rate up to 12 0 4 0 was observed at 400 nm in a solution spiked with 2 0 mm hco3 this enhanced photobleaching can be explained by the fact that co3 selectively attacks the phenolic moieties in the dom disrupting the ct interactions or degrades phenolic compounds that absorb long wavelength radiation furthermore based on the estimation of the reaction rate constants between co3 and hco3 co3 2 a model was developed to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 during dom photobleaching acknowledgments we appreciate the partial funding

18694,the carbonate radical co3 is a strong oxidative radical that is generated via the reactions of hco3 co3 2 with hydroxyl radical ho or triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom in sunlit surface water the bimolecular reaction rate constants of co3 with various dom isolates k co 3 d o m were calculated as 15 239 mg of c l 1 s 1 and were correlate to the bulk dom properties such as the content of phenolic moieties the specific uv absorbance suva the e2 e3 value and the fluorescence index fi the spectroscopic e2 e3 values was found to strongly correlated r2 0 93 with k co 3 d o m and an empirical equation was established our results also demonstrate that co3 is involved in the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter dom and in particular reacts with electron donor moieties leading to faster decay rates at long wavelengths of uv vis absorption furthermore a model was developed to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 during dom photobleaching these results allow us to estimate the reactivity of dom with co3 and to evaluate the role of co3 in sunlit surface water it will also allow a better assessment of the concentration and utilization of co3 during the application of advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbonate radical dissolved organic matters photobleaching 1 introduction carbonate radical co3 is a selective

et al 2015 and it shows broad optical absorption in the visible range with λ max at 600 nm ε 600nm 1850 m 1 cm 1 busset et al 2007 the reactions of co3 with organic contaminants have been recently investigated and their environmental significance has been recognized not only in environmental photochemistry but also in advanced oxidation processes aops for water treatment behar et al 1970 canonica et al 2005 huie et al 1991 zhang et al 2015 in comparison with well studied ho co3 is selective toward organic compounds the rate constants for the reactions involving the carbonate radical are in the range of 102 109 m 1 s 1 behar et al 1970 chen et al 1975 cope et al 1978 moore et al 1977 co3 was found to primarily react with electron rich compounds such as phenols amines and sulfur compounds via electron transfer mechanisms lilie et al 1978 stenman et al 2003 umschlag and herrmann 1999 the steady state concentrations of co3 in sunlit surface waters have been estimated to be approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the ho concentrations sulzberger et al 1997 which indicates that co3 may play an important role in dom involved aquatic photochemistry solar irradiation of dom solutions results in the loss of uv vis absorbance photobleaching which could involve two processes 1 the chromophores absorb light leading to direct photochemical destruction and 2 indirect photochemical processes via the generation of the triplet states of dom 3dom and numerous reactive oxygen species ros such as ho and singlet oxygen 1o2 burns et al 2012 sun et al 2015 vione et al 2006 these reactive intermediates ultimately lead to the destruction of the chromophores and hence the loss of chromophoric dom absorption previous studies implied that indirect photobleaching may play an important role in dom photobleaching del vecchio and blough 2002 loiselle et al 2012 in sunlit freshwater ho alone could account for no more than 20 of absorbance bleaching and the contributions of other reactive intermediates remain unclear brinkmann et al 2003 goldstone et al 2002 recently it was found that secondary radicals such as co3 and reactive halogen species rhs can be produced through the reactions of 3dom ho with inorganic anions those transient species are further consumed by natural scavengers such as dom larson and zepp 1988 mitch and coworkers found that the rhs generated by the scavenging of ho in oceanic environments have a profound effect on dom photo transformations on account of rhs targeting electron rich chromophores within dom grebel et al 2009 parker and mitch 2016 compared with rhs which have important effects in seawater co3 has broader impacts owing to the ubiquity of co3 2 hco3 in natural waters however little attention has been paid to the reaction between co3 and dom to the best of our knowledge only three studies have investigated the reaction rate constants of co3 with dom the first value for the reaction rate constant reported to be 40 mg of c l 1s 1 was determined by competition kinetics with aniline using the hydrophobic extracts from the suwannee river the second 280 mg of c l 1s 1 was obtained by flash photolysis of suwannee river fulvic acid srfa canonica et al 2005 larson and zepp 1988 the third calculated using a photolysis model used a sample collected from a pilot scale open water unit process wetland located in discovery bay ca jasper and sedlak 2013 nevertheless the effect of co3 on the photochemical transformations of dom is worth investigating in recent years there have been more published work describing the utilization of spectroscopic methods such as uv absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy to correlate the chemical composition with the reactivity of dom for example e2 e3 in combination with other absorbance values were used to predict the photochemical formation quantum yields of 1o2 bodhipaksha et al 2015 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva and fluorescence index fi were used to predict the reaction rates between ho and dom keen et al 2014 however there have been no studies investigating the relationship between the co3 reaction rate constants and the optical properties of the dom this study focused on the reaction between co3 and dom the bimolecular reaction rate constants of co3 with various dom isolates k co 3 d o m were measured and the relationship between the optical properties of the dom with k co 3 d o m was established meanwhile the impacts of co3 2 hco3 on dom photobleaching under environmentally relevant

were measured at various concentration of 3 doms 2s101h 1r107f and s3 ppl and shown in fig s4 according to the result the inhibition effect of dom to phenol can be ignored when dom 5 mgc l 1 the competition for lamp irradiance between ctc and dom can be omitted since the absorbance of ctc 1 0 mm ε 254nm 8500 m 1 cm 1 was two orders of magnitude higher than the one from dom 3 0 mgc l 1 ε 254nm 0 034 mg of c l 1 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 measuring and predicting the reaction rate constants of co3 with dom due to the low reaction rates with inorganic ions carbonate radical in natural waters likely reacts mainly with dom larson and zepp 1988 considering that co3 is much more selective than ho its reactivity toward different types of dom is expected to vary over a wider range than that of ho 1 4 3 3 104 mg of c l 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 keen et al 2014 to understand the mechanisms of the reactions between dom and co3 the reaction rate constants of co3 with 17 different dom samples k co 3 d o m were measured using the competition method the measured values are listed in table s1 of the si and ranged from 15 to 239 mg of c l 1 s 1 the reaction rate measured for srha was 220 6 mg of c l 1 s 1 which is in a good agreement with the literature value 280 90 mg of c l 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 it further validates the methodology used in this study the dom samples obtained from effluent and effluent dominated natural waters present lower co3 reaction rate constants than those of natural organic matters noms this difference may be due to the low concentrations of phenolic moieties in the effluent organic matters efoms thus the correlation between the concentrations of phenolic moieties and the k co 3 d o m values for diverse dom samples was investigated as shown in fig 1 a for all the dom samples k co 3 d o m is linearly related to the concentration of phenolic moieties r2 0 93 considering that the phenolic contents of the dom samples are strongly correlated with the spectroscopic properties boyle et al 2009 dalrymple et al 2010 the k co 3 d o m values can be predicted using easily measured optical properties therefore the relationship between the k co 3 d o m values and those optical properties was evaluated the measured optical parameters of the various dom samples are provided in table s1 of the si according to these results dom samples from effluent dominated aquatic systems present higher e2 e3 ratios and fi values as well as lower suva254 values than nom samples arnold 2014 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017a in this study the k co 3 d o m values were first plotted versus e2 e3 and a strong negative correlation was observed the correlation was based on the linear regression of log k co 3 d o m values and e2 e3 r2 0 93 as demonstrated in fig s5 of the si fig 1b shows these data along with the regression line and the 95 confidence prediction interval as an empirical surrogate the e2 e3 value was established to provide an indicator of how rapidly the absorption decreases with increasing wavelengths recent studies have reported that the e2 e3 ratios have an inverse relationship with the content of electron donor moieties in aquatic dom samples and are strongly dependent on the phenolic contents sharpless et al 2014 the negative relationship between the k co 3 d o m and e2 e3 values indicates that co3 is prone to reacting with the electron donating components edcs in the dom the suva values for 17 dom samples versus their k co 3 d o m values were compared a clear positive correlation r2 0 84 exists between the suva and k co 3 d o m data fig 1c suva is a useful parameter for estimating the dissolved aromatic carbon content in aquatic systems weishaar et al 2003 this parameter has also been employed to estimate the bimolecular rate constants between hydroxyl radical and dom rosario ortiz et al 2008 compared with e2 e3 the relationship data for suva was more scattered indicating that the aromatic groups in the dom samples do not consist of only the edcs moreover besides the e2 e3 and suva values a weak correlation with r2 0 52 was found between k co 3 d o m and fi a proxy for microbially or terrestrially derived dom as illustrated in fig 1d these results suggest that while the fi values are good predictors of the general source of the dom they do not provide reliable information about the reactivity of the dom with co3 in summary the results of these experiments show that although phenolic moieties content allows for a more precise prediction of k co 3 d o m e2 e3 can easily measure in a sufficiently robust way the value of k co 3 d o m the fitting curve prepared from these 17 dom samples resulted in the following expression eq 8 for the prediction of k co 3 d o m by using e2 e3 values to the best of our knowledge this is the first detailed investigation to assess the reaction rate constants of co3 with dom 8 k co 3 d o m 1738 1 3 10 0 25 0 02 e 2 e 3 3 2 impact of bicarbonate anion on the photobleaching of dom in this study srnom cat 1r101n was selected as a model dom to investigate the impact of carbonate anion on the photobleaching of dom fig 2 a shows that the uv vis absorbance gradually decreased under simulated solar irradiation considering that the spectral dependence of the photobleaching process is important for understanding the dynamics of dom the photobleaching rates of dom at individual wavelengths were examined under various experimental conditions the photobleaching rates as measured by the absorption coefficients are first order decays with respect to the dom concentrations to simulate the environmental relevant concentrations of bicarbonate the dom photobleaching was also investigated in 2 0 mm hco3 solutions the photobleaching rates of dom increased with hco3 spiking the differential rates of loss in absorption are clearer when considering the photobleaching rates versus wavelength in the presence or absence of carbonates as shown in fig 2b with increasing absorption wavelengths the enhancement of the photobleaching rate due to hco3 is more significant a 12 0 4 0 faster photobleaching rate was observed at 400 nm when the dom solution was spiked with 2 mm hco3 this consequence is assigned to be the co3 specific effect vide infra to explore whether the observed enhancement in photobleaching was associated with ionic strength one set of samples was supplemented with perchlorate ion to make the ionic strength equal to that in the hco3 spiked solution fig 2b ionic strength did not show a statistically significant effect implying that the enhancement in photobleaching rates was a result of carbonate anion specific chemistry not the ionic strength herein we assumed that co3 formed via carbonate anion scavenging of ho and or 3dom enhanced the dom photobleaching rates and γ radiolysis experiments were conducted to further prove the assumption as a dark source of ho γ radiolysis experiments eliminated the influence of direct photolysis the dom degradation rate constants at 250 400 nm were examined with without 20 mm hco3 moreover the ho formation in the γ radiolysis experiment was carefully controlled such that it was equivalent the ho formation in the simulated solar irradiation experiments which allowed us to explore the role of ho and its derivative co3 in the photobleaching of dom the detailed conversion procedure is illustrated in text s7 of the si as shown in fig s6 of the si ho alone led to equal degradation rates all over the wavelengths in the presence of hco3 the dom bleaching rates caused by ho induced co3 are wavelength dependent with increasing absorption wavelength the enhancement of the degradation rate was observed it is evident that co3 can enhance the dom photobleaching rates at long wavelength furthermore the effects of various concentrations of hco3 0 10 mm on the photobleaching rate of dom were evaluated as illustrated in fig 3 a increasing concentrations had minor effects at short wavelengths 300 nm however at long wavelengths especially 350 nm the first order decay rates were considerably enhanced by increasing concentrations of hco3 that further prove the assumption in general the uv absorption of short wavelength 300 nm by dom originates from aromatic components korshin et al 1997 ma et al 2010 to explain the minor effects of hco3 on the photobleaching rates at short wavelengths we suggest two possibilities 1 co3 has low reaction rate constants with aromatic components or 2 the reaction products of co3 with aromatic components also show uv absorption in other words co3 didn t lead to loss of the aromaticity of dom regarding the long wavelength absorption tail of dom 350 nm many studies have adopted the charge transfer ct model to interpret this unique optical property it appears to arise through charge transfer interactions between hydroxyl aromatic electron donors and quinoid acceptors formed by the partial oxidation of lignin precursors boyle et al 2009 sharpless and blough 2014 these chromophores are believed to play an important role in dom photochemistry aeschbacher et al 2012 golanoski et al 2012 richard and canonica 2005 the accelerated photodegradation rate at long wavelengths indicates that co3 may disturb the continuum coupled states of electron donors and acceptors recently there has been an argument about the ct model mckay and co workers suggested ct complexes are not the main mechanism explaining the photophysical properties of dom blough and del vecchio 2018 mckay et al 2018a b therefore the superposition model can also be applied to explicate the visible absorption of the humic substance superposition model postulates that the absorption spectrum of dom results from a simple linear superposition of the absorption spectra of an ensemble of independent chromophores if the superposition model is engaged we could suggest that co3 reactive components absorb at longer wavelengths in addition the k measured at different ph values in 10 0 mm hco3 illustrate that the highest degradation rate was obtained at high ph and long wavelengths as shown in fig 3b because the fraction of co3 2 increased with increasing ph and led to high steady state concentrations of co3 to understand the specificity of carbonate ion chemistry the co3 reactive portion of the dom will be discussed in the following section 3 3 the photobleaching of the co3 reactive portion of carbonate rich waters based on the ct model the removal change of either the donor or acceptor moieties will eliminate the ct interactions and reduce the absorption at long wavelengths accordingly the bimolecular reaction rate constants of co3 with model compounds for the electron donor and electron acceptor moieties in dom were measured using the competition method and are summarized in table 1 seven monomeric models p coumaric acid ferulic acid syringic acid vanillic acid vanillin acetovanillone and syringaldehyde representing the lignin s phenolic end groups were chosen to stand for the electron donating moieties in the dom three quinone phenones were selected to stand in for the electron accepting moieties the second order reaction rate constants measured for the phenolic compounds ranged from 108 109 m 1 s 1 and the average value was 6 9 108 m 1 s 1 which was 2 4 orders of magnitude faster than that of the quinone phenones moieties average value 9 3 105 m 1 s 1 thus the co3 reactive portions of the dom could be assigned as the electron rich species especially the phenolic moieties the assignment can also be supported by the correlations of k co 3 d o m with phenolic and e2 e3 this result indicates that co3 can selectively react with electron donor groups in dom and interrupt the ct interactions enhancing the photobleaching rate at 360 400 nm again if the superposition model not ct model dominated the dom photochemistry the co3 reactive portions long wavelengths absorption chromophores can be proposed to be enriched in phenolic moieties 3 4 assessment of the contributions of ho and 3dom in co3 generation to evaluate the contribution of ho initiated co3 in dom enriched solutions ipa scavenging experiments were performed as illustrated in fig 4 a and b the experiments were conducted under two ph conditions ph 8 3 for hco3 and ph 11 6 for co3 2 the solutions were spiked with 2 0 mm ipa to minimize the concentrations of ho and ho initiated co3 but ipa has negligible effects on 3dom grebel et al 2012 parker and mitch 2016 therefore four photobleaching rate constants k d o m k d o m i p a k d o m h c o 3 c o 3 2 and k d o m i p a h c o 3 c o 3 2 under various experimental conditions were obtained as shown in fig 4 the value of k d o m i p a c o 3 2 is higher than the value of k d o m i p a indicating that 3dom initiated co3 has significant effects on the photobleaching rates of dom to compare these reaction rates we calculated the contribution ratios of ho and 3dom to the formation of co3 the detailed procedure for the calculation is discussed in text s8 of the si the ratio of the ho related co3 formation rate to the 3dom related co3 formation rate was found to be 71 29 in the 0 5 mm co3 2 solution ph 11 6 and 82 18 in the 10 mm hco3 solution ph 8 3 based on these ratios the bimolecular reaction rates between 3dom and hco3 co3 2 k 3 k 4 were estimated by using the following equations eq 9 and eq 10 9 r co 3 from ho r co 3 from d 3 om k 1 ho ss co 3 2 k 3 d 3 om ss co 3 2 ph 11 6 co 3 2 dominated 10 r co 3 from ho r co 3 from d 3 om k 2 ho ss hco 3 k 4 d 3 om ss hco 3 ph 8 3 hco 3 dominated where r c o 3 f r o m h o and r c o 3 f r o m d 3 o m are the formation rates of co3 from ho and 3dom respectively the calculation of the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and 3dom d 3 om ss is described in text s9 and fig s7 of the si based on these calculations the values of k 3 and k 4 can be estimated to be 2 1 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 and 9 6 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 respectively the k 3 value estimated in this study is similar with the previous studies which was tentatively set to 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to estimate a value for k 4 finally a model was developed to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 during dom photobleaching considering the contributions of both 3dom and ho as shown in eq 11 11 co 3 s s r h o r d 3 o m k d o m c o 3 d o m k 1 h o s s c o 3 2 k 2 h o s s h c o 3 k 3 d 3 o m s s c o 3 2 k 4 d 3 o m s s h c o 3 1738 e 0 25 e 2 e 3 d o m to compare the generation of co3 by ho and 3dom in dom photobleaching the model was used to predict the concentration of co3 ss generated in doc 5 0 mgc l 1 solution at various ph levels 6 0 10 0 and co3 2 tot 0 0 5 0 mm as shown in fig 5 a the total co3 ss increased with increasing ph and co3 2 tot values which is consistent with our experiment data shown in fig 3 notably the 3dom generated co3 ss fig 5c monotonically increases as a function of co3 2 tot and ph value however the ho generated co3 ss fig 5b increased slowly at high co3 2 tot and ph value additionally the co3 ss was also predicted as a function of ph and doc fig 5d the concentration of dic no3 and no2 was set as 1 0 mm 150 μmol l 1 and 1 5 μmol l 1 respectively no3 and no2 was reported to be the predominate source of ho at low doc values 5 mgc l 1 mostofa et al 2013 the model indicated that the co3 ss is inversely proportional to the concentrations of doc fig 5d thus co3 is more common in low doc waters where ho plays the main role in its generation overall we proposed that the contribution of 3dom to the generation of co3 was non negligible in high carbonate ph and doc environments 4 conclusion since co3 has low reaction rate constants with the main inorganic ions in natural water dom is thought to be the major co3 sink considering that co3 is more selective than ho the reaction rates of co3 with various dom samples k co 3 d o m were expected to vary only three k co 3 d o m values 40 280 and 370 mg of c l 1 s 1 have been reported in the literature and these values have been frequently referred to by other studies to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 co3 ss jasper and sedlak 2013 lian et al 2017 vione et al 2009 considering the variations in dom samples the use of previously reported k co 3 d o m values might result in imprecise estimates in this study k co 3 d o m values for various sources of dom were reported the measured k co 3 d o m values agree with the previous study which validates the current methodology a reliable relationship between e2 e3 and k co 3 d o m for aquatic dom samples was found this relationship indicates that the k co 3 d o m value can be predicted by using the e2 e3 value of the dom the prediction range of the equation shows that the k co 3 d o m values can lead to up to two orders of magnitude of variance photobleaching is an important transformation pathway for dom and it controls photic zone depths and impacts a variety of photochemical reactions we have demonstrated that the photobleaching rates of dom are slightly improved by the carbonate bicarbonate anions through the photochemical generation of co3 the enhancement of the photobleaching rates caused by hco3 co3 2 is more significant at longer absorption wavelengths and an increased photobleaching rate up to 12 0 4 0 was observed at 400 nm in a solution spiked with 2 0 mm hco3 this enhanced photobleaching can be explained by the fact that co3 selectively attacks the phenolic moieties in the dom disrupting the ct interactions or degrades phenolic compounds that absorb long wavelength radiation furthermore based on the estimation of the reaction rate constants between co3 and hco3 co3 2 a model was developed to calculate the steady state concentrations of co3 during dom photobleaching acknowledgments we appreciate the partial funding
