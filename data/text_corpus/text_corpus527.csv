2635,mass transfer in non isothermal fractured porous media have a wide application in many natural phenomena and engineering processes the current study focuses on developing alternative formulations of steady state analytical modelling for thermally induced solute diffusion in fractured porous media the proposed analytical frameworks are validated by two set of experimental data the varied examples of coupled heat transfer and solute diffusion are evaluated by the proposed solution to discuss the effects of thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on the overall transport of solute in a fractured porous media it is found that thermal diffusion process or explicitly as a soret effect st is a non negligible part for investigating solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media for example increasing st from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 leads to a reduction of solute concentration by a factor of 1 2 we demonstrate that a larger peclet number ensures the temperature of the solute along the fracture decreasing while its concentration along the fracture increasing however an increase of the temperature difference between the entry and the output shows an opposite trend an increase in fracture aperture or matrix thickness leads to temperature decreasing and concentration increasing along the fracture and matrix as a larger amount of solute are injected from the inlet boundary the presented analytical solutions may also serve as a benchmark test tool for alternative numerical studies of coupled heat transfer and solute diffusion in fractured porous media keywords analytical model fractured porous media thermal diffusion solute transport coupled problem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction studies of coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena in fractured porous media have a wide application in the solution of various natural and artificial problems including the description of underground natural oil recovery geothermal extraction long term storage of high level nuclear waste soil physics and environmental remediation wu and pruess 2000 yan et al 2020a 2020b mass and heat transfer in fractured porous media systems has two distinct components fluid filled fractures and ambient solid matrix with low permeability and porosity martinez et al 2014 phenomenologically the fracture provides a preferential path for heat and mass transfer while the lower permeable porous matrix can store heat energy and allows solute to diffuse into it bai et al 1996 zhao et al 2014 understanding of heat and mass transfer in fractured porous media system has been progressed in recent decades via extensive experimental and numerical studies frippiat and holeyman 2008 wu et al 2010 roubinet et al 2012 ma 2015 yang et al 2021 despite these advances modelling of coupled heat and mass transfer in fractured porous media remains conceptually and mathematically challenging due to the difficulty of defining and measuring model parameters and uncertainties associated with fracture matrix systems berre et al 2019 it has been shown that mass transfer in fluid porous media can be further enhanced in a non isothermal field due to the temperature gradient which is known as thermal diffusion or soret effect or soret ludwig effect ludwig 1856 soret 1880 the thermal diffusion which provides theoretical descriptions of coupling between fluxes mass and heat and forces temperature and concentration gradients based on thermodynamics of irreversible processes yan et al 2020a exhibits a measurable influence on the non isothermal transport of fluid and diffusion of mass the soret effect is evident from extensive analytical and experimental research e g longhurst 1985 costesèque et al 2002 considering the soret effect may contribute to the reduction of breakthrough time of solute by a factor of 1 5 yan et al 2021 consequently it is necessary to highlight the significance of introducing and coupling heat transfer in modelling mass solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media however studies on influences of heat transfer on the transport of solute in fractured porous media are very limited natarajan and kumar 2012 lawrence et al 2021 heat and mass transfer in discretely fractured media have been extensively studied by experimental analytical and numerical methods bai et al 2017 ma 2015 yang et al 2021 experimental studies mainly focus on quantifying effects of fracture and its flow parameters and thermal properties including the roughness and aperture of fractures flow velocity heat conduction coefficient heat exchange and solute mass transfer at the fracture and matrix interface zhao 1994 bai et al 2016 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 luo et al 2017 luo et al 2018 huang et al 2019 qian et al 2011 tzelepis et al 2015 while laboratory or field experiments are expensive and time consuming many numerical models were developed for accurate prediction of heat and mass transfer in matrix fracture to help understand energy and mass exchange mechanisms within fracture matrix and matrix fracture interface briggs et al 2014 suzuki et al 2016 li et al 2020 chen and zhao 2020 he et al 2021 lawrence et al 2021 these results provided fundamental methodologies and important insights on understanding transport phenomena in fractured porous media zhao et al 2011 ma 2015 analytical solutions support physical explanation of these transport phenomena and act as an invaluable component in field scale screening and management decision support models martinez et al 2014 feng et al 2022 even if they rely on some simplifying assumptions that might not be valid in a specific application these analytical solutions are widely adopted as a basic benchmark test tool for other specific mass transport and heat transfer problems in fractured porous media liu et al 2011 zou et al 2016 xie et al 2022 pioneering works by tang et al 1981 developed an analytical model for mass transport in a single fractured porous media this analytical model was extended by considering effects of reactive transport transverse dispersion fracture networks roubinet et al 2012 zou et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 haddad et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 zhou and zhan 2018 xie et al 2022 additionally analytical models are developed and applied to investigate heat transfer in a single fracture coupled with thermal energy transfer in the ambient rock matrix zhao 2014 martinez et al 2014 bai et ai 2017 abbasi et al 2017 abbasi et al 2019 he et al 2021 zhou and wang 2022 however the aforementioned studies mainly focused on investigating either single solute transport or heat transfer in the system and the coupling of these two processes in fractured porous media was ignored the effect of coupled heat transfer on solute transport may be of interest where mass solute transport can be enhanced in a non isothermal fractured porous system this paper aims to develop the understanding of the direct effect of thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on the overall transport of solute in a fractured porous media an analytical model of coupled heat transfer and solute diffusion in fractured porous media is developed in this study section 2 provides a mathematical formulation of the problem section 3 contains its general solution for heat transfer and thermally induced solute transport these solutions are validated by two set of experimental data in section 4 physical and practical implications of the model are demonstrated in section 5 major conclusions from the study are summarized in section 6 2 non isothermal transport of solute in fractured porous media the conceptual model of non isothermal solute transport in fractured porous media is shown in fig 1 a fracture with aperture 2b and length l is embedded in a homogenous porous matrix the thickness of the matrix 2h is defined as the spacing between two adjacent parallel fractures see fig 1 solution is injected from the left side of fracture the fracture walls are smooth and parallel to each other the following assumptions are made relating the geometric and hydraulic properties of the fractured system tang et al 1981 martinez et al 2014 i the solute is incompressible with constant density and its flow is steady state ii heat and mass transport in a fracture is much faster than transport within the matrix which is mainly composed of tight porous media with relatively lower permeability when solution flows within the fractures thermal solute advection in the matrix barely happens heat transfer within the matrix is mainly governed by thermal conduction solute transport within the matrix is mainly governed by molecular diffusion thermal diffusion and decay iii since there is no sharp change of temperature in the fractured system the thermal and physical properties of the fluid and solid components are independent on temperature stopa and wojnarowski 2006 zhou and wang 2022 iv fracture aperture is assumed to be sufficiently small so that complete mixing in the fracture is considered trinchero and iraola 2020 v the analytical solutions are developed under the restrictive assumptions of steady state conditions rabideau and khandelwal 1998 rowe et al 2004 shackelford 1990 the time required to achieve steady state conditions which are largely affected by the fracture properties solute characteristics and transport parameters it might be as short as a few years tang et al 1981 or might possibly be as long as hundred or thousand of years trinchero and iraola 2020 however the steady state solution allows for investigating and explaining the mechanisms involved and their roles in mass transport in non isothermal fractures in addition it can serve as an effective estimation of the risk related to the breakthrough of solute in the system dominijanni and manassero 2019 foose 2010 2 1 heat transfer in fractured porous media the general differential governing equation for heat transfer in the fracture can be obtained by considering energy balance in a control volume the steady state heat transport in the fracture including conduction advection and convection from the fracture wall can be expressed as zhao 2014 heinze et al 2017 1 k w c w ρ w 2 t f x x 2 v l t f x x q t b 0 where k w c w ρ w are the thermal conductivity specific heat capacity and density of the liquid respectively v l is the mean steady flow velocity of the liquid in the fracture b is the half aperture of the fracture t f is the temperature in fracture q t is heat flux perpendicular to the fracture axis and it can be given by 2 q t k r c w ρ w t m x z z z b where t m is the temperature in matrix and k r is the matrix thermal conductivity the mean steady flow velocity in the fracture can be estimated by using darcy s law 3 v l k l η p x x where η and k l are the dynamic viscosity and permeability p is the hydraulic pressure the relation between a single fracture size and its permeability can be given by witherspoon et al 1980 4 k l b 2 12 assuming that the heat conduction in matrix is perpendicular to the fracture plane the steady state heat conduction in the matrix is governed by tavakkoli osgouei 2020 5 2 t m x z z 2 0 2 2 thermally induced solute transport in fractured porous media the governing equation for coupled solute transport and heat transfer in the fracture can be obtained by the conservation of mass in the fracture yan et al 2021 xie et al 2022 6 d f 2 c f x x 2 v l c f x x d t f x t f x x q c b λ f c f x 0 where d f is the diffusion coefficient of solute in the fracture d t f is the thermal diffusion coefficient of solute in the fracture λ f is the decay rate q c is diffusion flux of solute perpendicular to the fracture axis and it can be given by 7 q c d m c m x z z z b it should be noted that thermal osmosis which describes the influence of temperature gradient on fluid flow is not considered in the current study eq 6 since it is reported that thermal osmosis effects are typically trivial in traditional geotechnical engineering due to lower temperature gradients and higher permeabilities e g kl 10 10 m s yang et al 2014 zagorščak et al 2016 zhai and atefi monfared 2020 the general governing equation for solute transport in the non isothermal matrix can be given by e g sedighi et al 2018 yan et al 2020a 8 d m 2 c m x z z 2 d t m z t m x z z λ m c m x z 0 where d m is the diffusion coefficient of solute in porous matrix and d t m is the thermal diffusion coefficient of solute in the porous matrix three transport mechanisms are involved including solute diffusion thermal diffusion and decay processes the total solute flux comprises the diffusive flux due to the solute concentration potential and thermal diffusion flux due to temperature gradient or soret effect molecular diffusion first term in eq 8 is based on fick s law of diffusion thermal diffusion second term is induced by soret effect the soret coefficients for the fracture and matrix can be defined as follows ludwig 1856 soret 1880 chan et al 2003 s t i d t i d i i m or f 9 it should be noted that positive values of s t i and d t i represent that solute transport from the warmer regions to the cooler regions under non isothermal conditions chan et al 2003 2 3 boundary conditions the solute concentration and temperature at inflow boundary left hand side see fig 1 is assumed to be a constant the boundary conditions bcs for solute transport and heat transfer along the fracture are given by zhao 2014 xie et al 2022 10 t f 0 t in 11 c f 0 c 0 12 t f l t 0 13 c f l 0 the boundary conditions for solute and heat transport at the interface of the fracture and the matrix are given by 14 t m x b t f x 15 c m x b c f x two types of boundary conditions for the matrix are assumed 1 the dirichlet boundary conditions are 16 t m x h t 0 17 c m x h 0 2 the neumann boundary conditions are 18 t m x z z z h 0 19 c m x z z z h 0 neumann boundary condition eqs 18 and 19 could simulate e g an impermeable boundary or advective discharge in more conductive quaternary sediments trinchero et al 2019 it is widely adopted for parallel fractures system which allows symmetry to be considered trinchero and iraola 2020 dirichlet boundary condition eqs 16 and 17 implies that the solute can be removed instantaneously at the boundary it is worthwhile noting that for mathematical convenience most of the available analytical solutions for heat transfer and mass transport in fractured porous media assume a semi infinite domain trinchero et al 2019 in addition dirichlet boundary condition can be reduced to a semi infinite boundary condition when h is assumed to be infinite 3 analytical solutions the analytical solution for heat transfer and solute transport in fractured porous media under dirichlet bc is first given in section 3 1 the analytical solution is then extended for neumann bc which is given in section 3 2 3 1 particular solution for dirichlet boundary

transfer in fractured porous media the experimental observations reported by zhao and tso 1993 are adopted here to validate the proposed analytical solution for heat transfer in the fractured porous media a schematic diagram of the experimental test is shown in fig 2 the data reproduced and replotted from the literature is obtained by using the function of digitizer in origin pro 2016 although there may have been slight deviations as the results of digitalization the tested rock sample had a size of 102 mm length and 51 mm diameter the coefficient of surface roughness of the fracture presented in fig 2a is 9 according to the division standard of barton and choubey 1977 zhao 1987 the real fracture fig 2a is simplified in this study by assuming a parallel fracture with a thickness of 2b in the rock sample see fig 2b the low temperature solute tin was injected at left side and collected from the right side the solute temperatures at inlet and outlet were measured when the system reached a steady state the following thermal parameters were used for the prediction k r 3 5 w m 1 k 1 ρ w 1000 k g m 3 and c w 4200 j k g 1 k 1 the fracture aperture liquid flowrate and injected liquid temperatures are provided in table 1 it should be noted that temperature distributions along the fracture and in the matrix were not recorded in the experiment therefore the measured outlet temperatures were adopted to validate the current analytical solution the measured temperatures and predicted results from eq 22 are compared in table 1 the relative difference between the measurement data and predicted results are used to quantify the accuracy of the proposed solution the relative difference is defined as follows 47 ε δ t ana δ t exp δ t exp 100 48 δ t ana t in ana t out ana 49 δ t exp t in exp t out exp where t in exp and t out exp are the measured temperature at inlet and outlet boundaries respectively t in ana and t out ana are the inlet and outlet boundary temperature predicted by the model both dirichlet eq 16 and neuman eq 18 outlet boundary conditions are applied to analyze the experimental data reported by zhao and tso 1993 the predicted results obtained for both dirichlet eq 22 and neuman eq 39 boundary conditions are provided in table 1 it can be seen that the average difference between the measured data and predicted results was within 10 the average difference predicted by dirichlet boundary conditions eq 22 is lower than that of neuman boundary conditions eq 39 the explanation of the phenomena is that compared with neuman boundary conditions the use of dirichlet boundary conditions can reduce the matrix diffusion because of lower thermal gradients kennedy and lennox 1995 it is can be seen that the use of dirichlet boundary conditions can capture the effects of liquid injection velocity on heat transfer i e that the increase of liquid velocity can slightly reduce the outlet temperature nevertheless with decreasing of liquid velocity the effect of matrix boundary conditions decreases for example the predicted outlet temperatures by dirichlet and neuman boundary conditions are both 363 k when v l 30 mm s 4 2 thermally induced solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media experimental investigations of solute transport in the non isothermal fractured core plugs were carried out by tavakkoli osgouei 2020 rhodamine b rhbs with molecular weight of 479 02 g mol was used as a conventional and non reactive tracer with constant injection concentration c0 the injection flow rate was 1 ml min the temperatures of the rock sample were maintained at 303 k and 343 k at the injection side and outer surface respectively tavakkoli osgouei and akin 2021 a schematic diagram of the experimental test is analogous to one shown in fig 1 the effective diffusion coefficients in the fracture and matrix are assumed to 1 16 10 5 m2 s and 4 91 10 9 m2 s respectively which are calibrated effective diffusion coefficients reported by tavakkoli osgouei 2020 at t 343 k it should be noted that effects of temperature variations on the effective diffusion coefficient are not considered in the current analytical solutions although it is reported that the diffusion coefficient is temperature dependent yan et al 2020a the comparison between experimental data and model predictions for temperatures at outlet under various liquid injection rate is provided in table 3 generally the outer temperatures decrease with a rise of flow rate in all core plugs verifications of temperature profiles along the fracture at t0 343 k for core plug 3 are shown in fig 3 the temperature of cold solute increases along the fracture from the fluid inlet to the fracture outlet a comparison of experimental measurements of rhbs concentration and predicted results in steady state conditions for different core plugs is shown in table 4 it is noted that rhbs concentration profile along the fracture and in the matrix were not recorded in the experiment consequently the measured outlet solute concentrations are used to validate the proposed model it can be seen that the core plug 3 has the highest relative outer concentration e g c c0 0 75 as it has the lowest matrix permeability and matrix porosity see table 2 a case of the solute transport model without considering the temperature effect is added in table 4 to highlight the significance of coupling heat transfer the relative outlet concentration for the case without coupling heat transfer is achieved by setting the domain with an isothermal temperature e g t 343 k it is found that the difference between the measured data and predicted results is increased for the case without coupling heat transfer process for example the difference of the relative outlet concentration for plug 1 is 2 3 and 12 8 for the case with considering the temperature effect and without considering the temperature effect respectively 4 3 comparison with numerical model the proposed analytical solution is compared with the results of finite element simulation of the same problem performed by comsol multiphysics in order to justify the basic assumptions including constant density fluid assumption i and no advection in the matrix assumption ii the permeability of the matrix and density driven flow in the matrix coupling with heat transport is included in the comsol model three physical modules are used to simulate the steady transport of solute in non isothermal fractured porous media in comsol the darcy s law and heat transfer modules were applied for studying fluid and heat transport in fractures and matrix respectively coefficient form of pde module was used to investigate solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media in this implementation the primary dependent variables are solute concentration c temperature t and fluid velocity v the updated variables or parameters such as the temperature dependent density and viscosity are fed into the external material interface using the formulas for the material parameters in comsol the details of the governing equations are given in appendix a unless otherwise indicated the parameters in table 2 are used as the reference conditions to calculate solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media in order to study effects of seepage in the matrix density driven flow in the matrix coupling with heat transport temperature dependent density and viscosity on solute transport in fractured porous media the following additional parameters were used in comsol simulations the matrix porosity n 0 19 tavakkoli osgouei 2020 the longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 1 m and the transverse dispersivity α t 0 03 m west et al 2004 three values of the matrix permeability km including 0 1 md 1 md and 10 md are selected to represent the low medium and high matrix permeability respectively hosseini et al 2020 the finer grid close to the fracture matrix interface z h 0 where the solute diffuses from the fracture into the matrix and the changes in solute concentration are significant the temperature difference δt between the entry and the output plays a key role in controlling heat transfer and solute transport in the fracture matrix system luo et al 2017 in this verification the temperature difference is achieved via altering the temperature of injected fluid with a fixed outer temperature at 343 k in order to evaluate the influence of temperature differences and matrix seepage on the solute transport the following five simulation cases scenarios have been designed which include case 1 solute transport under isothermal conditions 343 k case 2 the temperature of the fluid was maintained at 381 1 k in which solute transport from the warmer region to the cooler region case 3 the temperature of the fluid was maintained at 304 9 k in which solute transport from the cooler region to the warmer region case 4 with km 0 1 md and case 5 with km 10 md are designed to study the effect of matrix seepage on solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media figs 4 7 show the temperature and concentration profiles of solute under neumann bc and dirichlet bc it can be seen that the presented analytical solution agrees with the results obtained by the numerical model generally the concentration profile is largely affected by the temperature of the injected fluid it can be seen that the negative temperature difference δ t 0 can lead to a reduction of solute concentration while the positive temperature difference δ t 0 may result in an increase of solute concentration in the fracture for example the relative solute concentration at x l 0 5 for δ t 0 δ t 38 1 k and δ t 38 1 k is 0 49 0 4 and 0 59 under neumann bc respectively the explanation for the phenomena is that there is driving force for mass transport within the system from a point of higher concentration to that of a lower concentration bird 2002 this indicates that variations of temperature can have significant impact on the transport of solute in the non isothermal fractured porous media it is noted that some deviations can be observed between the numerical solution and analytical solution in fig 7c the discrepancy may be attributed to the mesh issue close to the fracture matrix interface although the mesh quality is high near the interface e g extra fine element size is selected in comsol the inflection points observed in fig 7c and fig 7d can be attributed to thermal diffusion processes for example it can be found in fig 6a that there is a fast decrease of the temperature along the fracture for the case with δt 38 1 k when x l 0 1 solute transport is largely enhanced in this range by thermal diffusion process as a result inflections points of solute concentration distribution are observed in fig 7c in addition it can be found that effects of matrix seepage and density driven flow on heat transfer and solute transport are negligible under the simulated conditions of this study these results justify the basic assumptions of constant density fluid and no advection in the matrix for the analytical model 5 applications and discussions this section presents a detailed investigation of the effects of some key variables including thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on solute in non isothermal fractured porous media the length of the calculated domain l is 71 3 mm the fracture half aperture b and matrix thickness h is set to be 0 18 mm and 18 6 mm respectively tavakkoli osgouei and akin 2021 unless otherwise indicated the parameters in table 2 are used as the reference conditions to calculate solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media tavakkoli osgouei 2020 5 1 effects of peclet number peclet number is a dimensionless number corresponding to the ratio of advection and diffusion dispersion which is defined as yan et al 2020b 50 pe v l l d f pe is generally used to assess the dominant mechanism of mass transfer induced by advection or dispersion diffusion a large peclet number e g pe 1 characterizes an advective system while the system becomes dispersive when its value is lower than 1 variations of pe can be achieved by increasing the flow velocity or decreasing the diffusion coefficient in this section the change of pe is achieved by using different flow velocities with a fixed d f since variation of flow velocity may contribute to both heat transfer and solute migration in the fractured system the relationship between the reynolds number re and the aperture 2b for cubic law fractures can be estimated by the following logarithmic equation quinn et al 2020 51 re 4 67 ln 2 b 20 444 the logarithmic relationship presented in eq 51 has been well validated for the 100 500 µm range of fracture apertures however the validity of this equation beyond the 100 500 µm is still unclear since the corresponding data are extremely limited quinn et al 2020 although single fractures non linearities are observed even at quite low re numbers fractures in the range of 100 500 µm have been shown to be cubic law apertures nicholl et al 1999 zimmerman et al 2004 konzuk and kueper 2004 the discrepancy of predicted hydraulic aperture and the measured on is within 30 effects of peclet number on coupled heat transfer and solute transport in a fractured porous media are presented in fig 8 generally with decreasing peclet number the temperatures along the fracture increase while the concentrations along the fracture decrease see fig 8a and 8e it was shown that temperature along the fracture decreases faster for the case with larger peclet numbers similar trends were reported by bagalkot and kumar 2015 this is mainly because the matrix is not able to sufficiently heat up the solution within the fracture when the cold solution injection rate is large e g pe 100 this leads to the decrease of temperature along the fracture in addition the matrix is cooled down with the growth of peclet number it can be seen in fig 8b 8d that the isothermal line with 337 k moves from the left bottom to the right top when pe increases from 1 to 100 this is attributed to a lower temperature profile in the fracture induced by a larger pe which causes variation of the temperature in the fracture and matrix consequently a considerable decrease of temperature can be observed in the matrix due to the heat exchange the relative concentration of solute experiences a substantial increase along the fracture with peclet number growth see fig 8e for example the relative concentration at x l 0 5 in the case with pe 100 is in 3 2 times larger than in the case with pe 1 the reduction of the relative concentration for the case with a lower pe comes from longer contact time of chemicals in fracture with porous matrix which can make more chemicals penetrate into the porous matrix tavakkoli osgouei 2020 on the contrary a larger pe can speed up solute transport and reduce contact time of fracture and the matrix system this contributes to more solute reaching the outlet boundary of fractures the concentration difference between the fracture and matrix leads to larger amount of solute transport into the matrix for the case with higher pe see fig 8f 8 h concentration gradients parallel to the fracture vanish along the fracture and in the matrix when pe 100 as solute is transported in an advection dominated system 5 2 effects of thermal diffusion st and the temperature difference δ t effects of thermal diffusion on solute transport are quantified in this section by using different soret coefficient eq 9 the soret coefficient is reported to have a range from 10 3 to 10 2 k 1 for solutions of small molecules platten et al 2003 it can be seen that the relative concentration of solute in the fracture matrix system decreases with the increase of st since the solution is injected in a hotter medium see fig 9 for example the increase of st from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 leads to the decrease of relative concentration from 0 48 to 0 39 at x l 0 5 the concentration gradients parallel to the fracture vanish in the matrix at 10 3 k 1 while the lines become curved with the growth of st additionally the isoline c c0 0 4 moves down from the center to the left bottom when st increases from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 this contributes to the reduction of concentration profiles as the intensity of solute transport from high temperatures to low temperatures is increased 5 3 effects of the fracture aperture and the matrix thickness the influence of the fracture half aperture b and matrix thickness h on heat transfer and solute transport is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the change of fracture aperture significantly affects temperature distributions and solute concentration profiles in the fracture and matrix for example increasing the fracture aperture from 0 09 mm to 1 mm can reduce the temperature at x l 0 2 from 343 k to 327 k the increment of the fracture aperture can cause an increase of the cold solution injection rate it increases the temperature difference between the matrix and solute which as a result gives that more thermal energy may be transferred from the matrix which serves as a heat source to the fracture therefore the fracture and matrix systems are cooled down with the fracture aperture increasing this thickness plays a key role in the description of interactions between two adjacent fractures and amount of stored heat in the matrix zhou and wang 2022 a larger temperature distribution in the fracture and matrix can be found in fig 10a 10d for the case with a smaller h e g h 1 86 mm this is because the coupling between the porous matrix and the fracture is enhanced with the increase of the matrix thickness since it inversely varies with the thickness see eq 21 the above results indicate that the increase of fracture aperture and matrix thickness can effectively reduce the temperature profile of the system the increase of the fracture aperture and matrix thickness leads to higher concentration profiles see fig 10e 10 h for example the solute concentration at x l 0 5 for b 1 mm and h 18 6 mm can be 1 5 and 4 6 times larger than that for b 0 09 mm and h 18 6 mm and b 0 09 mm and h 1 86 respectively the phenomena can be explained by the enlargement of fracture apertures which may effectively increase the amount of solute transported in the fracture as a result a larger part of the solute can penetrate the matrix consequently it is found that the solute transport in the fracture and its diffusion into the matrix is much less intensive when fracture aperture is increased as a smaller fracture implies a higher transport resistance and thus a higher retention for the same residence time trinchero et al 2020 moreover the increment of matrix thickness can reduce the mass transfer between the matrix and fracture see eq 30 6 conclusion a steady state analytical model for coupled heat transfer and solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media is developed its accuracy is successfully validated by two sets of experimental data the varied examples of coupled heat transfer and solute transport are evaluated by the proposed solution to discuss the effects of thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on the overall solute transport in a fractured porous media our analysis leads to the following major conclusions 1 thermal diffusion process is a non negligible mechanism to develop an accurate assessment of solute transport in a non isothermal fractured porous media for example the increase of st from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 leads to a reduction of solute concentration by a factor of 1 2 moreover thermal diffusion may be enhanced for a case with a larger temperature difference in solid fluid interface 2 it is found that a larger peclet number may cause a lower temperature distribution and a higher concentration profile in the fracture this is mainly because the matrix cannot sufficiently heat up the solution within the fracture in addition a larger peclet number can reduce contact time of solute at fracture matrix interface when the cold solute injection rate is large e g pe 100 3 coupled transport of heat and solute is largely affected by the fracture aperture generally an increase in fracture aperture leads to temperatures along the fracture decreasing while concentrations along the fracture increasing for example the solute concentration for b 0 09 mm can be 1 5 lower than that for b 0 1 mm the phenomena can be explained by the fact that an increase of fracture aperture may effectively increase the amount of solute transported in the fracture in addition the solute transport process may be enhanced by the thermal diffusion mechanism since a larger temperature difference in solid fluid interface can be observed for a bigger fracture aperture 4 the matrix thickness plays a key role in the interactions between two adjacent fractures and amount of heat stored in the matrix the increment of matrix thickness can reduce the mass transfer between the matrix and fracture and weaken the coupling of heat and mass transfer processes it is shown that the increase of the matrix thickness from 1 mm to 18 6 mm may result in a reduction of solute concentration by a factor of 3 5 the proposed analytical model is not without limitations one limitation is that the approach cannot provide the time required to achieve steady state conditions the time required to achieve steady state conditions in a fractured porous media can be calculated using the approach of tang et al 1981 another limitation is that a convection of pore water with temperature dependent density is not included in the current analytical model furthermore temperature dependent diffusion coefficient is not considered in the model due

2635,mass transfer in non isothermal fractured porous media have a wide application in many natural phenomena and engineering processes the current study focuses on developing alternative formulations of steady state analytical modelling for thermally induced solute diffusion in fractured porous media the proposed analytical frameworks are validated by two set of experimental data the varied examples of coupled heat transfer and solute diffusion are evaluated by the proposed solution to discuss the effects of thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on the overall transport of solute in a fractured porous media it is found that thermal diffusion process or explicitly as a soret effect st is a non negligible part for investigating solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media for example increasing st from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 leads to a reduction of solute concentration by a factor of 1 2 we demonstrate that a larger peclet number ensures the temperature of the solute along the fracture decreasing while its concentration along the fracture increasing however an increase of the temperature difference between the entry and the output shows an opposite trend an increase in fracture aperture or matrix thickness leads to temperature decreasing and concentration increasing along the fracture and matrix as a larger amount of solute are injected from the inlet boundary the presented analytical solutions may also serve as a benchmark test tool for alternative numerical studies of coupled heat transfer and solute diffusion in fractured porous media keywords analytical model fractured porous media thermal diffusion solute transport coupled problem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction studies of coupled heat and mass transfer phenomena in fractured porous media have a wide application in the solution of various natural and artificial problems including the description of underground natural oil recovery geothermal extraction long term storage of high level nuclear waste soil physics and environmental remediation wu and pruess 2000 yan et al 2020a 2020b mass and heat transfer in fractured porous media systems has two distinct components fluid filled fractures and ambient solid matrix with low permeability and porosity martinez et al 2014 phenomenologically the fracture provides a preferential path for heat and mass transfer while the lower permeable porous matrix can store heat energy and allows solute to diffuse into it bai et al 1996 zhao et al 2014 understanding of heat and mass transfer in fractured porous media system has been progressed in recent decades via extensive experimental and numerical studies frippiat and holeyman 2008 wu et al 2010 roubinet et al 2012 ma 2015 yang et al 2021 despite these advances modelling of coupled heat and mass transfer in fractured porous media remains conceptually and mathematically challenging due to the difficulty of defining and measuring model parameters and uncertainties associated with fracture matrix systems berre et al 2019 it has been shown that mass transfer in fluid porous media can be further enhanced in a non isothermal field due to the temperature gradient which is known as thermal diffusion or soret effect or soret ludwig effect ludwig 1856 soret 1880 the thermal diffusion which provides theoretical descriptions of coupling between fluxes mass and heat and forces temperature and concentration gradients based on thermodynamics of irreversible processes yan et al 2020a exhibits a measurable influence on the non isothermal transport of fluid and diffusion of mass the soret effect is evident from extensive analytical and experimental research e g longhurst 1985 costesèque et al 2002 considering the soret effect may contribute to the reduction of breakthrough time of solute by a factor of 1 5 yan et al 2021 consequently it is necessary to highlight the significance of introducing and coupling heat transfer in modelling mass solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media however studies on influences of heat transfer on the transport of solute in fractured porous media are very limited natarajan and kumar 2012 lawrence et al 2021 heat and mass transfer in discretely fractured media have been extensively studied by experimental analytical and numerical methods bai et al 2017 ma 2015 yang et al 2021 experimental studies mainly focus on quantifying effects of fracture and its flow parameters and thermal properties including the roughness and aperture of fractures flow velocity heat conduction coefficient heat exchange and solute mass transfer at the fracture and matrix interface zhao 1994 bai et al 2016 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 luo et al 2017 luo et al 2018 huang et al 2019 qian et al 2011 tzelepis et al 2015 while laboratory or field experiments are expensive and time consuming many numerical models were developed for accurate prediction of heat and mass transfer in matrix fracture to help understand energy and mass exchange mechanisms within fracture matrix and matrix fracture interface briggs et al 2014 suzuki et al 2016 li et al 2020 chen and zhao 2020 he et al 2021 lawrence et al 2021 these results provided fundamental methodologies and important insights on understanding transport phenomena in fractured porous media zhao et al 2011 ma 2015 analytical solutions support physical explanation of these transport phenomena and act as an invaluable component in field scale screening and management decision support models martinez et al 2014 feng et al 2022 even if they rely on some simplifying assumptions that might not be valid in a specific application these analytical solutions are widely adopted as a basic benchmark test tool for other specific mass transport and heat transfer problems in fractured porous media liu et al 2011 zou et al 2016 xie et al 2022 pioneering works by tang et al 1981 developed an analytical model for mass transport in a single fractured porous media this analytical model was extended by considering effects of reactive transport transverse dispersion fracture networks roubinet et al 2012 zou et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 haddad et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 zhou and zhan 2018 xie et al 2022 additionally analytical models are developed and applied to investigate heat transfer in a single fracture coupled with thermal energy transfer in the ambient rock matrix zhao 2014 martinez et al 2014 bai et ai 2017 abbasi et al 2017 abbasi et al 2019 he et al 2021 zhou and wang 2022 however the aforementioned studies mainly focused on investigating either single solute transport or heat transfer in the system and the coupling of these two processes in fractured porous media was ignored the effect of coupled heat transfer on solute transport may be of interest where mass solute transport can be enhanced in a non isothermal fractured porous system this paper aims to develop the understanding of the direct effect of thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on the overall transport of solute in a fractured porous media an analytical model of coupled heat transfer and solute diffusion in fractured porous media is developed in this study section 2 provides a mathematical formulation of the problem section 3 contains its general solution for heat transfer and thermally induced solute transport these solutions are validated by two set of experimental data in section 4 physical and practical implications of the model are demonstrated in section 5 major conclusions from the study are summarized in section 6 2 non isothermal transport of solute in fractured porous media the conceptual model of non isothermal solute transport in fractured porous media is shown in fig 1 a fracture with aperture 2b and length l is embedded in a homogenous porous matrix the thickness of the matrix 2h is defined as the spacing between two adjacent parallel fractures see fig 1 solution is injected from the left side of fracture the fracture walls are smooth and parallel to each other the following assumptions are made relating the geometric and hydraulic properties of the fractured system tang et al 1981 martinez et al 2014 i the solute is incompressible with constant density and its flow is steady state ii heat and mass transport in a fracture is much faster than transport within the matrix which is mainly composed of tight porous media with relatively lower permeability when solution flows within the fractures thermal solute advection in the matrix barely happens heat transfer within the matrix is mainly governed by thermal conduction solute transport within the matrix is mainly governed by molecular diffusion thermal diffusion and decay iii since there is no sharp change of temperature in the fractured system the thermal and physical properties of the fluid and solid components are independent on temperature stopa and wojnarowski 2006 zhou and wang 2022 iv fracture aperture is assumed to be sufficiently small so that complete mixing in the fracture is considered trinchero and iraola 2020 v the analytical solutions are developed under the restrictive assumptions of steady state conditions rabideau and khandelwal 1998 rowe et al 2004 shackelford 1990 the time required to achieve steady state conditions which are largely affected by the fracture properties solute characteristics and transport parameters it might be as short as a few years tang et al 1981 or might possibly be as long as hundred or thousand of years trinchero and iraola 2020 however the steady state solution allows for investigating and explaining the mechanisms involved and their roles in mass transport in non isothermal fractures in addition it can serve as an effective estimation of the risk related to the breakthrough of solute in the system dominijanni and manassero 2019 foose 2010 2 1 heat transfer in fractured porous media the general differential governing equation for heat transfer in the fracture can be obtained by considering energy balance in a control volume the steady state heat transport in the fracture including conduction advection and convection from the fracture wall can be expressed as zhao 2014 heinze et al 2017 1 k w c w ρ w 2 t f x x 2 v l t f x x q t b 0 where k w c w ρ w are the thermal conductivity specific heat capacity and density of the liquid respectively v l is the

witherspoon et al 1980 4 k l b 2 12 assuming that the heat conduction in matrix is perpendicular to the fracture plane the steady state heat conduction in the matrix is governed by tavakkoli osgouei 2020 5 2 t m x z z 2 0 2 2 thermally induced solute transport in fractured porous media the governing equation for coupled solute transport and heat transfer in the fracture can be obtained by the

it should be noted that thermal osmosis which describes the influence of temperature gradient on fluid flow is not considered in the current study eq 6 since it is reported that thermal osmosis effects are typically trivial in traditional geotechnical engineering due to lower temperature gradients and higher permeabilities e g kl 10 10 m s yang et al 2014 zagorščak et al 2016 zhai and atefi monfared 2020 the general governing equation for solute transport in the non isothermal matrix can be given by e g sedighi et al 2018 yan et al 2020a 8 d m 2 c m x z z 2 d t m z t m x z z λ m c m x z 0 where d m is the diffusion coefficient of solute in porous matrix and d t m is the thermal diffusion coefficient of solute in the porous matrix three transport mechanisms are involved including solute diffusion thermal diffusion and decay processes the total solute flux comprises the diffusive flux due to the solute concentration potential and thermal diffusion flux due to temperature gradient or soret effect molecular diffusion first term in eq 8 is based on fick s law of diffusion thermal diffusion second term is induced by soret effect the soret coefficients for the fracture and matrix can be defined as follows ludwig 1856 soret 1880 chan et al 2003 s t i d t i d i i m or f 9 it should be noted that positive values of s t i and d t i represent that solute transport from the warmer regions to the cooler regions under non isothermal conditions chan et al 2003 2 3 boundary conditions the solute concentration and temperature at inflow boundary left hand side see fig 1 is

simulate e g an impermeable boundary or advective discharge in more conductive quaternary sediments trinchero et al 2019 it is widely adopted for parallel fractures system which allows symmetry to be considered trinchero and iraola 2020 dirichlet boundary condition eqs 16 and 17 implies that the solute can be removed instantaneously at the boundary it is worthwhile noting that for mathematical convenience most of the available analytical solutions for heat transfer and mass transport in fractured porous media assume a semi infinite domain trinchero et al 2019 in addition dirichlet boundary condition can be reduced to a semi infinite boundary condition when h is assumed to be infinite 3 analytical solutions the analytical solution for heat transfer and solute transport in fractured

transfer in fractured porous media the experimental observations reported by zhao and tso 1993 are adopted here to validate the proposed analytical solution for heat transfer in the fractured porous media a schematic diagram of the experimental test is shown in fig 2 the data reproduced and replotted from the literature is obtained by using the function of digitizer in origin pro 2016 although there may have been slight deviations as the results of digitalization the tested rock sample had a size of 102 mm length and 51 mm diameter the coefficient of surface roughness of the fracture presented in fig 2a is 9 according to the division standard of barton and choubey 1977 zhao 1987 the real fracture fig 2a is simplified in this study by assuming a parallel fracture with a thickness of 2b in the rock sample see fig 2b the low temperature solute tin was injected at left side and collected from the right side the solute temperatures at inlet and outlet were measured when the system reached a steady state the following thermal parameters were used for the prediction k r 3 5 w m 1 k 1 ρ w 1000 k g m 3 and c w 4200 j k g 1 k 1 the fracture aperture liquid flowrate and injected liquid temperatures are provided in table 1 it should be noted that temperature distributions along the fracture and in the matrix were not recorded in the experiment therefore the measured outlet temperatures were adopted to validate the current analytical solution the measured temperatures and predicted results from eq 22 are compared in table 1 the relative difference between the measurement data and predicted results are used to quantify the accuracy of the proposed solution the relative difference is defined as follows 47 ε δ t ana δ t exp δ t exp 100 48 δ t ana t in ana t out ana 49 δ t exp t in exp t out exp where t in exp and t out exp are the measured temperature at inlet and outlet boundaries respectively t in ana and t out ana are the inlet and outlet boundary temperature predicted by the model both dirichlet eq 16 and neuman eq 18 outlet boundary conditions are applied to analyze the experimental data reported by zhao and tso 1993 the predicted results obtained for both dirichlet eq 22 and neuman eq 39 boundary conditions are provided in table 1 it can be seen that the average difference between the measured data and predicted results was within 10 the average difference predicted by dirichlet boundary conditions eq 22 is lower than that of neuman boundary conditions eq 39 the explanation of the phenomena is that compared with neuman boundary conditions the use of dirichlet boundary conditions can reduce the matrix diffusion because of lower thermal gradients kennedy and lennox 1995 it is can be seen that the use of dirichlet boundary conditions can capture the effects of liquid injection velocity on heat transfer i e that the increase of liquid velocity can slightly reduce the outlet temperature nevertheless with decreasing of liquid velocity the effect of matrix boundary conditions decreases for example the predicted outlet temperatures by dirichlet and neuman boundary conditions are both 363 k when v l 30 mm s 4 2 thermally induced solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media experimental investigations of solute transport in the non isothermal fractured core plugs were carried out by tavakkoli osgouei 2020 rhodamine b rhbs with molecular weight of 479 02 g mol was used as a conventional and non reactive tracer with constant injection concentration c0 the injection flow rate was 1 ml min the temperatures of the rock sample were maintained at 303 k and 343 k at the injection side and outer surface respectively tavakkoli osgouei and akin 2021 a schematic diagram of the experimental test is analogous to one shown in fig 1 the effective diffusion coefficients in the fracture and matrix are assumed to 1 16 10 5 m2 s and 4 91 10 9 m2 s respectively which are calibrated effective diffusion coefficients reported by tavakkoli osgouei 2020 at t 343 k it should be noted that effects of temperature variations on the effective diffusion coefficient are not considered in the current analytical solutions although it is reported that the diffusion coefficient is temperature dependent yan et al 2020a the comparison between experimental data and model predictions for temperatures at outlet under various liquid injection rate is provided in table 3 generally the outer temperatures decrease with a rise of flow rate in all core plugs verifications of temperature profiles along the fracture at t0 343 k for core plug 3 are shown in fig 3 the temperature of cold solute increases along the fracture from the fluid inlet to the fracture outlet a comparison of experimental measurements of rhbs concentration and predicted results in steady state conditions for different core plugs is shown in table 4 it is noted that rhbs concentration profile along the fracture and in the matrix were not recorded in the experiment consequently the measured outlet solute concentrations are used to validate the proposed model it can be seen that the core plug 3 has the highest relative outer concentration e g c c0 0 75 as it has the lowest matrix permeability and matrix porosity see table 2 a case of the solute transport model without considering the temperature effect is added in table 4 to highlight the significance of coupling heat transfer the relative outlet concentration for the case without coupling heat transfer is achieved by setting the domain with an isothermal temperature e g t 343 k it is found that the difference between the measured data and predicted results is increased for the case without coupling heat transfer process for example the difference of the relative outlet concentration for plug 1 is 2 3 and 12 8 for the case with considering the temperature effect and without considering the temperature effect respectively 4 3 comparison with numerical model the proposed analytical solution is compared with the results of finite element simulation of the same problem performed by comsol multiphysics in order to justify the basic assumptions including constant density fluid assumption i and no advection in the matrix assumption ii the permeability of the matrix and density driven flow in the matrix coupling with heat transport is included in the comsol model three physical modules are used to simulate the steady transport of solute in non isothermal fractured porous media in comsol the darcy s law and heat transfer modules were applied for studying fluid and heat transport in fractures and matrix respectively coefficient form of pde module was used to investigate solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media in this implementation the primary dependent variables are solute concentration c temperature t and fluid velocity v the updated variables or parameters such as the temperature dependent density and viscosity are fed into the external material interface using the formulas for the material parameters in comsol the details of the governing equations are given in appendix a unless otherwise indicated the parameters in table 2 are used as the reference conditions to calculate solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media in order to study effects of seepage in the matrix density driven flow in the matrix coupling with heat transport temperature dependent density and viscosity on solute transport in fractured porous media the following additional parameters were used in comsol simulations the matrix porosity n 0 19 tavakkoli osgouei 2020 the longitudinal dispersivity α l 0 1 m and the transverse dispersivity α t 0 03 m west et al 2004 three values of the matrix permeability km including 0 1 md 1 md and 10 md are selected to represent the low medium and high matrix permeability respectively hosseini et al 2020 the finer grid close to the fracture matrix interface z h 0 where the solute diffuses from the fracture into the matrix and the changes in solute concentration are significant the temperature difference δt between the entry and the output plays a key role in controlling heat transfer and solute transport in the fracture matrix system luo et al 2017 in this verification the temperature difference is achieved via altering the temperature of injected fluid with a fixed outer temperature at 343 k in order to evaluate the influence of temperature differences and matrix seepage on the solute transport the following five simulation cases scenarios have been designed which include case 1 solute transport under isothermal conditions 343 k case 2 the temperature of the fluid was maintained at 381 1 k in which solute transport from the warmer region to the cooler region case 3 the temperature of the fluid was maintained at 304 9 k in which solute transport from the cooler region to the warmer region case 4 with km 0 1 md and case 5 with km 10 md are designed to study the effect of matrix seepage on solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media figs 4 7 show the temperature and concentration profiles of solute under neumann bc and dirichlet bc it can be seen that the presented analytical solution agrees with the results obtained by the numerical model generally the concentration profile is largely affected by the temperature of the injected fluid it can be seen that the negative temperature difference δ t 0 can lead to a reduction of solute concentration while the positive temperature difference δ t 0 may result in an increase of solute concentration in the fracture for example the relative solute concentration at x l 0 5 for δ t 0 δ t 38 1 k and δ t 38 1 k is 0 49 0 4 and 0 59 under neumann bc respectively the explanation for the phenomena is that there is driving force for mass transport within the system from a point of higher concentration to that of a lower concentration bird 2002 this indicates that variations of temperature can have significant impact on the transport of solute in the non isothermal fractured porous media it is noted that some deviations can be observed between the numerical solution and analytical solution in fig 7c the discrepancy may be attributed to the mesh issue close to the fracture matrix interface although the mesh quality is high near the interface e g extra fine element size is selected in comsol the inflection points observed in fig 7c and fig 7d can be attributed to thermal diffusion processes for example it can be found in fig 6a that there is a fast decrease of the temperature along the fracture for the case with δt 38 1 k when x l 0 1 solute transport is largely enhanced in this range by thermal diffusion process as a result inflections points of solute concentration distribution are observed in fig 7c in addition it can be found that effects of matrix seepage and density driven flow on heat transfer and solute transport are negligible under the simulated conditions of this study these results justify the basic assumptions of constant density fluid and no advection in the matrix for the analytical model 5 applications and discussions this section presents a detailed investigation of the effects of some key variables including thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on solute in non isothermal fractured porous media the length of the calculated domain l is 71 3 mm the fracture half aperture b and matrix thickness h is set to be 0 18 mm and 18 6 mm respectively tavakkoli osgouei and akin 2021 unless otherwise indicated the parameters in table 2 are used as the reference conditions to calculate solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media tavakkoli osgouei 2020 5 1 effects of peclet number peclet number is a dimensionless number corresponding to the ratio of advection and diffusion dispersion which is defined as yan et al 2020b 50 pe v l l d f pe is generally used to assess the dominant mechanism of mass transfer induced by advection or dispersion diffusion a large peclet number e g pe 1 characterizes an advective system while the system becomes dispersive when its value is lower than 1 variations of pe can be achieved by increasing the flow velocity or decreasing the diffusion coefficient in this section the change of pe is achieved by using different flow velocities with a fixed d f since variation of flow velocity may contribute to both heat transfer and solute migration in the fractured system the relationship between the reynolds number re and the aperture 2b for cubic law fractures can be estimated by the following logarithmic equation quinn et al 2020 51 re 4 67 ln 2 b 20 444 the logarithmic relationship presented in eq 51 has been well validated for the 100 500 µm range of fracture apertures however the validity of this equation beyond the 100 500 µm is still unclear since the corresponding data are extremely limited quinn et al 2020 although single fractures non linearities are observed even at quite low re numbers fractures in the range of 100 500 µm have been shown to be cubic law apertures nicholl et al 1999 zimmerman et al 2004 konzuk and kueper 2004 the discrepancy of predicted hydraulic aperture and the measured on is within 30 effects of peclet number on coupled heat transfer and solute transport in a fractured porous media are presented in fig 8 generally with decreasing peclet number the temperatures along the fracture increase while the concentrations along the fracture decrease see fig 8a and 8e it was shown that temperature along the fracture decreases faster for the case with larger peclet numbers similar trends were reported by bagalkot and kumar 2015 this is mainly because the matrix is not able to sufficiently heat up the solution within the fracture when the cold solution injection rate is large e g pe 100 this leads to the decrease of temperature along the fracture in addition the matrix is cooled down with the growth of peclet number it can be seen in fig 8b 8d that the isothermal line with 337 k moves from the left bottom to the right top when pe increases from 1 to 100 this is attributed to a lower temperature profile in the fracture induced by a larger pe which causes variation of the temperature in the fracture and matrix consequently a considerable decrease of temperature can be observed in the matrix due to the heat exchange the relative concentration of solute experiences a substantial increase along the fracture with peclet number growth see fig 8e for example the relative concentration at x l 0 5 in the case with pe 100 is in 3 2 times larger than in the case with pe 1 the reduction of the relative concentration for the case with a lower pe comes from longer contact time of chemicals in fracture with porous matrix which can make more chemicals penetrate into the porous matrix tavakkoli osgouei 2020 on the contrary a larger pe can speed up solute transport and reduce contact time of fracture and the matrix system this contributes to more solute reaching the outlet boundary of fractures the concentration difference between the fracture and matrix leads to larger amount of solute transport into the matrix for the case with higher pe see fig 8f 8 h concentration gradients parallel to the fracture vanish along the fracture and in the matrix when pe 100 as solute is transported in an advection dominated system 5 2 effects of thermal diffusion st and the temperature difference δ t effects of thermal diffusion on solute transport are quantified in this section by using different soret coefficient eq 9 the soret coefficient is reported to have a range from 10 3 to 10 2 k 1 for solutions of small molecules platten et al 2003 it can be seen that the relative concentration of solute in the fracture matrix system decreases with the increase of st since the solution is injected in a hotter medium see fig 9 for example the increase of st from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 leads to the decrease of relative concentration from 0 48 to 0 39 at x l 0 5 the concentration gradients parallel to the fracture vanish in the matrix at 10 3 k 1 while the lines become curved with the growth of st additionally the isoline c c0 0 4 moves down from the center to the left bottom when st increases from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 this contributes to the reduction of concentration profiles as the intensity of solute transport from high temperatures to low temperatures is increased 5 3 effects of the fracture aperture and the matrix thickness the influence of the fracture half aperture b and matrix thickness h on heat transfer and solute transport is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the change of fracture aperture significantly affects temperature distributions and solute concentration profiles in the fracture and matrix for example increasing the fracture aperture from 0 09 mm to 1 mm can reduce the temperature at x l 0 2 from 343 k to 327 k the increment of the fracture aperture can cause an increase of the cold solution injection rate it increases the temperature difference between the matrix and solute which as a result gives that more thermal energy may be transferred from the matrix which serves as a heat source to the fracture therefore the fracture and matrix systems are cooled down with the fracture aperture increasing this thickness plays a key role in the description of interactions between two adjacent fractures and amount of stored heat in the matrix zhou and wang 2022 a larger temperature distribution in the fracture and matrix can be found in fig 10a 10d for the case with a smaller h e g h 1 86 mm this is because the coupling between the porous matrix and the fracture is enhanced with the increase of the matrix thickness since it inversely varies with the thickness see eq 21 the above results indicate that the increase of fracture aperture and matrix thickness can effectively reduce the temperature profile of the system the increase of the fracture aperture and matrix thickness leads to higher concentration profiles see fig 10e 10 h for example the solute concentration at x l 0 5 for b 1 mm and h 18 6 mm can be 1 5 and 4 6 times larger than that for b 0 09 mm and h 18 6 mm and b 0 09 mm and h 1 86 respectively the phenomena can be explained by the enlargement of fracture apertures which may effectively increase the amount of solute transported in the fracture as a result a larger part of the solute can penetrate the matrix consequently it is found that the solute transport in the fracture and its diffusion into the matrix is much less intensive when fracture aperture is increased as a smaller fracture implies a higher transport resistance and thus a higher retention for the same residence time trinchero et al 2020 moreover the increment of matrix thickness can reduce the mass transfer between the matrix and fracture see eq 30 6 conclusion a steady state analytical model for coupled heat transfer and solute transport in non isothermal fractured porous media is developed its accuracy is successfully validated by two sets of experimental data the varied examples of coupled heat transfer and solute transport are evaluated by the proposed solution to discuss the effects of thermal diffusion flow operational conditions geometry and thermal properties of fracture and matrix on the overall solute transport in a fractured porous media our analysis leads to the following major conclusions 1 thermal diffusion process is a non negligible mechanism to develop an accurate assessment of solute transport in a non isothermal fractured porous media for example the increase of st from 10 3 k 1 to 10 2 k 1 leads to a reduction of solute concentration by a factor of 1 2 moreover thermal diffusion may be enhanced for a case with a larger temperature difference in solid fluid interface 2 it is found that a larger peclet number may cause a lower temperature distribution and a higher concentration profile in the fracture this is mainly because the matrix cannot sufficiently heat up the solution within the fracture in addition a larger peclet number can reduce contact time of solute at fracture matrix interface when the cold solute injection rate is large e g pe 100 3 coupled transport of heat and solute is largely affected by the fracture aperture generally an increase in fracture aperture leads to temperatures along the fracture decreasing while concentrations along the fracture increasing for example the solute concentration for b 0 09 mm can be 1 5 lower than that for b 0 1 mm the phenomena can be explained by the fact that an increase of fracture aperture may effectively increase the amount of solute transported in the fracture in addition the solute transport process may be enhanced by the thermal diffusion mechanism since a larger temperature difference in solid fluid interface can be observed for a bigger fracture aperture 4 the matrix thickness plays a key role in the interactions between two adjacent fractures and amount of heat stored in the matrix the increment of matrix thickness can reduce the mass transfer between the matrix and fracture and weaken the coupling of heat and mass transfer processes it is shown that the increase of the matrix thickness from 1 mm to 18 6 mm may result in a reduction of solute concentration by a factor of 3 5 the proposed analytical model is not without limitations one limitation is that the approach cannot provide the time required to achieve steady state conditions the time required to achieve steady state conditions in a fractured porous media can be calculated using the approach of tang et al 1981 another limitation is that a convection of pore water with temperature dependent density is not included in the current analytical model furthermore temperature dependent diffusion coefficient is not considered in the model due to the limitation of analytical solution proposed in this study availability of data and materials data are available from the authors upon reasonable request national key r d program of china grant

2636,solute transport process in fractured rocks is central to many engineering applications however how matrix diffusion affects non fickian transport behavior which is typically characterized by the late time tailing in breakthrough curves and residence time distributions remains underexplored especially considering the coupling effects of the finite matrix thickness h and transport regimes quantified by peclet number pe in this work the fluid flow and solute transport were simulated by directly solving the navier stokes equations and advection diffusion equation in a two dimensional fracture matrix system considering matrix diffusion in total eighty cases considering variations of h and pe were conducted to investigate the impacts of h and pe on the late time solute tailing characterized by the exponent n in the power law function numerical results demonstrate that n decreases with an increase of h and pe where n eventually reduces to 1 5 that is a theoretical value for an infinite matrix domain moreover the relationship between n and h pe is established via a polynomial function which is further validated by the three dimensional heterogeneous fracture matrix system the newly established function can be used to accurately assess the power law tailing process given the knowledge of measurable h and pe keywords solute transport fracture matrix interactions finite matrix transport tailing advection diffusion equation direct numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction fractures are ubiquitously present in geological formations due to weathering and tectonic processes candela et al 2012 compared to the rock matrix fractures are expected to have a much higher permeability serving as the predominant pathways for the migration of fluids and solutes consequently fluid flow and solute transport in fractures are critical to understanding many geophysical processes and determining the success of engineering applications especially in low permeable subsurface cardenas et al 2007 goodman 1976 jing 2003 examples include but are not limited to geothermal exploitation chen et al 2018 pruess 2006 oil and gas recovery berg et al 2008 christensen and tanino 2017 groundwater contamination remediation huyakorn et al 1994 yang et al 2013 geological nuclear waste disposal bodvarsson et al 1999 and subsurface co2 sequestration szulczewski et al 2012 wang and cardenas 2017 wang and cardenas 2018 compared to fluid flow in fractures solute transport is more complex because the transport process is determined not only by the advection along with fluid flow but also by the complexity induced by diffusion and dispersion processes in the fracture and matrix bodin et al 2003a traditionally solute transport is assumed to follow fickian behaviors that can be described by the well known advection dispersion equation ade however extensive field and experimental results reported significant deviations between the measured breakthrough curves btcs and the numerical results obtained using the ade gouze et al 2008 levy and berkowitz 2003 neretnieks et al 1982 i e the presence of non fickian transport phenomenon more specifically in these analyses the ade did not capture the non fickian behavior exemplified in the early breakthrough times and late time tailing dou and zhou 2015 gouze et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 the widely observed non fickian transport phenomena in fractured rocks are fundamentally attributed to the interplay of advection and dispersion diffusion processes which are further determined by many physical and chemical factors till now there are several mechanisms are proposed to explain non fickian transport including 1 pronounced heterogeneity resulted in preferential flow paths hyman 2020 hyman et al 2019a painter et al 2002 2 the transport has not reached the fickian regime due to limited spatial and temporal scales bouquain et al 2012 wang and cardenas 2014 wang et al 2012 3 the mass transfer between mobile and immobile or slow flowing zones e g diffusion into and out of the rock matrix or recirculation zones becker and shapiro 2000 comolli et al 2016 shapiro 2001 wang et al 2020 4 the injection modes of solutes frampton and cvetkovic 2009 kang et al 2020 5 the flow and transport regimes cardenas et al 2009 nissan and berkowitz 2018 and 6 the absorption of solutes on fracture wall and matrix rock hölttä et al 2001 here we focus exclusively on the effects of matrix diffusion on non fickian solute transport in fractures with different transport regimes in fact numerous studies have demonstrated that solute diffusion into the matrix can result in the heavy tailing of breakthrough curves btcs typical of non fickian transport for example grisak and pickens 1980a grisak and pickens 1980b studied the role of matrix diffusion in controlling the tailing behavior of trace btcs through laboratory tracer experiments and numerical simulations novakowski and lapcevic 1994 carried out a solute transport tracer experiment in the fractured rock at the stripa mining area they found that the tracer had entered the undisturbed pore skeleton over the course of passing through the disturbed area confirming the existence of matrix diffusion at a natural field site jardine et al 1999 conducted a long term tracer experiment on a natural fracture area oak ridge tennessee and concluded that the tracer gradually diffused into the surrounding shale matrix indeed many studies indisputably support the influence of matrix diffusion on solute transport especially when the matrix porosity is large huyakorn et al 1983 park et al 2001 sidle et al 1998 in theory the signature of matrix diffusion on tracer btcs is a late time tailing process characterized by a power law decay of late time concentration c i e c t n grisak and pickens 1981 haggerty et al 2000 hyman et al 2019b maloszewski and zuber 1985 tsang 1995 where t is time n is decay exponent for an idealized parallel plate fracture and a homogeneous matrix the late time decay exponent n has been theoretically determined to be 1 5 when the matrix is infinitely large maloszewski and zuber 1985 tang et al 1981 tsang 1995 however some tracer tests in fractured rocks exhibit btcs with sustained power law tails but their exponents deviate from 1 5 so far a broad range of power law exponents n have been observed depending on the field site and experimental conditions becker and shapiro 2003 gouze et al 2008 hyman et al 2019b kang et al 2015 for instance haggerty et al 2001 haggerty et al 2000 showed that btcs from the single well injection withdrawal tests at the waste isolation pilot plant wipp dolomite site clearly exhibited sustained power law tails with n ranging between 2 1 and 2 2 becker and shapiro 2003 showed that the late time tailing of btcs at the mirror lake granite site followed a power law with n around 2 tsang 1995 used tracers to study solute transport in fractures showing that matrix diffusion would significantly enhance the late time tailing process compared to no matrix diffusion case where n 1 5 was recovered following the theory in short a wide range of n has been reported based on field experiments but the driving mechanisms of such phenomena need to be carefully examined and investigated especially when n significantly deviates from 1 5 that cannot be simply explained by the matrix diffusion when assuming matrix domain is infinite large to fill the knowledge gap in understanding the deviation of n from 1 5 this study for the first time explicitly investigates the coupling effects of finite matrix domain size and peclet number pe on causing the deviation of n to achieve this goal we employed direct numerical simulations that directly solved fluid flow in the fracture via the navier stokes equations along with a specified zero velocity in the matrix the transport was solved in the fracture via the advection diffusion equation and in the matrix via the diffusion equation a series of two dimensional 2 d single parallel plates matrix systems with diverse matrix thicknesses h and transport regimes pe were considered to balance the tractability and transport complexity numerical solutions were used to assess and quantify the behavior of n in response to the h and pe finally the prediction of n was further validated based on a three dimensional 3 d fracture matrix system when matrix diffusion is present it should be noted that some analytical or semi analytical solutions are available for the simplified configurations we studied here bodin et al 2003a ling et al 2021 roubinet et al 2012 however these solutions either neglect the fully developed parabolic velocity profile in the fracture sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 or there are some estimation errors that semi analytical solution cannot handle under the circumstance of high velocity regime i e high pe regime ling et al 2021 these estimation errors might significantly undermine the prediction of n considering that the late time concentration is normally small that magnifies the effects of estimation errors thus we consistently used numerical simulations rather than using analytical or semi analytical solutions to investigate the effects of pe on solute transport especially on the late time tailing phenomenon that has not been systematically studied yet 2 methodology bodin et al 2003a bodin et al 2003a provided a comprehensive review of key physical mechanisms in fracture matrix interaction systems mainly including solute advection and dispersion in the fracture matrix diffusion from the fracture into the matrix fracture surface and matrix sorption decay and chemical reactions here we only considered the advection and diffusion in the fracture and molecular diffusion in the surrounding matrix from the fracture surfaces to exclusively investigate the coupling effects of finite h and pe the numerical configuration neglecting advection and dispersion in the matrix is consistent with some previous studies bodin et al 2003a sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 recent studies proposed to include the influence of matrix velocity that is parallel to the fracture flow on solute transport process ling et al 2021 ling et al 2016 the inclusion of matrix velocity might impact the magnitude of n however we are not sure that this treatment of the matrix velocity is appropriate or not in realistic geological settings the velocity in the matrix might be complex e g fluid can penetrate across the interface of fracture matrix hence and for simplicity our study only considered molecular diffusion in the matrix 2 1 a simplified 2 d fracture matrix system to exclude effects of other factors especially fracture heterogeneity on solute transport the flow and solute transport simulations were done in a simplified fracture matrix system where the fracture is a parallel plate with a specified thickness of the surrounding matrix fig 1 specifically the constant aperture b for fracture is 1 mm the length of domain l is 150 mm that satisfies the length threshold for reaching asymptotic dispersion regime wang et al 2012 to identify the effects of finite h on solute transport we considered eight scenarios with h increasing from 0 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 and up to 50 mm fig 2 where h 0 indicates the case without molecular diffusion into matrix 2 2 fluid flow in the fracture governed by the naiver stokes equations the flow of isothermal incompressible and steady state single newtonian fluid in the fracture is governed by the navier stokes equations which represent mass and momentum conservation 1 u 0 2 ρ u u μ u p where u m s is velocity vector in the fracture and p pa is the total pressure with p pa m indicating pressure gradient the fluid properties of water were applied here ρ 1 103 kg m3 is the density and μ 1 10 3 pa s is the dynamic viscosity moreover since only molecular diffusion is considered in the matrix we simply specified velocity 0 m s in the matrix we applied dirichlet boundary conditions at the inlet left and outlet left boundaries of fracture that is a pressure gradient with a specified pressure p p0 at left and an open boundary at right p 0 pa drives fluid flow in the longitudinal direction figs 1 and 2 all other boundaries were set as either no flow or no slip walls the navier stokes equations with the specified boundary conditions were solved numerically using the finite element method implemented in comsol multiphysics we used a fine mesh size around the fracture and a coarse mesh size in the matrix results are not shown here eventually we had 0 1 million triangular elements for the fracture and 0 3 million triangular elements for the fracture matrix system convergence analysis for the size of element was conducted for each simulation using a series of successively refined grids until the solution became grid independent roache 1998 this was demonstrated by a specific case as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the results of the solved flow field served as the basis for simulating the solute transport process to examine the effects of finite matrix domain on solute transport the simulation scenarios with varying h fig 2 were implemented by comsol multiphysics moreover for each simulation scenario we systematically increased inlet pressure p0 to achieve different flow and transport regimes as further discussed below each run took about one hour on a memory shared workstation 2 3 direct numerical simulations for conservative solute transport conservative solute transport simulations for the fracture matrix system consists of advection diffusion in the fracture and pure diffusion in the matrix due to the absence of flow in the matrix fig 1 that is in the fracture domain we solved the ade following 3 c t u c d m c where c kg m3 is aqueous solute concentration t s is time and dm 2 03 10 9 m2 s is molecular diffusion coefficient for a conservative solute transport e g cl in water moreover the transport process in the matrix follows the diffusion equation 4 c t τ d m c where τ is tortuosity sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 due to tortuous pore geometry that follows the millington and quirk model with τ 1 θ 3 in comsol multiphysics where θ is porosity that was set to be 0 25 this tortuosity model has been widely used previously that is supposed to be applicable for a range of different soils the concentration field in the fracture matrix system was obtained by solving the eqs 3 4 with the given initial and boundary conditions fig 1 5 c x t 0 0 x l t 0 c x t c 0 x 0 t 0 c n 0 x l t 0 where n represents the normal direction to the outlet boundary equation 5 suggests that the fracture matrix system is initially free of solute the fracture inlet boundary assumes a step injection with c0 1 kg m3 and there is no diffusive flux at the fracture outlet note that all other boundaries were set as no flux walls in addition to the effects of finite matrix domain eight scenarios with different h the effects of transport regimes quantified by pe on solute transport were also diagnosed the pe is defined as 6 pe u b d m where u m s is mean longitudinal velocity in the fracture derived from flow simulations and b is fracture aperture fig 1 we achieved this by varying pressure gradients such that pe increased from 1 102 2 5 102 5 102 1 103 2 5 103 5 103 1 104 2 5 104 5 104 to 1 105 fig 3 where the range of pe follows the previous study yoon and kang 2021 in total we had ten different pe cases eight different h cases 80 numerical simulations all transport simulations were conducted in comsol multiphysics using the same meshing scheme as used for fluid flow simulations each run took about a few hours to 1 day that depending on the h and pe values 2 4 analysis of results of solute transport simulations

effluent solute mass to fluid mass 7 c f 0 b u c d y 0 b u d y where u m s is longitudinal fluid velocity at the fracture outlet moreover the cf and time were further normalized to make btc comparable for 80 numerical simulations following 8 c c f c 0 9 t qt a where c is the normalized concentration t is the dimensionless time related to the pore volume pv q m2 s is the integrated flux at outlet and a m2 is area of the fracture the rtds serve as an alternative metric to assess the non fickian transport characteristics in the fracture matrix systems which were estimated by taking the time derivative of btcs considering the step injection boundary condition fig 7 next we fitted the power law function c t n to the numerically derived rtds using the late time of 100 points excluding the last 15 points or using the same time window fig 7 all the power law exponents were determined for 80 cases with varying h and pe lastly the relationship between n and h pe was established by fitting a constitutive function that facilitates the assessment of non fickian transport in fractures when matrix diffusion is present note that the solute exchange flux qc between the fracture and matrix can be also quantified based on the numerical results following 10 q c 0 l θ d m c y d x where l is length of fracture matrix interface 3 results and discussion on the coupling effects of finite matrix domain and pe on solute transport 3 1 flow field in the fracture matrix systems understanding the flow field in fractures is fundamental for studying the conservative solute transport for the sake of completeness the flow fields used in this study were introduced and discussed briefly consistent to the theoretical solution for the parallel plates model according to the cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 the numerically derived longitudinal velocity u follows a parabolic profile across the fracture whereas the transverse velocity v in the y direction is zero everywhere in the fracture fig 1 this supports the validity of numerical solutions in capturing the velocity field in the fracture in contrast to previous studies sudicky and frind 1982 that assumed macroscopic mean velocities in the fracture we consider fully developed velocity profiles in the fracture which may render the solute transport process more accurate moreover the flow field maintains unchanged regardless of h fig 2 but the magnitude of u increases with pe because of enhanced pressure gradients fig 3 note that since no governing equation related to the fluid flow in the matrix was solved u v 0 everywhere in the matrix 3 2 transport process in the fracture matrix systems with varying h and pe conservative solute transport is mainly controlled by the advection and diffusion dispersion processes in the fracture matrix systems which in turn depend on h and pe maloszewski and zuber 1985 molinari et al 2015 nair and thampi 2012 yoon and kang 2021 here the evolutions of solute concentration fields at different snapshots t 0 25 0 5 1 2 8 32 128 pv for two cases with pe 102 fig 4 and pe 105 fig 5 including h 2 5 10 mm scenarios are exemplified to show the effects of h and pe on solute transport process upon which we find some noticeable transport features a the solutes at the center of the fracture domain transport faster than these located at the places near the fracture walls figs 4 and 5 clearly this preferential transport in fracture is merely caused by the advection following a parabolic velocity profile where the velocity magnitude decreases from the fracture center to the fracture wall fig 3 b over the course of traveling through fracture solutes simultaneously penetrate from the fracture walls perpendicularly into the matrix due to molecular diffusion at low pe regime pe 102 in fig 4 where the diffusion process is dominant the time scales of advection and diffusion in the fracture are relatively comparable to the time scale of diffusion in the matrix thus the matrix diffusion process might attenuate the concentration in the fracture which leads to a noticeable increase of solute concentration in the matrix moreover the solutes would have a larger chance to fully sample a thin matrix domain than that for a relative thick matrix domain fig 4 therefore it takes a much less time for the case with h b 2 1 dimensionless time scale t 8 pv to be roughly saturated with solutes than that for the case with h b 10 1 t 128 pv c in contrast at advection dominated situation when pe 105 fig 5 the time scale of transport in the fracture is much shorter than the time scale of diffusion in the matrix consequently solutes barely have chances to diffuse into matrix which is supported by the fact that the noticeable concentration only exists in the limited matrix area even at a large dimensionless time scale e g t 128 pv fig 5 however this transport phenomenon due to matrix diffusion at high pe regime can sustain a heavy tailing behavior at a longer time scale than the cases with a relatively small pe as further discussed below figs 6 and 7 3 3 features of breakthrough curves for the fracture matrix systems the presence of matrix and transport regime had a significant influence on the solute transport and corresponding btcs which led to the retardation of solute and the enhanced non fickian transport characteristics to better understand the late time tailing of btcs following the previous studies nowamooz et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 we plotted 1 c against t on the logarithmic scale in fig 6 where different cases with pe 102 103 104 and 105 for all eight h scenarios h 0 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 mm were exemplified such that the effects of h and pe on non fickian transport can be well examined when pe is relatively small pe 102 103 104 the degree of late time tailing of btcs increases significantly with h fig 6a c suggesting enhanced effects of matrix diffusion on the tailing process of solute transport this is because the time scale of solute transport in fracture is roughly on the same order of magnitude as that in matrix thus increasing h would significantly reduce the degree of solute saturation in the matrix by trapping more solutes causing the delay of the overall solute transport in the fracture matrix system for the advection dominated case when pe 105 we find that the late time tailing of btcs is almost identical regardless of variation in h except for the case in the absence of matrix diffusion i e h 0 fig 6d again this indicates that the time scale of transport in fractures is orders of magnitude shorter than that in matrix due to diffusion where h has trivial effects on the late time transport behavior we additionally re organized the plots in fig s2 in the supplementary materials to demonstrate the effects of pe on solute transport with a given h b ratio in the absence of matrix fig s2a the non fickian transport exhibits at high pe regime because the transport has not reached asymptotic regime due to limited spatial and temporal scales dentz and carrera 2007 wang et al 2012 for the cases when h is small h b 0 0 5 1 2 10 the degree of non fickian behavior i e heavy tailing increases with pe when h is sufficiently large i e h b 50 in fig s2f we observe a persistent non fickian transport regardless of pe which can be possibly explained by the classic theory of matrix diffusion with an infinite matrix domain maloszewski and zuber 1985 3 4 late time power law tailing in solute residence time distributions the rtds would typically show a dramatic drop off after the peak rather than the power law tailing if fickian transport prevails cardenas et al 2007 cardenas et al 2009 however the presence of matrix surrounding fractures would expectedly lead to the late time solute tailing due to significant matrix diffusion houseworth et al 2013 khafagy et al 2021 causing the dramatic drop off become a power law decay at the late time rtds this phenomenon is clearly supported by our direct numerical simulation results fig 7 and fig s3 in the supplementary materials to quantify the degree of solute tailing a power law function was fitted to the late time portion of the rtds the smaller n is the significant tailing behavior would be for the diffusion dominated cases with pe 102 and pe 103 the decay exponent n for the power law function decreases significantly with increasing h that is n declines from 23 51 to 1 5 fig 7a and b this is somehow expected and congruent with the classical model of matrix diffusion for a uniform flow in a single fracture adjacent to a semi infinite matrix where n 1 5 maloszewski and zuber 1985 tsang 1995 when advection is dominated in fracture with pe 105 n n 1 5 is almost identical for all h scenarios fig 7d alternatively when h is small h b 0 0 5 1 2 n decreases from 23 51 to the theoretical value of 1 5 with the increase of pe fig s3 as h is sufficiently large e g h b 50 the power law of the rtds is close to 1 5 regardless of the magnitude of pe another remarkable feature in the rtds is that the power law tailing exponent would change or even switch to the exponential decay when the matrix diffusion effects diminish fig 7 and fig s3 the change of n occurs over time when either h is small or the transport regimes in the fracture is diffusion dominated i e pe is sufficiently small which is consistent with previous studies cardenas et al 2009 wang et al 2020 although the change of n is well acknowledged the fundamental mechanisms causing this behavior are poorly understood here we hypothesize that the magnitude of solute mass diffusion into immobile zone i e matrix in this study contributes to the change of n over time which is discussed in details as shown below 3 5 exchange flux between fracture and matrix we further estimated the solute exchange flux qc between fracture and matrix for all 70 cases excluding cases with h 0 here the exemplified cases with pe 102 103 104 and 105 and h 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 and 50 mm are demonstrated in fig 8 as expected the late time change of qc is consistent with that of rtds fig 7 to support the above mentioned hypothesis we took the time derivative of qc to determine the inflection point when the slope of qc t fluctuated 2 compared to the sustained slope i e power law portion which is demonstrated by the black hollow circles in fig 8 similarly we applied the same criterion to find the inflection point for the rtds black circles in fig 7 when plotting the time of inflection point for qc t timeflux curves against that for rtds timertd we find that these two time scales coincidently overlap following the 1 1 line fig 9 for the cases we studied here hence our study for the first time finds that the tailing of rtds is tightly dependent on the solute mass exchange between matrix and fracture via diffusion 4 prediction of power law tailing exponent n based on coupling effects of h and pe 4 1 the polynomial function between n and h pe based on 2 d numerical results above we systematically identified the coupling effects of h and pe on the late time solute transport and quantified n for 80 cases with varying h and pe to facilitate the prediction of n without taking much effort on running direct numerical simulations we fitted a surface to the numerically derived 70 points excluding cases with h 0 at the h b pe space via the matlab fitting toolbox such that a polynomial function between n and h b pe was established with r2 0 96 following 11 f x y 26 59 13 9 x 16 26 y 2 65 x 2 4 89 x y 6 20 y 2 0 18 x 3 0 38 x 2 y 0 69 x y 2 1 24 y 3 where x represents log10 pe and y represents log10 h b the above function explicitly describes the coupling effects of h and pe on n given that b is constant specifically when h or pe are sufficiently large n is close to the theoretical value of 1 5 moreover n decreases with an increase of h and pe with the aid of polynomial function and knowledge of the dimensionless thickness of matrix h b and transport regimes pe the late time solute tailing can be efficiently predicted without having to running difficult physical and numerical experiments 4 2 validation of polynomial function for predicting n in a 3 d fracture matrix system the established polynomial function between n and h b pe facilitates a quick assessment of late time solute tailing however some questions remain unaddressed for the broad application of established function a is the function valid considering realistic fracture heterogeneity b can we use the polynomial function for the 3 d fracture matrix system to answer the above mentioned questions we further conducted a direct numerical simulation in a 3 d heterogeneous fracture matrix system where h b 23 36 pe 886 70 this specific 3 d case was used to validate the established polynomial function like 2 d simulations we solved the naiver stokes equations in the fracture for fluid flow the zero velocity was imposed everywhere in the matrix moreover the advection diffusion and diffusion equations were solved in 3 d heterogeneous fracture and matrix respectively the solute transport snapshots clearly show the matrix diffusion process fig 11 more details of numerical simulations can be found at another submitted manuscript based on the 3 d numerical solutions we evaluated the power law exponent n 1 76 by fitting the power law function to the late time portion of rtd where the effect of matrix diffusion is prominent the 3 d result with determined n was projected to the h b pe space in fig 10 i e the red solid point the overlap of red point and the fitted polynomial function fig 10 suggests that the established polynomial function is robust for capturing the late time tailing behavior in the heterogeneous 3 d fracture matrix system this confirms the polynomial function is potentially applicable and promising for realistic fracture matrix systems 5 implications and limitations of the prediction of n the heavy tailing of btcs and rtds is a demonstration of non fickian transport phenomenon which also influences the interpretation of effective velocity and dispersion coefficient wang et al 2015 in the macroscopic ade for the well posed fracture matrix systems where the fully developed velocity in the fracture and advection dispersion processes in the matrix are considered ling et al 2021 developed a semi analytical solution for the solute concentration based on the generalized integral transform technique they also found that the 2 d case with b l 1 can be simplified by the 1 d system where the macroscopic ade with effective dispersion coefficient is applicable however the semi analytical solution gets worse at high pe regime our numerical results can supplement the semi analytical solution by covering a broad range of pe as such the transport tailing behavior and effective transport parameters can be both accurately quantified a possible future work can be done by establishing a relationship between n and transport parameters although the numerical solutions are accurate to some extent the numerical configuration considered here is extremely simplified compared to the realistic geological settings geiger et al 2010 hyman and dentz 2021 i e factures are interconnected within a network additionally the porous matrix is heterogeneous with spatially variable hydraulic conductivity given the simplified geometry our work based on the simplified single fracture matrix interaction serves as the baby step for understanding transport in complex fractured rocks for example the prediction of n can help to decipher the field site transport experiments where a dominant single fracture was assumed to be existent becker and shapiro 2000 hoffmann et al 2020 more future works are needed to honor the important role of topological fracture networks and matrix heterogeneity in controlling effective transport parameters and tailing behavior especially when the fully developed velocity fields in the fracture and matrix systems are considered 6 conclusions we systematically investigated the effects of rock matrix thickness h and transport regimes characterized by peclet number pe on the non fickian transport in two dimensional 2 d and three dimensional 3 d fracture matrix systems via 81 direct numerical simulations the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the non fickian transport characterized by the late time tailing of breakthrough curves or residence time distributions is noticeable due to matrix diffusion where the power law function with a determined exponent n can be used to fit the tailing behavior 2 n is found to decrease with an increase of h and pe spanning from 23 51 without effects of matrix diffusion to the theoretical value of 1 5 when h is assumed to be infinite large 3 the dynamic variations of n over time in describing c t n can be fundamentally attributed to the changes of solute mass exchange across the fracture matrix interface where c is concentration t is time 4 the established polynomial function between n and h pe is robust for capturing the late time solute tailing in residence time distributions for 2 d and 3 d fracture matrix systems when matrix diffusion is prominent 5 this study provides a promising method for quickly assessing non fickian transport with the knowledge of h and pe via the newly established polynomial function declaration of

2636,solute transport process in fractured rocks is central to many engineering applications however how matrix diffusion affects non fickian transport behavior which is typically characterized by the late time tailing in breakthrough curves and residence time distributions remains underexplored especially considering the coupling effects of the finite matrix thickness h and transport regimes quantified by peclet number pe in this work the fluid flow and solute transport were simulated by directly solving the navier stokes equations and advection diffusion equation in a two dimensional fracture matrix system considering matrix diffusion in total eighty cases considering variations of h and pe were conducted to investigate the impacts of h and pe on the late time solute tailing characterized by the exponent n in the power law function numerical results demonstrate that n decreases with an increase of h and pe where n eventually reduces to 1 5 that is a theoretical value for an infinite matrix domain moreover the relationship between n and h pe is established via a polynomial function which is further validated by the three dimensional heterogeneous fracture matrix system the newly established function can be used to accurately assess the power law tailing process given the knowledge of measurable h and pe keywords solute transport fracture matrix interactions finite matrix transport tailing advection diffusion equation direct numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction fractures are ubiquitously present in geological formations due to weathering and tectonic processes candela et al 2012 compared to the rock matrix fractures are expected to have a much higher permeability serving as the predominant pathways for the migration of fluids and solutes consequently fluid flow and solute transport in fractures are critical to understanding many geophysical processes and determining the success of engineering applications especially in low permeable subsurface cardenas et al 2007 goodman 1976 jing 2003 examples include but are not limited to geothermal exploitation chen et al 2018 pruess 2006 oil and gas recovery berg et al 2008 christensen and tanino 2017 groundwater contamination remediation huyakorn et al 1994 yang et al 2013 geological nuclear waste disposal bodvarsson et al 1999 and subsurface co2 sequestration szulczewski et al 2012 wang and cardenas 2017 wang and cardenas 2018 compared to fluid flow in fractures solute transport is more complex because the transport process is determined not only by the advection along with fluid flow but also by the complexity induced by diffusion and dispersion processes in the fracture and matrix bodin et al 2003a traditionally solute transport is assumed to follow fickian behaviors that can be described by the well known advection dispersion equation ade however extensive field and experimental results reported significant deviations between the measured breakthrough curves btcs and the numerical results obtained using the ade gouze et al 2008 levy and berkowitz 2003 neretnieks et al 1982 i e the presence of non fickian transport phenomenon more specifically in these analyses the ade did not capture the non fickian behavior exemplified in the early breakthrough times and late time tailing dou and zhou 2015 gouze et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 the widely observed non fickian transport phenomena in fractured rocks are fundamentally attributed to the interplay of advection and dispersion diffusion processes which are further determined by many physical and chemical factors till now there are several mechanisms are proposed to explain non fickian transport including 1 pronounced heterogeneity resulted in preferential flow paths hyman 2020 hyman et al 2019a painter et al 2002 2 the transport has not reached the fickian regime due to limited spatial and temporal scales bouquain et al 2012 wang and cardenas 2014 wang et al 2012 3 the mass transfer between mobile and immobile or slow flowing zones e g diffusion into and out of the rock matrix or recirculation zones becker and shapiro 2000 comolli et al 2016 shapiro 2001 wang et al 2020 4 the injection modes of solutes frampton and cvetkovic 2009 kang et al 2020 5 the flow and transport regimes cardenas et al 2009 nissan and berkowitz 2018 and 6 the absorption of solutes on fracture wall and matrix rock hölttä et al 2001 here we focus exclusively on the effects of matrix diffusion on non fickian solute transport in fractures with different transport regimes in fact numerous studies have demonstrated that solute diffusion into the matrix can result in the heavy tailing of breakthrough curves btcs typical of non fickian transport for example grisak and pickens 1980a grisak and pickens 1980b studied the role of matrix diffusion in controlling the tailing behavior of trace btcs through laboratory tracer experiments and numerical simulations novakowski and lapcevic 1994 carried out a solute transport tracer experiment in the fractured rock at the stripa mining area they found that the tracer had entered the undisturbed pore skeleton over the course of passing through the disturbed area confirming the existence of matrix diffusion at a natural field site jardine et al 1999 conducted a long term tracer experiment on a natural fracture area oak ridge tennessee and concluded that the tracer gradually diffused into the surrounding shale matrix indeed many studies indisputably support the influence of matrix diffusion on solute transport especially when the matrix porosity is large huyakorn et al 1983 park et al 2001 sidle et al 1998 in theory the signature of matrix diffusion on tracer btcs is a late time tailing process characterized by a power law decay of late time concentration c i e c t n grisak and pickens 1981 haggerty et al 2000 hyman et al 2019b maloszewski and zuber 1985 tsang 1995 where t is time n is decay exponent for an idealized parallel plate fracture and a homogeneous matrix the late time decay exponent n has been theoretically determined to be 1 5 when the matrix is infinitely large maloszewski and zuber 1985 tang et al 1981 tsang 1995 however some tracer tests in fractured rocks exhibit btcs with sustained power law tails but their exponents deviate from 1 5 so far a broad range of power law exponents n have been observed depending on the field site and experimental conditions becker and shapiro 2003 gouze et al 2008 hyman et al 2019b kang et al 2015 for instance haggerty et al 2001 haggerty et al 2000 showed that btcs from the single well injection withdrawal tests at the waste isolation pilot plant wipp dolomite site clearly exhibited sustained power law tails with n ranging between 2 1 and 2 2 becker and shapiro 2003 showed that the late time tailing of btcs at the mirror lake granite site followed a power law with n around 2 tsang 1995 used tracers to study solute transport in fractures showing that matrix diffusion would significantly enhance the late time tailing process compared to no matrix diffusion case where n 1 5 was recovered following the theory in short a wide range of n has been reported based on field experiments but the driving mechanisms of such phenomena need to be carefully examined and investigated especially when n significantly deviates from 1 5 that cannot be simply explained by the matrix diffusion when assuming matrix domain is infinite large to fill the knowledge gap in understanding the deviation of n from 1 5 this study for the first time explicitly investigates the coupling effects of finite matrix domain size and peclet number pe on causing the deviation of n to achieve this goal we employed direct numerical simulations that directly solved fluid flow in the fracture via the navier stokes equations along with a specified zero velocity in the matrix the transport was solved in the fracture via the advection diffusion equation and in the matrix via the diffusion equation a series of two dimensional 2 d single parallel plates matrix systems with diverse matrix thicknesses h and transport regimes pe were considered to balance the tractability and transport complexity numerical solutions were used to assess and quantify the behavior of n in response to the h and pe finally the prediction of n was further validated based on a three dimensional 3 d fracture matrix system when matrix diffusion is present it should be noted that some analytical or semi analytical solutions are available for the simplified configurations we studied here bodin et al 2003a ling et al 2021 roubinet et al 2012 however these solutions either neglect the fully developed parabolic velocity profile in the fracture sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 or there are some estimation errors that semi analytical solution cannot handle under the circumstance of high velocity regime i e high pe regime ling et al 2021 these estimation errors might significantly undermine the prediction of n considering that the late time concentration is normally small that magnifies the effects of estimation errors thus we consistently used numerical simulations rather than using analytical or semi analytical solutions to investigate the effects of pe on solute transport especially on the late time tailing phenomenon that has not been systematically studied yet 2 methodology bodin et al 2003a bodin et al 2003a provided a comprehensive review of key physical mechanisms in fracture matrix interaction systems mainly including solute advection and dispersion in the fracture matrix diffusion from the fracture into the matrix fracture surface and matrix sorption decay and chemical reactions here we only considered the advection and diffusion in the fracture and molecular diffusion in the surrounding matrix from the fracture surfaces to exclusively investigate the coupling effects of finite h and pe the numerical configuration neglecting advection and dispersion in the matrix is consistent with some previous studies bodin et al 2003a sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 recent studies proposed to include the influence of matrix velocity that is parallel to the fracture flow on solute transport process ling et al 2021 ling et al 2016 the inclusion of matrix velocity might impact the magnitude of n however we are not sure that this treatment of the matrix velocity is appropriate or not in realistic geological settings the velocity in the matrix might be complex e g fluid can penetrate across the interface of fracture matrix hence and for simplicity our study only considered molecular diffusion in the matrix 2 1 a simplified 2 d fracture matrix system to exclude effects of other factors especially fracture heterogeneity on solute transport the flow and solute transport simulations were done in a simplified fracture matrix system where the fracture is a parallel plate with a specified thickness of the surrounding matrix fig 1 specifically the constant aperture b for fracture is 1 mm the length of domain l is 150 mm that satisfies the length threshold for reaching asymptotic dispersion regime wang et al 2012 to identify the effects of finite h on solute transport we considered eight scenarios with h increasing from 0 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 and up to 50 mm fig 2 where h 0 indicates the case without molecular diffusion into matrix 2 2 fluid flow in the fracture governed by the naiver stokes equations the flow of isothermal incompressible and steady state single newtonian fluid in the fracture is governed by the navier stokes equations which represent mass and momentum conservation 1 u 0 2 ρ u u μ u p where u m s is velocity vector in the fracture and p pa is the total pressure with p pa m indicating pressure gradient the fluid properties of water were applied here ρ 1 103 kg m3 is the density and μ 1 10 3 pa s is the dynamic viscosity moreover since only molecular diffusion is considered in the matrix we simply specified velocity 0 m s in the matrix we applied dirichlet boundary conditions at the inlet left and outlet left boundaries of fracture that is a pressure gradient with a specified pressure p p0 at left and an open boundary at right p 0 pa drives fluid flow in the longitudinal direction figs 1 and 2 all other boundaries were set as either no flow or no slip walls the navier stokes equations with the specified boundary conditions were solved numerically using the finite element method implemented in comsol multiphysics we used a fine mesh size around the fracture and a coarse mesh size in the matrix results are not shown here eventually we had 0 1 million triangular elements for the fracture and 0 3 million triangular elements for the fracture matrix system convergence analysis for the size of element was conducted for each simulation using a series of successively refined grids until the solution became grid independent roache 1998 this was demonstrated by a specific case as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the results of the solved flow field served as the basis for simulating the solute transport process to examine the effects of finite matrix domain on solute transport the simulation scenarios with varying h fig 2 were implemented by comsol multiphysics moreover for each simulation scenario we systematically increased inlet pressure p0 to achieve different flow and transport regimes as further discussed below each run took about one hour on a memory shared workstation 2 3 direct numerical simulations for conservative solute transport conservative solute transport simulations for the fracture matrix system consists of advection diffusion in the fracture and pure diffusion in the matrix due to the absence of flow in the matrix fig 1 that is in the fracture domain we solved the ade following 3 c t u c d m c where c kg m3 is aqueous solute concentration t s is time and dm 2 03 10 9 m2 s is molecular diffusion coefficient for a conservative solute transport e g cl in water moreover the transport process in the matrix follows the diffusion equation 4 c t τ d m c where τ is tortuosity sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 due to tortuous pore geometry that follows the millington and quirk model with τ 1 θ 3 in comsol multiphysics where θ is porosity that was set to be 0 25 this tortuosity model has been widely used previously that is supposed to be applicable for a range of different soils the concentration field in the fracture matrix system was obtained by solving the eqs 3 4 with the given initial and boundary conditions fig 1 5 c x t 0 0 x l t 0 c x t c 0 x 0 t 0 c n 0 x l t 0 where n represents the normal direction to the outlet boundary equation 5 suggests that the fracture matrix system is initially free of solute the fracture inlet boundary assumes a step injection with c0 1 kg m3 and there is no diffusive flux at the fracture outlet note that all other boundaries were set as no flux walls in addition to the effects of finite matrix domain eight scenarios with different h the effects of transport regimes quantified by pe on solute transport were also diagnosed the pe is defined as 6 pe u b d m where u m s is mean longitudinal velocity in the fracture derived from flow simulations and b is fracture aperture fig 1 we achieved this by varying pressure gradients such that pe increased from 1 102 2 5 102 5 102 1 103 2 5 103 5 103 1 104 2 5 104 5 104 to 1 105 fig 3 where the range of pe follows the previous study yoon and kang 2021 in total we had ten different pe cases eight different h cases 80 numerical simulations all transport simulations were conducted in comsol multiphysics using the same meshing scheme as used for fluid flow simulations each run took about a few hours to 1 day that depending on the h and pe values 2 4 analysis of results of solute transport simulations after solving flow and transport simulations figs 4 and 5 the flux weighted concentration cf over time that constitutes the breakthrough curve btc was evaluated fig 6 the cf is defined by the ratio of effluent solute mass to fluid mass 7 c f 0 b u c d y 0 b u d y where u m s is longitudinal fluid velocity at the fracture outlet moreover the cf and time were further normalized to make btc comparable for 80 numerical simulations following 8 c c f c 0 9 t qt a where c is the normalized concentration t is the dimensionless time related to the pore volume pv q m2 s is the integrated flux at outlet and a m2 is area of the fracture the rtds serve as an alternative metric to assess the non fickian transport characteristics in the fracture matrix systems which were estimated by taking the time derivative of btcs considering the step injection boundary condition fig 7 next we fitted the power law function c t n to the numerically derived rtds using the late time of 100 points excluding the last 15 points or using the same time window fig 7 all the power law exponents were determined for 80 cases with varying h and pe lastly the relationship between n and h pe was established by fitting a constitutive function that facilitates the assessment of non fickian transport in fractures when matrix diffusion is present note that the solute exchange flux qc between the fracture and matrix can be also quantified based on the numerical results following 10 q c 0 l θ d m c y d x where l is length of fracture matrix interface 3 results and discussion on the coupling effects of finite matrix domain and pe on solute transport 3 1 flow field in the fracture matrix systems understanding the flow field in fractures is fundamental for studying the conservative solute transport for the sake of completeness the flow fields used in this study were introduced and discussed briefly consistent to the theoretical solution for the parallel plates model according to the cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 the numerically derived longitudinal velocity u follows a parabolic profile across the fracture whereas the transverse velocity v in the y direction is zero everywhere in the fracture fig 1 this supports the validity of numerical solutions in capturing the velocity field in the fracture in contrast to previous studies sudicky and frind 1982 that assumed macroscopic mean velocities in the fracture we consider fully developed velocity profiles in the fracture which may render the solute transport process more accurate moreover the flow field maintains unchanged regardless of h fig 2 but the magnitude of u increases with pe because of enhanced pressure gradients fig 3 note that since no governing equation related to the fluid flow in the matrix was solved u v 0 everywhere in the matrix 3 2 transport process in the fracture matrix systems with varying h and pe conservative solute transport is mainly controlled by the advection and diffusion dispersion processes in the fracture matrix systems which in turn depend on h and pe maloszewski and zuber 1985 molinari et al 2015 nair and thampi 2012 yoon and kang 2021 here the evolutions of solute concentration fields at different snapshots t 0 25 0 5 1 2 8 32 128 pv for two cases with pe 102 fig 4 and pe 105 fig 5 including h 2 5 10 mm scenarios are exemplified to show the effects of h and pe on solute transport process upon which we find some noticeable transport features a the solutes at the center of the fracture domain transport faster than these located at the places near the fracture walls figs 4 and 5 clearly this preferential transport in fracture is merely caused by the advection following a parabolic velocity profile where the velocity magnitude decreases from the fracture center to the fracture wall fig 3 b over the course of traveling through fracture solutes simultaneously penetrate from the fracture walls perpendicularly into the matrix due to molecular diffusion at low pe regime pe 102 in fig 4 where the diffusion process is dominant the time scales of advection and diffusion in the fracture are relatively comparable to the time scale of diffusion in the matrix thus the matrix diffusion process might attenuate the concentration in the fracture which leads to a noticeable increase of solute concentration in the matrix moreover the solutes would have a larger chance to fully sample a thin matrix domain than that for a relative thick matrix domain fig 4 therefore it takes a much less time for the case with h b 2 1 dimensionless time scale t 8 pv to be roughly saturated with solutes than that for the case with h b 10 1 t 128 pv c in contrast at advection dominated situation when pe 105 fig 5 the time scale of transport in the fracture is much shorter than the time scale of diffusion in the matrix consequently solutes barely have chances to diffuse into matrix which is supported by the fact that the noticeable concentration only exists in the limited matrix area even at a large dimensionless time scale e g t 128 pv fig 5 however this transport phenomenon due to matrix diffusion at high pe regime can sustain a heavy tailing behavior at a longer time scale than the cases with a relatively small pe as further discussed below figs 6 and 7 3 3 features of breakthrough curves for the fracture matrix systems the presence of matrix and transport regime had a significant influence on the solute transport and corresponding btcs which led to the retardation of solute and the enhanced non fickian transport characteristics to better understand the late time tailing of btcs following the previous studies nowamooz et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 we plotted 1 c against t on the logarithmic scale in fig 6 where different cases with pe 102 103 104 and 105 for all eight h scenarios h 0 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 mm were exemplified such that the effects of h and pe on non fickian transport can be well examined when pe is relatively small pe 102 103 104 the degree of late time tailing of btcs increases significantly with h fig 6a c suggesting enhanced effects of matrix diffusion on the tailing process of solute transport this is because the time scale of solute transport in fracture is roughly on the same order of magnitude as that in matrix thus increasing h would significantly reduce the degree of solute saturation in the matrix by trapping more solutes causing the delay of the overall solute transport in the fracture matrix system for the advection dominated case when pe 105 we find that the late time tailing of btcs is almost identical regardless of variation in h except for the case in the absence of matrix diffusion i e h 0 fig 6d again this indicates that the time scale of transport in fractures is orders of magnitude shorter than that in matrix due to diffusion where h has trivial effects on the late time transport behavior we additionally re organized the plots in fig s2 in the supplementary materials to demonstrate the effects of pe on solute transport with a given h b ratio in the absence of matrix fig s2a the non fickian transport exhibits at high pe regime because the transport has not reached asymptotic regime due to limited spatial and temporal scales dentz and carrera 2007 wang et al 2012 for the cases when h is small h b 0 0 5 1 2 10 the degree of non fickian behavior i e heavy tailing increases with pe when h is sufficiently large i e h b 50 in fig s2f we observe a persistent non fickian transport regardless of pe which can be possibly explained by the classic theory of matrix diffusion with an infinite matrix domain maloszewski and zuber 1985 3 4 late time power law tailing in solute residence time distributions the rtds would typically show a dramatic drop off after the peak rather than the power law tailing if fickian transport prevails cardenas et al 2007 cardenas et al 2009 however the presence of matrix surrounding fractures would expectedly lead to the late time solute tailing due to significant matrix diffusion houseworth et al 2013 khafagy et al 2021 causing the dramatic drop off become a power law decay at the late time rtds this phenomenon is clearly supported by our direct numerical simulation results fig 7 and fig s3 in the supplementary materials to quantify the degree of solute tailing a power law function was fitted to the late time portion of the rtds the smaller n is the significant tailing behavior would be for the diffusion dominated cases with pe 102 and pe 103 the decay exponent n for the power law function decreases significantly with increasing h that is n declines from 23 51 to 1 5 fig 7a and b this is somehow expected and congruent with the classical model of matrix diffusion for a uniform flow in a single fracture adjacent to a semi infinite matrix where n 1 5 maloszewski and zuber 1985 tsang 1995 when advection is dominated in fracture with pe 105 n n 1 5 is almost identical for all h scenarios fig 7d alternatively when h is small h b 0 0 5 1 2 n decreases from 23 51 to the theoretical value of 1 5 with the increase of pe fig s3 as h is sufficiently large e g h b 50 the power law of the rtds is close to 1 5 regardless of the magnitude of pe another remarkable feature in the rtds is that the power law tailing exponent would change or even switch to the exponential decay when the matrix diffusion effects diminish fig 7 and fig s3 the change of n occurs over time when either h is small or the transport regimes in the fracture is diffusion dominated i e pe is sufficiently small which is consistent with previous studies cardenas et al 2009 wang et al 2020 although the change of n is well acknowledged the fundamental mechanisms causing this behavior are poorly understood here we hypothesize that the magnitude of solute mass diffusion into immobile zone i e matrix in this study contributes to the change of n over time which is discussed in details as shown below 3 5 exchange flux between fracture and matrix we further estimated the solute exchange flux qc between fracture and matrix for all 70 cases excluding cases with h 0 here the exemplified cases with pe 102 103 104 and 105 and h 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 and 50 mm are demonstrated in fig 8 as expected the late time change of qc is consistent with that of rtds fig 7 to support the above mentioned hypothesis we took the time derivative of qc to determine the inflection point when the slope of qc t fluctuated 2 compared to the sustained slope i e power law portion which is demonstrated by the black hollow circles in fig 8 similarly we applied the same criterion to find the inflection point for the rtds black circles in fig 7 when plotting the time of inflection point for qc t timeflux curves against that for rtds timertd we find that these two time scales coincidently overlap following the 1 1 line fig 9 for the cases we studied here hence our study for the first time finds that the tailing of rtds is tightly dependent on the solute mass exchange between matrix and fracture via diffusion 4 prediction of power law tailing exponent n based on coupling effects of h and pe 4 1 the polynomial function between n and h pe based on 2 d numerical results above we systematically identified the coupling effects of h and pe on the late time solute transport and quantified n for 80 cases with varying h and pe to facilitate the prediction of n without taking much effort on running direct numerical simulations we fitted a surface to the numerically derived 70 points excluding cases with h 0 at the h b pe space via the matlab fitting toolbox such that a polynomial function between n and h b pe was established with r2 0 96 following 11 f x y 26 59 13 9 x 16 26 y 2 65 x 2 4 89 x y 6 20 y 2 0 18 x 3 0 38 x 2 y 0 69 x y 2 1 24 y 3 where x represents log10 pe and y represents log10 h b the above function explicitly describes the coupling effects of h and pe on n given that b is constant specifically when h or pe are sufficiently large n is close to the theoretical value of 1 5 moreover n decreases with an increase of h and pe with the aid of polynomial function and knowledge of the dimensionless thickness of matrix h b and transport regimes pe the late time solute tailing can be efficiently predicted without having to running difficult physical and numerical experiments 4 2 validation of polynomial function for predicting n in a 3 d fracture matrix system the established polynomial function between n and h b pe facilitates a quick assessment of late time solute tailing however some questions remain unaddressed for the broad application of established function a is the function valid considering realistic fracture heterogeneity b can we use the polynomial function for the 3 d fracture matrix system to answer the above mentioned questions we further conducted a direct numerical simulation in a 3 d heterogeneous fracture matrix system where h b 23 36 pe 886 70 this specific 3 d case was used to validate the established polynomial function like 2 d simulations we solved the naiver stokes equations in the fracture for fluid flow the zero velocity was imposed everywhere in the matrix moreover the advection diffusion and diffusion equations were solved in 3 d heterogeneous fracture and matrix respectively the solute transport snapshots clearly show the matrix diffusion process fig 11 more details of numerical simulations can be found at another submitted manuscript based on the 3 d numerical solutions we evaluated the power law exponent n 1 76 by fitting the power law function to the late time portion of rtd where the effect of matrix diffusion is prominent the 3 d result with determined n was projected to the h b pe space in fig 10 i e the red solid point the overlap of red point and the fitted polynomial function fig 10 suggests that the established polynomial function is robust for capturing the late time tailing behavior in the heterogeneous 3 d fracture matrix system this confirms the polynomial function is potentially applicable and promising for realistic fracture matrix systems 5 implications and limitations of the prediction of n the heavy tailing of btcs and rtds is a demonstration of non fickian transport phenomenon which also influences the interpretation of effective velocity and dispersion coefficient wang et al 2015 in the macroscopic ade for the well posed fracture matrix systems where the fully developed velocity in the fracture and advection dispersion processes in the matrix are considered ling et al 2021 developed a semi analytical solution for the solute concentration based on the generalized integral transform technique they also found that the 2 d case with b l 1 can be simplified by the 1 d system where the macroscopic ade with effective dispersion coefficient is applicable however the semi analytical solution gets worse at high pe regime our numerical results can supplement the semi analytical solution by covering a broad range of pe as such the transport tailing behavior and effective transport parameters can be both accurately quantified a possible future work can be done by establishing a relationship between n and transport parameters although the numerical solutions are accurate to some extent the numerical configuration considered here is extremely simplified compared to the realistic geological settings geiger et al 2010 hyman and dentz 2021 i e factures are interconnected within a network additionally the porous matrix is heterogeneous with spatially variable hydraulic conductivity given the simplified geometry our work based on the simplified single fracture matrix interaction serves as the baby step for understanding transport in complex fractured rocks for example the prediction of n can help to decipher the field site transport experiments where a dominant single fracture was assumed to be existent becker and shapiro 2000 hoffmann et al 2020 more future works are needed to honor the important role of topological fracture networks and matrix heterogeneity in controlling effective transport parameters and tailing behavior especially when the fully developed velocity fields in the fracture and matrix systems are considered 6 conclusions we systematically investigated the effects of rock matrix thickness h and transport regimes characterized by peclet number pe on the non fickian transport in two dimensional 2 d and three dimensional 3 d fracture matrix systems via 81 direct numerical simulations the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the non fickian transport characterized by the late time tailing of breakthrough curves or residence time distributions is noticeable due to matrix diffusion where the power law function with a determined exponent n can be used to fit the tailing behavior 2 n is found to decrease with an increase of h and pe spanning from 23 51 without effects of matrix diffusion to the theoretical value of 1 5 when h is assumed to be infinite large 3 the dynamic variations of n over time in describing c t n can be fundamentally attributed to the changes of solute mass exchange across the fracture matrix interface where c is concentration t is time 4 the established polynomial function between n and h pe is robust for capturing the late time solute tailing in residence time distributions for 2 d and 3 d fracture matrix systems when matrix diffusion is prominent 5 this study provides a promising method for quickly assessing non fickian transport with the knowledge of h and pe via the newly established polynomial function declaration of

2637,the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and follow on grace fo missions offer great potential for large scale flood event monitoring however the effectiveness of current grace based

hirabayashi et al 2013 as one of the most destructive natural hazards flood has caused a lot of casualties and economic losses worldwide during the last decades lee et al 2020 there is an urgent need to better monitor flood events to promote sustainable development traditionally flood monitoring relies on in situ gauge station observations but generally it is difficult to effectively monitor large scale flood risk due to the sparse distribution of hydrological stations the development of hydrological models global reanalysis datasets and remote sensing has made it possible to monitor floods on a large scale dubey and singh 2021 lópez et al 2020 pandi et al 2021 hydrological models detail terrestrial water storage tws components but lack verification from in situ gauges famiglietti and rodell 2013 combined with in situ gauge observations global reanalysis datasets feature uninterrupted regional coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution however their performance varies spatially because of the uncertainty of the prediction model data assimilation and data source zhang et al 2020 synthetic aperture radars optical remote sensing and rain radars provide data from shallow soil moisture water surfaces and rainfall ahamed and bolten 2017 reager and famiglietti 2009 surampudi and yarrakula 2020 which play a significant role in flood monitoring and forecasting however flood monitoring and forecasting should be based not only on meteorological information but also on the saturation state of flood prone areas prior to rainfall reager and famiglietti 2009 nevertheless neither optical microwave remote sensors nor radar can monitor regional tws the joint national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center dlr gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission and its continuing legacy the grace follow on grace fo provide a solution for this limitation the monthly gravity field around earth s surface estimated by grace can be transformed into terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 1998 yeh et al 2006 grace fo twsa comprises anomalies from surface water storage soil water and underground water and can estimate the regional water saturation associated with flood prone areas previous studies have found that the grace fo twsa responds well to flood events chao and wang 2017 chen et al 2010 idowu and zhou 2019 and therefore grace could serve as a solution for large scale flood monitoring over the last decade several grace based indices have been developed to monitor floods reager and famiglietti 2009 developed the flood potential index fpi which uses the precipitation and grace fo twsa to assess flood potential i e the amount of water that precipitation exceeds the potential water storage long et al 2014 used the fpi to monitor floods in the yunnan guizhou plateau and the results showed the value of the fpi for flood forecasts and damage evaluation yirdaw et al 2008 developed the total storage deficit index tsdi which was originally proposed for drought monitoring and can also be used for floods monitoring for example chen et al 2018 used tsdi to analyze flood events in the liao river basin and found that its results were largely consistent with historical observations in addition two improved index storage deficit indices based on the tsdi namely the water storage deficit index wsdi sun et al 2018 and the combined climatologic deviation index ccdi satish kumar et al 2021 have also been applied to flood events identification nigatu et al 2021 according to the calculation principle these indices mainly rely on capturing the characteristics of grace fo twsa signals to identify floods the grace fo twsa signal can be decomposed into a long term trend an interannual term a semiannual term and a residual signal scanlon et al 2016 floods are usually driven by seasonal precipitation which is shown in grace fo twsa as annual semiannual and residual signals if the twsa in a region has a significant long term trend the annual semiannual and residual signals will be relatively weaker these grace based indices mentioned above cannot distinguish long term trend from annual semiannual signals hence it can be assumed that their performance will deteriorate over time some studies have found the impact of long term trend signals when using grace fo twsa for drought monitoring hosseini moghari et al 2019 noted that in basins with excessive water withdrawal the long term trend of twsa showed a continuous decline in this case tsdi introduces a declining trend from twsa and tend to misclassify early drought event into normal or wet years they proposed the modified total storage deficit index mtsdi in which grace fo twsa is replaced by grace fo twsa residuals without periodic terms and long term trend the evaluation results showed that mtsdi can effectively improve the monitoring ability of drought events compared with drought flood is the other side of extreme hydrology and the problems faced in monitoring floods and droughts are similar to each other when flood index is used for flood monitoring based on grace fo twsa data it is also necessary to solve the identification errors caused by significant long term trends at present it has been found that many large basins worldwide have a significant downward trend of grace fo twsa due to climate change or human activities rodell et al 2018 such as ganges brahmaputra and indus river basins where grace fo twsa decreases gradually due to significant irrigation intensity scanlon et al 2016 however floods in these basins are still often seen devrani et al 2022 dubey et al 2021 dubey and singh 2021 gogoi et al 2020 lal et al 2020 surampudi and yarrakula 2020 especially in the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river basin ybrb the basin experiences frequent floods hossain et al 2019 which negatively impact the local populations in this context the limitations of the traditional flood index will become more prominent and it is valuable to develop a more reliable flood monitoring index this study aimed to develop a modified flood potential index mfpi which removes the long term trend of twsa thus it improves the flood monitoring ability of grace based flood indices in the area with significant tws depletion a case study was carried out in the ybrb to evaluate the performance of the mfpi considering that the grace fo data gap problem may affect the analysis of the long term trend of twsa we first use an artificial neural network model to fill the data gap to obtain a continuous and long term twsa data series on this basis the mfpi and five other indices fpi tsdi wsdi ccdi and mtsdi are calculated and their monitoring capabilities for flood events are compared this study can provide a reference for the application of grace data in flood monitoring 2 study area the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river ybr has the fourth highest average discharge in the world with an average annual discharge of approximately 20 000 m3s 1 immerzeel 2008 pervez and henebry 2015 the ybr originates from the gyima yangzoin glacier on the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2021 and flows through china bhutan india and bangladesh with a total length of 2 900 km ji et al 2020 the ybrb drains diverse environments including the dry and cold tibetan plateau rain

of which were categorized under the level of devastating catastrophes hossain et al 2021 in assam 10 000 km2 of land is affected by floods every year valdiya 1999 floods were the most severe in 1998 inundating an area of 38 000 km2 and threatening the lives and property of approximately 12 5 million people devrani et al 2022 effective monitoring of regional flood risks can significantly reduce

april 2002 to june 2017 and grace fo may 2018 to march 2021 twsa products were resampled into a 0 25 grid by nearest neighbor interpolation hardy et al 2017 hasan and tarhule 2021 sadeghi et al 2020 in addition some data are missing in grace fo including missing data that occur approximately every six months in the grace fo era 23 months in total with 11 during the monsoon season of the ybrb from jun sep see fig s1 in supporting information and the data gap between grace and grace fo for the former data missing we interpolated the 1 2 months of missing data by cubic spline chen et al 2020 mu 2018 wouters et al 2019 which is better able to retain the characteristic of positive negative peaks than linear interpolation and for the latter data gap we performed filling by the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network mlp ann simulation see section 3 2 1 the three types of grace fo twsa were in good agreement with each other in the ybrb fig s2 with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 979 to most effectively reduce the noise in the gravity field solution within the available scatter of the solution sakumura et al 2014 the ensemble mean of the nine grace fo twsa products was used as the grace fo twsa in this study 3 1 2 external inputs for the mlp ann network precipitation is a direct influencing factor which is the most important tws input whereas temperature which is

noah the variable infiltration capacity vic and the community land model clm the mosaic in gldas v001 was removed from gldas 2 because gldas does not consider groundwater the sum of the snow water equivalent vegetation canopy water and soil water from the model output was used as the model tws outputs and twsa is computed by removing the baseline from 2004 to 2009 the twsa from noah vic clm and the three model mean were in good agreement with the grace fo twsa fig s3 with correlation coefficients of 0 88 0 86 0 87 and 0 94 respectively the correlation coefficient of the three model mean is the highest and is used as another external input to the mlp ann model called gldas twsa it was resampled to a 0 25 grid cell by nearest neighbor interpolation covering april 2002 march 2021 3 1 3 discharge discharge observations from the bahadurabad station were used to identify flood events in the ybrb and then served as the basis for evaluating the performance of each index because the in situ gauge observations only cover april 2002 to december 2016 the discharge data output from the global flood awareness system glofas harrigan et al 2021 model was used to append the discharge data

accessed on 22 march 2022 and the spatial resolution of 0 1 was resampled to 0 25 by nearest neighbor interpolation the consistency between glofas and in situ discharge has also been checked the results showed that glofas has a good agreement with in situ discharge performing nse 0 88 r 0 94 rmse 30 39 mm mae 22 02 mm fig s6 proving the reasonability to append in situ discharge by glofas 3 2 method fig 2 presents the proposed framework for developing the mfpi for the ybrb the grace data period covers april 2002 to june 2017 and the grace fo data period covers june 2018 to march 2021 thus a 11 months data gap occurs between the two missions to obtain a continuous 19 year grace fo twsa series the data gap was firstly filled using an mlp ann that took precipitation temperature and gldas twsa as the inputs then based on the gap filled grace fo twsa the performance of the mfpi was developed and compared with that of current flood indices using the accuracy rate acc the area under the

3 2 1 mlp ann mlp ann as a kind of machine learning algorithm has been successfully used in the grace twsa series gap filling and prediction abhishek et al 2022 abhishek et al 2021 long et al 2014 considering its reported good efficiency it was also selected in this study the mlp ann models have three parts the inputs layer hidden layer and outputs layer and its structure is shown in fig s4 the mlp ann models built in this study have one hidden layer and output grace fo twsa prediction the number of neurons in hidden layer was determined by bayesian parameter optimization which is a model based hyperparameter optimization method bayesian parameter optimization method can achieve better performance on the test set while requiring fewer iterations than random search and network search and it has been widely applied to machine learning hyperparameter choosing sun et al 2021 wunsch et al 2021 the training period is between april 2002 and july 2015 75 samples 160 months the validation is from august 2015 to june 2017 10 samples 23 months and the testing period is from june 2018 to march 2021 15 samples 34 months and prediction period is the grace data gap july 2017 to may 2018 11 months the validation period was used to screen for the best model and the testing period was used to test the generalization ability of the model since the trend term of twsa is affected by both climate change and human activities and the input variables are mainly climate parameters it is possible to lose sight of the part of human activities impact during the simulation process many current studies on the grace fo data gap filling tried removing the trend of grace fo twsa before making predictions table 3 and obtained better predictions mo et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 referring to this strategy we removed the long term trend from the simulation inputs p t gldas twsa and target grace fo twsa of mlp ann finally the long term trend was added back to the reconstructed

on the fpi to improve flood monitoring ability in the tws depletion basin based on grace twsa the fpi takes precipitation as the water storage input and the difference between the maximum and the previous month s twsa is the potential water storage equation s1 when precipitation exceeds the potential water storage the basin is at risk of flooding however the fpi may have limitations when twsa has a significant long term trend for example if the twsa trend declines the fpi will also decline but the real flood risk might not decline as the long term trend dclines this study replaced the twsa with a detrended twsa to construct an mfpi for flood event monitoring the detrended twsa removed the long term trend of the twsa signal the fpi considers that flood risk is influenced by precipitation and twsa the mfpi keeps the same principle but removes the long term trend of twsa and remains a periodical and residual signal of twsa the mfpi equation 6 8 is as follows 6 mfpa i p i m a x twsa detrend twsa detrend i 1 7 tws a detrend t w s a twsa long t e r m t r e n d 8 m fpi i mfpa i m a x m f p a where mfpa i represents the modified flood potential amount tws a detrend indicates the twsa signal after removing the long term trend p i represents precipitation m a x represents a maximum function subscript i represents the ith month in grace fo era april 2002 march 2021 to assess the effectiveness of the mfpi other grace based indices that can be used for flood monitoring are also calculated for comparison such as the fpi the tsdi wsdi and ccdi the mtsdi which also adopted detrended twsa performs better for monitoring drought events hosseini moghari et al 2019 but its ability to monitor flood events has not previously been discussed therefore the mtsdi was also chosen for comparison in this study the equations for the five indices are shown in supporting information equation s1 15 in text s1 3 2 3 evaluation indices for flood monitoring ability in this study a confusion matrix table 2 of the discharge flood identification and index flood identification was used to quantify the flood monitoring capability of the grace based indices first discharge observations at the bahadurabad station were divided into three levels of floods namely the 85th 90th and 95th percentiles to identify flood events based on discharge although high discharge does not necessarily result in flooding it can indicate a high flood risk the use of discharge to identify flood levels has also been applied in other studies on the grace flood monitoring index gupta and dhanya 2020 xiong et al 2021 the average value of the six indices for individual level flood events was then calculated as the identification thresholds of the index gupta and dhanya 2020 xiong et al 2021 and the flood events were identified by them then the confusion matrix for flood identification was built based on the discharge identified and index identified flood events finally the flood identifying capability of the flood indices at the corresponding thresholds is evaluated by the acc precision recall also named true positive rate tpr and auc as following equations 9 11 slaby 2007 9 acc tp t n tp t n f p f n 10 precision t p t p f p 11 recall t p r tp t p f n where tp represents the number of months in which both the index and discharge are identified as flood fp represents the number of months that the index identified as flood but the discharge identified as non flood fn represents the number of months that the index identified as non flood but the discharge identified as flood and tn represents the number of months that both the index and discharge identified as non flood acc responds to the accuracy of the index for both flood and non flood event identification precision describes the rate of real floods out of the floods identified by the flood index the recall or tpr describes the rate of real floods recalled by flood index out of real floods larger acc precision and recall result in an improved ability of the flood index the auc is the area under the roc curve which is plotted by a curve in which the false positive rate fpr is at the x axis and tpr is at the y axis the curve consists of a series of points fpr tpr with many thresholds a larger tpr and a smaller fpr indicate a better flood index performance therefore the top left point is the ideal performance of the flood index on the roc curve the larger the area under the roc curve is the more the auc gets and the better the flood indices perform the equation 12 13 of auc is following 12 auc x 0 1 t p r fpr 1 x d x 13 fpr fp fp t n where tpr denotes the tpr function fpr 1 x denotes the inverse of the fpr function and x denotes the value of fpr the auc is the combined response of the tpr and fpr and a larger value represents a better flood monitoring capability if the auc value is 0 5 then the index has the flood monitoring ability equivalent to a random classification and cannot detect floods effectively xiong et al 2021 in practice the auc corresponds to different evaluation criteria 0 5 bad 0 6 fair 0 7 satisfactory 0 8 good and 0 9 excellent mandrekar 2010 molodtsova et al 2016 4 results 4 1 gap filling of the twsa between grace and grace fo this study used mlp ann to fill the grace fo data gap between july 2017 and may 2018 11 months in total the grace fo twsa is affected by both human activities and climate change and the mlp ann might not effectively learn the trend of the grace fo twsa only by the inputs of climate parameters referring to current studies on the grace fo data gap filling mo et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 long term trends of p t gldas twsa and grac twsa were removed as shown in fig 3 and then taken as the inputs and targets of mlp ann respectively we considered 3 input patterns predictor1 with inputs of p and gldas twsa predioctor2 with inputs of p and t and predictor3 with inputs of p t and gldas twsa the number of neurons in the hidden layer of mlp ann was obtained by bayesian hyperparameter optimization in the training and validation periods and the selection range was 1 to 100 the best number of neurons in the hidden layer of predictor1 predictor2 and predictor3 were 54 38 and 10 respectively then we selected the model performing best in 100 times training to predict the test period fig 4 and table 4 show the grace fo twsa prediction and performance of each predictor it indicates that the predictor1 performs best in the testing period with nse 0 92 cc 0 96 rmse 1 99 cm mse 1 66 cm and nrmse 0 08 therefore we took predictor1 to fill the grace fo twsa data gap 4 2 performance of the grace based flood indices the floods in this paper are defined by discharge based on the measured discharge from april 2002 to december 2016 at bahadurabad station three levels of flood identification thresholds were determined according to the 85th 90th and 95th percentiles gupta and dhanya 2020 the flood events identified from the discharge are listed in table 5 85th percentile in addition the flood events from january 2017 to march 2021 are filled by glofas identified flood events to match the grace fo twsa period coverage although the duration of the glofas identified flood events differs from the real flood events due to the model s uncertainty it does not affect the flood event identification the glofas identified flood events in 2017 2019 and 2020 corresponded to all flood events retrieved from the literature dubey et al 2021 dubey and singh 2021 hossain et al 2019 according to the evaluation criteria the fpi and the mfpi were significantly better than the other four indices for monitoring flood events the roc curves of all six indices are presented in fig 5 it shows that the roc curves of the tsdi mtsdi wsdi and ccdi are distributed around the line y x similar to the random classifier while the fpi and the mfpi are distributed above the line y x which indicates the fpi and the mfpi perform better than other four flood indices the flood identification thresholds of the six indices and the evaluation indices are listed in table 6 it also showed that the mfpi and fpi perform far better than tsdi mtsdi wsdi and tsdi from the perspective of precision and recall although the mfpi and fpi perform not very high with precision 0 20 0 50 and recall 0 48 0 76 they perform much better than other indices tsdi mtsdi wsdi and ccdi with precision 0 05 0 16 and recall 0 30 0 52 the distribution of index identified flood events and real flood events in the time series is shown in fig 6 it shows that tsdi mtsdi wsdi and ccdi have much more fp and fn months and fewer tp months than the mfpi and fpi indicating their poor flood monitoring capability while flood events identified by the fpi and mfpi are consistent with those identified by in situ discharge such as the flood events in 2004 2007 and 2012 gouweleeuw et al 2018 hossain et al 2021 the 2017 flood during the grace fo data gap hossain et al 2019 and 2019 2020 floods in grace fo devrani et al 2022 dubey et al 2021 dubey and singh 2021 hossain et al 2021 lal et al 2020 the identification accuracy of the mfpi was better than that of the fpi at the thresholds of the three flood levels the thresholds of the fpi for 85th 90th and 95th percentile floods were 0 02 0 12 and 0 15 while the thresholds of the mfpi are 0 30 0 57 and 0 61 table 6 compared to the fpi the mfpi was 2 higher for acc 4 higher for auc 21 higher for precision and 31 higher for recall indicating that the mfpi has improved flood monitoring capability as shown in fig 6 a b the fpi failed to identify flood events in 2017 2019 and 2020 whereas the mfpi did identify them in addition the ability of the mfpi to monitor floods gradually increased as the flood level increased the acc of the mfpi for 85th 90th and 95th percentile floods increased from 0 85 to 0 89 and auc increased from 0 81 to 0 91 table 6 5 discussion 5 1 possible reason for twsa depletion in ybrb according to the gap filled grace grace fo twsa data we analyzed the twsa trend in ybrb as shown in fig 7 the twsa of the ybrb declined at a rate of 11 0 mm a from 2002 to 2021 which is consistent with the results of previous studies khandu et al 2016 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2021b some studies have analyzed the reasons for the obvious decline of twsa in ybrb khandu et al 2016 believed that the long term decline relates to human activities and climate change and in the downstream of ybrb human activities including groundwater extraction and agricultural irrigation are the important reasons for the decline of twsa meng et al 2019 found that the glacier water storage in upper ybrb 2003 2014 decline significantly and took a 110 3 contribution to twsa decline the dominant role of glacier mass loss in the decrease in grace tws in the upper ybrb was also reported in other studies brun et al 2017 chen et al 2017 ye et al 2017 which support the dominant role of glaciers in twsa depletion in upper ybrb according to these studies it can be summarized that twsa decline in ybrb is mainly attributed to the depletion from groundwater and glaciers we further quantified the contribution of individual water components to the decline of twsa in ybrb based on the reanalysis data of the integrated watergap global hydrological model which added the glacier water based on the standard watergap model cáceres et al 2020 although the data only covers april 2002 december 2016 in the grace era it takes account of almost all the tws components including the water storage in snow canopy soil moisture groundwater lake reservoir wetland glacier and river we calculated the long term trend of each water component in the basin and the long term trend of twsa as shown in table s3 it can be found that the top three water components contributing to the long term trend of twsa in the whole basin are glacier water snow water equivalent and groundwater contributing 85 91 13 91 and 4 41 respectively this indicates that the decline of twsa in this study area is mainly related to glacier ablation and groundwater consumption only accounts for a small part 5 2 differences between the mfpi and other flood indices significant long term trends of the twsa might increase the uncertainty of traditional grace based indices for flood event monitoring in the ybrb the fpi tsdi wsdi and ccdi identified a significant decreasing trend from the grace fo twsa and misidentified some flood events as shown in fig 6 a c e f the tp points months in which both the index and discharge are identified as flood are mainly distributed before 2012 whereas the fn points months in which the index is identified as non flood but discharge is identified as flood are mainly distributed after 2012 the mfpi and mtsdi removed the grace fo twsa long term trends and effectively avoid the limitations of the traditional grace based flood indices therefore the index values do not show a significant decreasing trend and the tp and fn points are equally distributed from 2002 to 2021 fig 6 b d although both the mtsdi and the mfpi correct the trend problem of twsa the mtsdi is likely more suitable for monitoring drought events whereas the mfpi performs better for flood monitoring this phenomenon can be explained in two ways one reason is related to precipitation flood events in the ybrb are mainly caused by heavy and intensive rainfall the mfpi considers precipitation whereas the mtsdi does not another reason is the difference in the frequency of flood and drought event signals the grace fo twsa signal can be decomposed into a long term trend an interannual term a semiannual term and a residual signal fig 8 in the ybrb the long term trend mainly attributes to the depletion of glaciers and groundwater storage and the annual semi annual term contains the seasonal signal and the residual contains the non seasonal signal for flood event monitoring the ybrb experiences flood events almost every year indicating that main flood event signals exist in the annual semi annual and residual signals the mfpi considers both the annual semi annual and the residual signals performing better than the mtsdi which considers only the residual signals however the frequency of drought events in the ybrb was much less than that of flood events and does not have an annual frequency prolonged droughts occurred only in 2006 and 2009 baruah et al 2021 khandu et al 2016 this indicates that the signals of drought events mainly exist in the residual signals rather than in the annual semi annual periodic signals the mtsdi in 2006 and 2009 showed local minima which indicates an abnormal decline of twsa in the ybrb fig 6 d while the mfpi did not show any unusual local minima in 2006 and 2009 fig 6 b because the mfpi is influenced more by the stronger twsa seasonal signal than by the weaker residual signal resulting in the inability to monitor drought events while the mtsdi considers only the residual signal and can monitor drought events in short if there is a significant decline of twsa in the study area the traditional grace based flood indices will show a downward trend and misrepresent flood risk two modified indices the mfpi and mtsdi avoid the effects of long term trends in the twsa however because of the formulation differences between the two indices the mfpi is suitable for monitoring flood events while mtsdi is more suitable for monitoring drought events 5 3 the ability of the mfpi to show flood spatial process the distribution of the flood risk is determined by the initial state of the twsa and the distribution of precipitation and a higher twsa causes large potential flooding during monsoons due to the excess of water that cannot be stored further long et al 2014 according to the definition of mfpi the potential water storage is determined using the difference between the previous month s detrended twsa and the maximum detrended twsa combined with real time or forecasted precipitation the mfpi can monitor flood risk and even predict flood prone areas we compared the distribution of mfpi and recorded floods in a typical flood year and an atypical flood year the extreme floods in 2012 bhattacharya et al 2019 gogoi et al 2020 reached 95th percentile discharge typical flood while the flood in 2021 only had 85th percentile discharge atypical flood in the 2012 flood a higher initial twsa offered lower potential water storage in fig 7 the minimum twsa in january 2011 was slightly higher than that in january 2010 whereas the minimum twsa in january 2012 remained at the same level as that in 2011 indicating lower potential water storage in addition local heavy precipitation aggravated the mfpi flood risk in fig 10 heavy rainfall occurred in the lower basin from june to september the twsa in the lower basin ended the deficit in june under the influence of continuous heavy rainfall then gradually rose to a peak from july to september and finally subsided after october fig 9 in june the mfpi in the lower basin exceeds the 85th percentile flood threshold of 0 30 and in some areas it even exceeds the 95th percentile threshold of 0 61 thresholds shown in table 6 in october the mfpi reduced below the 85th percentile flood threshold in addition the spatiotemporal process of the mfpi was generally consistent with the real flood in 2012 for instance in eight districts of assam india 10 of the area was inundated by the flood from june 27th to july 2th 2012 bhatt et al 2013 namely kamrup marigaon barpeta nowgong lakhimpur karimganj cachar and darrang fig 11 a these areas largely coincide with places where the mean mfpi is 0 30 85th percentile flood threshold from june july furthermore pal et al 2013 indicated that three flood waves occurred in the barpeta district of assam from june to october 2012 with durations of june 7th to 24th june 25th to august 14th and september 9th to october 14th respectively the mean mfpi values for barpeta district from june to october are 0 64 0 28 0 46 0 33 and 0 13 respectively fig 10 the mean mfpi in june august and september exceeded the 85th percentile flood threshold 0 30 which largely coincides with the duration of the three flood waves in the 2021 flood a lower initial twsa offered lower potential water storage according to fig s8 a the twsa got a lower level than before which led ybrb could store more water but heavy precipitation in august increased the mfpi flood risk according to fig s7 the mfpi shows a high flood risk only in august but a low flood risk in july this can be explained with that the precipitation in july is much less than the average level and precipitation reached the average level and even higher in august when floods happened fig s8 b the spatiotemporal process of the mfpi was generally consistent with real floods too the discharge in 2021 was 85th percentile and was not the typical flood defined in this study and could not be identified by the mfpi flood threshold indicating weak flood level there are few documents recording the inundated area however the assam state disaster management authority s daily flood hazard report showed local floods from august to september 2021 https www asdma gov in reports html 2021 8 13 to 2021 9 18 36 days in total we counted the distribution map of the mean mfpi in august and september 2021 and the days when a district was reported affected by floods as shown in fig 11 b unlike the high mfpi in the extreme 2012 flood fig 11 a in the 2021 flood most of the mfpi values were 0 30 the 85th percentile flood threshold and ranged from 0 to 0 30 in most areas in assam fig 11 b nevertheless the plot shows that the greater the mfpi value is the more days that affected by floods is reported if we assume that the severity of flood is positively correlated with the number of days when a district are affected by floods this suggests that the mfpi can also reflect the under 85th percentile flood risk the comparison of the 2012 flood and the 2021 flood shows that the mfpi index can show the flood risk of both typical and atypical floods the mfpi flood risk relates to the level of initial twsa and rainfall intensity holding rainfall constant higher initial twsa reduces potential water storage leading to higher flood risk holding twsa constant higher rainfall leads to higher flood risk in addition the same rainfall intensity poses different flood risks in different places in the basin for example in fig 10 2012 flood in august when the mfpi in the upper basin reached 0 3 the rainfall was only 200 400 mm while the mfpi in the lower basin reached 0 3 the rainfall was 900 1500 mm in ybrb the hydrological signal in the upper the annual amplitude of twsa is 6 9 cm a is weaker than in the lower basin the annual amplitude of twsa is 14 8 cm a indicating less potential water storage in the upper basin therefore a certain amount of rainfall leads to high flood risk in the upper basin but does not necessarily result in flood risk lower basin 5 4 uncertainty and limitation although the proposed mfpi has a good performance in the application of flood monitoring in ybrb there are still some uncertainties and limitations that need to be noted the uncertainties mainly come from some data and their processing methods first when evaluating the performance of flood indices we use discharge data to identify flood events as a benchmark due to the lack of in situ discharge from 2017 to 2021 glofas discharges were appended in situ discharge glofas which is a kind of reanalysis data does have some uncertainty compared with the observed discharge however we evaluated the data quality and found that it performed well on the monthly scale and had good consistency with the in situ discharge nse 0 87 r 0 94 rmse 30 39 mm mae 22 02 mm according to fig s6 it can be seen that it shows high accuracy in the magnitude and occurrence time of the peak runoff in flood season therefore it can be considered that glofas discharge data is worthy of being recommended for monthly scale flood event analysis in the absence of short term observation data second there are uncertainties caused by some deficiencies in grace products due to the grace battery management problem several missing consecutive weeks starting in 2011 occurred approximately every 6 months volkov and landerer 2013 there are 23 months of data missing in this study including 11 months belonging to monsoons in ybrb fig s1 the lack of data in the monsoon period will bring uncertainty to the identification of flood events for this problem some studies have adopted the cubic spline method for interpolation and obtained good results chen et al 2020 mu 2018 wouters et al 2019 this study also adopts this method to interpolate the missing information of grace twsa into standard monthly time intervals due to the lack of tws observation data it is difficult to strictly evaluate these values obtained by interpolation which is also a common problem when using grace data nevertheless according to fig s3 the interpolated data is in good agreement with the gladas twsa in addition there are uncertainties from the grace fo data gap filling grace twsa is influenced by both human activity and climate when filling the grace fo data gap the mlp ann model only takes into account the climatic factors and might not keep the long term characteristic of grace twsa yang et al 2021 several studies assume that uncertainty from 11 month data missing in the data gap in long term trends computation is negligible they detrended the grace twsa in model training and added back the long term trend after prediction which improved prediction performance significantly mo et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 this study takes the same strategy and the nse of mlp ann prediction in the testing period is 0 91 which reaches very good this performance can meet our needs for flood event identification third many gridded datasets are used in this study and their spatial resolution is not completely uniform the mismatched spatial resolution among multiple data will also bring some uncertainty in order to analyze on a unified scale these datasets including grace fo twsa gldas twsa gpm p era5 t and glofas discharge were resampled into 0 25 by nearest neighboring interpolation nearest neighborhood interpolation is also a common method in processing grace data han et al 2021 although it may over or under estimate sub grid data it preserves as much of the original data as possible tan et al 2015 for the large scale flood process mainly concerned in this study the impact of this uncertainty is limited it will be valuable and interesting to research the impact of different spatial resolution data on flood monitoring in future work the ybrb was selected as the research area in this study in recent decades china india and bhutan are all interested in developing hydropower in the ybrb there are nearly 40 dams in total including built or planned located on both the main stem and the tributaries yang et al 2016 these dams will change the original natural runoff process and usually weaken the flood in the flood season the impact of the dam is not considered because the space time scale of flood concerned in this study determines that the dam will not have a great impact on the application of grace based flood indices the flood index proposed in this study is aimed at a large scale it identifies the flood risk according to the change of tws in the catchment and is not limited to the water volume of the river on the other hand the high intensity and large scale flood events often showed obvious characteristics from the twsa and will be detected by the flood index whether there are dams or not our results fig 6 showed that the flood index performs well for large flood events such as those 85th discharge percentile floods therefore the dam has a limited impact on our large scale flood monitoring for small scale and short term flood events the dam can indeed reduce the risk of disasters through reservoir capacity regulation however grace data with a monthly time step and 0 25 spatial resolution is not suitable for small scale and short term flood monitoring which is also the limitation of this study 6 conclusion in this study a modified flood index was proposed to eliminate the uncertainty of traditional grace flood indices in the basin with significant twsa decline the index was used in the ybrb for flood event monitoring based on the gap filled grace grace fo twsa data the main findings of this study are as follows 1 the mlp ann model taking the gldas twsa and precipitation as external inputs perform best reaching a level of very good thus filling the data gap between the grace and grace fo mission 2 the proposed mfpi is available to areas with a significant twsa decline it performed better in flood event monitoring than the fpi tsdi wsdi and ccdi in the ybrb the mfpi removes trends of the grace fo twsa and avoids the effect of long term trends on flood events monitoring in addition the mfpi is also able to monitor the temporal spatial process of floods and the result is consistent with the recorded flood 3 although the mtsdi also considers the trend problem of twsa it only takes into account the grace fo twsa residuals that contain the non periodic signal and is likely more suitable for monitoring drought events the mfpi considers precipitation as well as the periodic and residual signals of the grace fo twsa and performs relatively better for flood monitoring in general grace has the edge in large scale flood monitoring that hydrological models and other remote sensing methods cannot match the grace based flood indices can be used to monitor flood events and processes conveniently and effectively the mfpi proposed in this study is more applicable to flood monitoring in areas where tws has decreased significantly than other traditional indices under the influences of human activities and climate change many river basins around the world are experiencing significant tws depletion the mfpi will have wider applicability which has important implications for the study of extreme hydrological events

2637,the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and follow on grace fo missions offer great potential for large scale flood event monitoring however the effectiveness of current grace based indices may be limited in areas with significant terrestrial water storage tws decline in this study a modified flood potential index mfpi was proposed to improve the monitoring capability for flood events in the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river basin ybrb first the grace fo terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa data gap was filled with a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model mlp ann based on the gap filled data the performance of the mfpi was compared with five selected indices flood potential index fpi total storage deficit index tsdi modified total storage deficit index mtsdi water storage deficit index wsdi and combined climatologic deviation index ccdi finally the spatiotemporal monitoring ability of the mfpi was evaluated for typical and atypical flood events we found that 1 mlp ann was able to predict the grace fo data gap with a performance of very good 2 the mfpi outperformed the fpi tsdi mtsdi wsdi and ccdi in capturing flood events and could also reflect their spatiotemporal processes and 3 the mfpi avoids long term twsa trend effects on flood event monitoring and is available for areas with significant twsa trends this study can provide a reference

hirabayashi et al 2013 as one of the most destructive natural hazards flood has caused a lot of casualties and economic losses worldwide during the last decades lee et al 2020 there is an urgent need to better monitor flood events to promote sustainable development traditionally flood monitoring relies on in situ gauge station observations but generally it is difficult to effectively monitor large scale flood risk due to the sparse distribution of hydrological stations the development of hydrological models global reanalysis datasets and remote sensing has made it possible to monitor floods on a large scale dubey and singh 2021 lópez et al 2020 pandi et al 2021 hydrological models detail terrestrial water storage tws components but lack verification from in situ gauges famiglietti and rodell 2013 combined with in situ gauge observations global reanalysis datasets feature uninterrupted regional coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution however their performance varies spatially because of the uncertainty of the prediction model data assimilation and data source zhang et al 2020 synthetic aperture radars optical remote sensing and rain radars provide data from shallow soil moisture water surfaces and rainfall ahamed and bolten 2017 reager and famiglietti 2009 surampudi and yarrakula 2020 which play a significant role in flood monitoring and forecasting however flood monitoring and forecasting should be based not only on meteorological information but also on the saturation state of flood prone areas prior to rainfall reager and famiglietti 2009 nevertheless neither optical microwave remote sensors nor radar can monitor regional tws the joint national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center dlr gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission and its continuing legacy the grace follow on grace fo provide a solution for this limitation the monthly gravity field around earth s surface estimated by grace can be transformed into terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 1998 yeh et al 2006 grace fo twsa comprises anomalies from surface water storage soil water and underground water and can estimate the regional water saturation associated with flood prone areas previous studies have found that the grace fo twsa responds well to flood events chao and wang 2017 chen et al 2010 idowu and zhou 2019 and therefore grace could serve as a solution for large scale flood monitoring over the last decade several grace based indices have been developed to monitor floods reager and famiglietti 2009 developed the flood potential index fpi which uses the precipitation and grace fo twsa to assess flood potential i e the amount of water that precipitation exceeds the potential water storage long et al 2014 used the fpi to monitor floods in the yunnan guizhou plateau and the results showed the value of the fpi for flood forecasts and damage evaluation yirdaw et al 2008 developed the total storage deficit index tsdi which was originally proposed for drought monitoring and can also be used for floods monitoring for example chen et al 2018 used tsdi to analyze flood events in the liao river basin and found that its results were largely consistent with historical observations in addition two improved index storage deficit indices based on the tsdi namely the water storage deficit index wsdi sun et al 2018 and the combined climatologic deviation index ccdi satish kumar et al 2021 have also been applied to flood events identification nigatu et al 2021 according to the calculation principle these indices mainly rely on capturing the characteristics of grace fo twsa signals to identify floods the grace fo twsa signal can be decomposed into a long term trend an interannual term a semiannual term and a residual signal scanlon et al 2016 floods are usually driven by seasonal precipitation which is shown in grace fo twsa as annual semiannual and residual signals if the twsa in a region has a significant long term trend the annual semiannual and residual signals will be relatively weaker these grace based indices mentioned above cannot distinguish long term trend from annual semiannual signals hence it can be assumed that their performance will deteriorate over time some studies have found the impact of long term trend signals when using grace fo twsa for drought monitoring hosseini moghari et al 2019 noted that in basins with excessive water withdrawal the long term trend of twsa showed a continuous decline in this case tsdi introduces a declining trend from twsa and tend to misclassify early drought event into normal or wet years they proposed the modified total storage deficit index mtsdi in which grace fo twsa is replaced by grace fo twsa residuals without periodic terms and long term trend the evaluation results showed that mtsdi can effectively improve the monitoring ability of drought events compared with drought flood is the other side of extreme hydrology and the problems faced in monitoring floods and droughts are similar to each other when flood index is used for flood monitoring based on grace fo twsa data it is also necessary to solve the identification errors caused by significant long term trends at present it has been found that many large basins worldwide have a significant downward trend of grace fo twsa due to climate change or human activities rodell et al 2018 such as ganges brahmaputra and indus river basins where grace fo twsa decreases gradually due to significant irrigation intensity scanlon et al 2016 however floods in these basins are still often seen devrani et al 2022 dubey et al 2021 dubey and singh 2021 gogoi et al 2020 lal et al 2020 surampudi and yarrakula 2020 especially in the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river basin ybrb the basin experiences frequent floods hossain et al 2019 which negatively impact the local populations in this context the limitations of the traditional flood index will become more prominent and it is valuable to develop a more reliable flood monitoring index this study aimed to develop a modified flood potential index mfpi which removes the long term trend of twsa thus it improves the flood monitoring ability of grace based flood indices in the area with significant tws depletion a case study was carried out in the ybrb to evaluate the performance of the mfpi considering that the grace fo data gap problem may affect the analysis of the long term trend of twsa we first use an artificial neural network model to fill the data gap to obtain a continuous and long term twsa data series on this basis the mfpi and five other indices fpi tsdi wsdi ccdi and mtsdi are calculated and their monitoring capabilities for flood events are compared this study can provide a reference for the application of grace data in flood monitoring 2 study area the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river ybr has the fourth highest average discharge in the world with an average annual discharge of approximately 20 000 m3s 1 immerzeel 2008 pervez and henebry 2015 the ybr originates from the gyima yangzoin glacier on the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2021 and flows through china bhutan india and bangladesh with a total length of 2 900 km ji et al 2020 the ybrb drains diverse environments including the dry and cold tibetan plateau rain drenched himalayan slopes landlocked alluvial plains of assam and vast deltaic lowlands of bangladesh lópez et al 2020 the study area is the watershed above bahadurabad station fig 1 and ranges from 82 to 98 e and 25 32 n and covers 530 000 km2 guo et al 2022 rainfall from june to september accounts for 60 70 of the annual precipitation in this area pervez and henebry 2015 and heavy and concentrated precipitation has led to frequent flooding in the lower ybrb on average six flood waves occur annually during the monsoon period in the lower basin with discharge ranging from 4 420 m3s 1 51 156 m3s 1 dubey and singh 2021 moderate floods occur once every 2 years while severe floods occur every 6 7 years hossain et al 2021 between 1980 and 2012 a total of 38 flood events occurred five of which were categorized under the level of devastating catastrophes hossain et al 2021 in assam 10 000 km2 of land is affected by floods every year valdiya 1999 floods were the most severe in 1998 inundating an area of 38 000 km2 and threatening the lives and property of approximately 12 5 million people devrani et al 2022 effective monitoring of regional flood risks can significantly reduce human casualties and economic losses 3 data and methods 3 1 data 3 1 1 grace fo twsa data grace fo twsa data include the mascon solutions mascons loomis et al 2019 save et al 2016 wiese et al 2019

bias caused by filtering the scale factor correction long et al 2015 was implemented based on the twsa of the noah hydrological model from the global land data assimilation system gldas these grace april 2002 to june 2017 and grace fo may 2018 to march 2021 twsa products were resampled into a 0 25 grid by nearest neighbor interpolation hardy et al 2017 hasan and tarhule 2021 sadeghi et al 2020 in addition some data are missing in grace fo including missing data that occur approximately every six months in the grace fo era 23 months in total with 11 during the monsoon season of the ybrb from jun sep see fig s1 in supporting information and the data gap between grace and grace fo for the former data missing we interpolated the 1 2 months of missing data by cubic spline chen et al 2020 mu 2018 wouters et al 2019 which is better able to retain the characteristic of positive negative peaks than linear interpolation and for the latter data gap we performed filling by the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network mlp ann simulation see section 3 2 1 the three types of grace fo twsa were in good agreement with each other in the ybrb fig s2 with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 979 to most effectively reduce the noise in the gravity field solution within the available scatter of the solution sakumura et al 2014 the ensemble mean of the nine grace fo twsa products was used as the grace fo twsa in this study 3 1 2 external inputs for the mlp ann network precipitation is a direct influencing factor which is the most important tws input whereas temperature which is correlated with evapotranspiration has an indirect influence the precipitation p data used in this study are from the nasa global precipitation measurement gpm mission huffman et al 2019 and are downloaded from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc the temperature t data consisted of the surface 2 m temperature from the european center for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 land era5 land which is a reanalysis dataset that combines globally measured data reanalysis with higher resolution and reliability compared to era5 muñoz sabater 2021 the p and t data periods cover april 2002 to march 2021 with a temporal resolution of one month and a spatial resolution of 0 1 and they were resampled into 0 25 by nearest neighbor interpolation refer to table 1 for details tws consists of all water components such as canopy water snow water soil water groundwater and so on therefore this study also considers the tws component output from the nasa global land data assimilation system version2 1 gldas 2 1 beaudoing 2020a b li et al 2020a b rodell et al 2004 as an external input to the model gldas 2 1 currently contains three model outputs noah the variable infiltration capacity vic and the community land model clm the mosaic in gldas v001 was removed from gldas 2 because gldas does not consider groundwater the sum of the snow water equivalent vegetation canopy water and soil water from the model output was used as the model tws outputs and twsa is computed by removing the baseline from 2004 to 2009 the twsa from noah vic clm and the three model mean were in good agreement with the grace fo twsa fig s3 with correlation coefficients of 0 88 0 86 0 87 and 0 94 respectively the correlation coefficient of the three model mean is the highest and is used as another external input to the mlp ann model called gldas twsa it was resampled to a 0 25 grid cell by nearest neighbor interpolation covering april 2002 march 2021 3 1 3 discharge discharge observations from the bahadurabad station were used to identify flood events in the ybrb and then served as the basis for evaluating the performance of each index because the in situ gauge observations only cover april 2002 to december 2016 the discharge data output from the global flood awareness system glofas harrigan et al 2021 model was used to append the discharge data to march 2021 thus maintaining the same coverage as grace fo the glofas river discharge reanalysis dataset is a product of the copernicus management service cems and is produced by coupling surface and sub surface runoff data from the hydrology tiled european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel and flood simulation lisflood hydrological and channel routing model harrigan et al 2021 senent aparicio et al 2021 this study takes the glofas 2 1 monthly discharge from april 2002 to march 2021 downloaded from https www globalfloods eu accessed on 22 march 2022 and the spatial resolution of 0 1 was resampled to 0 25 by nearest neighbor interpolation the consistency between glofas and in situ discharge has also been checked the results showed that glofas has a good agreement with in situ discharge performing nse 0 88 r 0 94 rmse 30 39 mm mae 22 02 mm fig s6 proving the reasonability to append in situ discharge by glofas 3 2 method fig 2 presents the proposed framework for developing the mfpi for the ybrb the grace data period covers april 2002 to june 2017 and the grace fo data period covers june 2018 to march 2021 thus a 11 months data gap occurs between the two missions to obtain a continuous 19 year grace fo twsa series the data gap was firstly filled using an mlp ann that took precipitation temperature and gldas twsa as the inputs then based on the gap filled grace fo twsa the performance of the mfpi was developed and compared with that of current flood indices using the accuracy rate acc the area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc precision rate precision and recall rate recall finally the mfpi was applied to monitor the spatiotemporal process of typical and atypical flood events 3 2 1 mlp ann mlp ann as a kind of machine learning algorithm has been successfully used in the grace twsa series gap filling and prediction abhishek et al 2022 abhishek et al 2021 long et al 2014 considering its reported good efficiency it was also selected in this study the mlp ann models have three parts the inputs layer hidden layer and outputs layer and its structure is shown in fig s4 the mlp ann models built in this study have one hidden layer and output grace fo twsa prediction the number of neurons in hidden layer was determined by bayesian parameter optimization which is a model based hyperparameter optimization method bayesian parameter optimization method can achieve better performance on the test set while requiring fewer iterations than random search and network search and it has been widely applied to machine learning hyperparameter choosing sun et al 2021 wunsch et al 2021 the training period is between april 2002 and july 2015 75 samples 160 months the validation is from august 2015 to june 2017 10 samples 23 months and the testing period is from june 2018 to march 2021 15 samples 34 months and prediction period is the grace data gap july 2017 to may 2018 11 months the validation period was used to screen for the best model and the testing period was used to test the generalization ability of the model since the trend term of twsa is affected by both climate change and human activities and the input variables are mainly climate parameters it is possible to lose sight of the part of human activities impact during the simulation process many current studies on the grace fo data gap filling tried removing the trend of grace fo twsa before making predictions table 3 and obtained better predictions mo et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 referring to this strategy we removed the long term trend from the simulation inputs p t gldas twsa and target grace fo twsa of mlp ann finally the long term trend was added back to the reconstructed grace fo twsa the statistical indices for evaluating the predictive performance of the mlp ann model are the pearson correlation coefficient cc benesty et al 2009 nash sutcliffe model efficiency

obs indicates the observed time series average sim represents the model predicted value sim indicates the predicted time series average max and min represents the maximum and minimum function respectively i 1 2 3 n n represents the time length and i represents the time ordering here 1 c c 1 and a value closer to 1 indicates a better model performance and n s e 1 and a value closer to 1 indicates a better model performance the general evaluation criteria are as follows lin et al 2017 moriasi et al 2007 nse 0 5 unsatisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 satisfactory 0 65 nse 0 75 good and 0 75 nse 1 00 very good the rmse mae and nrmse reflect the model prediction bias and a value closer to 0 indicates a better model performance 3 2 2 flood monitoring indices in this study mfpi was proposed based on the fpi to improve flood monitoring ability in the tws depletion basin based on grace twsa the fpi takes precipitation as the water storage input and the difference between the maximum and the previous month s twsa is the potential water storage equation s1 when precipitation exceeds the potential water storage the basin is at risk of flooding however the fpi may have limitations when twsa has a significant long term trend for example if the twsa trend declines the fpi will also decline but the real flood risk might not decline as the long term trend dclines this study replaced the twsa with a detrended twsa to construct an mfpi for flood event monitoring the detrended twsa removed the long term trend of the twsa signal the fpi considers that flood risk is influenced by precipitation and twsa the mfpi keeps the same principle but removes the long term trend of twsa and remains a periodical and residual signal of twsa the mfpi equation 6 8 is as follows 6 mfpa i p i m a x twsa detrend twsa detrend i 1 7 tws a detrend t w s a twsa long t e r m t r e n d 8 m fpi i mfpa i m a x m f p a where mfpa i represents the modified flood potential amount tws a detrend indicates the twsa signal after removing the long term trend p i represents precipitation m a x represents a maximum function subscript i represents the ith month in grace fo era april 2002 march 2021 to assess the effectiveness of the mfpi other grace based indices that can be used for flood monitoring are also calculated for comparison such as the fpi the tsdi wsdi and ccdi the mtsdi which also adopted detrended twsa performs better for monitoring drought events hosseini moghari et al 2019 but its ability to monitor flood events has not previously been discussed therefore the mtsdi was also chosen for comparison in this study the equations for the five indices are shown in supporting information equation s1 15 in text s1 3 2 3 evaluation indices for flood monitoring ability in this study a confusion matrix table 2 of the discharge flood identification and index flood identification was used to quantify the flood monitoring capability of the grace based indices first discharge observations at the bahadurabad station were divided into three levels of floods namely the 85th 90th and 95th percentiles to identify flood events based on discharge although high discharge does not necessarily result in flooding it can indicate a high flood risk the use of discharge to identify flood levels has also been applied in other studies on the grace flood monitoring index gupta and dhanya 2020 xiong et al 2021 the average value of the six indices for individual level flood events was then calculated as the identification thresholds of the index gupta and dhanya 2020 xiong et al 2021 and the flood events were identified by them then the confusion matrix for flood identification was built based on the discharge identified and index identified flood events finally the flood identifying capability of the flood indices at the corresponding thresholds is evaluated by the acc precision recall also named true positive rate tpr and auc as following equations 9 11 slaby 2007 9 acc tp t n tp t n f p f n 10 precision t p t p f p 11 recall t p r tp t p f n where tp represents the number of months in which both the index and discharge are identified as flood fp represents the number of months that the index identified as flood but the discharge identified as non flood fn represents the number of months that the index identified as non flood but the discharge identified as flood and tn represents the number of months that both the index and discharge identified as non flood acc responds to the accuracy of the index for both flood and non flood event identification precision describes the rate of real floods out of the floods identified by the flood index the recall or tpr describes the rate of real floods recalled by flood index out of real floods larger acc precision and recall result in an improved ability of the flood index the auc is the area under the roc curve which is plotted by a curve in which the false positive rate fpr is at the x axis and tpr is at the y axis the curve consists of a series of points fpr tpr with many thresholds a larger tpr and a smaller fpr indicate a better flood index performance therefore the top left point is the ideal performance of the flood index on the roc curve the larger the area under the roc curve is the more the auc gets and the better the flood indices perform the equation 12 13 of auc is following 12 auc x 0 1 t p r fpr 1 x d x 13 fpr fp fp t n where tpr denotes the tpr function fpr 1 x denotes the inverse of the fpr function and x denotes the value of fpr the auc is the combined response of the tpr and fpr and a larger value represents a better flood monitoring capability if the auc value is 0 5 then the index has the flood monitoring ability equivalent to a random classification and cannot detect floods effectively xiong et al 2021 in practice the auc corresponds to different evaluation criteria 0 5 bad 0 6 fair 0 7 satisfactory 0 8 good and 0 9 excellent mandrekar 2010 molodtsova et al 2016 4 results 4 1 gap filling of the twsa between grace and grace fo this study used mlp ann to fill the grace fo data gap between july 2017 and may 2018 11 months in total the grace fo twsa is affected by both human activities and climate change and the mlp ann might not effectively learn the trend of the grace fo twsa only by the inputs of climate parameters referring to current studies on the grace fo data gap filling mo et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 long term trends of p t gldas twsa and grac twsa were removed as shown in fig 3 and then taken as the inputs and targets of mlp ann respectively we considered 3 input patterns predictor1 with inputs of p and gldas twsa predioctor2 with inputs of p and t and predictor3 with inputs of p t and gldas twsa the number of neurons in the hidden layer of mlp ann was obtained by bayesian hyperparameter optimization in the training and validation periods and the selection range was 1 to 100 the best number of neurons in the hidden layer of predictor1 predictor2 and predictor3 were 54 38 and 10 respectively then we selected the model performing best in 100 times training to predict the test period fig 4 and table 4 show the grace fo twsa prediction and performance of each predictor it indicates that the predictor1 performs best in the testing period with nse 0 92 cc 0 96 rmse 1 99 cm mse 1 66 cm and nrmse 0 08 therefore we took predictor1 to fill the grace fo twsa data gap 4 2 performance of the grace based flood indices the floods in this paper are defined by discharge based on the measured discharge from april 2002 to december 2016 at bahadurabad station three levels of flood identification thresholds were determined according to the 85th 90th and 95th percentiles gupta and dhanya 2020 the flood events identified from the discharge are listed in table 5 85th percentile in addition the flood events from january 2017 to march 2021 are filled by glofas identified flood events to match the grace fo twsa period coverage although the duration of the glofas identified flood events differs from the real flood events due to the model s uncertainty it does not affect the flood event identification the glofas identified flood events in 2017 2019 and 2020 corresponded to all flood events retrieved from the literature dubey et al 2021 dubey and singh 2021 hossain et al 2019 according to the evaluation criteria the fpi and the mfpi were significantly better than the other four indices for monitoring flood events the roc curves of all six indices are presented in fig 5 it shows that the roc curves of the tsdi mtsdi wsdi and ccdi are distributed around the line y x similar to the random classifier while the fpi and the mfpi are distributed above the line y x which indicates the fpi and the mfpi perform better than other four flood indices the flood identification thresholds of the six indices and the evaluation indices are listed in table 6 it also showed that the mfpi and fpi perform far better than tsdi mtsdi wsdi and tsdi from the perspective of precision and recall although the mfpi and fpi perform not very high with precision 0 20 0 50 and recall 0 48 0 76 they perform much better than other indices tsdi mtsdi wsdi and ccdi with precision 0 05 0 16 and recall 0 30 0 52 the distribution of index identified flood events and real flood events in the time series is shown in fig 6 it shows that tsdi mtsdi wsdi and ccdi have much more fp and fn months and fewer tp months than the mfpi and fpi indicating their poor flood monitoring capability while flood events identified by the fpi and mfpi are consistent with those identified by in situ discharge such as the flood events in 2004 2007 and 2012 gouweleeuw et al 2018 hossain et al 2021 the 2017 flood during the grace fo data gap hossain et al 2019 and 2019 2020 floods in grace fo devrani et al 2022 dubey et al 2021 dubey and singh 2021 hossain et al 2021 lal et al 2020 the identification accuracy of the mfpi was better than that of the fpi at the thresholds of the three flood levels the thresholds of the fpi for 85th 90th and 95th percentile floods were 0 02 0 12 and 0 15 while the thresholds of the mfpi are 0 30 0 57 and 0 61 table 6 compared to the fpi the mfpi was 2 higher for acc 4 higher for auc 21 higher for precision and 31 higher for recall indicating that the mfpi has improved flood monitoring capability as shown in fig 6 a b the fpi failed to identify flood events in 2017 2019 and 2020 whereas the mfpi did identify them in addition the ability of the mfpi to monitor floods gradually increased as the flood level increased the acc of the mfpi for 85th 90th and 95th percentile floods increased from 0 85 to 0 89 and auc increased from 0 81 to 0 91 table 6 5 discussion 5 1 possible reason for twsa depletion in ybrb according to the gap filled grace grace fo twsa data we analyzed the twsa trend in ybrb as shown in fig 7 the twsa of the ybrb declined at a rate of 11 0 mm a from 2002 to 2021 which is consistent with the results of previous studies khandu et al 2016 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2021b some studies have analyzed the reasons for the obvious decline of twsa in ybrb khandu et al 2016 believed that the long term decline relates to human activities and climate change and in the downstream of ybrb human activities including groundwater extraction and agricultural irrigation are the important reasons for the decline of twsa meng et al 2019 found that the glacier water storage in upper ybrb 2003 2014 decline significantly and took a 110 3 contribution to twsa decline the dominant role of glacier mass loss in the decrease in grace tws in the upper ybrb was also reported in other studies brun et al 2017 chen et al 2017 ye et al 2017 which support the dominant role of glaciers in twsa depletion in upper ybrb according to these studies it can be summarized that twsa decline in ybrb is mainly attributed to the depletion from groundwater and glaciers we further quantified the contribution of individual water components to the decline of twsa in ybrb based on the reanalysis data of the integrated watergap global hydrological model which added the glacier water based on the standard watergap model cáceres et al 2020 although the data only covers april 2002 december 2016 in the grace era it takes account of almost all the tws components including the water storage in snow canopy soil moisture groundwater lake reservoir wetland glacier and river we calculated the long term trend of each water component in the basin and the long term trend of twsa as shown in table s3 it can be found that the top three water components contributing to the long term trend of twsa in the whole basin are glacier water snow water equivalent and groundwater contributing 85 91 13 91 and 4 41 respectively this indicates that the decline of twsa in this study area is mainly related to glacier ablation and groundwater consumption only accounts for a small part 5 2 differences between the mfpi and other flood indices significant long term trends of the twsa might increase the uncertainty of traditional grace based indices for flood event monitoring in the ybrb the fpi tsdi wsdi and ccdi identified a significant decreasing trend from the grace fo twsa and misidentified some flood events as shown in fig 6 a c e f the tp points months in which both the index and discharge are identified as flood are mainly distributed before 2012 whereas the fn points months in which the index is identified as non flood but discharge is identified as flood are mainly distributed after 2012 the mfpi and mtsdi removed the grace fo twsa long term trends and effectively avoid the limitations of the traditional grace based flood indices therefore the index values do not show a significant decreasing trend and the tp and fn points are equally distributed from 2002 to 2021 fig 6 b d although both the mtsdi and the mfpi correct the trend problem of twsa the mtsdi is likely more suitable for monitoring drought events whereas the mfpi performs better for flood monitoring this phenomenon can be explained in two ways one reason is related to precipitation flood events in the ybrb are mainly caused by heavy and intensive rainfall the mfpi considers precipitation whereas the mtsdi does not another reason is the difference in the frequency of flood and drought event signals the grace fo twsa signal can be decomposed into a long term trend an interannual term a semiannual term and a residual signal fig 8 in the ybrb the long term trend mainly attributes to the depletion of glaciers and groundwater storage and the annual semi annual term contains the seasonal signal and the residual contains the non seasonal signal for flood event monitoring the ybrb experiences flood events almost every year indicating that main flood event signals exist in the annual semi annual and residual signals the mfpi considers both the annual semi annual and the residual signals performing better than the mtsdi which considers only the residual signals however the frequency of drought events in the ybrb was much less than that of flood events and does not have an annual frequency prolonged droughts occurred only in 2006 and 2009 baruah et al 2021 khandu et al 2016 this indicates that the signals of drought events mainly exist in the residual signals rather than in the annual semi annual periodic signals the mtsdi in 2006 and 2009 showed local minima which indicates an abnormal decline of twsa in the ybrb fig 6 d while the mfpi did not show any unusual local minima in 2006 and 2009 fig 6 b because the mfpi is influenced more by the stronger twsa seasonal signal than by the weaker residual signal resulting in the inability to monitor drought events while the mtsdi considers only the residual signal and can monitor drought events in short if there is a significant decline of twsa in the study area the traditional grace based flood indices will show a downward trend and misrepresent flood risk two modified indices the mfpi and mtsdi avoid the effects of long term trends in the twsa however because of the formulation differences between the two indices the mfpi is suitable for monitoring flood events while mtsdi is more suitable for monitoring drought events 5 3 the ability of the mfpi to show flood spatial process the distribution of the flood risk is determined by the initial state of the twsa and the distribution of precipitation and a higher twsa causes large potential flooding during monsoons due to the excess of water that cannot be stored further long et al 2014 according to the definition of mfpi the potential water storage is determined using the difference between the previous month s detrended twsa and the maximum detrended twsa combined with real time or forecasted precipitation the mfpi can monitor flood risk and even predict flood prone areas we compared the distribution of mfpi and recorded floods in a typical flood year and an atypical flood year the extreme floods in 2012 bhattacharya et al 2019 gogoi et al 2020 reached 95th percentile discharge typical flood while the flood in 2021 only had 85th percentile discharge atypical flood in the 2012 flood a higher initial twsa offered lower potential water storage in fig 7 the minimum twsa in january 2011 was slightly higher than that in january 2010 whereas the minimum twsa in january 2012 remained at the same level as that in 2011 indicating lower potential water storage in addition local heavy precipitation aggravated the mfpi flood risk in fig 10 heavy rainfall occurred in the lower basin from june to september the twsa in the lower basin ended the deficit in june under the influence of continuous heavy rainfall then gradually rose to a peak from july to september and finally subsided after october fig 9 in june the mfpi in the lower basin exceeds the 85th percentile flood threshold of 0 30 and in some areas it even exceeds the 95th percentile threshold of 0 61 thresholds shown in table 6 in october the mfpi reduced below the 85th percentile flood threshold in addition the spatiotemporal process of the mfpi was generally consistent with the real flood in 2012 for instance in eight districts of assam india 10 of the area was inundated by the flood from june 27th to july 2th 2012 bhatt et al 2013 namely kamrup marigaon barpeta nowgong lakhimpur karimganj cachar and darrang fig 11 a these areas largely coincide with places where the mean mfpi is 0 30 85th percentile flood threshold from june july furthermore pal et al 2013 indicated that three flood waves occurred in the barpeta district of assam from june to october 2012 with durations of june 7th to 24th june 25th to august 14th and september 9th to october 14th respectively the mean mfpi values for barpeta district from june to october are 0 64 0 28 0 46 0 33 and 0 13 respectively fig 10 the mean mfpi in june august and september exceeded the 85th percentile flood threshold 0 30 which largely coincides with the duration of the three flood waves in the 2021 flood a lower initial twsa offered lower potential water storage according to fig s8 a the twsa got a lower level than before which led ybrb could store more water but heavy precipitation in august increased the mfpi flood risk according to fig s7 the mfpi shows a high flood risk only in august but a low flood risk in july this can be explained with that the precipitation in july is much less than the average level and precipitation reached the average level and even higher in august when floods happened fig s8 b the spatiotemporal process of the mfpi was generally consistent with real floods too the discharge in 2021 was 85th percentile and was not the typical flood defined in this study and could not be identified by the mfpi flood threshold indicating weak flood level there are few documents recording the inundated area however the assam state disaster management authority s daily flood hazard report showed local floods from august to september 2021 https www asdma gov in reports html 2021 8 13 to 2021 9 18 36 days in total we counted the distribution map of the mean mfpi in august and september 2021 and the days when a district was reported affected by floods as shown in fig 11 b unlike the high mfpi in the extreme 2012 flood fig 11 a in the 2021 flood most of the mfpi values were 0 30 the 85th percentile flood threshold and ranged from 0 to 0 30 in most areas in assam fig 11 b nevertheless the plot shows that the greater the mfpi value is the more days that affected by floods is reported if we assume that the severity of flood is positively correlated with the number of days when a district are affected by floods this suggests that the mfpi can also reflect the under 85th percentile flood risk the comparison of the 2012 flood and the 2021 flood shows that the mfpi index can show the flood risk of both typical and atypical floods the mfpi flood risk relates to the level of initial twsa and rainfall intensity holding rainfall constant higher initial twsa reduces potential water storage leading to higher flood risk holding twsa constant higher rainfall leads to higher flood risk in addition the same rainfall intensity poses different flood risks in different places in the basin for example in fig 10 2012 flood in august when the mfpi in the upper basin reached 0 3 the rainfall was only 200 400 mm while the mfpi in the lower basin reached 0 3 the rainfall was 900 1500 mm in ybrb the hydrological signal in the upper the annual amplitude of twsa is 6 9 cm a is weaker than in the lower basin the annual amplitude of twsa is 14 8 cm a indicating less potential water storage in the upper basin therefore a certain amount of rainfall leads to high flood risk in the upper basin but does not necessarily result in flood risk lower basin 5 4 uncertainty and limitation although the proposed mfpi has a good performance in the application of flood monitoring in ybrb there are still some uncertainties and limitations that need to be noted the uncertainties mainly come from some data and their processing methods first when evaluating the performance of flood indices we use discharge data to identify flood events as a benchmark due to the lack of in situ discharge from 2017 to 2021 glofas discharges were appended in situ discharge glofas which is a kind of reanalysis data does have some uncertainty compared with the observed discharge however we evaluated the data quality and found that it performed well on the monthly scale and had good consistency with the in situ discharge nse 0 87 r 0 94 rmse 30 39 mm mae 22 02 mm according to fig s6 it can be seen that it shows high accuracy in the magnitude and occurrence time of the peak runoff in flood season therefore it can be considered that glofas discharge data is worthy of being recommended for monthly scale flood event analysis in the absence of short term observation data second there are uncertainties caused by some deficiencies in grace products due to the grace battery management problem several missing consecutive weeks starting in 2011 occurred approximately every 6 months volkov and landerer 2013 there are 23 months of data missing in this study including 11 months belonging to monsoons in ybrb fig s1 the lack of data in the monsoon period will bring uncertainty to the identification of flood events for this problem some studies have adopted the cubic spline method for interpolation and obtained good results chen et al 2020 mu 2018 wouters et al 2019 this study also adopts this method to interpolate the missing information of grace twsa into standard monthly time intervals due to the lack of tws observation data it is difficult to strictly evaluate these values obtained by interpolation which is also a common problem when using grace data nevertheless according to fig s3 the interpolated data is in good agreement with the gladas twsa in addition there are uncertainties from the grace fo data gap filling grace twsa is influenced by both human activity and climate when filling the grace fo data gap the mlp ann model only takes into account the climatic factors and might not keep the long term characteristic of grace twsa yang et al 2021 several studies assume that uncertainty from 11 month data missing in the data gap in long term trends computation is negligible they detrended the grace twsa in model training and added back the long term trend after prediction which improved prediction performance significantly mo et al 2022 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 this study takes the same strategy and the nse of mlp ann prediction in the testing period is 0 91 which reaches very good this performance can meet our needs for flood event identification third many gridded datasets are used in this study and their spatial resolution is not completely uniform the mismatched spatial resolution among multiple data will also bring some uncertainty in order to analyze on a unified scale these datasets including grace fo twsa gldas twsa gpm p era5 t and glofas discharge were resampled into 0 25 by nearest neighboring interpolation nearest neighborhood interpolation is also a common method in processing grace data han et al 2021 although it may over or under estimate sub grid data it preserves as much of the original data as possible tan et al 2015 for the large scale flood process mainly concerned in this study the impact of this uncertainty is limited it will be valuable and interesting to research the impact of different spatial resolution data on flood monitoring in future work the ybrb was selected as the research area in this study in recent decades china india and bhutan are all interested in developing hydropower in the ybrb there are nearly 40 dams in total including built or planned located on both the main stem and the tributaries yang et al 2016 these dams will change the original natural runoff process and usually weaken the flood in the flood season the impact of the dam is not considered because the space time scale of flood concerned in this study determines that the dam will not have a great impact on the application of grace based flood indices the flood index proposed in this study is aimed at a large scale it identifies the flood risk according to the change of tws in the catchment and is not limited to the water volume of the river on the other hand the high intensity and large scale flood events often showed obvious characteristics from the twsa and will be detected by the flood index whether there are dams or not our results fig 6 showed that the flood index performs well for large flood events such as those 85th discharge percentile floods therefore the dam has a limited impact on our large scale flood monitoring for small scale and short term flood events the dam can indeed reduce the risk of disasters through reservoir capacity regulation however grace data with a monthly time step and 0 25 spatial resolution is not suitable for small scale and short term flood monitoring which is also the limitation of this study 6 conclusion in this study a modified flood index was proposed to eliminate the uncertainty of traditional grace flood indices in the basin with significant twsa decline the index was used in the ybrb for flood event monitoring based on the gap filled grace grace fo twsa data the main findings of this study are as follows 1 the mlp ann model taking the gldas twsa and precipitation as external inputs perform best reaching a level of very good thus filling the data gap between the grace and grace fo mission 2 the proposed mfpi is available to areas with a significant twsa decline it performed better in flood event monitoring than the fpi tsdi wsdi and ccdi in the ybrb the mfpi removes trends of the grace fo twsa and avoids the effect of long term trends on flood events monitoring in addition the mfpi is also able to monitor the temporal spatial process of floods and the result is consistent with the recorded flood 3 although the mtsdi also considers the trend problem of twsa it only takes into account the grace fo twsa residuals that contain the non periodic signal and is likely more suitable for monitoring drought events the mfpi considers precipitation as well as the periodic and residual signals of the grace fo twsa and performs relatively better for flood monitoring in general grace has the edge in large scale flood monitoring that hydrological models and other remote sensing methods cannot match the grace based flood indices can be used to monitor flood events and processes conveniently and effectively the mfpi proposed in this study is more applicable to flood monitoring in areas where tws has decreased significantly than other traditional indices under the influences of human activities and climate change many river basins around the world are experiencing significant tws depletion the mfpi will have wider applicability which has important implications for the study of extreme hydrological events

2638,climate change poses a great threat to society through its effects on extreme hydrological events floods and droughts and the sustainable development coping with climate change requires a better awareness of the possible impacts to inform climate adaptation strategies in this study we investigated the climate projections from two contrasting gcms wet scenario from miroc5 and dry scenario from csiro and quantified the possible outcomes in terms of hydrological components of the upper blue nile basin ubnb these two climate projection scenarios show that the overall precipitation change in the early 2011 2040 mid 2041 2070 and late century 2071 2100 over the ubnb may vary from 18 3 to 13 6 of the baseline annual precipitation of 1350 mm the hydrological simulations over the basin from our study showed that evapotranspiration may vary between 13 7 and 12 1 of the average annual total actual et of 710 mm and the flow at the basin outlet may range between 40 7 and 30 8 of the mean annual total flow volume of 45 billion cubic meters as a result the wet projection exhibited more frequent floods while the dry projection showed severe droughts specifically in the late century we also examined the role of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd designed for hydropower generation in moderating these potential future climate hydrological extremes our findings indicate that gerd operations can help reduce downstream flood and drought severity by managing flow releases thus this study illustrates the most possible extreme hydrological events in the ubnb due to climate change and demonstrates the degree to which gerd operations can help reduce the impact of these extremes downstream the findings and data generated in this study will aid understanding the importance of sustainable water management and reservoir operation that caters to both hydropower generation and recurring floods and droughts keywords hydrological model crest svas upper blue nile ethiopia water budget evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the changing climate poses a great threat to sustainable development in large parts of the world the adverse impacts of climate change take the form of heat waves sea level rise exacerbating extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods these extreme events can create extensive social agricultural economic and public health damages handmer et al 2012 climate change also affects the availability of water resources by influencing hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and temperature huntington 2006 the upper blue nile basin ubnb in ethiopia is expected to be greatly affected by climate change haile et al 2020 because the complex topography of the basin produces heterogenous climatic conditions its eastern highland experiences cooler temperatures and less precipitation compared to the western lowlands abera et al 2017 analysis of the climate change in this main tributary to the nile river is vital because the basin is transboundary with egypt and sudan and contributes more than 60 of the total flow to the sudan border roth et al 2018 any significant alternation in the basin hydrology will affect the flow of nile the world s largest river and the riparian countries of the basin moreover climate change presents a huge challenge to upstream ethiopia which is one of the world s most drought prone countries haile et al 2020 in some years ethiopia experiences unpredictable excessive rain and in other years low rainfall accumulations in the wet season the lowlands of the basin are vulnerable to high temperatures and prolonged droughts while the highlands may suffer from irregular but intense rainfall mofa 2018 the disparity regarding the contribution and consumption of the nile water in the transboundary nations has always been an issue of water disputes di nunzio 2013 for instance ethiopia contributes the main water volume of the nile river whereas it withdraws only about 3 km3 3 4 of its water annually from the river jeuland et al 2017 egypt on the other hand depends on the nile for 97 of its water supply and as of 2013 accounted for water withdrawals of 55 5 km3 out of the river s total annual flow of 84 km3 johnston 2013 additionally although the highlands of ethiopia offer the best hydropower sites in the world with an exploitable potential of 45 000 mw less than 25 of it is utilized tafesse et al 2021 hailu and kumsa 2020 ethiopia s annual per capita electricity consumption was 65 kw hours kwh in 2013 which was much lower than 488 kwh the annual average of sub saharan african countries and worldwide average of 3 104 kwh kumagai 2016 to increase the per capita electricity consumption as well as to meet the demand from its increasing population the ethiopian government is constructing the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd at the outlet of the ubnb at the border of sudan and ethiopia after completion gerd will be one of the largest dams in africa with a storage capacity of 74 km3 while ethiopia expects gerd to meet its increasing demand for domestic electricity allam and eltahir 2019 egypt is concerned that the dam will reduce inflow to the downstream dam the high aswan dam hence analysis of the effects of future climate and dam operation on the hydrological components in ubnb will contribute scientific knowledge to support negotiations among the transboundary nations regarding the nile water use predictions from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 under different representative concentration pathways rcps have made it possible to analyze impacts of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the blue nile river basin due to the geographical political and socioeconomic importance ubnb has been studied extensively by prior studies yet research findings in this domain remain controversial for instance different trends and magnitudes have been reported in terms of changes of hydrological components kim and kaluarachchi 2009 predicted an average increase of 4 in the annual runoff of the blue nile by 2050 using six general circulation models gcms with a two layer monthly water balance model similarly soliman et al 2009 reported an overall increase in annual flow of about 1 5 with a 10 increase during the wet season in the blue nile during 2034 55 using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as inputs from a regional climate model rcm to a distributed monthly rainfall runoff model aich et al 2014 also reported an increase in discharge and high flows with a longer and more intense rainy season and frequent flooding expected in the future for the ubnb using bias corrected data from five gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 to the contrary some studies have reported future decreases in precipitation and runoff for the ubnb in an analysis of 17 bias corrected and statistically downscaled gcms elshamy et al 2009 predicted an increase in pet of 2 to 14 with an average reduction of 15 in the flow of the blue nile by the end of the 21st century cherie 2013 projected a reduction in the flow from 10 to 61 depending on the time slices the 2050 s and 2090 s by using three statistically downscaled gcms with the soil water assessment tool swat haile et al 2017 investigated the impact of global warming under a 2 c threshold with a slight change in precipitation 2 8 to 2 7 for blue nile basin hydrology and projected a decrease in the streamflow of around 10 using six dynamically downscaled gcms girma 2013 used two rcms the cosmo climate limited area model cclm and the regional atmosphere model remo downscaled from echam5 gcm and produced widely varying results in terms of runoff ranging from 9 to 10 from the cclm and 103 to 141 for remo mengistu et al 2021 also used cclm from three cmip5 gcms in swat and projected an increase of 27 in pet and a decrease of 22 7 to 1 7 in water yield in the ubnb other studies have projected contrasting impacts of future climate on different parts of the nile river beyene et al 2010 estimated a change in flow at the high aswan dam ranging from 16 to 11 using 11 bias corrected statistically downscaled gcms with the variable infiltration capacity vic model siam and eltahir 2017 reported that the long term mean and standard deviation of the total annual river flow of the nile will increase in the 21st century by about 15 and 50 respectively based on their analysis using 18 cmip5 gcms moreover according to ipcc 2021 projections from the cmip6 multi model ensemble mean indicate increases in heavy precipitation although decreases in mean precipitation in the mid 21st century altogether the discrepancies in terms of magnitude and sign in the changes in the hydrological components projected by the studies mentioned above indicate the uncertainties and limitations of gcms as well as of the simulation methods parameters spatiotemporal resolutions and calibration schemes adopted in the various hydrological models to account for the uncertainties associated with different gcm projections and for better preparedness against future extreme events we selected two gcms based on the precipitation trends one that projects the wettest conditions and another that indicates the driest condition in the future in ubnb thus in this study our objectives are 1 study the future climate impacts on the hydrological extremes in the ubnb 2 analyze the climate change impacts on the future hydropower production of gerd and determine how the downstream counties will be affected by the altered flows due to the dam and future climate as well to do so we used the downscaled climate forcing of the selected gcms from an rcm the rossby centre regional atmospheric model version 4 rca4 at 3 hourly and 50 km resolution we first removed the bias from the climate forcing against reference reanalysis data era interim we then simulated the hydrological components evapotranspiration and discharge with the bias adjusted forcing and calibrated the fully distributed hydrological model coupled routing and excess storage crest shen and anagnostou 2017 we finally analyzed the flood frequency and drought conditions in the ubnb with the simulated current and future flows at the basin outlet eldiem close to the gerd dam we analyzed future floods and droughts in w o dam and with dam scenarios to anticipate the probable changes induced by the future climate and gerd respectively thus comparing the results of these two conditions w o dam and with dam we examined the role of the dam gerd in reducing flood drought severity projected in the future extreme climate scenarios this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area we describe the input data model framework and methodology in section 3 and present the results in section 4 followed by a discussion in section 5 and concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area 2 1 basin description the ubnb shown in fig 1 is the largest tributary of the nile river and has a drainage area of around 176 000 km2 it extends from the lake tana highlands to the sudanese border at eldiem conway 2000 contributing 60 of the discharge to the main nile basin it is referred to as the water tower of northeastern africa conway and hulme 1993 the topography of the ubnb is heterogeneous and complex fig 1 shows relatively high terrain elevations ranging from 490 m asl near the ethiopia sudan border to 4 260 m asl around the central part of the basin its climate varies from arid to semiarid with mean annual precipitation of 925 to 1 845 mm conway 1997 2000 the mean annual temperature is about 18 5 c kim et al 2008 and the annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated 1 100 mm kim and hogue 2008 2 2 gerd description gerd is located 25 km east of the border between sudan and ethiopia the dam has 74 km3 storage capacity and 1 700 km2 reservoir area three spillways fig 3 shows a typical cross section of the dam gerd has two powerhouses of approximately 6 000 mw installed turbine capacity the right powerhouse has 10 francis turbines with 3 750 mw total installed capacity while the left has 6 francis turbines with 2 250 mw installed capacity each turbine has 270 m3 s flow capacity according to the ethiopian electric power corporation eepco turbine efficiency is assumed to be 95 abdelazim et al 2020 gerd will release the water from the turbines for power generation if its reservoir water level is above the minimum operating level of 590 m during high floods when the reservoir water level exceeds the spillway crest level 642 m water can be released through any of the three spillways the relationship between the reservoir water level and reservoir volume is depicted in fig 2 gerd is expected to provide approximately 15 000 gwh of electricity annually to upstream ethiopia 3 methodology this section provides an overview of the hydrological model climate projections and reference data we used in the study and it describes our methods for adjusting the bias of the climate forcing and for our analysis of the reservoir mass balances flood frequency analysis drought conditions and hydropower generation in future climate scenarios fig 2 provides a schematic of the workflow we adopted summarizing the data and methods it shows the selected gcms and required forcing variables in crest svas with the simulated flow at the basin outlet we then examine the role of dam for future flood and drought protection by considering w o dam and with dam scenarios we adjusted the dam operation hours in the wet and dry seasons based on the annual drought condition in the basin 3 1 hydrological model crest svas overview in this study we used the coupled routing and excess storage hydrological model crest shen and anagnostou 2017 to simulate the water cycle by physically closing water and energy budgets in the soil vegetation atmosphere snow svas system the model can simulate water cycle components at high spatiotemporal 3 hourly and 500 m resolution for long periods the hydrological processes in crest svas include interception of the rainfall evapotranspiration et infiltration of the through fall in soil layers and finally the runoff generation in the routing process a fully distributed linear reservoir routing fdlrr module estimates the channel discharge using the surface and sub surface runoff shen et al 2017 the locally calibrated crest svas has been shown to outperform the existing global models in the ubnb for both et and discharge simulation lazin et al 2020 it can also provide a better estimation of inflow for the local reservoir koga management 3 2 data 3 2 1 climate data we forced the hydrological model with the climate fields including precipitation temperature downward shortwave sw and longwave lw radiation wind speed and relative humidity and pressure to analyze the hydrological response of the basin to future climate we retrieved the climate scenarios from an rcm the rossby centre atmospheric model version 4 rca4 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 https esgf node llnl gov search esgf llnl in this rcm the variables are downscaled to 3 hourly and 50 km from cmip5 gcms since our objective was to analyze the impact of future extremes we selected the wettest and driest gcms from all available downscaled gcm products in the rca4 model using the annual precipitation change against the baseline 1976 2005 as the criteria as fig 3 shows model for interdisciplinary research on climate miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 projects the wettest precipitation trend in all three future time windows early century 2011 40 mid century 2041 70 and late century 2071 2100 whereas commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro collier et al 2011 indicates the driest condition we first calibrated crest svas simulation results et and discharge using the historical baseline period 1981 2005 downscaled forcing variables from these two gcm and then used the calibrated parameters in future et and discharge simulations we also used a dynamic remote sensing product the leaf area index lai from the global land surface satellite glass dataset at 8 day intervals from 1981 to 2014 and we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mod12q1 for 2015 to represent the land cover we did not consider any projection for the lai and land cover and used the latest data on the present climate for future scenarios to compute the soil hydraulic properties from africa soilgrids hengl et al 2015 in 0 2 m six layered soil we used a model developed by saxton and rawls 2006 we collected the terrain properties of the basin such as the digital elevation model dem the flow direction fdr and the stream network from the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds at 15 arc second resolution lehner et al 2008 we resampled the coarser resolution forcing data to 500 m grids using bilinear interpolation for a better representation of the water cycle as affected by different land cover and soil types 3 2 2 reference data we used the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 blended precipitation product as of the reference precipitation because lakew et al 2020 concluded that mswep performed better than other precipitation products in the study area we used reanalysis era interim data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf dee et al 2011 as a reference to evaluate other forcing variables such as temperature and solar radiation from the climate model we validated the simulated actual evapotranspiration aet against the aet from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 1a martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 which had been calibrated against fluxnet data in the nile basin with reasonable accuracy nooni et al 2019 prior studies abera et al 2017 lazin et al 2020 had also used gleam as the reference model for et validation we validated simulated discharge against daily in situ streamflow observations at eldiem provided by ethiopia s ministry of water irrigation and energy and the abay basin authority 3 3 bias removal of rcm data we removed the bias of the vital forcing fields including precipitation temperature and sw from the rcm statistically we modeled the bias as a gridded scaling factor for precipitation and a time lag for other variables we determined the scaling factor using 3 hourly data of the overlapping baseline period 1981 2005 as shown in equation 1 we then applied the gridded scaling factor to remove the precipitation bias spatially since forcing variables like temperature and sw radiation that show a diurnal cycle peaking at noon have a time lag in the climate model see fig a1 for each grid we determined the climatology for each three hourly window of a year i e from jan 1 0 00 jan 1 3 00 to dec 31 18 00 dec 31 21 00 of the baseline period and then estimated the scaling factor gridded s c a l i n g f a c t o r mmddhh we then scaled the biases for the specific hours and grids as shown in equation 2 thus we corrected the biases of the climate forcing spatially as well as temporally that is in the time lag correction we then used the corrected forcing variables as input for the hydrological simulation table 1 shows the performance matrices of the bias corrected forcing which have a high correlation greater than0 6 and a low pbias 5 with the reference data fig a1 shows that the bias correction agreed well with the reference and improved the time lag of the climate model 1 gridded s c a l i n g f a c t o r gridded c l i m a t o l o g y climate m o d e l

frequency analysis ffa with the simulated baseline and future flow from the wet miroc5 model in w o dam and with dam conditions we used a novel ffa approach metastatistical extreme value mev marani and ignaccolo 2015 distribution which utilizes not only extreme events but also ordinary events independent non zero events examples of events based approaches include annual maxima or peaks over the threshold in principle mev can improve estimation of the quantile of extreme events by utilizing available flow records and performs better for low return periods hu et al 2020 in mev the occurrence of the ordinary events and the parameters of the distribution are allowed to change year by year which is crucial for accuracy of the distribution parameters and small data sample size of a year marra et al 2019 simplified this method by considering that when the interannual variability of the parameters of the distribution of the ordinary events can be neglected the interannual variability in their occurrence can also be neglected known as simplified mev smev making the approach equivalent to ordinary statistics of finite size block maxima serinaldi et al 2020 thus the cumulative distribution function of finite size block maxima can be written as 3 ζ x f x θ n where x is the discharge peak at daily scale and f x θ is the cumulative distribution function of the ordinary events described by the array of parameters θ and n the average number of wet days in the finite size block the parameters θ of the distribution of the ordinary events are determined by gamma distribution since miniussi et al 2020 found it best fit the distribution of flood discharges to identify the independent flood events the largest flood peaks should be separated by blocks of length equal to t 10 d a y s l o g a where a is the basin area in square miles meanwhile the smallest discharge peak between two consecutive peak values below a threshold 75 equal to of the lower of the two should be rejected parameters are estimated using the peak of all sample events with l moments we compare the ffa from smev distribution against traditional extreme value methods including estimates based on annual maxima using the generalized extreme value gev distribution and the log pearson iii lp3 distributions and estimates based on threshold exceedances using the generalized pareto gp distribution we used the skill score ss as ffa accuracy matric murphy and winkler 1992 hashino et al 2007 in equation 4 4 ss ρ q 1 q 2 2 ρ q 1 q 2 σ q 1 σ q 2 2 μ q 1 μ q 1 σ q 2 2 where q 1 q 2 are the quantile estimates based on the simulated flow and the observation respectively and ρ q 1 q 2 is the correlation coefficient between q 1 and q 2 σ and μ are the standard deviation and mean of q 1 q 2 a perfect value for ss is 1 3 5 streamflow drought index we analyzed drought conditions using simulated streamflow forced by the bias corrected and downscaled csiro model dry scenario derived climate variables we did the analysis in w o dam and with dam conditions to evaluate of the role gerd in reducing future drought severity the sdi is calculated based on the cumulative streamflow volume v i k for the reference period k and for i th hydrological year as equation 5 5 sdi v i k v k s k where v k and s k are the mean and standard deviation of the cumulative streamflow volume for the reference period k here reference period is from october to september for a hydrological year table 2 shows the sdi values for different drought conditions 3 6 reservoir mass balance and hydropower generation we used the simulated inflow q in the potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and the outflow qout to compute the water balance in the gerd reservoir as written in equation 6 and determined the gerd

including the capacity of the reservoir turbine and spillway reservoir water balance and the relationship between the reservoir s elevation and storage fig 4 provides a schematic of the water balance with the design specifications of the reservoir including the elevation storage curve the reservoir bottom is at 500 m asl the turbine is at 560 m with the minimum operating water level being 590 m the main gated and auxiliary spillways are open at 625 m and 642 m respectively for reservoir outflows we considered the turbine and spillway capacity based on the water elevation in the reservoir

a year based on the drought condition from the sdi values we adjusted the hours of operation for hydropower generation during the wet and dry seasons to reduce the severity of the flood and drought conditions gerd operation hours might be adjusted based on the anticipated drought condition or the sdi values of the year here we assume that the annual sdi is predicted for the next year if the year is going to be extreme wet to mild wet then maximum hours of operation 22 to 18 h is carried out during the wet season june october to maximize the hydropower generation as well as to ensure sufficient water stored releasing water if the water level is between 590 m and 635 m in the dam for the dry season for a mild to extreme dry condition dam operation is limited to within 15 to 10 h in the wet season so that more water is available during dry season for hydropower generation 3 8 model performance metrics we used nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse pearson correlation coefficient r nse and percentage bias pbias to evaluate the model performances nse and pbias are calculated as 12 pbias i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 13 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i is the observed data s i is the simulated data and o is the mean observed data according to stehr et al 2008 an absolute value for pbias of less than 20 is considered good for nse a value greater than 0 75 is considered good while values between 0 75 and 0 36 are considered satisfactory 4 results 4 1 evaluation of et and discharge we evaluated the crest svas simulated et and flow for the baseline historical simulations driven by both downscaled miroc5 and csiro projections we compared the basin averaged simulated et with the reference et from gleam for the baseline period and compared the simulated flow at eldiem with respect to the observed flow from 1981 to 2005 as shown in fig 5 the cdf plot of historical et indicates that miroc5 simulated captures the high percentiles daily et while the et driven by csiro captures the low percentiles daily et well overall the pbias from both model miroc5 and csiro are 4 45 and 0 64 which are good again the nse for flow simulation from both miroc5 and csiro and are 0 61 0 67 respectively which are high indicating simulated flow can capture the peak discharges satisfactorily well the good validation statistics for both et and discharge indicated that the downscaled climate driven model simulations well represented the hydrological variability in the basin 4 2 climate change impact on water cycle fig 6 presents the climate change impacts on the vital hydrological components of precipitation et and discharge at eldiem stations from both miroc5 and csiro models in the three future time windows early mid and late century in rcp 4 5 upper panel the mean annual precipitation in the three windows will vary from 6 3 to 3 3 from 6 7 5 to 9 3 and 7 5 to 5 5 respectively in the wettest miroc5 and driest csiro at ubnb projections compared to the baseline period similarly in rcp 8 5 the lower panel the two models project precipitation variation ranging from 7 9 to 5 5 13 6 to 9 9 and 10 5 to 18 3 respectively in the three future windows the simulated annual et under rcp 4 5 the upper panel will vary from 4 6 to 8 1 12 6 to 9 6 and 13 7 to 12 1 in miroc5 and csiro projections while under rcp 8 5 the lower panel et will vary from 5 6 to 6 4 11 1 to 12 0 and 12 2 to 11 9 in the three future windows compared to the baseline period finally the inflow volume to the gerd reservoir under rcp 4 5 upper panel miroc5 and csiro projections indicate that annual flow will vary from 7 7 to 14 4 24 7 to 25 7 and 27 5 to 37 9 in the future time windows under rcp 8 5 lower panel annual flow variations are from 5 2 to 13 5 35 9 to 28 5 and 30 8 to 40 7 in the early mid and late century 4 3 future flood frequency analysis the ffa skill score ss of the observed flow from 1981 to 2005 at the dam location shows that smev ss 0 67 performs slightly better that other commonly used distributions gev ss 0 65 gp ss 0 55 and lp3 ss 0 68 smev also yield the best accuracy fitting the simulated discharge with an ss being 0 71 see fig 7 therefore we select smev to project future flood frequency using wet projections from the miroc5 model fig 8 shows the ffa result at eldiem without dam and with the dam condition in the baseline period the peak discharge of a 100 year flood and 10 year floods are 11 000 m3 s and 7 900 m3 s respectively under rcp 4 5 in the w o dam condition solid lines in fig 8a the peak discharge of a 100 year flood of the baseline period shifts significantly and will become a 40 year 20 year and 10 year flood respectively in the early mid and late century similarly a 10 year flood in the baseline period becomes a 5 year flood early and mid centuries and a 2 year flood late century under rcp 8 5 in the w o dam condition see fig 8b the early century flood frequency is similar to the baseline period but a 100 year flood in the baseline period shifts to 10 year and 6 year respectively in the mid and late century and a 10 year flood in the baseline period becomes 3 year and 2 year flood in the same future windows the gerd can significantly reduce future flood severity by delaying the flow under rcp 4 5 the 2 year 10 year and 100 year flood peak discharges are reduced by approximately 4 000 m3 s 5 000 m3 s and 6 000 m3 s from the w o dam condition dashed line in fig 8a under rcp 8 5 since the late and mid century floods are more frequent and severe a 10 year and a 100 year flood can be reduced by approximately 5 000 m3 s from floods for w o dam condition 4 4 future drought conditions in ubnb we evaluated the future drought severity with the projections from the driest model csiro fig 9 shows that without the dam based on the sdi values at the eldiem outlet droughts will be severe or extreme median sdi values drops below 1 5 for most of the years during the late century under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 compared to the baseline period and it will be drier during the mid and late century in rcp 8 5 than in rcp 4 5 the dam can alter or delay the reservoir outflow for hydropower generation by dam regulation we observed that during the extreme wet season the outflow from the dam could be reduced and so the flood severity again during the dry season dam could store more water and could be used for hydropower generation as well as for the downstream countries see fig a2 as shown in fig 10 we compared the annual drought conditions for w o dam and with dam conditions with the projections from the csiro model the boxplot for extreme drought under rcp 4 5 shows increased flow volume in the with dam scenario ranging from 11 27 km3 compared to the 12 20 km3 annual flow in the w o dam scenario as a result sdi values are increased above 2 improving the drought condition from extreme to severe fig 10 shows that similarly in the with dam scenario under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 drought severity can be reduced as the boxplots for extreme drought to mild drought conditions move upward or towards the wet conditions again the boxplots for mild wet to extreme wet conditions in the with dam scenario move downward or towards drier conditions reducing the flow volume or sdi values thus the dam can help to reduce the severity of the extreme wet and dry years in the future 4 5 gerd storage analysis fig 11 shows that with the projections from miroc5 wet during mid century in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 the frequency of high storage peaks will be greater than during the baseline period in the baseline period the mean observed annual dam outflow to the downstream was 45 km3 without the dam regulation with the dam this may increase to 52 1 km3 61 0 km3 and 62 2 km3 during the early mid and late centuries respectively in rcp 4 5 and to 52 9 km3 67 3 km3 and 64 7 km3 in rcp 8 5 moreover in rcp 8 5 as the reservoir storage might be high enough in 2044 and 2054 to activate the spillways prevent the dam from overtopped in contrast the projections from csiro dry in rcp 4 5 in compared to the historical outflow 45 km3 the dam outflow will be reduced to 36 4 km3 36 5 km3 and 25 9 km3 during the early mid and late century respectively and to 366 km3 30 0 km3 and 24 3 km3 in rcp 8 5 even with the highest storage the spill ways may not need to activate and for most of the years the reservoir will not be full 4 6 hydropower generation gerd is expected to provide 15 000 gwh power per year to ethiopia fig 12 shows during the baseline period hydropower generation was below the designed capacity for most years with an average generation of around 10 084 gwh miroc5 and 10 901 gwh csiro as the flow increases in miroc5 hydropower generation will increase with 11gwh csiro as the flow increases in miroc5 hydropower generation will increase with 11 783 gwh on average to a peak value of 17 166 gwh in rcp 4 5 and 12 395 on average to a peak value of 20 872 gwh in rcp 8 5 specifically in the mid and late century hydropower production will be closer to the expected production in most years however with the decreased flow from csiro projections the hydropower generation will decrease with a mean annual production of 8 805 gwh to a maximum of 17 502 in rcp 4 5 and on average 8 970 gwh to a maximum of 18 856 gwh in the rcp 8 5 scenario 5 discussion and limitations in this study we focused on the impact of climate change on the hydrological extremes floods and droughts in the ubnb so we considered the possible wettest miroc5 and driest csiro climate scenarios in the basin from the available gcm projections the corresponding future changes in the hydrological components showed variation in a containing wide range the possible changes from other gcms in between the projections indicated that the precipitation would vary from 18 3 to 13 6 and consequently the flow variation would range from 40 7 to 30 8 with chances of future droughts and floods the lower values of the dam outflow in the with dam condition compared to the w o dam condition during peak discharges from miroc5 indicate that gerd can provide additional benefits as flood protection and management from recurring floods induced by climate change moreover streamflow drought indexes of the csiro flows showed that droughts in the late century will be severe and by managing the dam the dry outflow in and wet seasons gerd can help reduce drought intensity concerns of reduced flow to sudan and egypt could be relieved in the micro5 climate change scenario the results from the wet projection of the miroc5 show that the future increase in flow close to the dam at eldiem will help achieve higher release annually around 55 km3 than the historical 45 km3 annual average to downstream egypt wheeler et al 2020 also concluded that ethiopia and sudan will benefit from the renaissance dam without water use in egypt being significantly affected however the driest projection from the csiro model shows that annual flow to the downstream countries might be reduced to 32 9 km3 from 45 km3 the historical annual average in this case careful coordination countries will be among the riparian necessary to minimize the harmful impacts of future drought risks in this study we considered the use of dam water for hydropower generation in ethiopia with inflow close to that of the baseline period from miroc5 the dam can generate an average of 10 084 gwh 10 901 csiro annually which is consistent with the production reported by eldardiry and hossain 2021 for the minimum operating level of 590 m with the future increased inflow miroc5 to the dam hydropower production will increase with an average annual production of 15 056 gwh in the mid century the increased power generation can help meet rising demand for electricity brought by a projected 120 growth in ethiopia s population by 2050 united nations 2019 on the contrary the decreased flow projections csiro will reduce the average annual hydropower generation to approximately 8 805 gwh in such a case ethiopia will need to explore other renewable energy potentials such as solar wind and geothermal energy hailu and kumsa 2020 to meet the future electricity demand results obtained in this study can help policymakers of the riparian counties with the future management of water resources as well as with agricultural planning however in this study we did not consider the aspects such as potential increases in population irrigation demand manufacturing standard of living due to affordable energy which could greatly affect the future water resources management in different sectors in the ubnb other limitations of this study include the uncertainties of the climate model errors in input may have resulted in biased hydrological impacts over the basin moreover in the simulation of the future hydrological components we did not consider the changes in land cover which may also affect the results of land surface simulations although getachew et al 2021 concluded that land use and land cover change lulc do not significantly affect future land surface simulations for the lake tana basin further analysis is required to explore its impact in the ubnb another limitation of this study is the assumption of stationarity in the bias correction of gcms to achieve realistic hydrological components we needed to bias correct the climate data and we assumed the present bias would be the same as the future in practice this stationarity is not guaranteed moreover we the caution that absolute magnitude of hydropower energy or installed power capacity may vary from what is supplied by the ethiopian energy company the variation may be attributed to operation e g peak operation the inflow data considered or the number of turbines used 6 conclusions in this study we predicted the impact of future climate on the upper blue nile basin water cycle including flood frequency and drought conditions using a physically based hydrological model driven by sub daily and downscaled climate projections using the simulated future discharge at the eldiem basin we further predicted the reservoir mass balance and hydropower generation of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam thus along with presenting the future climate impacts on the basin hydrology this study attempts to identify the climate driven extreme hydrological events in the future using the two most extreme and contrasting climate model simulations and explores the water resource infrastructure management as a mitigation strategy the findings of this study indicate the following future impacts of climate change in the ubnb the gerd may help provide future flood protection as well as minimize future extreme drought severity through managing dam releases the wet precipitation projection indicates that future increased electricity demand and expected hydropower generation can be met while the dry projection suggests exploring other renewable energy to meet future electricity demand in ethiopia the dry scenario indicates reduction in the future annual flow at the ubnb outlet so a careful coordination among the transboundary countries is necessary regarding gerd release amount to tackle probable future extreme dry years this study only considered uncertainties associated with the contrasting climate change simulations in future studies we could include other factors such as changes in the land use water and energy demand for increased population human impacts and eco system to present more realistic scenarios of future water use moreover by integrating surface and subsurface hydrology future groundwater potential khadim et al 2020 and food security yang et al 2021 the future water energy and food nexus can

2638,climate change poses a great threat to society through its effects on extreme hydrological events floods and droughts and the sustainable development coping with climate change requires a better awareness of the possible impacts to inform climate adaptation strategies in this study we investigated the climate projections from two contrasting gcms wet scenario from miroc5 and dry scenario from csiro and quantified the possible outcomes in terms of hydrological components of the upper blue nile basin ubnb these two climate projection scenarios show that the overall precipitation change in the early 2011 2040 mid 2041 2070 and late century 2071 2100 over the ubnb may vary from 18 3 to 13 6 of the baseline annual precipitation of 1350 mm the hydrological simulations over the basin from our study showed that evapotranspiration may vary between 13 7 and 12 1 of the average annual total actual et of 710 mm and the flow at the basin outlet may range between 40 7 and 30 8 of the mean annual total flow volume of 45 billion cubic meters as a result the wet projection exhibited more frequent floods while the dry projection showed severe droughts specifically in the late century we also examined the role of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd designed for hydropower generation in moderating these potential future climate hydrological extremes our findings indicate that gerd operations can help reduce downstream flood and drought severity by managing flow releases thus this study illustrates the most possible extreme hydrological events in the ubnb due to climate change and demonstrates the degree to which gerd operations can help reduce the impact of these extremes downstream the findings and data generated in this study will aid understanding the importance of sustainable water management and reservoir operation that caters to both hydropower generation and recurring floods and droughts keywords hydrological model crest svas upper blue nile ethiopia water budget evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the changing climate poses a great threat to sustainable development in large parts of the world the adverse impacts of climate change take the form of heat waves sea level rise exacerbating extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods these extreme events can create extensive social agricultural economic and public health damages handmer et al 2012 climate change also affects the availability of water resources by influencing hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and temperature huntington 2006 the upper blue nile basin ubnb in ethiopia is expected to be greatly affected by climate change haile et al 2020 because the complex topography of the basin produces heterogenous climatic conditions its eastern highland experiences cooler temperatures and less precipitation compared to the western lowlands abera et al 2017 analysis of the climate change in this main tributary to the nile river is vital because the basin is transboundary with egypt and sudan and contributes more than 60 of the total flow to the sudan border roth et al 2018 any significant alternation in the basin hydrology will affect the flow of nile the world s largest river and the riparian countries of the basin moreover climate change presents a huge challenge to upstream ethiopia which is one of the world s most drought prone countries haile et al 2020 in some years ethiopia experiences unpredictable excessive rain and in other years low rainfall accumulations in the wet season the lowlands of the basin are vulnerable to high temperatures and prolonged droughts while the highlands may suffer from irregular but intense rainfall mofa 2018 the disparity regarding the contribution and consumption of the nile water in the transboundary nations has always been an issue of water disputes di nunzio 2013 for instance ethiopia contributes the main water volume of the nile river whereas it withdraws only about 3 km3 3 4 of its water annually from the river jeuland et al 2017 egypt on the other hand depends on the nile for 97 of its water supply and as of 2013 accounted for water withdrawals of 55 5 km3 out of the river s total annual flow of 84 km3 johnston 2013 additionally although the highlands of ethiopia offer the best hydropower sites in the world with an exploitable potential of 45 000 mw less than 25 of it is utilized tafesse et al 2021 hailu and kumsa 2020 ethiopia s annual per capita electricity consumption was 65 kw hours kwh in 2013 which was much lower than 488 kwh the annual average of sub saharan african countries and worldwide average of 3 104 kwh kumagai 2016 to increase the per capita electricity consumption as well as to meet the demand from its increasing population the ethiopian government is constructing the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd at the outlet of the ubnb at the border of sudan and ethiopia after completion gerd will be one of the largest dams in africa with a storage capacity of 74 km3 while ethiopia expects gerd to meet its increasing demand for domestic electricity allam and eltahir 2019 egypt is concerned that the dam will reduce inflow to the downstream dam the high aswan dam hence analysis of the effects of future climate and dam operation on the hydrological components in ubnb will contribute scientific knowledge to support negotiations among the transboundary nations regarding the nile water use predictions from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 under different representative concentration pathways rcps have made it possible to analyze impacts of climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the blue nile river basin due to the geographical political and socioeconomic importance ubnb has been studied extensively by prior studies yet research findings in this domain remain controversial for instance different trends and magnitudes have been reported in terms of changes of hydrological components kim and kaluarachchi 2009 predicted an average increase of 4 in the annual runoff of the blue nile by 2050 using six general circulation models gcms with a two layer monthly water balance model similarly soliman et al 2009 reported an overall increase in annual flow of about 1 5 with a 10 increase during the wet season in the blue nile during 2034 55 using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as inputs from a regional climate model rcm to a distributed monthly rainfall runoff model aich et al 2014 also reported an increase in discharge and high flows with a longer and more intense rainy season and frequent flooding expected in the future for the ubnb using bias corrected data from five gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 to the contrary some studies have reported future decreases in precipitation and runoff for the ubnb in an analysis of 17 bias corrected and statistically downscaled gcms elshamy et al 2009 predicted an increase in pet of 2 to 14 with an average reduction of 15 in the flow of the blue nile by the end of the 21st century cherie 2013 projected a reduction in the flow from 10 to 61 depending on the time slices the 2050 s and 2090 s by using three statistically downscaled gcms with the soil water assessment tool swat haile et al 2017 investigated the impact of global warming under a 2 c threshold with a slight change in precipitation 2 8 to 2 7 for blue nile basin hydrology and projected a decrease in the streamflow of around 10 using six dynamically downscaled gcms girma 2013 used two rcms the cosmo climate limited area model cclm and the regional atmosphere model remo downscaled from echam5 gcm and produced widely varying results in terms of runoff ranging from 9 to 10 from the cclm and 103 to 141 for remo mengistu et al 2021 also used cclm from three cmip5 gcms in swat and projected an increase of 27 in pet and a decrease of 22 7 to 1 7 in water yield in the ubnb other studies have projected contrasting impacts of future climate on different parts of the nile river beyene et al 2010 estimated a change in flow at the high aswan dam ranging from 16 to 11 using 11 bias corrected statistically downscaled gcms with the variable infiltration capacity vic model siam and eltahir 2017 reported that the long term mean and standard deviation of the total annual river flow of the nile will increase in the 21st century by about 15 and 50 respectively based on their analysis using 18 cmip5 gcms moreover according to ipcc 2021 projections from the cmip6 multi model ensemble mean indicate increases in heavy precipitation although decreases in mean precipitation in the mid 21st century altogether the discrepancies in terms of magnitude and sign in the changes in the hydrological components projected by the studies mentioned above indicate the uncertainties and limitations of gcms as well as of the simulation methods parameters spatiotemporal resolutions and calibration schemes adopted in the various hydrological models to account for the uncertainties associated with different gcm projections and for better preparedness against future extreme events we selected two gcms based on the precipitation trends one that projects the wettest conditions and another that indicates the driest condition in the future in ubnb thus in this study our objectives are 1 study the future climate impacts on the hydrological extremes in the ubnb 2 analyze the climate change impacts on the future hydropower production of gerd and determine how the downstream counties will be affected by the altered flows due to the dam and future climate as well to do so we used the downscaled climate forcing of the selected gcms from an rcm the rossby centre regional atmospheric model version 4 rca4 at 3 hourly and 50 km resolution we first removed the bias from the climate forcing against reference reanalysis data era interim we then simulated the hydrological components evapotranspiration and discharge with the bias adjusted forcing and calibrated the fully distributed hydrological model coupled routing and excess storage crest shen and anagnostou 2017 we finally analyzed the flood frequency and drought conditions in the ubnb with the simulated current and future flows at the basin outlet eldiem close to the gerd dam we analyzed future floods and droughts in w o dam and with dam scenarios to anticipate the probable changes induced by the future climate and gerd respectively thus comparing the results of these two conditions w o dam and with dam we examined the role of the dam gerd in reducing flood drought severity projected in the future extreme climate scenarios this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area we describe the input data model framework and methodology in section 3 and present the results in section 4 followed by a discussion in section 5 and concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area 2 1 basin description the ubnb shown in fig 1 is the largest tributary of the nile river and has a drainage area of around 176 000 km2 it extends from the lake tana highlands to the sudanese border at eldiem conway 2000 contributing 60 of the discharge to the main nile basin it is referred to as the water tower of northeastern africa conway and hulme 1993 the topography of the ubnb is heterogeneous and complex fig 1 shows relatively high terrain elevations ranging from 490 m asl near the ethiopia sudan border to 4 260 m asl around the central part of the basin its climate varies from arid to semiarid with mean annual precipitation of 925 to 1 845 mm conway 1997 2000 the mean annual temperature is about 18 5 c kim et al 2008 and the annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated 1 100 mm kim and hogue 2008 2 2 gerd description gerd is located 25 km east of the border between sudan and ethiopia the dam has 74 km3 storage capacity and 1 700 km2 reservoir area three spillways fig 3 shows a typical cross section of the dam gerd has two powerhouses of approximately 6 000 mw installed turbine capacity the right powerhouse has 10 francis turbines with 3 750 mw total installed capacity while the left has 6 francis turbines with 2 250 mw installed capacity each turbine has 270 m3 s flow capacity according to the ethiopian electric power corporation eepco turbine efficiency is assumed to be 95 abdelazim et al 2020 gerd will release the water from the turbines for power generation if its reservoir water level is above the minimum operating level of 590 m during high floods when the reservoir water level exceeds the spillway crest level 642 m water can be released through any of the three spillways the relationship between the reservoir water level and reservoir volume is depicted in fig 2 gerd is expected to provide approximately 15 000 gwh of electricity annually to upstream ethiopia 3 methodology this section provides an overview of the hydrological model climate projections and reference data we used in the study and it describes our methods for adjusting the bias of the climate forcing and for our analysis of the reservoir mass balances flood frequency analysis drought conditions and hydropower generation in future climate scenarios fig 2 provides a schematic of the workflow we adopted summarizing the data and methods it shows the selected gcms and required forcing variables in crest svas with the simulated flow at the basin outlet we then examine the role of dam for future flood and drought protection by considering w o dam and with dam scenarios we adjusted the dam operation hours in the wet and dry seasons based on the annual drought condition in the basin 3 1 hydrological model crest svas overview in this study we used the coupled routing and excess storage hydrological model crest shen and anagnostou 2017 to simulate the water cycle by physically closing water and energy budgets in the soil vegetation atmosphere snow svas system the model can simulate water cycle components at high spatiotemporal 3 hourly and 500 m resolution for long periods the hydrological processes in crest svas include interception of the rainfall evapotranspiration et infiltration of the through fall in soil layers and finally the runoff generation in the routing process a fully distributed linear reservoir routing fdlrr module estimates the channel discharge using the surface and sub surface runoff shen et al 2017 the locally calibrated crest svas has been shown to outperform the existing global models in the ubnb for both et and discharge simulation lazin et al 2020 it can also provide a better estimation of inflow for the local reservoir koga management 3 2 data 3 2 1 climate data we forced the

response of the basin to future climate we retrieved the climate scenarios from an rcm the rossby centre atmospheric model version 4 rca4 for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 https esgf node llnl gov search esgf llnl in this rcm the variables are downscaled to 3 hourly and 50 km from cmip5 gcms since our objective was to analyze the impact of future extremes we selected the wettest and driest gcms from all available downscaled gcm products in the rca4 model using the annual precipitation change against the baseline 1976 2005 as the criteria as fig 3 shows model for interdisciplinary research on climate miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 projects the wettest precipitation trend in all three future time windows early century 2011 40 mid century 2041 70 and late century 2071 2100 whereas commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro collier et al 2011 indicates the driest condition we first calibrated crest svas simulation results et and discharge using the historical baseline period 1981 2005 downscaled forcing variables from these two gcm and then used the calibrated parameters in future et and discharge simulations we also used a dynamic remote sensing product the leaf area index lai from the global land surface satellite glass dataset at 8 day intervals from 1981 to 2014 and we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mod12q1 for 2015 to represent the land cover we did not consider any projection for the lai and land cover and used the latest data on the present climate for future scenarios to compute the soil hydraulic properties from africa soilgrids hengl et al 2015 in 0 2 m six layered soil we used a model developed by saxton and rawls 2006 we collected the terrain properties of the basin such as the digital elevation model dem the flow direction fdr and the stream network from the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds at 15 arc second resolution lehner et al 2008 we resampled the coarser resolution forcing data to 500 m grids using bilinear interpolation for a better representation of the water cycle as affected by different land cover and soil types 3 2 2 reference data we used the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 blended precipitation product as of the reference precipitation because lakew et al 2020 concluded that mswep performed better than other precipitation products in the study area we used reanalysis era interim data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasting ecmwf dee et al 2011 as a reference to evaluate other forcing variables such as temperature and solar radiation from the climate model we validated the simulated actual evapotranspiration aet against the aet from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 1a martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 which had been calibrated against fluxnet data in the nile basin with reasonable accuracy nooni et al 2019 prior studies abera et al 2017 lazin et al 2020 had also used gleam as the reference model for et validation we validated simulated discharge against daily in situ streamflow observations at eldiem provided by ethiopia s ministry of water irrigation and energy and the abay basin authority 3 3 bias removal of rcm data we removed the bias of the vital forcing fields including precipitation temperature and sw from the rcm statistically we modeled the bias as a gridded scaling factor for precipitation and a time lag for other variables we determined the scaling factor using 3 hourly data of the overlapping baseline period 1981 2005 as shown in equation 1 we then applied the gridded scaling factor to remove the precipitation bias spatially since forcing variables like temperature and sw radiation that show a diurnal cycle peaking at noon have a time lag in the climate model see fig a1 for each grid we determined the climatology for each three hourly window of a year i e from jan 1 0 00 jan 1 3 00 to dec 31 18 00 dec 31 21 00 of the baseline period and then estimated the scaling factor gridded s c a l i n g f a c t o r mmddhh we then scaled the biases for the specific hours and grids as shown in equation 2 thus we corrected the biases of the climate forcing spatially as well as temporally that is in the time lag correction we then used the corrected forcing variables as input for the hydrological simulation table 1 shows the performance matrices of the bias corrected forcing which have a high correlation greater than0 6 and a low pbias 5 with the reference data fig a1 shows that the bias correction agreed well with the reference and improved the time lag of the climate model 1 gridded s c a l i n g f a c t o r gridded c l i m a t o l o g y climate m o d e l

frequency analysis ffa with the simulated baseline and future flow from the wet miroc5 model in w o dam and with dam conditions we used a novel ffa approach metastatistical extreme value mev marani and ignaccolo 2015 distribution which utilizes not only extreme events but also ordinary events independent non zero events examples of events based approaches include annual maxima or peaks over the threshold in principle mev can improve estimation of the quantile of extreme events by utilizing available flow records and performs better for low return periods hu et al 2020 in mev the occurrence of the ordinary events and the parameters of the distribution are allowed to change year by year which is crucial for accuracy of the distribution parameters and small data sample size of a year marra et al 2019 simplified this method by considering that when the interannual variability of the parameters of the distribution of the ordinary events can be neglected the interannual variability in their occurrence can also be neglected known as simplified mev smev making the approach equivalent to ordinary statistics of finite size block maxima serinaldi et al 2020 thus the cumulative distribution function of finite size block maxima can be written as 3 ζ x f x θ n where x is the discharge peak at daily scale and f x θ is the cumulative distribution function of the ordinary events described by the array of parameters θ and n the average number of wet days in the finite size block the parameters θ of the distribution of the ordinary events are determined by gamma distribution since miniussi et al 2020 found it best fit the distribution of flood discharges to identify the independent flood events the largest flood peaks should be separated by blocks of length equal to t 10 d a y s l o g a where a is the basin area in square miles meanwhile the smallest discharge peak between two consecutive peak values below a threshold 75 equal to of the lower of the two should be rejected parameters are estimated using the peak of all sample events with l moments we compare the ffa from smev distribution against traditional extreme value methods including estimates based on annual maxima using the generalized extreme value gev distribution and the log pearson iii lp3 distributions and estimates based on threshold exceedances using the generalized pareto gp distribution we used the skill score ss as ffa accuracy matric murphy and winkler 1992 hashino et al 2007 in equation 4 4 ss ρ q 1 q 2 2 ρ q 1 q 2 σ q 1 σ q 2 2 μ q 1 μ q 1 σ q 2 2 where q 1 q 2 are the quantile estimates based on the simulated flow and the observation respectively and ρ q 1 q 2 is the correlation coefficient between q 1 and q 2 σ and μ are the standard deviation and mean of q 1 q 2 a perfect value for ss is 1 3 5 streamflow drought index we analyzed drought conditions using simulated streamflow forced by the bias corrected and downscaled csiro model dry scenario derived climate variables we did the analysis in w o dam and with dam conditions to evaluate of the role gerd in reducing future drought severity the sdi is calculated based on the cumulative streamflow volume v i k for the reference period k and for i th hydrological year as equation 5 5 sdi v i k v k s k where v k and s k are the mean and standard deviation of the cumulative streamflow volume for the reference period k here reference period is from october to september for a hydrological year table 2 shows the sdi values for different drought conditions 3 6 reservoir mass balance and hydropower generation we used the simulated inflow q in the potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation and the outflow qout to compute the water balance in the gerd reservoir as written in equation 6 and determined the gerd daily storage sgerdi 6 s ger d i s ger d i 1 q in p e t p r e c gerd q out where sgerdi is the reservoir storage on the i t h day and the outflow is the sum of the turbine flow qturbine for generation and spillway released flow qspillway if activated by floods as written in equation 7 7 q out q spillway q turbines the hydropower generation in the gerd reservoir depends on a few constraints including the capacity of the reservoir turbine and spillway reservoir water balance and the relationship between the reservoir s elevation and storage fig 4 provides a schematic of the water balance with the design specifications of the reservoir including the elevation storage curve the reservoir bottom is at 500 m asl the turbine is at 560 m with the minimum operating water level being 590 m the main gated and auxiliary spillways are open at 625 m and 642 m respectively for reservoir outflows we considered the turbine and spillway capacity based on the water elevation in the reservoir described below 8 q turbines 0 373 k m 3 d a y w h e n e l e v a t i o n 590 9 q spillway 1 573 k m 3 d a y w h e n e l e v a t i o n 640 we estimated reservoirwaterleve l i from the elevation storage curve fig 4 the hydropower production hp is formulated in equation 10 10 hp γ η q turbines h gerd where γ specific weight of water 9807 n m3 h gerd is the head above the turbine as in equation 11 and η efficiency of the turbine 11 h gerd r e s e r v o i r w a t e r l e v e l i t u r b i n e l e v e l 560 m 3 7 gerd operation based on sdi for gerd reservoir operation at first we determined sdi for a year based on the drought condition from the sdi values we adjusted the hours of operation for hydropower generation during the wet and dry seasons to reduce the severity of the flood and drought conditions gerd operation hours might be adjusted based on the anticipated drought condition or the sdi values of the year here we assume that the annual sdi is predicted for the next year if the year is going to be extreme wet to mild wet then maximum hours of operation 22 to 18 h is carried out during the wet season june october to maximize the hydropower generation as well as to ensure sufficient water stored releasing water if the water level is between 590 m and 635 m in the dam for the dry season for a mild to extreme dry condition dam operation is limited to within 15 to 10 h in the wet season so that more water is available during dry season for hydropower generation 3 8 model performance metrics we used nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse pearson correlation coefficient r nse and percentage bias pbias to evaluate the model performances nse and pbias are calculated as 12 pbias i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 13 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i is the observed data s i is the simulated data and o is the mean observed data according to stehr et al 2008 an absolute value for pbias of less than 20 is considered good for nse a value greater than 0 75 is considered good while values between 0 75 and 0 36 are considered satisfactory 4 results 4 1 evaluation of et and discharge we evaluated the crest svas simulated et and flow for the baseline historical simulations driven by both downscaled miroc5 and csiro projections we compared the basin averaged simulated et with the reference et from gleam for the baseline period and compared the simulated flow at eldiem with respect to the observed flow from 1981 to 2005 as shown in fig 5 the cdf plot of historical et indicates that miroc5 simulated captures the high percentiles daily et while the et driven by csiro captures the low percentiles daily et well overall the pbias from both model miroc5 and csiro are 4 45 and 0 64 which are good again the nse for flow simulation from both miroc5 and csiro and are 0 61 0 67 respectively which are high indicating simulated flow can capture the peak discharges satisfactorily well the good validation statistics for both et and discharge indicated that the downscaled climate driven model simulations well represented the hydrological variability in the basin 4 2 climate change impact on water cycle fig 6 presents the climate change impacts on the vital hydrological components of precipitation et and discharge at eldiem stations from both miroc5 and csiro models in the three future time windows early mid and late century in rcp 4 5 upper panel the mean annual precipitation in the three windows will vary from 6 3 to 3 3 from 6 7 5 to 9 3 and 7 5 to 5 5 respectively in the wettest miroc5 and driest csiro at ubnb projections compared to the baseline period similarly in rcp 8 5 the lower panel the two models project precipitation variation ranging from 7 9 to 5 5 13 6 to 9 9 and 10 5 to 18 3 respectively in the three future windows the simulated annual et under rcp 4 5 the upper panel will vary from 4 6 to 8 1 12 6 to 9 6 and 13 7 to 12 1 in miroc5 and csiro projections while under rcp 8 5 the lower panel et will vary from 5 6 to 6 4 11 1 to 12 0 and 12 2 to 11 9 in the three future windows compared to the baseline period finally the inflow volume to the gerd reservoir under rcp 4 5 upper panel miroc5 and csiro projections indicate that annual flow will vary from 7 7 to 14 4 24 7 to 25 7 and 27 5 to 37 9 in the future time windows under rcp 8 5 lower panel annual flow variations are from 5 2 to 13 5 35 9 to 28 5 and 30 8 to 40 7 in the early mid and late century 4 3 future flood frequency analysis the ffa skill score ss of the observed flow from 1981 to 2005 at the dam location shows that smev ss 0 67 performs slightly better that other commonly used distributions gev ss 0 65 gp ss 0 55 and lp3 ss 0 68 smev also yield the best accuracy fitting the simulated discharge with an ss being 0 71 see fig 7 therefore we select smev to project future flood frequency using wet projections from the miroc5 model fig 8 shows the ffa result at eldiem without dam and with the dam condition in the baseline period the peak discharge of a 100 year flood and 10 year floods are 11 000 m3 s and 7 900 m3 s respectively under rcp 4 5 in the w o dam condition solid lines in fig 8a the peak discharge of a 100 year flood of the baseline period shifts significantly and will become a 40 year 20 year and 10 year flood respectively in the early mid and late century similarly a 10 year flood in the baseline period becomes a 5 year flood early and mid centuries and a 2 year flood late century under rcp 8 5 in the w o dam condition see fig 8b the early century flood frequency is similar to the baseline period but a 100 year flood in the baseline period shifts to 10 year and 6 year respectively in the mid and late century and a 10 year flood in the baseline period becomes 3 year and 2 year flood in the same future windows the gerd can significantly reduce future flood severity by delaying the flow under rcp 4 5 the 2 year 10 year and 100 year flood peak discharges are reduced by approximately 4 000 m3 s 5 000 m3 s and 6 000 m3 s from the w o dam condition dashed line in fig 8a under rcp 8 5 since the late and mid century floods are more frequent and severe a 10 year and a 100 year flood can be reduced by approximately 5 000 m3 s from floods for w o dam condition 4 4 future drought conditions in ubnb we evaluated the future drought severity with the projections from the driest model csiro fig 9 shows that without the dam based on the sdi values at the eldiem outlet droughts will be severe or extreme median sdi values drops below 1 5 for most of the years during the late century under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 compared to the baseline period and it will be drier during the mid and late century in rcp 8 5 than in rcp 4 5 the dam can alter or delay the reservoir outflow for hydropower generation by dam regulation we observed that during the extreme wet season the outflow from the dam could be reduced and so the flood severity again during the dry season dam could store more water and could be used for hydropower generation as well as for the downstream countries see fig a2 as shown in fig 10 we compared the annual drought conditions for w o dam and with dam conditions with the projections from the csiro model the boxplot for extreme drought under rcp 4 5 shows increased flow volume in the with dam scenario ranging from 11 27 km3 compared to the 12 20 km3 annual flow in the w o dam scenario as a result sdi values are increased above 2 improving the drought condition from extreme to severe fig 10 shows that similarly in the with dam scenario under both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 drought severity can be reduced as the boxplots for extreme drought to mild drought conditions move upward or towards the wet conditions again the boxplots for mild wet to extreme wet conditions in the with dam scenario move downward or towards drier conditions reducing the flow volume or sdi values thus the dam can help to reduce the severity of the extreme wet and dry years in the future 4 5 gerd storage analysis fig 11 shows that with the projections from miroc5 wet during mid century in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 the frequency of high storage peaks will be greater than during the baseline period in the baseline period the mean observed annual dam outflow to the downstream was 45 km3 without the dam regulation with the dam this may increase to 52 1 km3 61 0 km3 and 62 2 km3 during the early mid and late centuries respectively in rcp 4 5 and to 52 9 km3 67 3 km3 and 64 7 km3 in rcp 8 5 moreover in rcp 8 5 as the reservoir storage might be high enough in 2044 and 2054 to activate the spillways prevent the dam from overtopped in contrast the projections from csiro dry in rcp 4 5 in compared to the historical outflow 45 km3 the dam outflow will be reduced to 36 4 km3 36 5 km3 and 25 9 km3 during the early mid and late century respectively and to 366 km3 30 0 km3 and 24 3 km3 in rcp 8 5 even with the highest storage the spill ways may not need to activate and for most of the years the reservoir will not be full 4 6 hydropower generation gerd is expected to provide 15 000 gwh power per year to ethiopia fig 12 shows during the baseline period hydropower generation was below the designed capacity for most years with an average generation of around 10 084 gwh miroc5 and 10 901 gwh csiro as the flow increases in miroc5 hydropower generation will increase with 11gwh csiro as the flow increases in miroc5 hydropower generation will increase with 11 783 gwh on average to a peak value of 17 166 gwh in rcp 4 5 and 12 395 on average to a peak value of 20 872 gwh in rcp 8 5 specifically in the mid and late century hydropower production will be closer to the expected production in most years however with the decreased flow from csiro projections the hydropower generation will decrease with a mean annual production of 8 805 gwh to a maximum of 17 502 in rcp 4 5 and on average 8 970 gwh to a maximum of 18 856 gwh in the rcp 8 5 scenario 5 discussion and limitations in this study we focused on the impact of climate change on the hydrological extremes floods and droughts in the ubnb so we considered the possible wettest miroc5 and driest csiro climate scenarios in the basin from the available gcm projections the corresponding future changes in the hydrological components showed variation in a containing wide range the possible changes from other gcms in between the projections indicated that the precipitation would vary from 18 3 to 13 6 and consequently the flow variation would range from 40 7 to 30 8 with chances of future droughts and floods the lower values of the dam outflow in the with dam condition compared to the w o dam condition during peak discharges from miroc5 indicate that gerd can provide additional benefits as flood protection and management from recurring floods induced by climate change moreover streamflow drought indexes of the csiro flows showed that droughts in the late century will be severe and by managing the dam the dry outflow in and wet seasons gerd can help reduce drought intensity concerns of reduced flow to sudan and egypt could be relieved in the micro5 climate change scenario the results from the wet projection of the miroc5 show that the future increase in flow close to the dam at eldiem will help achieve higher release annually around 55 km3 than the historical 45 km3 annual average to downstream egypt wheeler et al 2020 also concluded that ethiopia and sudan will benefit from the renaissance dam without water use in egypt being significantly affected however the driest projection from the csiro model shows that annual flow to the downstream countries might be reduced to 32 9 km3 from 45 km3 the historical annual average in this case careful coordination countries will be among the riparian necessary to minimize the harmful impacts of future drought risks in this study we considered the use of dam water for hydropower generation in ethiopia with inflow close to that of the baseline period from miroc5 the dam can generate an average of 10 084 gwh 10 901 csiro annually which is consistent with the production reported by eldardiry and hossain 2021 for the minimum operating level of 590 m with the future increased inflow miroc5 to the dam hydropower production will increase with an average annual production of 15 056 gwh in the mid century the increased power generation can help meet rising demand for electricity brought by a projected 120 growth in ethiopia s population by 2050 united nations 2019 on the contrary the decreased flow projections csiro will reduce the average annual hydropower generation to approximately 8 805 gwh in such a case ethiopia will need to explore other renewable energy potentials such as solar wind and geothermal energy hailu and kumsa 2020 to meet the future electricity demand results obtained in this study can help policymakers of the riparian counties with the future management of water resources as well as with agricultural planning however in this study we did not consider the aspects such as potential increases in population irrigation demand manufacturing standard of living due to affordable energy which could greatly affect the future water resources management in different sectors in the ubnb other limitations of this study include the uncertainties of the climate model errors in input may have resulted in biased hydrological impacts over the basin moreover in the simulation of the future hydrological components we did not consider the changes in land cover which may also affect the results of land surface simulations although getachew et al 2021 concluded that land use and land cover change lulc do not significantly affect future land surface simulations for the lake tana basin further analysis is required to explore its impact in the ubnb another limitation of this study is the assumption of stationarity in the bias correction of gcms to achieve realistic hydrological components we needed to bias correct the climate data and we assumed the present bias would be the same as the future in practice this stationarity is not guaranteed moreover we the caution that absolute magnitude of hydropower energy or installed power capacity may vary from what is supplied by the ethiopian energy company the variation may be attributed to operation e g peak operation the inflow data considered or the number of turbines used 6 conclusions in this study we predicted the impact of future climate on the upper blue nile basin water cycle including flood frequency and drought conditions using a physically based hydrological model driven by sub daily and downscaled climate projections using the simulated future discharge at the eldiem basin we further predicted the reservoir mass balance and hydropower generation of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam thus along with presenting the future climate impacts on the basin hydrology this study attempts to identify the climate driven extreme hydrological events in the future using the two most extreme and contrasting climate model simulations and explores the water resource infrastructure management as a mitigation strategy the findings of this study indicate the following future impacts of climate change in the ubnb the gerd may help provide future flood protection as well as minimize future extreme drought severity through managing dam releases the wet precipitation projection indicates that future increased electricity demand and expected hydropower generation can be met while the dry projection suggests exploring other renewable energy to meet future electricity demand in ethiopia the dry scenario indicates reduction in the future annual flow at the ubnb outlet so a careful coordination among the transboundary countries is necessary regarding gerd release amount to tackle probable future extreme dry years this study only considered uncertainties associated with the contrasting climate change simulations in future studies we could include other factors such as changes in the land use water and energy demand for increased population human impacts and eco system to present more realistic scenarios of future water use moreover by integrating surface and subsurface hydrology future groundwater potential khadim et al 2020 and food security yang et al 2021 the future water energy and food nexus can also be investigated credit authorship contribution statement rehenuma lazin writing original draft software validation formal analysis xinyi shen methodology writing review editing supervision semu

2639,an inland river grassland basin is a fragile ecosystem and precipitation is of great significance to its resilience however the knowledge of where precipitation forming water vapor originated is not well understood limiting the predictability of future precipitation provided climate change the objective of this study was to characterize the hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotopes and hydro chemical compositions of precipitation as well as decipher atmospheric water vapor sources in a typical eurasian steppe river basin in this regard this study collected 59 water samples from 44 storm events in 2019 and 2020 the samples were analyzed in our laboratory for ions δd and δ18o which in turn were used to examine the stable isotopic features hydro chemical characteristics and water vapor transport at different temporal scales by a backward trajectory model and correlation and redundancy analyses the results showed negative δd and δ18o during the wet season with a trend of positive deuterium excess indicating that precipitation effect was significant in comparison with a linear model of global meteoric water levels the local meteoric water lines had smaller slopes and intercepts with a maximum slope in august and a minimum slope in july in addition hco3 and ca2 were the primary hydro chemical ions in precipitation ca2 and mg2 were significantly correlated with hco3 and na indicating that they shared terrestrial and marine sources nh4 originated mainly from human activities and chemical reactions whereas k originated primarily from continental and marine processes further the atmospheric water vapor was mainly transported from the northeast northwest and southeast directions into the study basin as affected by the westerly wind circulation the east asian summer monsoon northeast anticyclone circulation and local evapotranspiration moreover the water vapor was from both onsite and offsite sources over 40 from eurasia 10 to 25 from the arctic ocean and 35 to 45 from the pacific ocean keywords climate dryland extreme weather hyplist inland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than 40 of global grasslands have experienced degradation among which arid and semiarid grasslands present a more fragile ecosystem than humid and subhumid grasslands li et al 2019a fang et al 2021a as the main replenishment source of land water resources atmospheric water vapor is transported and condensed to generate precipitation as part of the circulation of a weather system guo et al 2022a gou et al 2022 the precipitation process is an indispensable part of the hydrologic cycle and thus is a key factor in attaining sustainable development of water resources wang et al 2021a however in the context of global warming extreme weather and climate events are expected to occur more frequently as influenced by multiple factors li et al 2021 el niño southern oscillation enso which is one of the important stress factors affecting precipitation as to ocean atmosphere interactions not only has a significant impact on tropical atmospheric circulation but also has an indirect impact on atmospheric circulation in middle and high latitudes he et al 2022 xie et al 2021 in recent years practical applications mandate a good understanding of the interrelation between large scale atmospheric circulation and watershed scale precipitation leading to the evolution of single qualitative analyses to comprehensive quantitative assessments most previous studies were conducted in major river basins zhao et al 2011 li et al 2016

al 2021b and monsoon regions ansari et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 the general approach of this study was to examine water vapor sources and influential factors by analyzing stable isotopes and hydro chemical compositions in precipitation bedaso and wu 2020 xu et al 2020a cai and tian 2016 ma et al 2012 wei et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 and simulate the paths and allocation of water vapor in terms of meteorologic data li et al 2019b wang et al 2018 xie et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a in contrast few studies have been conducted in typical eurasian steppe river basins which are located at the edge of the east asian summer monsoon and far from any ocean to protect the vast vulnerable steppe ecosystems it is imperative to understand and quantify water vapor sources of precipitation galewsky et al 2016 heydarizad et al 2021 ma et al 2018 song et al 2022 the objective of this study was to characterize the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and hydro chemical compositions of precipitation as well as to decipher atmospheric water vapor sources of inland steppe river basins using the balager river basin of inner mongolia as the testbed herein the underlying assumption is that these stable isotopes were affected by hydroclimatic processes and could be used to characterize precipitation forming water vapor sources in terms of the isotope fractionation theory deuterium in precipitation could deviate from an equilibrium level by varying degrees depending on how the precipitation is formed such a deviation is defined as deuterium surplus or excess equation 2 this study applied the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit model which is described in subsection 2 4 to identify the sources and proportions of water vapor advancing scientific understanding of the hydrologic cycle and water resources availability in such a fragile steppe ecosystem the unique contribution of this study was to present an innovative approach for deciphering atmospheric water vapor sources of precipitation in inland steppe basins where fragile ecosystems would jeopardize their functionalities and services because of climate change and human disturbance as detailed in the following context this study was based on data collected in one typical steppe basin for two years in the future it would be preferable to collect data for more years and in multiple steppe basins to better capture spatiotemporal variations of the isotopes and hydro chemicals as influenced by heterogenic environments and climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

september of 2019 and 2020 in accordance with the collection and preservation of atmospheric precipitation samples gb13580 2 1992 samr 1992 a total of 59 water samples were collected from 44 precipitation events each of which occurred between 8 00 pm of a day to 8 00 pm of the next day the collected samples were placed in polyethylene bottles sealed with parafilm and stored in a refrigerator 0 to 4 c in the correspondence s research laboratory each sample was filtered by a 0 2 μm filter membrane and then analyzed to determine isotopic composition of hydrogen δd isotopic composition of oxygen δ18o k ca2 na mg2 nh4 cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 laboratory analyses were conducted jointly by the inner mongolia autonomous region key laboratory of water resources protection and utilization and the inner mongolia agriculture animal husbandry fishery and biological experiment research center of inner mongolia agricultural university hco3 was determined by acid base titration while k ca2 na mg2 nh4 cl no3 and so4 2 were determined by metrohm 940 high pressure analytical ion chromatograph with the lower detection limits of 0 002 and 0 0017 g l for anions and cations respectively the laboratory analyses were reliable because the relative errors were found to be less than 5 ramaroson et al 2020 fang et al 2021b sun et al 2022 wu et al 2018 δd and δ18o were determined using a liquid water isotope analyzer lmia v2 dlt 100 lgr usa with an accuracy of 0 3 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o for a given water sample the value of δd or δ18o was computed with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as 1 δ r s a m p l e r v s m o w r v s m o w 1000 where δ is δd or δ18o rsample is the isotopic ratio of hydrogen 2h 1h or oxygen 18o 16o of the water sample

the hysplit model hysplit was jointly developed by the air resources laboratory of national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the united states and the melbourne meteorological research center of australia to simulate the dispersion and trajectory of substances transported and dispersed through atmosphere over local to global scales li et al 2012 stein et al 2015 since first released in 1949 hysplit has been widely used to identify and trace the source of water vapor as well as to determine and calculate the main path and proportion of water vapor in a specific period soderberg et al 2013 xu et al 2020b zhao et al 2019 the details of the inputs and outputs of hysplit can be found in draxler et al 2022 the hysplit model of this study used the gdas 1 1 reanalysis dataset as the meteorologic input to do reverse simulation and performed statistical clustering of similar trajectories through embedded algorithms to map spatial distributions of atmospheric water vapor sources given that the average residence time of water vapor in the stratosphere is about 10 d trenberth 1998 the model used the backward trajectory to invert the air mass trajectories at initial vertical heights of 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m with the xiwu banner weather station as a reference point also by fusing the site specific situations with literature results this study conducted a cluster analysis of the trajectory simulation results and generated a backward trajectory map of water vapor sources of the study basin for the wet seasons of 2019 and 2020 3 results 3 1 precipitation δd and δ18o characteristics the δd δ18o and d excess table 1 ranged from 163 87 32 29 21 52 5 02 and 10 50 20 48 respectively significant fluctuations indicated that the study site might have a precipitation mechanism that is influenced by multiple factors zhou et al 2022 the maximum and minimum of δd and δ18o occurred in august the maximum d excess value occurred in august whereas the minimum d excess value occurred in june the mean d excess in the wet season was lower than the corresponding global mean 9 34 versus 10 indicating occurrences of secondary i e enhanced evaporation during precipitation events enhanced evaporation led to a positive change in d excess whereas precipitation resulted in a negative change while all precipitation events had negative δd and δ18o d excess tended to remain positive indicating the recirculation of water vapor from onsite evaporation and or offsite monsoon air motion precipitation in 2019 and 2020 fell mainly in wet season june to september accounting for about 70 of the corresponding annual precipitation fig 3 the ratios of stable isotopes in the atmospheric precipitations varied by season latitude elevation temperature humidity and precipitation xie et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 the d excess was positive for the precipitation events except for two in junes of the two study years the negative d excess of june 2019 corresponded to the large storm with a precipitation of 22 mm and the high humidity of 80 whereas the negative d excess of june 2020 corresponded to the small storm with a precipitation of only 2 0 mm and the low humidity of 40 the air temperatures during both storms were around 25 c for both years in a month of interest the δd δ18o or d excess tended to be smaller for a storm with a larger precipitation than that with a smaller precipitation to be larger for a lower than a higher air temperature and to be larger for a higher than a lower humidity nonetheless the correlations between the δd δ18o or d excess and these three climatic variables were not strong across the four months of each year and the eight months of the two years the δd δ18o or d excess of a storm could be larger or smaller than that of another storm regardless of the relative magnitudes of precipitation temperature and humidity during the storms indicating that the isotopes might be dependent on factors beyond these three climate variables the aforementioned visual observations were verified and scrutinized by a redundancy analysis and a monte carlo substitution test for these two wet seasons air temperature was the most influential factor on the isotopes followed by humidity and then precipitation fig 4 3 2 local meteoric water line the local meteoric water lines lmwls deviated from the global meteoric water line gmwl regardless of the time scales fig 5 and table 2 across the two wet seasons the lmwl had a slope of 7 46 and an intercept of 3 56 whereas on a monthly basis the lmwls had a slope of 5 95 7 87 and an intercept of 7 98 15 30 the lmwls in june july and september had a steeper slope and a smaller intercept than the gmwl whereas the lmwl in august was comparable with the gmwl with minimal differences in slope and intercept the lmwl of august was the steepest while the lmwl of july was the flattest 3 3 precipitation water chemistries ca2 was the most dominant cation in the atmospheric precipitation table 3 and fig 6 accounting for 63 of the total cations its concentrations varied from 2 58 to 59 53 mg l with a mean of 10 96 mg l and a standard deviation of 10 04 mg l the less than one coefficient of variation cv 0 92 indicated that the ca2 concentrations are scattered around the mean for most precipitation events the concentrations of the cations were determined to be ca2 na k mg2 nh4 on the other hand hco3 was the most prevalent anion in the atmospheric precipitation accounting for 68 of the total cations concentration of hco3 varied from 6 1 to 274 58 mg l with a mean of 39 3 mg l and a standard deviation of 51 14 mg l hco3 concentration scattered around the mean more than ca2 concentration indicating that the precipitation of one storm event could have a much higher or lower hco3 concentration than the precipitation of another storm event the anion concentrations were ranked as hco3 no3 so4 2 cl f the ca2 mg2 or hco3 and na concentrations were highly correlated r greater than 0 80 fig 7 indicating similar terrestrial and marine sources so4 2 was in a strong correlation with ca2 r 0 88 na r 0 63 and nh4 r 0 79 so4 2 and no3 concentrations were poorly correlated r 0 11 suggesting that most so4 2 in precipitation was from sulfate rather than h2so4 k was significantly correlated with mg2 hco3 na and no3 r 0 75 indicating that k was from a variety of human related sources 3 4 water vapor sources the hysplit modeling revealed different patterns of water vapor sources at different time scales fig 8 the precipitation in the study basin was formed by both remote and near sources of water vapor the water vapor sources were mainly from three directions of northwest northeast and southeast regardless of the altitudes the water vapor in june and july was from the southwest direction as induced by the east asian summer monsoon westerly circulation polar air flow and northwest inland and onsite evapotranspiration across the wet seasons about 60 of the precipitation was formed by water vapor from the northwest direction fig 9 which originated by westerlies i e winds blowing from the west from polar regions eurasia and atlantic and arctic oceans specifically more than 40 of precipitation was formed by water vapor from eurasia and 10 25 by water vapor from arctic ocean with a minimal contribution from atlantic ocean near sources of water vapor included local and surrounding landscapes the water vapor in the northeast was originated from pacific ocean and contributed 35 45 of the precipitation westerly i e blowing from the west air prevails the mainland forming aleutian depressions in the north pacific and causing cyclones to move northeastward northeast china is under the control of anticyclonic circulations so precipitation in the study basin would increase as influenced by upper troughs and northeast cold vortexes in june and july of 2019 and 2020 the study basin was affected by the east asian summer monsoon and controlled mainly by the pacific subtropical high producing water vapor in the southeastward in 2019 the water vapor was also supplied from the southwest advancing from the indian ocean to inner mongolia over a long distance however it had only a small contribution to precipitation due to the dispersions of the vapor over transport paths in august of both years with the weakening of the warm air force the primary sources of water vapor were from the northwest northeast and local landscapes in 2019 precipitation was produced under the combined influence of upper trough cloud systems and the water vapor of the typhoon danas in september of both years the water vapor was mainly from the northwest because the east asian summer monsoon retreated completely the precipitation sources in the study basin had obvious interannual differences fig 9 partially because the basin is located at the edge of the east asian summer monsoon region the direction of water vapor source varied with the strength of the monsoon and westerly circulation nonetheless the water vapor sources were mostly affected by westerly circulation the east asian summer monsoon northeast anticyclone circulation and local landscape evapotranspiration 4 discussion as a basic process and an important part of the inland water cycle precipitation is of great significance to ecological sustainability and socioeconomic development of semiarid regions such as the balagaer river basin as a natural tracer in the water cycle hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotopes can be an effective means to study water vapor sources and chemical characteristics of atmospheric precipitation wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020b for an area of interest the δ18o varies synchronically with δd and the relative change of these two isotopes is normally assigned with the deuterium excess i e d excess ampuero et al 2020 the variations of δ18o δd and d excess reflect water transformation processes e g vapor origin precipitation and evapotranspiration which in turn depend on climate variables including air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed u as well as physiographic features of the landscape zhou et al 2022 in principle d excess is negatively correlated with air temperature because of secondary evaporation enhanced by rising temperature and positively correlated with precipitation and rh because of more additions of δd than δ18o however such correlations can be different interannually and from one month to another in every given year due to dynamics of local vegetation transpiration enso and large scale atmospheric circulation cropper et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for a local meteoric water line lmwl slope represents the fractionation rate of deuterium oxygen and the intercept reflects the deviation from an equilibrium state fang et al 2021a rationally for semiarid and arid regions where precipitation is much less than potential evapotranspiration the lmwl slope is smaller than 8 with an intercept of smaller than 10 li et al 2017 zheng et al 1983 craig 1961 this explains why the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls in the study basin are smaller than those of the mwl for the world china and northern china but close to those of the mwl for the arid region of northwest china and zhenglan banner fig 5 versus table 2 the negative intercepts of the lmwls in june and july can be attributed to rising air temperatures for secondary evapotranspiration whereas the positive intercepts of the lmwls in august and september can be attributed to increasing recirculation steams froehlich et al 2008 this is particularly true for areas with a dense vegetation coverage making transpiration i e secondary evaporation an important source of water vapor the precipitation of the study basin is formed by water vapor from multiple sources sui et al 2020 in the principle of isotopic fractionation the lmwls have smaller slopes if air temperature is low while transpiration is high zhang et al 2022b the order of the concentrations of the major cations in precipitation ca2 na k mg2 nh4 is consistent with that of the concentrations of the standard cations in crustal minerals ca2 na k mg2 whereas the order of the concentrations of the major anions in precipitation hco3 no3 so4 2 cl f is different from that of the concentrations of the standard anions in ocean water cl so4 2 no3 this can be explained by that the ion components in precipitation are mainly affected by terrestrial and anthropogenic factors and minimally influenced by marine processes which is characterized by the geographically inland location of the study basin the so4 2 and no3 are poorly correlated r 0 11 suggesting that most so4 2 in precipitation might be from sulfate rather than h2so4 ma et al 2012 han et al 2020 jia and li 2016 the correlations of na and ca2 with so4 2 can be attributed mainly to the reaction with the acidic substance h2so4 in the atmosphere whereas their high correlations with nh4 are due to human activities such as agricultural production and chemical emissions accompanied by atmospheric chemical interactions k is significantly correlated with mg2 hco3 na and no3 r 0 75 which can be attributed to human activities the warming of the atmosphere and oceans is bound to affect the air sea interactions recently typhoons have been becoming more frequent and stronger mandating close attentions to examining tropical cyclones of pacific ocean previous studies have shown that the formation of typhoons is closely related to the south china sea tropical western pacific monsoon trough el nino la nina sst sea surface temperature of the western pacific warm pool and the east asian monsoon liu et al 2022 as an abnormal phenomenon and strong signal of interactions between tropical oceans and the atmosphere an el nino southern oscillation enso event has an important influence on precipitation in many regions around the world chen et al 2022 el nino is a periodic natural phenomenon that occurs every 2 to 7 years kong et al 2021 as climate changes so does the pattern of el nino water vapor in the study basin was enriched by the el nino events occurred in 2019 and 2020 although the durations of the events are not long and the intensities are not strong the impact on the summer rainfall of the study basin is phenomena xie et al 2021 in 2020 because of the strengthening of summer monsoon the main rain belt moved northward figs 8 and 9 and the number of typhoons formed in the western pacific was subject to less influence of enso july was the first empty typhoon in china since 1949 and northeast china suffered three northward typhoons successively from the end of august to the beginning of september all of which were rare in history li et al 2021 this is also the reason why the research results of guo xin guo et al 2022a are similar with but different from ours the interannual strength of the monsoon and circulation makes the summer monsoon advance westward and turn to northward at varying speeds on the other hand under the influence of enso typhoons rarely land in northeast china so the directions of water vapor sources for the study basin are different in different months some water vapor comes from northeast china which is consistent with dong et al 2018 the air flow at the northern edge of the western pacific zone can transport warm and wet water vapor over the inland area of china while the north branch air flow from siberia increases water vapor in east inner mongolia the isotopes in precipitation of the study basin reflect effects of both rainfall and air temperature though the effect of precipitation is more obvious than that of temperature which is consistent with wu and wang 2011 that is precipitation in arid and semiarid regions is susceptible to evaporation due to a low air humidity so the precipitation effect does exist most of the time the hydro chemical characteristics of precipitation in the study basin are comparable with those of precipitation in northwest inland of china li et al 2020 as well as those of groundwater beneath the study basin fang et al 2021b indicating hydraulic connections between precipitation and groundwater the water vapor in the wet season accounted for more than 70 of the annual water vapor but the sources of precipitation in the dry season cannot be ignored rainfall and snowfall data can continue to be collected in the future the sources of water vapor are different interannually so the formation mechanism and source pattern need to be further investigated by considering seasonal extreme precipitation events wu and zhang 2021 global warming and la nina phenomenon while the monsoon and circulation transport water vapor they also transport and diffuse air suspended constituents affecting air quality as a recommendation future studies could combine analyses of enrichment and neutralization balasubramanian and chun 2001 wang et al 2019 with hydrochemistry to scrutinize the chemical characteristics of precipitation and ion sources assess air pollution predict impacts of human activities and decipher interrelations with atmospheric circulation despite these limitations the study approach and results of this paper are innovative in predicting and adapting impacts of climate change on water resources of eurasian inland steppe basins 5 conclusions this study measured isotopes and ions of precipitation received by the balagaer river basin in 2019 and 2020 the measurements showed negative δd and δ18o during the wet seasons with positive d excess for 57 samples and negative d excess for the remaining two samples overall the d excess was negatively correlated with temperature and positively correlated with precipitation and humidity in addition the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls were smaller than those the gmwl because the study basin had much less precipitation than potential evapotranspiration leading to a large evaporative capacity further the dominant hydro chemical ions in precipitation were hco3 and ca2 with concentrations of the anions and cations in the descending order of hco3 no3 so4 2 cl f and ca2 na k mg2 nh4 the ions in precipitation were affected mainly by terrestrial and anthropogenic factors and were influenced minimally by marine processes moreover water vapor mainly came from the of northeast northwest and southeast directions and was affected by the westerly circulation the east asian summer monsoon northeast anticyclone circulation and local landscape evapotranspiration the water vapor sources in the study basin had significant annual and interannual variabilities with more than 40 from eurasia 10 25 from the arctic ocean and 35 45 from the pacific ocean as a reasonable generalization this paper

2639,an inland river grassland basin is a fragile ecosystem and precipitation is of great significance to its resilience however the knowledge of where precipitation forming water vapor originated is not well understood limiting the predictability of future precipitation provided climate change the objective of this study was to characterize the hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotopes and hydro chemical compositions of precipitation as well as decipher atmospheric water vapor sources in a typical eurasian steppe river basin in this regard this study collected 59 water samples from 44 storm events in 2019 and 2020 the samples were analyzed in our laboratory for ions δd and δ18o which in turn were used to examine the stable isotopic features hydro chemical characteristics and water vapor transport at different temporal scales by a backward trajectory model and correlation and redundancy analyses the results showed negative δd and δ18o during the wet season with a trend of positive deuterium excess indicating that precipitation effect was significant in comparison with a linear model of global meteoric water levels the local meteoric water lines had smaller slopes and intercepts with a maximum slope in august and a minimum slope in july in addition hco3 and ca2 were the primary hydro chemical ions in precipitation ca2 and mg2 were significantly correlated with hco3 and na indicating that they shared terrestrial and marine sources nh4 originated mainly from human activities and chemical reactions whereas k originated primarily from continental and marine processes further the atmospheric water vapor was mainly transported from the northeast northwest and southeast directions into the study basin as affected by the westerly wind circulation the east asian summer monsoon northeast anticyclone circulation and local evapotranspiration moreover the water vapor was from both onsite and offsite sources over 40 from eurasia 10 to 25 from the arctic ocean and 35 to 45 from the pacific ocean keywords climate dryland extreme weather hyplist inland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than 40 of global grasslands have experienced degradation among which arid and semiarid grasslands present a more fragile ecosystem than humid and subhumid grasslands li et al 2019a fang et al 2021a as the main replenishment source of land water resources atmospheric water vapor is transported and condensed to generate precipitation as part of the circulation of a weather system guo et al 2022a gou et al 2022 the precipitation process is an indispensable part of the hydrologic cycle and thus is a key factor in attaining sustainable development of water resources wang et al 2021a however in the context of global warming extreme weather and climate events are expected to occur more frequently as influenced by multiple factors li et al 2021 el niño southern oscillation enso which is one of the important stress factors affecting precipitation as to ocean atmosphere interactions not only has a significant impact on tropical atmospheric circulation but also has an indirect impact on atmospheric circulation in middle and high latitudes he et al 2022 xie et al 2021 in recent years practical applications mandate a good understanding of the interrelation between large scale atmospheric circulation and watershed scale precipitation leading to the evolution of single qualitative analyses to comprehensive quantitative assessments most previous studies were conducted in major river basins zhao et al 2011 li et al 2016

al 2021b and monsoon regions ansari et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 the general approach of this study was to examine water vapor sources and influential factors by analyzing stable isotopes and hydro chemical compositions in precipitation bedaso and wu 2020 xu et al 2020a cai and tian 2016 ma et al 2012 wei et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 and simulate the paths and allocation of water vapor in terms of meteorologic data li et al 2019b wang et al 2018 xie et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a in contrast few studies have been conducted in typical eurasian steppe river basins which are located at the edge of the east asian summer monsoon and far from any ocean to protect the vast vulnerable steppe ecosystems it is imperative to understand and quantify water vapor sources of precipitation galewsky et al 2016 heydarizad et al 2021 ma et al 2018 song et al 2022 the objective of this study was to characterize the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and hydro chemical compositions of precipitation as well as to decipher atmospheric water vapor sources of inland steppe river basins using the balager river basin of inner mongolia as the testbed herein the underlying assumption is that these stable isotopes were affected by hydroclimatic processes and could be used to characterize precipitation forming water vapor sources in terms of the isotope fractionation theory deuterium in precipitation could deviate from an equilibrium level by varying degrees depending on how the precipitation is formed such a deviation is defined as deuterium surplus or excess equation 2 this study applied the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit model which is described in subsection 2 4 to identify the sources and proportions of water vapor advancing scientific understanding of the hydrologic cycle and water resources availability in such a fragile steppe ecosystem the unique contribution of this study was to present an innovative approach for deciphering atmospheric water vapor sources of precipitation in inland steppe basins where fragile ecosystems would jeopardize their functionalities and services because of climate change and human disturbance as detailed in the following context this study was based on data collected in one typical steppe basin for two years in the future it would be preferable to collect data for more years and in multiple steppe basins to better capture spatiotemporal variations of the isotopes and hydro chemicals as influenced by heterogenic environments and climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

precipitation events each of which occurred between 8 00 pm of a day to 8 00 pm of the next day the collected samples were placed in polyethylene bottles sealed with parafilm and stored in a refrigerator 0 to 4 c in the correspondence s research laboratory each sample was filtered by a 0 2 μm filter membrane and then analyzed to determine isotopic composition of hydrogen δd isotopic composition of oxygen δ18o k ca2 na mg2 nh4 cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 laboratory analyses were conducted jointly by the inner mongolia autonomous region key laboratory of water resources protection and utilization and the inner mongolia agriculture animal husbandry fishery and biological experiment research center of inner mongolia agricultural university hco3 was determined by acid base titration while k ca2 na mg2 nh4 cl no3 and so4 2 were determined by metrohm 940 high pressure analytical ion chromatograph with the lower detection limits of 0 002 and 0 0017 g l for anions and cations respectively the laboratory analyses were reliable because the relative errors were found to be less than 5 ramaroson et al 2020 fang et al 2021b sun et al 2022 wu et al 2018 δd and δ18o were determined using a liquid water isotope analyzer lmia v2 dlt 100 lgr usa with an accuracy of 0 3 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o for a given water sample the value of δd or δ18o was computed with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as 1 δ r s a m p l e r v s m o w r v s m o w 1000 where δ is δd or δ18o rsample is the isotopic ratio of hydrogen 2h 1h or oxygen 18o 16o of the water sample

the hysplit model hysplit was jointly developed by the air resources laboratory of national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the united states and the melbourne meteorological research center of australia to simulate the dispersion and trajectory of substances transported and dispersed through atmosphere over local to global scales li et al 2012 stein et al 2015 since first released in 1949 hysplit has been widely used to identify and trace the source of water vapor as well as to determine and calculate the main path and proportion of water vapor in a specific period soderberg et al 2013 xu et al 2020b zhao et al 2019 the details of the inputs and outputs of hysplit can be found in draxler et al 2022 the hysplit model of this study used the gdas 1 1 reanalysis dataset as the meteorologic input to do reverse simulation and performed statistical clustering of similar trajectories through embedded algorithms to map spatial distributions of atmospheric water vapor sources given that the average residence time of water vapor in the stratosphere is about 10 d trenberth 1998 the model used the backward trajectory to invert the air mass trajectories at initial vertical heights of 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m with the xiwu banner weather station as a reference point also by fusing the site specific situations with literature results this study conducted a cluster analysis of the trajectory simulation results and generated a backward trajectory map of water vapor sources of the study basin for the wet seasons of 2019 and 2020 3 results 3 1 precipitation δd and δ18o characteristics the δd δ18o and d excess table 1 ranged from 163 87 32 29 21 52 5 02 and 10 50 20 48 respectively significant fluctuations indicated that the study site might have a precipitation mechanism that is influenced by multiple factors zhou et al 2022 the maximum and minimum of δd and δ18o occurred in august the maximum d excess value occurred in august whereas the minimum d excess value occurred in june the mean d excess in the wet season was lower than the corresponding global mean 9 34 versus 10 indicating occurrences of secondary i e enhanced evaporation during precipitation events enhanced evaporation led to a positive change in d excess whereas precipitation resulted in a negative change while all precipitation events had negative δd and δ18o d excess tended to remain positive indicating the recirculation of water vapor from onsite evaporation and or offsite monsoon air motion precipitation in 2019 and 2020 fell mainly in wet season june to september accounting for about 70 of the corresponding annual precipitation fig 3 the ratios of stable isotopes in the atmospheric precipitations varied by season latitude elevation temperature humidity and precipitation xie et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 the d excess was positive for the precipitation events except for two in junes of the two study years the negative d excess of june 2019 corresponded to the large storm with a precipitation of 22 mm and the high humidity of 80 whereas the negative d excess of june 2020 corresponded to the small storm with a precipitation of only 2 0 mm and the low humidity of 40 the air temperatures during both storms were around 25 c for both years in a month of interest the δd δ18o or d excess tended to be smaller for a storm with a larger precipitation than that with a smaller precipitation to be larger for a lower than a higher air temperature and to be larger for a higher than a lower humidity nonetheless the correlations between the δd δ18o or d excess and these three climatic variables were not strong across the four months of each year and the eight months of the two years the δd δ18o or d excess of a storm could be larger or smaller than that of another storm regardless of the relative magnitudes of precipitation temperature and humidity during the storms indicating that the isotopes might be dependent on factors beyond these three climate variables the aforementioned visual observations were verified and scrutinized by a redundancy analysis and a monte carlo substitution test for these two wet seasons air temperature was the most influential factor on the isotopes followed by humidity and then precipitation fig 4 3 2 local meteoric water line the local meteoric water lines lmwls deviated from the global meteoric water line gmwl regardless of the time scales fig 5 and table 2 across the two wet seasons the lmwl had a slope of 7 46 and an intercept of 3 56 whereas on a monthly basis the lmwls had a slope of 5 95 7 87 and an intercept of 7 98 15 30 the lmwls in june july and september had a steeper slope and a smaller intercept than the gmwl whereas the lmwl in august was comparable with the gmwl with minimal differences in slope and intercept the lmwl of august was the steepest while the lmwl of july was the flattest 3 3 precipitation water chemistries ca2 was the most dominant cation in the atmospheric precipitation table 3 and fig 6 accounting for 63 of the total cations its concentrations varied from 2 58 to 59 53 mg l with a mean of 10 96 mg l and a standard deviation of 10 04 mg l the less than one coefficient of variation cv 0 92 indicated that the ca2 concentrations are scattered around the mean for most precipitation events the concentrations of the cations were determined to be ca2 na k mg2 nh4 on the other hand hco3 was the most prevalent anion in the atmospheric precipitation accounting for 68 of the total cations concentration of hco3 varied from 6 1 to 274 58 mg l with a mean of 39 3 mg l and a standard deviation of 51 14 mg l hco3 concentration scattered around the mean more than ca2 concentration indicating that the precipitation of one storm event could have a much higher or lower hco3 concentration than the precipitation of another storm event the anion concentrations were ranked as hco3 no3 so4 2 cl f the ca2 mg2 or hco3 and na concentrations were highly correlated r greater than 0 80 fig 7 indicating similar terrestrial and marine sources so4 2 was in a strong correlation with ca2 r 0 88 na r 0 63 and nh4 r 0 79 so4 2 and no3 concentrations were poorly correlated r 0 11 suggesting that most so4 2 in precipitation was from sulfate rather than h2so4 k was significantly correlated with mg2 hco3 na and no3 r 0 75 indicating that k was from a variety of human related sources 3 4 water vapor sources the hysplit modeling revealed different patterns of water vapor sources at different time scales fig 8 the precipitation in the study basin was formed by both remote and near sources of water vapor the water vapor sources were mainly from three directions of northwest northeast and southeast regardless of the altitudes the water vapor in june and july was from the southwest direction as induced by the east asian summer monsoon westerly circulation polar air flow and northwest inland and onsite evapotranspiration across the wet seasons about 60 of the precipitation was formed by water vapor from the northwest direction fig 9 which originated by westerlies i e winds blowing from the west from polar regions eurasia and atlantic and arctic oceans specifically more than 40 of precipitation was formed by water vapor from eurasia and 10 25 by water vapor from arctic ocean with a minimal contribution from atlantic ocean near sources of water vapor included local and surrounding landscapes the water vapor in the northeast was originated from pacific ocean and contributed 35 45 of the precipitation westerly i e blowing from the west air prevails the mainland forming aleutian depressions in the north pacific and causing cyclones to move northeastward northeast china is under the control of anticyclonic circulations so precipitation in the study basin would increase as influenced by upper troughs and northeast cold vortexes in june and july of 2019 and 2020 the study basin was affected by the east asian summer monsoon and controlled mainly by the pacific subtropical high producing water vapor in the southeastward in 2019 the water vapor was also supplied from the southwest advancing from the indian ocean to inner mongolia over a long distance however it had only a small contribution to precipitation due to the dispersions of the vapor over transport paths in august of both years with the weakening of the warm air force the primary sources of water vapor were from the northwest northeast and local landscapes in 2019 precipitation was produced under the combined influence of upper trough cloud systems and the water vapor of the typhoon danas in september of both years the water vapor was mainly from the northwest because the east asian summer monsoon retreated completely the precipitation sources in the study basin had obvious interannual differences fig 9 partially because the basin is located at the edge of the east asian summer monsoon region the direction of water vapor source varied with the strength of the monsoon and westerly circulation nonetheless the water vapor sources were mostly affected by westerly circulation the east asian summer monsoon northeast anticyclone circulation and local landscape evapotranspiration 4 discussion as a basic process and an important part of the inland water cycle precipitation is of great significance to ecological sustainability and socioeconomic development of semiarid regions such as the balagaer river basin as a natural tracer in the water cycle hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o isotopes can be an effective means to study water vapor sources and chemical characteristics of atmospheric precipitation wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020b for an area of interest the δ18o varies synchronically with δd and the relative change of these two isotopes is normally assigned with the deuterium excess i e d excess ampuero et al 2020 the variations of δ18o δd and d excess reflect water transformation processes e g vapor origin precipitation and evapotranspiration which in turn depend on climate variables including air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed u as well as physiographic features of the landscape zhou et al 2022 in principle d excess is negatively correlated with air temperature because of secondary evaporation enhanced by rising temperature and positively correlated with precipitation and rh because of more additions of δd than δ18o however such correlations can be different interannually and from one month to another in every given year due to dynamics of local vegetation transpiration enso and large scale atmospheric circulation cropper et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for a local meteoric water line lmwl slope represents the fractionation rate of deuterium oxygen and the intercept reflects the deviation from an equilibrium state fang et al 2021a rationally for semiarid and arid regions where precipitation is much less than potential evapotranspiration the lmwl slope is smaller than 8 with an intercept of smaller than 10 li et al 2017 zheng et al 1983 craig 1961 this explains why the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls in the study basin are smaller than those of the mwl for the world china and northern china but close to those of the mwl for the arid region of northwest china and zhenglan banner fig 5 versus table 2 the negative intercepts of the lmwls in june and july can be attributed to rising air temperatures for secondary evapotranspiration whereas the positive intercepts of the lmwls in august and september can be attributed to increasing recirculation steams froehlich et al 2008 this is particularly true for areas with a dense vegetation coverage making transpiration i e secondary evaporation an important source of water vapor the precipitation of the study basin is formed by water vapor from multiple sources sui et al 2020 in the principle of isotopic fractionation the lmwls have smaller slopes if air temperature is low while transpiration is high zhang et al 2022b the order of the concentrations of the major cations in precipitation ca2 na k mg2 nh4 is consistent with that of the concentrations of the standard cations in crustal minerals ca2 na k mg2 whereas the order of the concentrations of the major anions in precipitation hco3 no3 so4 2 cl f is different from that of the concentrations of the standard anions in ocean water cl so4 2 no3 this can be explained by that the ion components in precipitation are mainly affected by terrestrial and anthropogenic factors and minimally influenced by marine processes which is characterized by the geographically inland location of the study basin the so4 2 and no3 are poorly correlated r 0 11 suggesting that most so4 2 in precipitation might be from sulfate rather than h2so4 ma et al 2012 han et al 2020 jia and li 2016 the correlations of na and ca2 with so4 2 can be attributed mainly to the reaction with the acidic substance h2so4 in the atmosphere whereas their high correlations with nh4 are due to human activities such as agricultural production and chemical emissions accompanied by atmospheric chemical interactions k is significantly correlated with mg2 hco3 na and no3 r 0 75 which can be attributed to human activities the warming of the atmosphere and oceans is bound to affect the air sea interactions recently typhoons have been becoming more frequent and stronger mandating close attentions to examining tropical cyclones of pacific ocean previous studies have shown that the formation of typhoons is closely related to the south china sea tropical western pacific monsoon trough el nino la nina sst sea surface temperature of the western pacific warm pool and the east asian monsoon liu et al 2022 as an abnormal phenomenon and strong signal of interactions between tropical oceans and the atmosphere an el nino southern oscillation enso event has an important influence on precipitation in many regions around the world chen et al 2022 el nino is a periodic natural phenomenon that occurs every 2 to 7 years kong et al 2021 as climate changes so does the pattern of el nino water vapor in the study basin was enriched by the el nino events occurred in 2019 and 2020 although the durations of the events are not long and the intensities are not strong the impact on the summer rainfall of the study basin is phenomena xie et al 2021 in 2020 because of the strengthening of summer monsoon the main rain belt moved northward figs 8 and 9 and the number of typhoons formed in the western pacific was subject to less influence of enso july was the first empty typhoon in china since 1949 and northeast china suffered three northward typhoons successively from the end of august to the beginning of september all of which were rare in history li et al 2021 this is also the reason why the research results of guo xin guo et al 2022a are similar with but different from ours the interannual strength of the monsoon and circulation makes the summer monsoon advance westward and turn to northward at varying speeds on the other hand under the influence of enso typhoons rarely land in northeast china so the directions of water vapor sources for the study basin are different in different months some water vapor comes from northeast china which is consistent with dong et al 2018 the air flow at the northern edge of the western pacific zone can transport warm and wet water vapor over the inland area of china while the north branch air flow from siberia increases water vapor in east inner mongolia the isotopes in precipitation of the study basin reflect effects of both rainfall and air temperature though the effect of precipitation is more obvious than that of temperature which is consistent with wu and wang 2011 that is precipitation in arid and semiarid regions is susceptible to evaporation due to a low air humidity so the precipitation effect does exist most of the time the hydro chemical characteristics of precipitation in the study basin are comparable with those of precipitation in northwest inland of china li et al 2020 as well as those of groundwater beneath the study basin fang et al 2021b indicating hydraulic connections between precipitation and groundwater the water vapor in the wet season accounted for more than 70 of the annual water vapor but the sources of precipitation in the dry season cannot be ignored rainfall and snowfall data can continue to be collected in the future the sources of water vapor are different interannually so the formation mechanism and source pattern need to be further investigated by considering seasonal extreme precipitation events wu and zhang 2021 global warming and la nina phenomenon while the monsoon and circulation transport water vapor they also transport and diffuse air suspended constituents affecting air quality as a recommendation future studies could combine analyses of enrichment and neutralization balasubramanian and chun 2001 wang et al 2019 with hydrochemistry to scrutinize the chemical characteristics of precipitation and ion sources assess air pollution predict impacts of human activities and decipher interrelations with atmospheric circulation despite these limitations the study approach and results of this paper are innovative in predicting and adapting impacts of climate change on water resources of eurasian inland steppe basins 5 conclusions this study measured isotopes and ions of precipitation received by the balagaer river basin in 2019 and 2020 the measurements showed negative δd and δ18o during the wet seasons with positive d excess for 57 samples and negative d excess for the remaining two samples overall the d excess was negatively correlated with temperature and positively correlated with precipitation and humidity in addition the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls were smaller than those the gmwl because the study basin had much less precipitation than potential evapotranspiration leading to a large evaporative capacity further the dominant hydro chemical ions in precipitation were hco3 and ca2 with concentrations of the anions and cations in the descending order of hco3 no3 so4 2 cl f and ca2 na k mg2 nh4 the ions in precipitation were affected mainly by terrestrial and anthropogenic factors and were influenced minimally by marine processes moreover water vapor mainly came from the of northeast northwest and southeast directions and was affected by the westerly circulation the east asian summer monsoon northeast anticyclone circulation and local landscape evapotranspiration the water vapor sources in the study basin had significant annual and interannual variabilities with more than 40 from eurasia 10 25 from the arctic ocean and 35 45 from the pacific ocean as a reasonable generalization this paper presents an innovative study approach and the convincible results for increasing sustainability and resilience of water limited steppe ecosystems beyond the balager river basin credit authorship
