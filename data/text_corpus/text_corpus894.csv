4470,multi objective requirements including water supply hydropower generation water sediment regulation wsr and inner river ecosystem maintenance should be fully valued in the operation of reservoirs located on a sediment laden river in order to balance the satisfaction of multiple objectives with intense competition and guarantee the primary requirements preferentially this paper presents a novel framework that incorporates the recognition and classification of primary and secondary requirements of multiple operation targets a set of principles for multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs mosrr following the theory of synergetics and the optimization model construction of mosrr considering the maximization synergetic degree of multi objective the analytic hierarchy process and particle swarm optimization algorithm are employed to determine the weight and solve the mosrr model respectively mosrr is applied to a system of cascade reservoirs along the upper yellow river in china considering climatic and hydrologic variability the results from mosrr are compared to those from a traditional multi objective optimal operation model it is found that the guarantee of multi objective requirements from mosrr have been improved visibly compare with the traditional model at the expense of a slight reduction in the hydropower generation especially the secondary requirement of the energy output in the dry season also mosrr can mitigate the effects of runoff reduction through minimizing the damage of primary requirements which is more appropriate for multi objective reservoir operation with limited water in sediment laden river the proposed mosrr framework can be applied to other large scale reservoir systems with stiff competition in water resources keywords multi objective regulation cascade reservoirs synergetics sediment laden river runoff reduction 1 introduction nowadays sediment laden river basins are facing a serious situation with mounting demand for water supply due to rapid societal development and growing water requirement to sustain river ecological health especially sediment deposition and suspended river problems ran et al 2020 wang et al 2017b sediment deposition and suspended river problem in sediment laden river caused by dam construction and regulation of runoff usually have caused various negative effects such as reduction of channel discharge capacity and the available storage in reservoirs induction of downstream morphological changes shrinkage of river channel rises of the riverbed and exacerbation of the possibility of severe flooding greatly guo et al 2020 hauer et al 2018 tang et al 2019 to relieve the impact of sediment deposition reservoirs in sediment laden rivers are employed to release controlled flood to scour downstream riverbed which has raised gradually owing to river flow alteration and sediment accumulation at the expense of decreasing the socio economic benefit of reservoirs kong et al 2015 this is referred to water sediment regulation hereafter wsr which is shown as an efficient non engineering measure with less investment faster effect and easier to implement compared to sediment retaining sediment transportation and artificial sand excavation jin et al 2019a bai et al 2019 in consequence except for the normal routine taskings of water supply power generation flood control and inner river ecology wsr is another important objective for water resources utilization by reservoirs in sediment laden rivers which inevitably accelerates the disordered competition between multiple objectives multi objective reservoirs regulation has always been a complicated issue and the usual method to solve the problem is to adopt weight method or constraint method to transform multi objective problem into single objective problem or use multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea to solve the problem directly traditional reservoir operation models often consider the total benefit value of the whole regulating period such as maximizing total hydropower generation minimizing total water shortages however some primary requirements which are related to the core purpose of water utilization and once being dissatisfied will lead the social economy and ecological environment to suffer great losses have not been given sufficient attention in traditional models the protection of primary requirements of multi objective should be fully valued in reservoirs operation under the intense competition of multi objective in water lacking basin especially a sediment laden river in the arid area and there is not much research on how to balance the guarantee of primary i e rigid water requirements and secondary i e water requirements that can allow some changes requirements in multi objective reservoirs regulation thus it is urgent to propose a novel approach to deal with multi objective problems of reservoirs operation in sediment laden river by emphasizing the primary requirements as a scientific theory studing the evolution of open systems from disorder state to ordered state synergetics theory has been applied to many areas of water resources management chang et al 2004 proposed a method to simulate the multi objective operation of the reservoir based on the synergetics theory and evaluate the schemes by the entropy of information principles huang and chang 2007 used the synergetics theory to manage and control the regulation plans of flood prevention water supply and power generation of yellow river china gan et al 2010 used synergetics to set the order parameters of resource ecological economic social and environmental subsystems in the water cycle system and establish order degree entropy function to evaluate the evolution direction of the system yao et al 2017 selected the indicators of water resources development economic and social development to evaluate the sustainable water resources utilization based on synergetics zhen 2019 taken three order parameters based on synergetics to realize the multiple subjects cooperative participation in the watershed eco compensation zhang et al 2020 developed an assessment model based on the synergy theory and information entropy to measure the synergies of water energy food nexus wefn systems then developed a synergy evolution model to analyze the steady states of wefn systems despite that a few attempts were made on the multi objective operation of reservoirs based on the synergetics theory the attention on synergetic regulation of primary and secondary requirements among multiple objectives have not been well evaluated which is the knowledge gap that this study aims to address on the other hand runoff reduction caused by climate change and anthropogenic activities has an adverse effect on the water utilization and river health conservation around the world the runoff into the major water supply reservoirs in south western australia have declined by more than 50 since the mid1970s had major implications for water resources planning and the preservation of aquatic and riparian ecosystems silberstein et al 2012 climate change was the main reason for the runoff reduction of lake issyk kul basin in central asia hindered the management and sustainable allocation of water resources alifujiang et al 2021 similarly runoff reduction in sediment laden river should aggravate the competition between multi objective and need more effective measures to help reservoirs to cope with water shortages research shows that as the main runoff generation area of the most famous sediment laden river i e the yellow river the upper yellow river in china uyr the study area in this paper is facing a decreasing trend in runoff caused by climate change mainly tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 doubtlessly runoff reduction could bring tough challenges to the multi objective operation of reservoirs in sediment laden river and urgently need to treat the primary and secondary requirements of multi objective in sequence the primary requirements is prior the secondary requirements is posterior meanwhile the impact of runoff reduction on primary and secondary requirements of multi objective has not been quantified ever before and needs in depth investigation in this study overall how to explore new approaches for guiding reservoirs operation based on the security of primary requirements with limited water quantify and mitigate the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective water utilization have become frontier problems of water and sediment management in sediment laden river in this work we propose a novel framework on multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs mosrr based on the theory of synergetics set the synergetic regulation principles for multi objective primary and secondary requirements establish a multi objective synergetic regulation model of reservoirs and prove the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed model through comparing the results with the traditional model then the impacts of runoff reduction on primary and secondary requirements have been quantified through driving the multi objective synergetic regulation model in two time periods of runoff data before and after the runoff changing point lastly the operation modes of cascade reservoirs based on the synergetic regulation model are illustrated to guide the actual operation and some countermeasures for runoff reduction have been suggested in the study area the research route of this article is shown in fig 1 2 theory for mosrr 2 1 a brief introduction of synergetics synergetics is a meta disciplinary field fusing natural and social sciences to analyze systems composed of many interconnected components in particular synergetics addresses the mechanism and laws of the transformation of a system from a disorder state to an ordered state through the synergy among the internal sub systems haken 2004 2006 i e how the ordered structure of an open system that is away from an equilibrium state is achieved in time and space when there is material or energy exchange between the open system and environment a li et al 2013 the theory of synergetics is based on principles of synergistic effect the servo principle and self organization the synergistic effect refers to the overall effect of the subsystems is greater than the sum of individual parts in a complex open system the servo principle is stated as the fast variables are subject to the slow variables and the behaviors of subsystems are dominated by the order of parameters which describes the process of self organization in terms of the interaction between internal and external factors of the system the principle of self organization explains that the system forms a new ordered structure through the synergy between subsystems under the condition of certain inputs of external material energy and information the multi objective operation of a reservoir as a system follows the basic principles of the synergetic theory first reservoirs have a large number of complex materials energy and information interaction with the external natural and social environment such as the flow input and electric energy and water supply output to human society and information exchange between reservoir operators and water users stakeholders those complex interactions make the process of multi objective reservoirs operation as a complex open system far from equilibrium secondly the nonlinear interactions between many regulating tasks e g flood control social water supply clean power generation reducing sediment deposition and maintaining river ecological health requires a joint operation plan of a single or a system of cascade reservoirs to deal with the tradeoffs and synergies existing between many regulating tasks 2 2 principles of multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs it is necessary to highlight that primary requirements refer to the special or most valuable water demand in terms of each of the multi objectives for the reservoir system operation and the failure of any primary requirements will bring serious adverse impacts secondary requirements specify the elastic demand for each objective and a moderate failure will not cause a serious impact on the objective subsystem to guarantee the primary requirements and achieve the equilibrium of primary and secondary requirements among multiple objectives the general principle of multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs and the tenets of synergetic operation for primary and secondary requirements are set to guide the concrete implementation shown in fig 2 3 methods 3 1 calculation of the order degree according to the theory of synergetics order parameters of a subsystem are the leading factors to determine the evolution of the subsystems and they dominate the behaviors of the subsystem the evolution of the entire system is determined by the ordered contributions from all subsystems the order degree of an order parameter associated with a particular subsystem refers to the contribution of the order parameter to the evolution of the subsystem 3 1 1 the order degree of an order parameter the order parameters of primary and secondary requirements can be classified into three types 1 positive order parameters the larger the value of an order parameter the higher order level the subsystem has 2 negative order parameters the smaller the value of an order parameter the higher order level the subsystem has 3 middle order parameter the highest order level of a subsystem can be reached when the values of its order parameters are fixed values the larger distance to the fixed values reflect a lower order level of the subsystem in the theory of synergetic the order degree of one order parameter is usually quantified by the efficacy function and common types of efficacy functions include linear function exponential function logarithmic function power function and so on wang et al 2020 the commonly used type of efficacy function is the linear efficacy function that is employed in this paper and three different linear efficacy functions for calculating the order degree of three types of order parameters are shown as formulas 1 2 3 respectively 1 d j positive e nk e nk j min e nk max e nk min e nk 2 d j negative e nk max e nk e nk j max e nk min e nk 3 d j middle e nk 1 e nk j c max e nk min e nk where n is the number of subsystems k is the number of order parameters of n subsystem j is the number of hydrological years d j e nk is the order degree of k order parameter of n subsystem in j year e nk j is the value of k order parameter of n subsystem in j year max e nk and min e nk are the minimum and maximum allowable value of k order parameter of n subsystem c is the fixed value of order parameter when the highest orderly of the subsystem 3 1 2 order degree of subsystems the order degree of a subsystem in a period can be calculated by the linear weighted sum of the order degree of all order parameters of the subsystem and it reflects the ordered contribution level to the whole system evolution the calculating function for the order degree of subsystem of one year has been shown in equation 4 it should be noted that since the order parameter of f wsr must be obtained based on a long term scale f wsr is equal to the number of years taken wsr divided by the total years the order degree of the wsr subsystem of one period e g year only can be calculated with the two order parameters of qwsr and t wsr 4 h j s n k 1 k ω nk d j e nk where k is the total number of order parameters of n subsystem d j e nk is the order degree of k order parameter of n subsystem in j year ω nk is the weight coefficient of k order parameter of n subsystem h j s n is the order degree of n th subsystem in j year 3 2 multi objective synergetic regulation model of reservoirs reservoirs optimal operation is a multi stage decision making problem and the stages can be selected according to the time interval e g month or ten days of whole regulating period in the multi objective synergetic regulation model of reservoirs proposed in this paper the reservoir water level at the end of each time interval are selected as decision variables and the number of decision variables is equal to the number of reservoirs participated in the joint regulation multiplied by the total number of time intervals of whole regulating period the historical runoff data is the input variables for the model 3 2 1 the optimization objective function the synergetic degree of a multi objective operating system of reservoirs can be obtained by geometric average of the order degree of each subsystem i e water supply power generation inner river ecology sediment transport and the synergetic degree can be regarded as the final optimization object for the synergetic regulating model shown as equation 5 5 h max n 1 4 h s n 1 4 s t h s n j j h j s n j n 1 2 4 h s n λ 1 j j h j s n j wsr λ 2 d f wsr n 3 where h is the synergetic degree of the whole system j the total number of hydrological

parameters e g ω nk in eq 4 ahp is a multi criteria decision making method to solve complex decision problems and applied in the water management field widely lu et al 2017 achu et al 2020 the detailed solution of typical ahp are as following 1 transforming the multiple criteria problem into a hierarchy 2 building pair wise comparison matrices 3 calculating the relative weights of the comparison elements by solving the judgment matrix and 4 conducting the consistency test via a consistency index ren et al 2019 more detailed instructions about ahp are provided in supporting information si tables s1 and s2 3 2 4 model solution by using pso algorithm the optimization model of mosrr could be solved by evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm progressive optimality algorithm or machine learning algorithms i e support vector machine deep learning and artificial neural network as well each algorithm mentioned above with its own superiority and limitation has been applied in the field of reservoir operation in varying degrees the evolutionary algorithms and classic machine learning algorithms i e support vector machine artificial neural network have been successfully and widely applied to the reservoir operation field for many years deep learning a new type of machine learning algorithm has gradually become the frontier of computer science and technology in recent years and has been tentatively introduced into the reservoir operation field in a few literatures zhang et al 2018a liu et al 2019 in this study a widely used and efficient algorithm the particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed particle swarm optimization algorithm pso was first discovered and proposed by kennedy and eberhart in 1995 which originated from the study of bird predation behavior lsiet and gadala 2020 pso as an efficient parallel optimization method is suitable for solving some nonlinear non differentiable and multi objective complex optimization problems and has been widely used in solving reservoir optimal operation problem because of its simple principle fewer parameters and fast search speed ahmadianfar et al 2019 bai et al 2017 the main framework of typical pso are as following 1 generate the initial population of individuals so called particles and move these particles around in the search space 2 calculate the objective function of each particle based on its coordination in the search space 3 choose a direction for each particle using the current position and its best position in the previous iterations p best and also the best position of the whole population or swarm g best 4 move the particles to new positions and the objective function values of particles solutions are evaluated resulting in p best and g best in each iteration and 5 repeat this process until some stopping criteria are met hatamkhani et al 2020 the main parameters of the pso algorithm as population size number of generation inertia weight inertia weight damping ratio personal learning coefficient and global learning coefficient are 120 1000 1 0 0 99 1 5 and 2 0 respectively to compare with the results from the proposed mosrr a traditional multi objective optimal operation model was also constructed and solved by the pso algorithm as well details about the traditional model are provided in si 4 case study area 4 1 the upper yellow river and cascade reservoirs the yellow river is known as china s mother river and it plays a powerful role in china s economy wang et al 2019 as the second longest river in china the yellow river originates from the bayan har mountains in the qinghai tibet plateau flows through the three major stairs of the macroscopic landform structure of china i e the qinghai tibet plateau the loess plateau and the north china plain with a length of 5464 km and a basin area of 0 75 million km2 and finally imports into bohai fig 3 chang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the high annual sediment load approximately 1 5 108 tons with the low annual average runoff 2 2 1010m3 makes the yellow river a most famous sediment laden river in the world xu et al 2019 meanwhile the yellow river is an important source for water supply in the northwestern and northern china supplying freshwater for approximately 8 7 of the total population chang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b the upper yellow river hereafter uyr includes the reaches from the source to the toudaoguai tdg section in inner mongolia fig 3 with a total length of 3472 km and a basin area of 386000 km2 the runoff of the reach accounts for 54 of the whole river which is the key area of runoff yield jin et al 2019a there are four primary objectives that the uyr need to achieve 1 sufficient water supply for society 2 power generation 3 inner river ecology 4 wsr in the low runoff production in the middle reaches of the whole basin the uyr is the major source of comprehensive water utilization for cities industry and agriculture along the river meanwhile 25 reservoirs have been built or planned in the uyr with 16 3 gw of total installed capacity and undertake the important task of transporting clean energy to the north west electricity network of china li et al 2013 additionally the ecology in the uyr has been destroyed and threatened by the construction of dam and the regulation of natural runoff the living environment of many indigenous fish in the uyr has been destroyed and threatened zhang et al 2011 shen et al 2014 more importantly due to the sharp cut in runoff caused by the construction of upstream dams and high sediment concentration of tributaries inflow wsr is urgent to carry out because of a suspended river of 268 km is formed in the ningxia inner mongolia hereafter nim reach and the riverbed elevation is 3 5 m higher than cities along the river which endangers the safety of downstream river channel and life and poverty security of people chang et al 2014 yao et al 2017 jin et al 2019a it is also crucial to control ice disaster by limiting the discharge of the upstream reservoir during the ice control period and maintaining the discharge within a stable and suitable range the nim reach in the uyr enters into the ice control period from november to march every year the freeze up occurs from downstream to upstream in the winter and break up occurs from upstream to downstream in the spring which may lead to ice jams or ice dams due to the quick increase of the ice melt flood and threaten levee safety cause ice flood disasters and huge losses of lives and property on both sides of the levee chang et al 2014 deng et al 2019 longyangxia lyx a multi year operation reservoir and liujiaxia ljx an annual operation reservoir are the two pivotal reservoirs in the uyr which bear the responsibility of water supply power generation ice and flood control be regarded as the constraints of water level and outflow inner river ecology and wsr besides there are thirteen run off reservoirs constructed in the study area serve for power generation or agricultural irrigation i laxiwa ii nina iii lijiaxia iv jishixia v zhiganglaka vi kangyang vii gongboxia viii shuzhi ix yanguoxia x bapanxia xi xiaoxia xii daxia and xiii qingtongxia the total installed capacity of the multi reservoir system is 116 40 105 kw the layout of the multi reservoir system can be found in si fig s1 the primary statistics of the two pivotal reservoirs are listed in si table s3 and the initial water level of lyx and ljx reservoir in the optimization model is 2580 m and 1720 m respectively 4 2 data sources lanzhou hereafter lz section is the most important section with a major hydrological station which controls the water supply for irrigation important cities and industrial parks in the uyr the monthly demand of water supply in the lz section is shown in fig 4 for agriculture irrigation in the uyr the major crops include wheat rice corn and sunflowers while the largest area of planting crops is corn zhang 2019 yan et al 2013 to ensure the sufficient irrigation for main crops during the critical growth stages e g the seeding period the filling stage and the flowering period the early and the mid may the early june the early and the mid july the mid august have been chosen as the critical stages of agriculture according to the law of crop growing process there are serval spawning grounds feeding grounds wintering grounds and migration channels in the reach from szs section to bygl section for 26 species of indigenous fish and the monthly discharge demand for inner river ecology in this reach is shown in table 1 liu et al 2010 to avoid ice flooding disaster the release discharge of ljx reservoir during the ice control period must be limited to a low level and the upper limit discharge of ljx reservoir is shown in table 2 according to the literature on the wsr and multi objective regulation in uyr the regulating discharge of wsr in the uyr should be maintained to the 2240 m3 s to 3000 m3 s range and the duration time for wsr should be maintained to the 10 days to 30 days range jin et al 2019a an et al 2019 moreover wsr should be carried out during the flood control period by utilizing natural floodwater bi et al 2019 in this study long and extensive runoff data are collected from the yellow river conservancy commission hereafter yrcc which consisted of monthly runoff series of 56 years 1960 2015 monthly fig 5 the streamflow had a general decreasing tendency in the uyr the 90 day min had shifted from high streamflow to low streamflow conditions near 1990 and the same phenomenon was also observed for the 7 day maximum with decreasing variability zhang et al 2018b similarly the reach about the trend free pre whitening mann kendall test on runoff variation in the uyr shows that the years of 1989 and 1990 are the potential changing points of the annual runoff zheng et al 2018 the annual reservoir runoff in lyx reservoir from 1990 to 2015 is 178 94 108m3 which is 41 69 108m3 less than that from 1960 to 1989 with a decline of 18 90 therefore the runoff data from 1960 to 1989 were used to compare the difference of multi objective synergetic regulation model and traditional optimal operation model and the runoff data from 1990 to 2015 were used to quantify the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation 4 3 primary and secondary requirements for multiple objectives the primary and secondary requirements of the multi objectives are used as guidelines for multi objective synergetic operation with an emphasis on the balance of the various water utilization objectives the general principle for setting the primary requirements is to recognize the relative importance of multi objectives representing multiple water requirements the primary requirements play an essential and indispensable role for instance the urban and rural domestic water demand ecological water requirement out of the river and the water demand in the critical growth stages of crops which are sensitive to soil moisture and directly affect the yield of crops in agriculture irrigation are needed to maintain some key benefits which are usually considered as primary requirements in the study area in particular the monthly minimum required ecological flow and the flow impulse in may and june are essential for the reproduction and growth of fish and the maintenance of the biological population and biodiversity in the river the hydropower with the cascade dams is crucial to electricity generation in the wet season from april to october taking advantage of the high water heads for wsr the controlled discharge and duration time for one wsr application are directly related to the amount of sand sluicing a schematic diagram of wsr carried out by the cascade reservoirs is provided in si fig s2 table 3 shows the primary and secondary requirements of multi objectives in the case study area the critical stages of agriculture in the table 3 refers to the early and middle may the early june the early and middle july and the middle august which are selected according to the critical stages of the chief crops corn and wheat in the uyr consequently in the reservoirs multi objective synergetic regulation model for the uyr the time interval for reservoirs operation in may june july and august is ten days and in other months is month there are twenty time intervals in a hydrologic year 4 4 threshold and weight coefficients of order parameters in the study area determining the thresholds of order parameters is a key procedure for implementing mosrr based on the determined thresholds of order parameters the order degree of the order parameters can be calculated the maximal and minimal values of order parameters for the four subsystems can be determined theoretically for the case study area in practice the maximal value of ws 1 and ws 2 are determined by 40 of water demand for irrigation in critical and non critical stages respectively the maximal value of f wsr is empirically determined as 30 00 according to another study in uyr jin et al 2019b and the wsr has been carried out in 6 years in a regulation period of 24 years which means the frequency of wsr is 25 00 in this literature the maximal value of n ele1 and n ele2 are determined by sum of the installed capacity of cascade reservoirs finally the maximal and minimal value of order parameters have been shown in table 4 to obtain the weight coefficients of order parameters for the multi objectives we invited 10 experts to grade the order parameters of each of the subsystems established the pair wise comparison judgment matrix and used the ahp method to estimate the weight of order parameters table 5 the value of consistency ratio cr of all subsystems does not exceed 0 10 as shown in table 5 which shows that the matrixes are consistent 5 results and discussion 5 1 effectiveness of the synergetic model 5 1 1 order degrees the order degree of each order parameter and subsystem and the final synergetic degree of the multi objective operating system of reservoirs are shown in table 6 which reflect the degree of satisfaction of the primary and secondary requirements of each subsystem the order degrees of primary requirements p water1 ws 1 mdr in the subsystem of water supply are 1 00 0 86 0 77 respectively note that higher value of order degree mean the order parameter are more orderly the primary requirements in water supply is satisfied with higher priority than the secondary requirements the order degrees of primary requirements are much higher than the secondary requirements in the subsystem of power generation revealing that the benefits of power generation in the dry season cannot be satisfied for the subsystem of wsr the order degrees of primary requirements and secondary requirements shows that the benefit of wsr has been guaranteed the order degree of secondary requirement is higher than the order degrees of primary requirements of wsr and the reason that the order degree of f wsr is 1 00 as a result of the maximal threshold of f wsr was empirically set as 30 00 in the subsystem of inner river ecology the order degrees of all order parameters are higher than 0 90 reveal that the needs of inner river ecology are satisfied well though multi objective synergetic regulation importantly the order degrees of subsystem of water supply and inner river ecology are much higher than subsystem of power generation and wsr finally the synergetic degree of the whole system is 0 78 which basically reflects the orderly regulation of multi objectives operation of the cascade reservoirs 5 1 2 comparison between the synergetic model and traditional model to verify the effectiveness of the synergetic model we compare the results of the synergetic model and the traditional model from two aspects one is the comparison of the total benefits as shown in table 7 the other aspect is the comparison of benefits in water using processes referring to the primary and secondary requirements of the multi objectives shown in table 8 in the traditional model the objective of inner river ecology has been transferred into strong constraints so only the total benefits of the rest of three objectives can be compared it can be seen in table 7 that for the objective of water supply the annual shortage for water supply in the synergetic model is 9 41 108m3 which has been reduced by 1 92 108m3 compared with the traditional model and the rate of variation is 16 95 this reveals that the synergetic model is propitious to improve the total benefit of water supply for the objective of power generation the annual power generation of 15 power stations is 512 18 108kw h in the traditional model and it has been fallen to 509 39 108 kw h in the synergetic model this reflects that the synergetic model had lost more total benefit of power generation since the lowest priority in the principles of mosrr for the objective of wsr the total water volume of wsr in the traditional model is 369 37 108m3 and it is increased to 378 04 108m3 in the synergetic model in general except for power generation the results of the total benefits of multi objectives in the synergetic model are better than the traditional model especially the total benefits of the water supply have been improved significantly as shown in table 8 among the statistical results of primary and secondary requirements of water supply the synergetic model has generated better performance by reducing the water shortage and improving the guaranteed rate of the water supply of agriculture both in critical and non critical stages the value of water shortage in critical and non critical stages of agriculture i e ws 1 and ws 2 in the synergetic model is decreased by 25 71 and 12 97 compared with the traditional model respectively meanwhile the rate of variation of mdr in the synergetic model is 20 69 lower than that in the traditional model which is improved significantly comparing the primary and secondary requirements of power generation between the two models except the value of n ele2 in the synergetic model has been decreased by 4 35 the rest indicators achieve varying degrees of improvement especially the value of p ele1 in the synergetic model has been increased by 7 45 it should be noted that the value of p ele2 in the two models are both 30 the reason for this is the ice flood controlling in the dry season in uyr has limited the power generation of cascade reservoirs among the primary and secondary requirements of wsr in the two models only the value of q wsr had been rising slightly in the synergetic model and the rate of variation is 3 50 the other indicators remained unchanged similarly only the value of t eco2 in the synergetic model had been rising 2 50 compared with the traditional model the rest requirements of inner river ecology among the two models had remained the same value in general except for the indicator of n ele2 the results of primary and secondary requirements of multiple objectives in the synergetic model are better than the traditional model or stay the same value especially the primary requirements of water supply and power generation have been increased obviously it can be concluded that although the annual power generation of cascade reservoirs and the average output in the dry season are reduced slightly the rest total benefits and the primary requirements of multi objective have been improved obviously by using synergetic model which has proved the effectiveness of the model of mosrr 5 2 effect of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation 5 2 1 comparison of order degrees in two time periods the order degrees of primary and secondary requirements of multi objectives for the two time periods 1960 1989 and 1990 2015 are compared to illustrate the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation shown in table 9 it can be seen in table 9 that 1 affected by the runoff decrease the synergetic degree of the whole system in time period of 1990 2015 is 0 66 15 38 lower than that in 1960 1989 the order degrees of the four subsystems are 0 83 0 56 0 43 and 0 96 respectively which are 2 58 13 85 36 76 and 3 03 lower than that in 1960 1989 separately a great majority of the order degrees of primary and secondary requirements among the four subsystems except the t eco1 is reduced at many levels compared with the time period of 1960 1989 2 for the subsystem of water supply except for the order parameters of p water1 and ws 1 the decline of order degrees of primary and secondary requirements in time period of 1990 2015 is over 5 and the largest drop is 11 84 in the order parameter of maximum deficit ratio mdr in critical stages of agriculture this indicates that when the runoff decreases for the period of 1990 2015 the primary requirements of industry life and ecological water demand out of the river only decline slightly but the primary and secondary requirements of agriculture suffers more losses 3 for the subsystem of power generation the order degrees of primary requirements in the time period of 1990 2015 are 0 93 0 49 respectively compared to the period of 1960 1989 the average decline of order degrees of primary and secondary requirements are 13 5 22 4 separately which reveals that the runoff reduction has much more negative influence on power generation under a drier condition 4 the decline in the order degrees of primary and secondary requirements in subsystems of wsr and inner river ecology cannot be neglected for the subsystems of wsr the order degrees of q wsr t wsr and f wsr in 1990 2015 have been reduced by 32 86 10 26 54 00 respectively the influence of runoff decrease on wsr is considerable for the subsystem of inner river ecology the order degrees of p eco and t eco2 decreases slightly in the time period of 1990 2015 5 2 2 comparison of multi objectives besides comparing the difference of the order degrees of order parameters between the two time periods the comparison of comprehensive efficiencies and benefit values for multiple objectives can reveal the effect of runoff reduction on the multi objective synergetic regulation more intuitively table 10 shows the mean annual benefits of primary and secondary requirements of multiple objectives for the two time periods it is clearly seen in table 10 that for benefits of water supply compared with the results in the time period of 1960 1989 the value of water shortage in critical stages ws 1 and non critical stages of agriculture ws 2 and the maximum deficit ratio mdr in critical stages of agriculture increase in 1990 2015with a change rate over 20 for the three indicators however the guaranteed rate of water supply in non critical stages of agriculture p water2 in 1990 2015 is lower 3 8 than that in 1960 1989 this shows that the impact of runoff reduction on the water supply for the whole stages of agriculture is significant for benefits of power generation the guaranteed rate and the monthly average power output of reservoirs in wet season i e p ele1 n ele1 and dry season i e p ele2 n ele2 in 1990 2015 are 6 55 20 59 27 90 16 57 lower than that in 1960 1989 respectively this reveals the power generation of cascade reservoirs is effected distinctly by runoff decline for benefits of wsr in the time period of 1990 2015 the average regulating discharge of one wsr q wsr is 150 86 m3 s lower than that in 1960 1989 and the average duration of one wsr t wsr and the frequency of long term wsr f wsr are 4 39 and 35 90 lower than that in 1960 1989 respectively this reflects that affected by runoff reduction q wsr and t wsr has been small decreased but f wsr has been cut down sharply for benefits of inner river ecology the guaranteed rate of basic ecological flow p eco in 1990 2015 is 3 08 lower than that in 1969 1989 the number of ecological impulses in may and june t eco2 is decreased by 7 34 than that in 1969 1989 despite the small amount of decline in p eco and t eco2 the benefits of inner river ecology can be ensured well on the background of runoff reduction moreover the long term changing process of primary and secondary requirements could reflect how the runoff reduction effects the guarantee of multi objectives the fig 6 has shown the changing processes of some primary and secondary requirements of water supply in the two time periods similarly the changing processes of some primary and secondary requirements power generation have been shown in fig 7 the changing processes of some benefits of wsr and inner river ecology have been shown in table 11 and fig 8 respectively it can be observed in fig 6 that the value range of water shortage in critical stages of agriculture i e ws 1 in 1990 2015 is up to 14 58 108m3 which is 3 28 108m3 higher than the maximal ws 1 in 1960 1989 with eight years of no shortage the range of water shortage in non critical stages of agriculture i e ws 2 in 1990 2015 is up to 33 82 108m3 and the maximal value is 41 87 of the total demand in non critical stages of agriculture which is 21 01 higher than that in 1960 1989 the value range of the maximum deficit ratio in critical stages of agriculture i e mdr in 1990 2015 is from 0 to 0 78 with eight years being 0 one more year than that in 1960 1989 and the maximal mdr occurred in the year of 2008 overall the performance of the three order parameters of water supply in 1990 2015 is worse than that in 1960 1989 reflect the negative influence of runoff reduction on water supply in the uyr fig 7 shows that influenced by ice flood control the monthly average power output of cascade reservoirs in wet season i e n ele1 is much greater than that in dry season i e n ele2 in all years and the average difference between n ele1 and n ele2 in 1960 1989 is 84 08 104kw higher than that in 1990 2015 which reflect the advantage of power generation in wet season is diminished effected by runoff reduction the maximal n ele1 in 1960 1989 is 918 76 104kw 207 18 104kw higher than that in 1990 2015 and minimal n ele1 in 1960 1989 is 168 12 104kw higher than that in 1990 2015 the value range of n ele2 in 1960 1989 is from 336 61 104kw to 423 87 104kw but from 111 20 104kw to 389 18 104kw in 1990 2015 the amount of annual power generation of cascade reservoirs in 1990 2015 is within the range from 231 11 108kw h to 488 19 108kw h which are 184 94 108kw h and 124 09 108kw h less than the minimal and maximal annual power generation in 1960 1989 respectively in general runoff reduction in 1990 2015 has a huge impact on power generation for cascade reservoirs in the uyr it is can be observed from table 11 that the number of years with wsr application in the two time periods are nine and five respectively which means that wsr should be applied once every three years averagely in 1960 1989 and every five years averagely in 1990 2015 the maximal and minimal regulating discharge of wsr q wsr in 1960 1989 are 2887 53 m3 s 2567 25 m3 s respectively the value range of water volume for once wsr application is from 26 31 108m3 to 52 39 108m3 in 1960 1989 the value of q wsr in 1990 2015 ranges from 2384 22 m3 s to 2731 20 m3 s and the average water volume of once wsr application is 38 57 108m3 which is 3 18 108m3 less than that in 1960 1989 in general although the regulating discharge and duration of once wsr application would not be effected obviously the frequency of long term wsr would be reduced significantly because of runoff reduction fig 8 shows that the guaranteed rate of basic ecological flow i e p eco is 100 in all years of 1960 1989 and most years of 1990 2015 moreover six times of ecological impulses occurred in most years of 1960 1989 and only five years with three or five times of ecological impulses however the times of ecological impulses in 1990 2015 ranges from two to six and only five years with six times of ecological impulses which is decreased significantly compared with 1960 1989 this indicates that runoff reduction has a small impact on the guarantee of basic ecological flow but a greater impact on ecological impulses needed for fish reproduction and growth based on the above analysis of results in section 5 2 it can be concluded that the performance of multi objective synergetic regulation is effected greatly by runoff reduction in most cases fortunately with limited water resources in 1990 2015 the benefits of primary requirements of multi objectives have been guaranteed as much as possible by the regulation of the synergetic model to prevent further losses 5 3 operation modes of cascade reservoirs from the synergetic model the changing process of inflow and outflow of cascade reservoirs are used to reflect the joint operation modes of them based on the synergetic model as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 meanwhile the changing process of the water level of cascade reservoirs is shown in fig 11 and fig 12 it is can be observed from fig 9 that benefitting from huge regulating storage the lyx reservoir has greatly changed the uneven natural runoff process by reducing the flood peak discharge and increases the downstream discharge in the dry season in the time period of 1960 1989 the maximum inflow discharge of the lyx reservoir is 3550 m3 s which is occurred in september 1981 and the outflow discharge has been cut down to 715 m3 s greatly in this period moreover there are thirteen times when the outflow discharge of the lyx reservoir is more than 1300 m3 s in 1960 1989 which are all occurred in the wsr period or flood control period however effected by runoff reduction the maximum inflow discharge of lyx reservoir in 1990 2015 is 2577 m3 s and only five times of outflow discharge above 1300 m3 s fig 10 shows that as the anti regulating reservoir of lyx the role of ljx reservoir is reducing the outflow discharge to follow the upper limit outflow discharge during the ice flood control period strictly increasing the outflow discharge to meet the downstream comprehensive water requirement in the irrigation and wsr period and storing a part of the outflow of lyx reservoir in the main flood season it is noteworthy that the outflow of lyx and ljx reservoirs from february to april in 2002 the driest year in 1990 2015 are all lower than the basic ecological flow this reflects that even the priority order of inner river ecology is highest in principles of mosrr the primary requirements of inner river ecology cannot be guaranteed effectively under extreme drought conditions fig 11 shows that the times of water level of lyx reservoir reach to the normal water level i e 2600 00 m in 1960 1989 and 1990 2015 are six and zero respectively and the times of water level drop to the dead water level i e 2530 00 m in the two time periods are three and twelve respectively this indicates that the ability of capacity utilization of the lyx reservoir has been weakened in 1990 2015 effected by runoff reduction the water level is unable to recover to normal water level result from increasing the outflow discharge to meet the comprehensive water demand finally the water level of the lyx reservoir drop to 2567 12 m at the end of 1990 2015 which is 16 48 m lower than that in 1960 1989 fig 12 shows that because of the smaller storage capacity and function of anti regulating the yearly variation amplitude of the water level of the ljx reservoir is large especially in the years with wsr application the water level of the ljx reservoir falls sharply the minimal water level of the ljx reservoir in 1960 1989 is 5 29 m higher than that in 1990 2015 it is worth note that the water level of ljx reservoir has dropped to the dead water level i e 1694 00 m in nine years in 1990 2015 while the water level of lyx reservoir is close to the dead water level as well what represents the capability of adjusting river runoff by cascade reservoirs has been fully exploited in the case of runoff reduction 5 4 the countermeasures for runoff reduction based on the analysis of the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation of the cascade reservoirs in the study area it is undeniable that the negative effects will be posed to the various water use benefits although the application of the synergetic model could reduce the impact of runoff reduction on primary requirements of the multi objectives to reduce the impact of runoff reduction on ecological environment and social economic development fundamentally more attention should be paid on external or irregular sources of water supply to the study for example via the projected west route of the south north water transfer project which is planned to divert 170 108 m3 of water per year from the tributaries of china s largest river i e yangtze river to the upper yellow river in the future office of the south to north water diversion project construction committee 2016 besides the expansion of freshwater sources which can be subject to environmental and socio economic consequences in the near term adopting advanced irrigation technologies and reuse of municipal waste water can be more effective measures studies show that advanced irrigation technologies could save water up to 34 39 of the current use wu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 municipal sewage reuse has benefits of alleviating pressure onto the aquatic environment avoiding long distance transport of raw water possibly saving energy for conventional purification and transmission and diminishing process water loss wang et al 2017a xu et al 2019 a major move to build a water saving society is a significant institutional adjustment in the agricultural sector in china including crop pattern change liu et al 2018 it is expected that the combination of technological and policy measures should eliminate the adverse effects of runoff reduction on water use benefits in the uyr 6 conclusions this paper proposes a new approach for multi objective synergetic regulation of a cascade reservoir system mosrr in a sediment laden river based on the general principles of multi objective synergetic regulations and the recognition and quantification of primary and secondary requirements for each of the multi objectives the multiple requirements are classified into primary and secondary categories and the priority levels of key operation targets are assessed by stakeholders via a survey method mosrr is applied to a system of cascade reservoirs along the upper yellow river in china considering climatic and hydrologic variability the results from mosrr are compared to those from a traditional multi objective optimal operation model the results from two time periods of runoff data 1960 1989 and 1990 2015 with different water availability levels are compared to show the effect of runoff reduction and how mosrr can mitigate the effects the results show that the total benefits of water supply and wsr will increase significantly via mosrr with a small decline in the annual power generation two primary requirements of water supply water shortage in critical crop growth stages ws 1 and the maximum deficit ratio of water supply in a single period mdr will be improved by 25 7 and 20 7 respectively compared to the traditional model a primary requirement of power generation the guaranteed rate of power generation in wet season p ele1 will increase by 7 5 from the traditional model at the expense of slight reduction of energy output in the dry season runoff reduction in the study area will have the most significant impact on water supply with the primary requirements ws 1 and mdr relatively minor impact on hydropower generation and wsr some countermeasures for runoff decrease in the study area such as water saving irrigation municipal sewage reuse as well as policy changes are suggested it is found that streamflow variability can complicate the tradeoff relations among the multiple objectives and mosrr can effectively support the balance of the economic and environmental requirements based on prescribed priorities policies and regulations for the operations of large scale cascade reservoir systems operations although the proposed mosrr is only demonstrated to the uyr in this paper the generic framework allows the approach to be applied to other reservoir systems credit

4470,multi objective requirements including water supply hydropower generation water sediment regulation wsr and inner river ecosystem maintenance should be fully valued in the operation of reservoirs located on a sediment laden river in order to balance the satisfaction of multiple objectives with intense competition and guarantee the primary requirements preferentially this paper presents a novel framework that incorporates the recognition and classification of primary and secondary requirements of multiple operation targets a set of principles for multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs mosrr following the theory of synergetics and the optimization model construction of mosrr considering the maximization synergetic degree of multi objective the analytic hierarchy process and particle swarm optimization algorithm are employed to determine the weight and solve the mosrr model respectively mosrr is applied to a system of cascade reservoirs along the upper yellow river in china considering climatic and hydrologic variability the results from mosrr are compared to those from a traditional multi objective optimal operation model it is found that the guarantee of multi objective requirements from mosrr have been improved visibly compare with the traditional model at the expense of a slight reduction in the hydropower generation especially the secondary requirement of the energy output in the dry season also mosrr can mitigate the effects of runoff reduction through minimizing the damage of primary requirements which is more appropriate for multi objective reservoir operation with limited water in sediment laden river the proposed mosrr framework can be applied to other large scale reservoir systems with stiff competition in water resources keywords multi objective regulation cascade reservoirs synergetics sediment laden river runoff reduction 1 introduction nowadays sediment laden river basins are facing a serious situation with mounting demand for water supply due to rapid societal development and growing water requirement to sustain river ecological health especially sediment deposition and suspended river problems ran et al 2020 wang et al 2017b sediment deposition and suspended river problem in sediment laden river caused by dam construction and regulation of runoff usually have caused various negative effects such as reduction of channel discharge capacity and the available storage in reservoirs induction of downstream morphological changes shrinkage of river channel rises of the riverbed and exacerbation of the possibility of severe flooding greatly guo et al 2020 hauer et al 2018 tang et al 2019 to relieve the impact of sediment deposition reservoirs in sediment laden rivers are employed to release controlled flood to scour downstream riverbed which has raised gradually owing to river flow alteration and sediment accumulation at the expense of decreasing the socio economic benefit of reservoirs kong et al 2015 this is referred to water sediment regulation hereafter wsr which is shown as an efficient non engineering measure with less investment faster effect and easier to implement compared to sediment retaining sediment transportation and artificial sand excavation jin et al 2019a bai et al 2019 in consequence except for the normal routine taskings of water supply power generation flood control and inner river ecology wsr is another important objective for water resources utilization by reservoirs in sediment laden rivers which inevitably accelerates the disordered competition between multiple objectives multi objective reservoirs regulation has always been a complicated issue and the usual method to solve the problem is to adopt weight method or constraint method to transform multi objective problem into single objective problem or use multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea to solve the problem directly traditional reservoir operation models often consider the total benefit value of the whole regulating period such as maximizing total hydropower generation minimizing total water shortages however some primary requirements which are related to the core purpose of water utilization and once being dissatisfied will lead the social economy and ecological environment to suffer great losses have not been given sufficient attention in traditional models the protection of primary requirements of multi objective should be fully valued in reservoirs operation under the intense competition of multi objective in water lacking basin especially a sediment laden river in the arid area and there is not much research on how to balance the guarantee of primary i e rigid water requirements and secondary i e water requirements that can allow some changes requirements in multi objective reservoirs regulation thus it is urgent to propose a novel approach to deal with multi objective problems of reservoirs operation in sediment laden river by emphasizing the primary requirements as a scientific theory studing the evolution of open systems from disorder state to ordered state synergetics theory has been applied to many areas of water resources management chang et al 2004 proposed a method to simulate the multi objective operation of the reservoir based on the synergetics theory and evaluate the schemes by the entropy of information principles huang and chang 2007 used the synergetics theory to manage and control the regulation plans of flood prevention water supply and power generation of yellow river china gan et al 2010 used synergetics to set the order parameters of resource ecological economic social and environmental subsystems in the water cycle system and establish order degree entropy function to evaluate the evolution direction of the system yao et al 2017 selected the indicators of water resources development economic and social development to evaluate the sustainable water resources utilization based on synergetics zhen 2019 taken three order parameters based on synergetics to realize the multiple subjects cooperative participation in the watershed eco compensation zhang et al 2020 developed an assessment model based on the synergy theory and information entropy to measure the synergies of water energy food nexus wefn systems then developed a synergy evolution model to analyze the steady states of wefn systems despite that a few attempts were made on the multi objective operation of reservoirs based on the synergetics theory the attention on synergetic regulation of primary and secondary requirements among multiple objectives have not been well evaluated which is the knowledge gap that this study aims to address on the other hand runoff reduction caused by climate change and anthropogenic activities has an adverse effect on the water utilization and river health conservation around the world the runoff into the major water supply reservoirs in south western australia have declined by more than 50 since the mid1970s had major implications for water resources planning and the preservation of aquatic and riparian ecosystems silberstein et al 2012 climate change was the main reason for the runoff reduction of lake issyk kul basin in central asia hindered the management and sustainable allocation of water resources alifujiang et al 2021 similarly runoff reduction in sediment laden river should aggravate the competition between multi objective and need more effective measures to help reservoirs to cope with water shortages research shows that as the main runoff generation area of the most famous sediment laden river i e the yellow river the upper yellow river in china uyr the study area in this paper is facing a decreasing trend in runoff caused by climate change mainly tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 doubtlessly runoff reduction could bring tough challenges to the multi objective operation of reservoirs in sediment laden river and urgently need to treat the primary and secondary requirements of multi objective in sequence the primary requirements is prior the secondary requirements is posterior meanwhile the impact of runoff reduction on primary and secondary requirements of multi objective has not been quantified ever before and needs in depth investigation in this study overall how to explore new approaches for guiding reservoirs operation based on the security of primary requirements with limited water quantify and mitigate the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective water utilization have become frontier problems of water and sediment management in sediment laden river in this work we propose a novel framework on multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs mosrr based on the theory of synergetics set the synergetic regulation principles for multi objective primary and secondary requirements establish a multi objective synergetic regulation model of reservoirs and prove the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed model through comparing the results with the traditional model then the impacts of runoff reduction on primary and secondary requirements have been quantified through driving the multi objective synergetic regulation model in two time periods of runoff data before and after the runoff changing point lastly the operation modes of cascade reservoirs based on the synergetic regulation model are illustrated to guide the actual operation and some countermeasures for runoff reduction have been suggested in the study area the research route of this article is shown in fig 1 2 theory for mosrr 2 1 a brief introduction of synergetics synergetics is a meta disciplinary field fusing natural and social sciences to analyze systems composed of many interconnected components in particular synergetics addresses the mechanism and laws of the transformation of a system from a disorder state to an ordered state through the synergy among the internal sub systems haken 2004 2006 i e how the ordered structure of an open system that is away from an equilibrium state is achieved in time and space when there is material or energy exchange between the open system and environment a li et al 2013 the theory of synergetics is based on principles of synergistic effect the servo principle and self organization the synergistic effect refers to the overall effect of the subsystems is greater than the sum of individual parts in a complex open system the servo principle is stated as the fast variables are subject to the slow variables and the behaviors of subsystems are dominated by the order of parameters which describes the process of self organization in terms of the interaction between internal and external factors of the system the principle of self organization explains that the system forms a new ordered structure through the synergy between subsystems under the condition of certain inputs of external material energy and information the multi objective operation of a reservoir as a system follows the basic principles of the synergetic theory first reservoirs have a large number of complex materials energy and information interaction with the external natural and social environment such as the flow input and electric energy and water supply output to human society and information exchange between reservoir operators and water users stakeholders those complex interactions make the process of multi objective reservoirs operation as a complex open system far from equilibrium secondly the nonlinear interactions between many regulating tasks e g flood control social water supply clean power generation reducing sediment deposition and maintaining river ecological health requires a joint operation plan of a single or a system of cascade reservoirs to deal with the tradeoffs and synergies existing between many regulating tasks 2 2 principles of multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs it is necessary to highlight that primary requirements refer to the special or most valuable water demand in terms of each of the multi objectives for the reservoir system operation and the failure of any primary requirements will bring serious adverse impacts secondary requirements specify the elastic demand for each objective and a moderate failure will not cause a serious impact on the objective subsystem to guarantee the primary requirements and achieve the equilibrium of primary and secondary requirements among multiple objectives the general principle of multi objective synergetic regulation of reservoirs and the tenets of synergetic operation for primary and secondary requirements are set to guide the concrete implementation shown in fig 2 3 methods 3 1 calculation of the order degree according to the theory of synergetics order parameters of a subsystem are the leading factors to determine the evolution of the subsystems and they dominate the behaviors of the subsystem the evolution of the entire system is determined by the ordered contributions from all subsystems the order degree of an order parameter associated with a particular subsystem refers to the contribution of the order parameter to the evolution of the subsystem 3 1 1 the order degree of an order parameter the order parameters of primary and secondary requirements can be classified into three types 1 positive order parameters the larger the value of an order parameter the higher order level the subsystem has 2 negative order parameters the smaller the value of an order parameter the higher order level the subsystem has 3 middle order parameter the highest order level of a subsystem can be reached when the values of its order parameters are fixed values the larger distance to the fixed values reflect a lower order level of the subsystem in the theory of synergetic the order degree of one order parameter is usually quantified by the efficacy function and common types of efficacy functions include linear function exponential function logarithmic function power function and so on wang et al 2020 the commonly used type of efficacy function is the linear efficacy function that is employed in this paper and three different linear efficacy functions for calculating the order degree of three types of order parameters are shown as formulas 1 2 3 respectively 1 d j positive e nk e nk j min e nk max e nk min e nk 2 d j negative e nk max e nk e nk j max e nk min e nk 3 d j middle e nk 1 e nk j c max e nk min e nk where n is the number of subsystems k is the number of order parameters of n subsystem j is the number of hydrological years d j e nk is the order degree of k order parameter of n subsystem in j year e nk j is the value of k order parameter of n subsystem in j year max e nk and min e nk are the minimum and maximum allowable value of k order parameter of n subsystem c is the fixed value of order parameter when the highest orderly of the subsystem 3 1 2 order degree of subsystems the order degree of a subsystem in a period can be calculated by the linear weighted sum of the order degree of all order parameters of the subsystem and it reflects the ordered contribution level to the whole system evolution the calculating function for the order degree of subsystem of one year has been shown in equation 4 it should be noted that since the order parameter of f wsr must be obtained based on a long term scale f wsr is equal to the number of years taken wsr divided by the total years the order degree of the wsr subsystem of one period e g year only can be calculated with the two order parameters of qwsr and t wsr 4 h j s n k 1 k ω nk d j e nk where k is the total number of order parameters of n subsystem d j e nk is the order degree of k order parameter of n subsystem in j year ω nk is the weight coefficient of k order parameter of n subsystem h j s n is the order degree of n th subsystem in j year 3 2 multi objective synergetic regulation model of reservoirs reservoirs optimal operation is a multi stage decision making problem and the stages can be selected according to the time interval e g month or ten days of whole regulating period in the multi objective synergetic regulation model of reservoirs proposed in this paper the reservoir water level at the end of each time interval are selected as decision variables and the number of decision variables is equal to the number of reservoirs participated in the joint regulation multiplied by the total number of time intervals of whole regulating period the historical runoff data is the input variables for the model 3 2 1 the optimization objective function the synergetic degree of a multi objective operating system of reservoirs can be obtained by geometric average of the order degree of each subsystem i e water supply power generation inner river ecology sediment transport and the synergetic degree can be regarded as the final optimization object for the synergetic regulating model shown as

parameters e g ω nk in eq 4 ahp is a multi criteria decision making method to solve complex decision problems and applied in the water management field widely lu et al 2017 achu et al 2020 the detailed solution of typical ahp are as following 1 transforming the multiple criteria problem into a hierarchy 2 building pair wise comparison matrices 3 calculating the relative weights of the comparison elements by solving the judgment matrix and 4 conducting the consistency test via a consistency index ren et al 2019 more detailed instructions about ahp are provided in supporting information si tables s1 and s2 3 2 4 model solution by using pso algorithm the optimization model of mosrr could be solved by evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm progressive optimality algorithm or machine learning algorithms i e support vector machine deep learning and artificial neural network as well each algorithm mentioned above with its own superiority and limitation has been applied in the field of reservoir operation in varying degrees the evolutionary algorithms and classic machine learning algorithms i e support vector machine artificial neural network have been successfully and widely applied to the reservoir operation field for many years deep learning a new type of machine learning algorithm has gradually become the frontier of computer science and technology in recent years and has been tentatively introduced into the reservoir operation field in a few literatures zhang et al 2018a liu et al 2019 in this study a widely used and efficient algorithm the particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed particle swarm optimization algorithm pso was first discovered and proposed by kennedy and eberhart in 1995 which originated from the study of bird predation behavior lsiet and gadala 2020 pso as an efficient parallel optimization method is suitable for solving some nonlinear non differentiable and multi objective complex optimization problems and has been widely used in solving reservoir optimal operation problem because of its simple principle fewer parameters and fast search speed ahmadianfar et al 2019 bai et al 2017 the main framework of typical pso are as following 1 generate the initial population of individuals so called particles and move these particles around in the search space 2 calculate the objective function of each particle based on its coordination in the search space 3 choose a direction for each particle using the current position and its best position in the previous iterations p best and also the best position of the whole population or swarm g best 4 move the particles to new positions and the objective function values of particles solutions are evaluated resulting in p best and g best in each iteration and 5 repeat this process until some stopping criteria are met hatamkhani et al 2020 the main parameters of the pso algorithm as population size number of generation inertia weight inertia weight damping ratio personal learning coefficient and global learning coefficient are 120 1000 1 0 0 99 1 5 and 2 0 respectively to compare with the results from the proposed mosrr a traditional multi objective optimal operation model was also constructed and solved by the pso algorithm as well details about the traditional model are provided in si 4 case study area 4 1 the upper yellow river and cascade reservoirs the yellow river is known as china s mother river and it plays a powerful role in china s economy wang et al 2019 as the second longest river in china the yellow river originates from the bayan har mountains in the qinghai tibet plateau flows through the three major stairs of the macroscopic landform structure of china i e the qinghai tibet plateau the loess plateau and the north china plain with a length of 5464 km and a basin area of 0 75 million km2 and finally imports into bohai fig 3 chang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the high annual sediment load approximately 1 5 108 tons with the low annual average runoff 2 2 1010m3 makes the yellow river a most famous sediment laden river in the world xu et al 2019 meanwhile the yellow river is an important source for water supply in the northwestern and northern china supplying freshwater for approximately 8 7 of the total population chang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b the upper yellow river hereafter uyr includes the reaches from the source to the toudaoguai tdg section in inner mongolia fig 3 with a total length of 3472 km and a basin area of 386000 km2 the runoff of the reach accounts for 54 of the whole river which is the key area of runoff yield jin et al 2019a there are four primary objectives that the uyr need to achieve 1 sufficient water supply for society 2 power generation 3 inner river ecology 4 wsr in the low runoff production in the middle reaches of the whole basin the uyr is the major source of comprehensive water utilization for cities industry and agriculture along the river meanwhile 25 reservoirs have been built or planned in the uyr with 16 3 gw of total installed capacity and undertake the important task of transporting clean energy to the north west electricity network of china li et al 2013 additionally the ecology in the uyr has been destroyed and threatened by the construction of dam and the regulation of natural runoff the living environment of many indigenous fish in the uyr has been destroyed and threatened zhang et al 2011 shen et al 2014 more importantly due to the sharp cut in runoff caused by the construction of upstream dams and high sediment concentration of tributaries inflow wsr is urgent to carry out because of a suspended river of 268 km is formed in the ningxia inner mongolia hereafter nim reach and the riverbed elevation is 3 5 m higher than cities along the river which endangers the safety of downstream river channel and life and poverty security of people chang et al 2014 yao et al 2017 jin et al 2019a it is also crucial to control ice disaster by limiting the discharge of the upstream reservoir during the ice control period and maintaining the discharge within a stable and suitable range the nim reach in the uyr enters into the ice control period from november to march every year the freeze up occurs from downstream to upstream in the winter and break up occurs from upstream to downstream in the spring which may lead to ice jams or ice dams due to the quick increase of the ice melt flood and threaten levee safety cause ice flood disasters and huge losses of lives and property on both sides of the levee chang et al 2014 deng et al 2019 longyangxia lyx a multi year operation reservoir and liujiaxia ljx an annual operation reservoir are the two pivotal reservoirs in the uyr which bear the responsibility of water supply power generation ice and flood control be regarded as the constraints of water level and outflow inner river ecology and wsr besides there are thirteen run off reservoirs constructed in the study area serve for power generation or agricultural irrigation i laxiwa ii nina iii lijiaxia iv jishixia v zhiganglaka vi kangyang vii gongboxia viii shuzhi ix yanguoxia x bapanxia xi xiaoxia xii daxia and xiii qingtongxia the total installed capacity of the multi reservoir system is 116 40 105 kw the layout of the multi reservoir system can be found in si fig s1 the primary statistics of the two pivotal reservoirs are listed in si table s3 and the initial water level of lyx and ljx reservoir in the optimization model is 2580 m and 1720 m respectively 4 2 data sources lanzhou hereafter lz section is the most important section with a major hydrological station which controls the water supply for irrigation important cities and industrial parks in the uyr the monthly demand of water supply in the lz section is shown in fig 4 for agriculture irrigation in the uyr the major crops include wheat rice corn and sunflowers while the largest area of planting crops is corn zhang 2019 yan et al 2013 to ensure the sufficient irrigation for main crops during the critical growth stages e g the seeding period the filling stage and the flowering period the early and the mid may the early june the early and the mid july the mid august have been chosen as the critical stages of agriculture according to the law of crop growing process there are serval spawning grounds feeding grounds wintering grounds and migration channels in the reach from szs section to bygl section for 26 species of indigenous fish and the monthly discharge demand for inner river ecology in this reach is shown in table 1 liu et al 2010 to avoid ice flooding disaster the release discharge of ljx reservoir during the ice control period must be limited to a low level and the upper limit discharge of ljx reservoir is shown in table 2 according to the literature on the wsr and multi objective regulation in uyr the regulating discharge of wsr in the uyr should be maintained to the 2240 m3 s to 3000 m3 s range and the duration time for wsr should be maintained to the 10 days to 30 days range jin et al 2019a an et al 2019 moreover wsr should be carried out during the flood control period by utilizing natural floodwater bi et al 2019 in this study long and extensive runoff data are collected from the yellow river conservancy commission hereafter yrcc which consisted of monthly runoff series of 56 years 1960 2015 monthly fig 5 the streamflow had a general decreasing tendency in the uyr the 90 day min had shifted from high streamflow to low streamflow conditions near 1990 and the same phenomenon was also observed for the 7 day maximum with decreasing variability zhang et al 2018b similarly the reach about the trend free pre whitening mann kendall test on runoff variation in the uyr shows that the years of 1989 and 1990 are the potential changing points of the annual runoff zheng et al 2018 the annual reservoir runoff in lyx reservoir from 1990 to 2015 is 178 94 108m3 which is 41 69 108m3 less than that from 1960 to 1989 with a decline of 18 90 therefore the runoff data from 1960 to 1989 were used to compare the difference of multi objective synergetic regulation model and traditional optimal operation model and the runoff data from 1990 to 2015 were used to quantify the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation 4 3 primary and secondary requirements for multiple objectives the primary and secondary requirements of the multi objectives are used as guidelines for multi objective synergetic operation with an emphasis on the balance of the various water utilization objectives the general principle for setting the primary requirements is to recognize the relative importance of multi objectives representing multiple water requirements the primary requirements play an essential and indispensable role for instance the urban and rural domestic water demand ecological water requirement out of the river and the water demand in the critical growth stages of crops which are sensitive to soil moisture and directly affect the yield of crops in agriculture irrigation are needed to maintain some key benefits which are usually considered as primary requirements in the study area in particular the monthly minimum required ecological flow and the flow impulse in may and june are essential for the reproduction and growth of fish and the maintenance of the biological population and biodiversity in the river the hydropower with the cascade dams is crucial to electricity generation in the wet season from april to october taking advantage of the high water heads for wsr the controlled discharge and duration time for one wsr application are directly related to the amount of sand sluicing a schematic diagram of wsr carried out by the cascade reservoirs is provided in si fig s2 table 3 shows the primary and secondary requirements of multi objectives in the case study area the critical stages of agriculture in the table 3 refers to the early and middle may the early june the early and middle july and the middle august which are selected according to the critical stages of the chief crops corn and wheat in the uyr consequently in the reservoirs multi objective synergetic regulation model for the uyr the time interval for reservoirs operation in may june july and august is ten days and in other months is month there are twenty time intervals in a hydrologic year 4 4 threshold and weight coefficients of order parameters in the study area determining the thresholds of order parameters is a key procedure for implementing mosrr based on the determined thresholds of order parameters the order degree of the order parameters can be calculated the maximal and minimal values of order parameters for the four subsystems can be determined theoretically for the case study area in practice the maximal value of ws 1 and ws 2 are determined by 40 of water demand for irrigation in critical and non critical stages respectively the maximal value of f wsr is empirically determined as 30 00 according to another study in uyr jin et al 2019b and the wsr has been carried out in 6 years in a regulation period of 24 years which means the frequency of wsr is 25 00 in this literature the maximal value of n ele1 and n ele2 are determined by sum of the installed capacity of cascade reservoirs finally the maximal and minimal value of order parameters have been shown in table 4 to obtain the weight coefficients of order parameters for the multi objectives we invited 10 experts to grade the order parameters of each of the subsystems established the pair wise comparison judgment matrix and used the ahp method to estimate the weight of order parameters table 5 the value of consistency ratio cr of all subsystems does not exceed 0 10 as shown in table 5 which shows that the matrixes are consistent 5 results and discussion 5 1 effectiveness of the synergetic model 5 1 1 order degrees the order degree of each order parameter and subsystem and the final synergetic degree of the multi objective operating system of reservoirs are shown in table 6 which reflect the degree of satisfaction of the primary and secondary requirements of each subsystem the order degrees of primary requirements p water1 ws 1 mdr in the subsystem of water supply are 1 00 0 86 0 77 respectively note that higher value of order degree mean the order parameter are more orderly the primary requirements in water supply is satisfied with higher priority than the secondary requirements the order degrees of primary requirements are much higher than the secondary requirements in the subsystem of power generation revealing that the benefits of power generation in the dry season cannot be satisfied for the subsystem of wsr the order degrees of primary requirements and secondary requirements shows that the benefit of wsr has been guaranteed the order degree of secondary requirement is higher than the order degrees of primary requirements of wsr and the reason that the order degree of f wsr is 1 00 as a result of the maximal threshold of f wsr was empirically set as 30 00 in the subsystem of inner river ecology the order degrees of all order parameters are higher than 0 90 reveal that the needs of inner river ecology are satisfied well though multi objective synergetic regulation importantly the order degrees of subsystem of water supply and inner river ecology are much higher than subsystem of power generation and wsr finally the synergetic degree of the whole system is 0 78 which basically reflects the orderly regulation of multi objectives operation of the cascade reservoirs 5 1 2 comparison between the synergetic model and traditional model to verify the effectiveness of the synergetic model we compare the results of the synergetic model and the traditional model from two aspects one is the comparison of the total benefits as shown in table 7 the other aspect is the comparison of benefits in water using processes referring to the primary and secondary requirements of the multi objectives shown in table 8 in the traditional model the objective of inner river ecology has been transferred into strong constraints so only the total benefits of the rest of three objectives can be compared it can be seen in table 7 that for the objective of water supply the annual shortage for water supply in the synergetic model is 9 41 108m3 which has been reduced by 1 92 108m3 compared with the traditional model and the rate of variation is 16 95 this reveals that the synergetic model is propitious to improve the total benefit of water supply for the objective of power generation the annual power generation of 15 power stations is 512 18 108kw h in the traditional model and it has been fallen to 509 39 108 kw h in the synergetic model this reflects that the synergetic model had lost more total benefit of power generation since the lowest priority in the principles of mosrr for the objective of wsr the total water volume of wsr in the traditional model is 369 37 108m3 and it is increased to 378 04 108m3 in the synergetic model in general except for power generation the results of the total benefits of multi objectives in the synergetic model are better than the traditional model especially the total benefits of the water supply have been improved significantly as shown in table 8 among the statistical results of primary and secondary requirements of water supply the synergetic model has generated better performance by reducing the water shortage and improving the guaranteed rate of the water supply of agriculture both in critical and non critical stages the value of water shortage in critical and non critical stages of agriculture i e ws 1 and ws 2 in the synergetic model is decreased by 25 71 and 12 97 compared with the traditional model respectively meanwhile the rate of variation of mdr in the synergetic model is 20 69 lower than that in the traditional model which is improved significantly comparing the primary and secondary requirements of power generation between the two models except the value of n ele2 in the synergetic model has been decreased by 4 35 the rest indicators achieve varying degrees of improvement especially the value of p ele1 in the synergetic model has been increased by 7 45 it should be noted that the value of p ele2 in the two models are both 30 the reason for this is the ice flood controlling in the dry season in uyr has limited the power generation of cascade reservoirs among the primary and secondary requirements of wsr in the two models only the value of q wsr had been rising slightly in the synergetic model and the rate of variation is 3 50 the other indicators remained unchanged similarly only the value of t eco2 in the synergetic model had been rising 2 50 compared with the traditional model the rest requirements of inner river ecology among the two models had remained the same value in general except for the indicator of n ele2 the results of primary and secondary requirements of multiple objectives in the synergetic model are better than the traditional model or stay the same value especially the primary requirements of water supply and power generation have been increased obviously it can be concluded that although the annual power generation of cascade reservoirs and the average output in the dry season are reduced slightly the rest total benefits and the primary requirements of multi objective have been improved obviously by using synergetic model which has proved the effectiveness of the model of mosrr 5 2 effect of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation 5 2 1 comparison of order degrees in two time periods the order degrees of primary and secondary requirements of multi objectives for the two time periods 1960 1989 and 1990 2015 are compared to illustrate the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation shown in table 9 it can be seen in table 9 that 1 affected by the runoff decrease the synergetic degree of the whole system in time period of 1990 2015 is 0 66 15 38 lower than that in 1960 1989 the order degrees of the four subsystems are 0 83 0 56 0 43 and 0 96 respectively which are 2 58 13 85 36 76 and 3 03 lower than that in 1960 1989 separately a great majority of the order degrees of primary and secondary requirements among the four subsystems except the t eco1 is reduced at many levels compared with the time period of 1960 1989 2 for the subsystem of water supply except for the order parameters of p water1 and ws 1 the decline of order degrees of primary and secondary requirements in time period of 1990 2015 is over 5 and the largest drop is 11 84 in the order parameter of maximum deficit ratio mdr in critical stages of agriculture this indicates that when the runoff decreases for the period of 1990 2015 the primary requirements of industry life and ecological water demand out of the river only decline slightly but the primary and secondary requirements of agriculture suffers more losses 3 for the subsystem of power generation the order degrees of primary requirements in the time period of 1990 2015 are 0 93 0 49 respectively compared to the period of 1960 1989 the average decline of order degrees of primary and secondary requirements are 13 5 22 4 separately which reveals that the runoff reduction has much more negative influence on power generation under a drier condition 4 the decline in the order degrees of primary and secondary requirements in subsystems of wsr and inner river ecology cannot be neglected for the subsystems of wsr the order degrees of q wsr t wsr and f wsr in 1990 2015 have been reduced by 32 86 10 26 54 00 respectively the influence of runoff decrease on wsr is considerable for the subsystem of inner river ecology the order degrees of p eco and t eco2 decreases slightly in the time period of 1990 2015 5 2 2 comparison of multi objectives besides comparing the difference of the order degrees of order parameters between the two time periods the comparison of comprehensive efficiencies and benefit values for multiple objectives can reveal the effect of runoff reduction on the multi objective synergetic regulation more intuitively table 10 shows the mean annual benefits of primary and secondary requirements of multiple objectives for the two time periods it is clearly seen in table 10 that for benefits of water supply compared with the results in the time period of 1960 1989 the value of water shortage in critical stages ws 1 and non critical stages of agriculture ws 2 and the maximum deficit ratio mdr in critical stages of agriculture increase in 1990 2015with a change rate over 20 for the three indicators however the guaranteed rate of water supply in non critical stages of agriculture p water2 in 1990 2015 is lower 3 8 than that in 1960 1989 this shows that the impact of runoff reduction on the water supply for the whole stages of agriculture is significant for benefits of power generation the guaranteed rate and the monthly average power output of reservoirs in wet season i e p ele1 n ele1 and dry season i e p ele2 n ele2 in 1990 2015 are 6 55 20 59 27 90 16 57 lower than that in 1960 1989 respectively this reveals the power generation of cascade reservoirs is effected distinctly by runoff decline for benefits of wsr in the time period of 1990 2015 the average regulating discharge of one wsr q wsr is 150 86 m3 s lower than that in 1960 1989 and the average duration of one wsr t wsr and the frequency of long term wsr f wsr are 4 39 and 35 90 lower than that in 1960 1989 respectively this reflects that affected by runoff reduction q wsr and t wsr has been small decreased but f wsr has been cut down sharply for benefits of inner river ecology the guaranteed rate of basic ecological flow p eco in 1990 2015 is 3 08 lower than that in 1969 1989 the number of ecological impulses in may and june t eco2 is decreased by 7 34 than that in 1969 1989 despite the small amount of decline in p eco and t eco2 the benefits of inner river ecology can be ensured well on the background of runoff reduction moreover the long term changing process of primary and secondary requirements could reflect how the runoff reduction effects the guarantee of multi objectives the fig 6 has shown the changing processes of some primary and secondary requirements of water supply in the two time periods similarly the changing processes of some primary and secondary requirements power generation have been shown in fig 7 the changing processes of some benefits of wsr and inner river ecology have been shown in table 11 and fig 8 respectively it can be observed in fig 6 that the value range of water shortage in critical stages of agriculture i e ws 1 in 1990 2015 is up to 14 58 108m3 which is 3 28 108m3 higher than the maximal ws 1 in 1960 1989 with eight years of no shortage the range of water shortage in non critical stages of agriculture i e ws 2 in 1990 2015 is up to 33 82 108m3 and the maximal value is 41 87 of the total demand in non critical stages of agriculture which is 21 01 higher than that in 1960 1989 the value range of the maximum deficit ratio in critical stages of agriculture i e mdr in 1990 2015 is from 0 to 0 78 with eight years being 0 one more year than that in 1960 1989 and the maximal mdr occurred in the year of 2008 overall the performance of the three order parameters of water supply in 1990 2015 is worse than that in 1960 1989 reflect the negative influence of runoff reduction on water supply in the uyr fig 7 shows that influenced by ice flood control the monthly average power output of cascade reservoirs in wet season i e n ele1 is much greater than that in dry season i e n ele2 in all years and the average difference between n ele1 and n ele2 in 1960 1989 is 84 08 104kw higher than that in 1990 2015 which reflect the advantage of power generation in wet season is diminished effected by runoff reduction the maximal n ele1 in 1960 1989 is 918 76 104kw 207 18 104kw higher than that in 1990 2015 and minimal n ele1 in 1960 1989 is 168 12 104kw higher than that in 1990 2015 the value range of n ele2 in 1960 1989 is from 336 61 104kw to 423 87 104kw but from 111 20 104kw to 389 18 104kw in 1990 2015 the amount of annual power generation of cascade reservoirs in 1990 2015 is within the range from 231 11 108kw h to 488 19 108kw h which are 184 94 108kw h and 124 09 108kw h less than the minimal and maximal annual power generation in 1960 1989 respectively in general runoff reduction in 1990 2015 has a huge impact on power generation for cascade reservoirs in the uyr it is can be observed from table 11 that the number of years with wsr application in the two time periods are nine and five respectively which means that wsr should be applied once every three years averagely in 1960 1989 and every five years averagely in 1990 2015 the maximal and minimal regulating discharge of wsr q wsr in 1960 1989 are 2887 53 m3 s 2567 25 m3 s respectively the value range of water volume for once wsr application is from 26 31 108m3 to 52 39 108m3 in 1960 1989 the value of q wsr in 1990 2015 ranges from 2384 22 m3 s to 2731 20 m3 s and the average water volume of once wsr application is 38 57 108m3 which is 3 18 108m3 less than that in 1960 1989 in general although the regulating discharge and duration of once wsr application would not be effected obviously the frequency of long term wsr would be reduced significantly because of runoff reduction fig 8 shows that the guaranteed rate of basic ecological flow i e p eco is 100 in all years of 1960 1989 and most years of 1990 2015 moreover six times of ecological impulses occurred in most years of 1960 1989 and only five years with three or five times of ecological impulses however the times of ecological impulses in 1990 2015 ranges from two to six and only five years with six times of ecological impulses which is decreased significantly compared with 1960 1989 this indicates that runoff reduction has a small impact on the guarantee of basic ecological flow but a greater impact on ecological impulses needed for fish reproduction and growth based on the above analysis of results in section 5 2 it can be concluded that the performance of multi objective synergetic regulation is effected greatly by runoff reduction in most cases fortunately with limited water resources in 1990 2015 the benefits of primary requirements of multi objectives have been guaranteed as much as possible by the regulation of the synergetic model to prevent further losses 5 3 operation modes of cascade reservoirs from the synergetic model the changing process of inflow and outflow of cascade reservoirs are used to reflect the joint operation modes of them based on the synergetic model as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 meanwhile the changing process of the water level of cascade reservoirs is shown in fig 11 and fig 12 it is can be observed from fig 9 that benefitting from huge regulating storage the lyx reservoir has greatly changed the uneven natural runoff process by reducing the flood peak discharge and increases the downstream discharge in the dry season in the time period of 1960 1989 the maximum inflow discharge of the lyx reservoir is 3550 m3 s which is occurred in september 1981 and the outflow discharge has been cut down to 715 m3 s greatly in this period moreover there are thirteen times when the outflow discharge of the lyx reservoir is more than 1300 m3 s in 1960 1989 which are all occurred in the wsr period or flood control period however effected by runoff reduction the maximum inflow discharge of lyx reservoir in 1990 2015 is 2577 m3 s and only five times of outflow discharge above 1300 m3 s fig 10 shows that as the anti regulating reservoir of lyx the role of ljx reservoir is reducing the outflow discharge to follow the upper limit outflow discharge during the ice flood control period strictly increasing the outflow discharge to meet the downstream comprehensive water requirement in the irrigation and wsr period and storing a part of the outflow of lyx reservoir in the main flood season it is noteworthy that the outflow of lyx and ljx reservoirs from february to april in 2002 the driest year in 1990 2015 are all lower than the basic ecological flow this reflects that even the priority order of inner river ecology is highest in principles of mosrr the primary requirements of inner river ecology cannot be guaranteed effectively under extreme drought conditions fig 11 shows that the times of water level of lyx reservoir reach to the normal water level i e 2600 00 m in 1960 1989 and 1990 2015 are six and zero respectively and the times of water level drop to the dead water level i e 2530 00 m in the two time periods are three and twelve respectively this indicates that the ability of capacity utilization of the lyx reservoir has been weakened in 1990 2015 effected by runoff reduction the water level is unable to recover to normal water level result from increasing the outflow discharge to meet the comprehensive water demand finally the water level of the lyx reservoir drop to 2567 12 m at the end of 1990 2015 which is 16 48 m lower than that in 1960 1989 fig 12 shows that because of the smaller storage capacity and function of anti regulating the yearly variation amplitude of the water level of the ljx reservoir is large especially in the years with wsr application the water level of the ljx reservoir falls sharply the minimal water level of the ljx reservoir in 1960 1989 is 5 29 m higher than that in 1990 2015 it is worth note that the water level of ljx reservoir has dropped to the dead water level i e 1694 00 m in nine years in 1990 2015 while the water level of lyx reservoir is close to the dead water level as well what represents the capability of adjusting river runoff by cascade reservoirs has been fully exploited in the case of runoff reduction 5 4 the countermeasures for runoff reduction based on the analysis of the impact of runoff reduction on multi objective synergetic regulation of the cascade reservoirs in the study area it is undeniable that the negative effects will be posed to the various water use benefits although the application of the synergetic model could reduce the impact of runoff reduction on primary requirements of the multi objectives to reduce the impact of runoff reduction on ecological environment and social economic development fundamentally more attention should be paid on external or irregular sources of water supply to the study for example via the projected west route of the south north water transfer project which is planned to divert 170 108 m3 of water per year from the tributaries of china s largest river i e yangtze river to the upper yellow river in the future office of the south to north water diversion project construction committee 2016 besides the expansion of freshwater sources which can be subject to environmental and socio economic consequences in the near term adopting advanced irrigation technologies and reuse of municipal waste water can be more effective measures studies show that advanced irrigation technologies could save water up to 34 39 of the current use wu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 municipal sewage reuse has benefits of alleviating pressure onto the aquatic environment avoiding long distance transport of raw water possibly saving energy for conventional purification and transmission and diminishing process water loss wang et al 2017a xu et al 2019 a major move to build a water saving society is a significant institutional adjustment in the agricultural sector in china including crop pattern change liu et al 2018 it is expected that the combination of technological and policy measures should eliminate the adverse effects of runoff reduction on water use benefits in the uyr 6 conclusions this paper proposes a new approach for multi objective synergetic regulation of a cascade reservoir system mosrr in a sediment laden river based on the general principles of multi objective synergetic regulations and the recognition and quantification of primary and secondary requirements for each of the multi objectives the multiple requirements are classified into primary and secondary categories and the priority levels of key operation targets are assessed by stakeholders via a survey method mosrr is applied to a system of cascade reservoirs along the upper yellow river in china considering climatic and hydrologic variability the results from mosrr are compared to those from a traditional multi objective optimal operation model the results from two time periods of runoff data 1960 1989 and 1990 2015 with different water availability levels are compared to show the effect of runoff reduction and how mosrr can mitigate the effects the results show that the total benefits of water supply and wsr will increase significantly via mosrr with a small decline in the annual power generation two primary requirements of water supply water shortage in critical crop growth stages ws 1 and the maximum deficit ratio of water supply in a single period mdr will be improved by 25 7 and 20 7 respectively compared to the traditional model a primary requirement of power generation the guaranteed rate of power generation in wet season p ele1 will increase by 7 5 from the traditional model at the expense of slight reduction of energy output in the dry season runoff reduction in the study area will have the most significant impact on water supply with the primary requirements ws 1 and mdr relatively minor impact on hydropower generation and wsr some countermeasures for runoff decrease in the study area such as water saving irrigation municipal sewage reuse as well as policy changes are suggested it is found that streamflow variability can complicate the tradeoff relations among the multiple objectives and mosrr can effectively support the balance of the economic and environmental requirements based on prescribed priorities policies and regulations for the operations of large scale cascade reservoir systems operations although the proposed mosrr is only demonstrated to the uyr in this paper the generic framework allows the approach to be applied to other reservoir systems credit

4471,floodwater utilization through dynamic operating flood limited water levels flwls of reservoirs plays an important role in flood control and water conservation this study proposes a risk based aggregation decomposition method for floodwater utilization of a complex multi reservoir system the original system is decomposed into four basic configurations for the subsystem with hydraulic connections the upper bound of flwl of each reservoir is identified based on a given risk level for the subsystem and risk hedging between reservoirs a stochastic programming model to maximize hydropower generation is then established for joint operation of the multi reservoir system to find and update the optimal operation strategy during flood seasons the mixed cascade reservoirs in the pi river basin are selected as a case study the application results are compared with those of the original design model and deterministic operation model without considering risk which shows that joint operation and dynamic control of flwls 1 significantly increases the power generation and improves the utilization rate of floodwaters compared to those of the original design model 2 power production rate increases with the acceptable risk but the increasing rate between them decreases with higher levels of risk 3 results in lower utilization rate of floodwaters compared to that of the deterministic model but the difference is not significant the proposed method provides a framework for risk based decision making in floodwater utilization to enhance the comprehensive benefits of a multi reservoir system keywords multi reservoir system flood limited water level hydropower generation aggregation and decomposition risk hedging 1 introduction with continuous development of social economy human demand for water resources is becoming more and more intense scarcity of water resources has become one of the major factors restricting social progress chen et al 2016 reservoir through which distribution of natural runoff is changed by storing abundant water in flood season to meet requirements in non flood season is one of the major and effective engineering measures for integrated water resources management yeh 1985 zhou et al 2014 however most of the reservoirs are built for multiple purposes which are often in conflicts with each other such as flood control power generation water supply navigation and other functions janga reddy and nagesh kumar 2007 therefore optimizing reservoir operation to maximize its comprehensive benefits is an important problem to be solved flood limited water level flwl is the maximum allowed water level reserved for water supply during flood seasons when a reservoir has no needs to retain flood meeting demands the water level of the reservoir should be kept at or below the designed flood limited water level flwl so that the flood control capacity could be reserved to accommodate a possible impending large flood supposing that a flood occurs the reservoir flood control capacity is provided to accommodate the flood and the water level is then raised during the flood when the flood recedes the reservoir water level must be lowered to the designed flwl as soon as possible this operation mode is the so called static control of flood limited water level sc flwl tan et al 2017 lu et al 2020a 2020b it is simple to conduct sc flwl but providing the maximum flood control capacity by keeping a reservoir comparatively emptyduring the entire flood season just to accommodate low probability events such as design flood and check flood which gives too much priority to flood control neglects the variation in the severity of probable flood events and real time forecast information thus affecting the benefit of floodwater utilization ding et al 2015 chang et al 2017 to resolve the conflict between flood control and water conservation in flood season many scholars have studied the problem the us army corps of engineers usace 1998 proposed multistage flwl by dividing the flood season into different stages and reallocating flood control storage liu et al 2015 determined the seasonal flwl optimally by maximizing multiple benefits with the constraint that the total flood risk is less than the original risk the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated through a case study of three gorges reservoir xie et al 2018 established an optimization model to maximize power generation and water supply and found the optimal seasonal flwl by a nonlinear optimization technique the complex method the model was applied to danjiangkou reservoir and a considerable benefit increase was achieved with availability of meteorological and hydrological forecasting dynamic control of flood limited water level dc flwl yun and singh 2008 diao and wang 2011 chen et al 2013 ding et al 2015 peng et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 lu et al 2020a 2020b emerged which makes use of real time forecast information to change the flwl within dynamic control bounds li et al 2010 proposed a dynamic control operation model consisting of a pre release module a refill operation module and a risk analysis module then estimated the bound of dc flwlthrough monte carlo simulation ding et al 2015 ding et al 2017 established a two stage operation model for dc flwl with consideration of both forecast uncertainty and acceptable flood risk and obtained hedging rules between water conservation and flood control currently the technique of determining dc flwl for a single reservoir is relatively mature but is under developed in the case of multiple reservoir systems additionally comprehensive management of a river basin is inseparable from the joint operation of a multi reservoir system zhang et al 2011 due to hydrological hydraulic and storage compensation between reservoirs dc flwl of reservoirs becomes more complicated chen et al 2013 zhong et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 2018 zhong et al 2014 developed a model for determining the upper bounds of flwls in a cascade reservoir system in which the upstream and downstream reservoirs are connected through the storage compensation for the shared flood control responsibility chen et al 2013 proposed a method for the joint operation and dc flwls for cascade reservoirs based on aggregation and decomposition of large scale system for floodwaters utilization of reservoirs according to this method first the cascade reservoirs are aggregated into a single reservoir so that the upper bound of the conserved water excess storage of the whole system can be determined through the capacity constrained pre release method the decomposition method is then used to decompose the aggregated reservoir to individual reservoir units according to the hydraulic connection of upstream and downstream reservoirs thus the excess storage relationship between reservoirs is obtained however owing to possible partial and uncertain forecasts dc flwl for a multi reservoir system may cause additional flood control risk when the weather forecast fails to capture the rainfall or the hydrological forecast underestimates the actual inflow the reservoir water level cannot be drawn safely down to the designed flwl which has an influence on the subsequent flood control operation tan et al 2017 developed a model with consideration of storage compensation regulation and the uncertainty of flood spatial pattern using a copula function zhou et al 2015 proposed an integrated model consisting of a flood control risk analysis module a utilization benefits analysis module and a multi objective evaluation module to derive optimal refill operation rules for cascade reservoirs although these studies supported further development of dc flwl in a multi reservoir system there are some limitations listed as follows 1 the risk rate related to real time dc flwl was not quantified precisely and not integrated into the operation model 2 the risk complementarity between reservoirs was not taken into account although the conserved water levels of different reservoirs can be coordinated to minimize the total risk 3 the real time rolling operation was based on the forecast information in the effective lead time but lacked the consideration of forecast uncertainty in this paper a complex multi reservoir system is decomposed into four basic configurations with due consideration of forecast uncertainty and space compensation of risk the upper bound of flwl of each reservoir in the system is determined under a certain acceptable risk level which is set as the upper limit water level in the joint operation model considering floodwater utilization for the reservoir system the optimal storage allocation strategy in flood season is sought and updated in order to maximize system benefits then the benefits of different schemes can be evaluated and compared the multi reservoir system in the pi river basin is selected as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the decomposition of a complex multi reservoir system is presented in section 2 in section 3 the allowable dynamic control range of the flwl of each reservoir is determined based on the aggregation decomposition method considering risk constraints in section 4 the optimal combination of flwls gaining the maximal system benefits is derived in the control bounds determined in section 3 section 5 presents the case study results as well as analysis and discussion finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 decomposition of a complex multi reservoir system a complex multi reservoir system usually contains reservoirs with hydraulic connections individualflood control points and common flood control points there might be series parallel or mixed connections between the reservoirs fig 1 presents a generalized configuration of a complex multi reservoir system which consists of multi stage reservoirs and multiple flood control points according to the different connections between reservoirs and the needs of floodwaters utilization the complex system is decomposed into four basic configurations as shown in fig 2 a consists of a single reservoir with one flood control point b consists of two cascade reservoirs with two flood control points c consists of two parallel reservoirs with three flood control points in which s d and s e are called individual flood control points while s is common flood control point d consists of three mixed cascade reservoirs with three flood control points these four configurations represent all the basic types of reservoirs with hydraulic connections a large complex multi reservoir system can be decomposed into different subsystems step by step according to these structures to calculate the available water storage of floodwaters in real time fig 3 shows the framework of the proposed methodology which can be divided into two modules i e aggregation decomposition model for dc flwl considering risk constraints section 3 and storage compensation operation model for the multi reservoir system based on stochastic programming section 4 3 aggregation decomposition model for dc flwl considering risk constraints the process of reservoir flood regulation can be separated into three procedures pre release before a flood occurs flood regulation during the flood event and refill during the recession period ding et al 2015 floodwater conservation is conducted in the flood recession period under the condition of no rain forecast in the following days the method of two stage pre release based on forecasts lu et al 2020 is used to calculate the amount of floodwater that can be conserved above the designed flwl according to the meteorological and hydrological forecast information in order to ensure flood control safety the reservoir water level should be lowered to the designed flwl before the next flood occurs so as not to affect the subsequent flood regulation choudhury 2010 provided that the forecast is reliable the excess storage is composed of the water for beneficial uses in the no rain period and the water of pre release for flood control in the early period of the next flood however both weather forecast and hydrological forecast have uncertainties the forecast information is a random variable with certain distribution accordingly the excess storage is also a random variable with a specific distribution we denote the excess storage as w lu et al 2020 deduced the probability density function of w based on the rainfall forecast results from tigge thorpex interactive grand global ensemble which integrates ensemble precipitation products from different centers in which the improved truncated gaussian distribution was taken to fit the norain day forecast error and the normal distribution was used to describe the flood forecast error this function is shown in eq 1 1 f w w a 1 a 2 exp w μ 1 μ 2 2 2 σ 3 2 0 w 1 exp x σ 1 2 w μ 2 σ 2 2 μ 1 σ 3 2 2 2 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 2 d x y 0 a 2 0 w 1 exp w x μ 2 2 2 σ 2 2 d x where a 1 μ 1 σ 1 y 0 are the distribution parameters of pre release water for beneficial uses in the no rain period w 1 is the upper bound of pre release water for beneficial uses a 2 μ 2 σ 2 are the distribution parameters of pre release water for flood control in flood period and σ 3 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 the probability that the initial regulation water level of the next flood exceeding the designed flwl is defined as the risk rate of reservoir excess storage as shown in eq 2 2 p p r o b v 0 v x p r o b v x w s w v x p r o b w w s where v 0 represents the storage corresponding to the initial water level of the subsequent flood considering uncertainty v x denotes the storage at the designed flwl w s is the actual excess storage determined in the decision the risk increases with the actual excess storage from eqs 1 and 2 the risk curve of reservoir excess storage can be obtained as shown in fig 4 the end point of the curve point a in the figure represents the deterministic upper limit of excess storage w max given the acceptable risk value p 0 the upper bound of allowable excess storage w max can be gained the following risk calculations for subsystems are all based on this principle 3 1 a single reservoir with one flood control point if the uncertainty is not taken into account the excess storage of reservoir a in the subsystem of fig 2 a at the current time can be expressed as eq 3 3 w a max t 1 d q a m q a i n t δ t 1 t d 1 d t y α a q a s q a f l t δ t 2 where qa m is the maximum water flow for utilization qa in t is the reservoir inflow in the no rain period d is the forecasted no rain days αa is the discount coefficient of safety discharge at downstream qa s is the safety discharge at downstream of reservoir a qa fl t is the reservoir inflow in the early period of the next flood ty is the effective lead time of flood forecast t 1 and t 2 are the time intervals of weather forecast and flood forecast respectively based on the risk curve fig 4 derived from the risk calculations the upper bound of allowable excess storage w a max can be obtained according to the acceptable risk 3 2 two cascade reservoirs with two flood control points for reservoirs with hydraulic connections the aggregation decomposition method can be used for the determination of excess storage all of the reservoirs are aggregated into a virtual aggregated reservoir and the forecast accuracy of the whole basin is analyzed to find the relationship between the total excess storage of the aggregated reservoir and the risk the upper bound of the total excess storage is then obtained according to the acceptable risk the decomposition module is used to generate the relationship between the excess storages of reservoirs according to their hydraulic connections the total excess storage is optimally allocated to individual reservoir units by minimizing the total risk of reservoirs based on the risk hedging principle you and cai 2008 zhao et al 2014 3 2 1 aggregation module the cascade reservoirs shown in fig 2 b are aggregated into a large virtual reservoir whose inflow is the sum of all the inflows in the cascade system and the outflow is the outflow of downstream reservoir c the designed flood control capacity of the aggregated reservoir is the sum of the flood control capacities of the upstream and the downstream reservoirs the upper bound of the deterministic excess storage without considering uncertainty of the aggregated reservoir is shown as eq 4 4 w max t 1 d q b m q c m δ q q in t δ t 1 t d 1 d t y α c q c s q fl t δ t 2 where qb m and qc m are the maximum water flows for utilization of reservoir b and c respectively δ q is the reuse water of the two reservoirs that is the part of water used by reservoir b that is not stored and flows into reservoir c qin t is the inflow of the aggregated reservoir in no rain period expressed as eq 5 αc is the discount coefficient for downstream safety discharge of reservoir c qc s is the safety discharge at downstream of reservoir c qfl t is the inflow of the aggregated reservoir in the early flood period expressed as eq 6 5 q in t q b i n t q qj i n t 6 q fl t q b f l t q qj f l t where qb in t and qqj in t are respectively the inflow of reservoir b and lateral inflow in no rain period qb fl t and qqj fl t are respectively the inflow of reservoir b and lateral inflow in the early flood period the no rain forecast accuracy in the whole basin is analyzed and the flood forecast error is referenced to obtain the relevant parameters based on the calculated risk curve the upper bound of allowable excess storage of the aggregated reservoir considering risk constraint can be obtained under a given acceptable risk 3 2 2 decomposition module due to the hydraulic connection with the upstream and downstream reservoirs the excess storage of one reservoir is affected by the current storage of other reservoirs thus there is a mutual restriction among the reservoirs the total excess storage of the system can be allocated to each reservoir according to the hydraulic connectivity the decomposition module obtains the coordination relationship between the allowable excess storage of each reservoir under the current forecast information and the optimal allocation is made by risk hedging for the cascade reservoirs in fig 2 b the pre release water of reservoir b affects the inflow of reservoir c the upper limits of deterministic excess storages of the two reservoirs are shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 w b max t 1 d q b m q b i n t δ t 1 t d 1 d t y q b o u t q b f l t δ t 2 8 w c max t 1 d q c m q qj i n t δ q δ t 1 t d 1 d t y α c q c s q qj f l t q b o u t δ t 2 where qb out is the release discharge of reservoir b in the pre release for flood control stage which is the key variable to coordinate the upper bounds of excess storages of reservoirs b and c the range of qb out should meet the following requirements 9 q b f l t q b o u t α b q b s where αb denotes the discount coefficient for downstream safety discharge of reservoir b and qb s is the safety discharge at downstream of reservoir b the more pre release water for flood control of reservoir b the more excess storage the larger inflow of reservoir c and the less excess storage that is there is a negative correlation between wb max and wc max on condition that the uncertainty is not considered the corresponding wc max can be determined according to a given wb max the relationship between them is as follows 10 w b max w cmax w max in combination with section 3 2 1 adding the risk constraint of the aggregated reservoir eq 10 should be written as follows 11 w b max w c max w max where w b max and w c max are the upper bounds of allowable excess storages of reservoirs b and c with risk constraints respectively then the upper bounds of flwls of reservoirs b and c z b max z c max are identified as f v bx w b max f v cx w c max in which vbx and vcx are the storage capacities corresponding to the designed flwls of reservoirs b and c and f represents the relationship between reservoir water level and storage the lower bound is set as the original designed flwl if the upper limits of the deterministic flwls are zb max and zc max the optimization search interval is the area covered by the upper curve in fig 5 the optimization range will be narrowed with the interval boundary reduced after considering the risk constraint as shown in fig 5 in the multi reservoir system the hedging and offsetting of the flood control risks can be managed by the compensating allocation of flood control capacity between reservoirs based on eqs 7 and 8 the risk calculation of reservoirs b and c is introduced to obtain the corresponding risk curves of excess storage as shown in fig 6 under the condition that the total excess storage of the system is fixed the optimal allocation scheme of excess storages among reservoirs can be found by minimizing the weighted total risk of reservoirs eq 12 according to the principle of risk hedging 12 min λ b p b λ c p c where pb and pc are respectively the excess storage risks of reservoirs b and c λb and λc denote the weighting factors for reservoirs b and c which can be determined according to the reservoir safety importance level and real time flood control requirements if the water allocation results do not satisfy the expected requirements such as ensuring that there is a certain amount of excess water storage in both reservoirs and the excess storages of the two reservoirs are in the same proportion of the required water it will return to the storage decomposition phase and re coordinate the allocation by adjusting qb out 3 3 two parallel reservoirs with three flood control points for the parallel reservoirs shown in fig 2 c there is no direct hydraulic connection between reservoirs d and e but they jointly undertake the flood control safety of downstream common flood control point we denote qs as the safety discharge at the common flood control point s qs d and qs e as the safety discharges at the individual flood control points s d and s e the excess storage is calculated in two cases 1 qs qs d qs e the common flood control point will not work and the excess storages of the two reservoirs can be calculated separately as a single reservoir 2 qs qs d qs e allocate qs to reservoirs d and e in proportion via discounting at qs d and qs e the discounted safety discharge is then the maximum allowable discharge to pre release for flood control and the excess storages of the two reservoirs are calculated according to the single reservoir model 3 4 three mixed reservoirs with three flood control points compared with the cascade and parallel reservoir subsystems the mixed reservoirs have more complex hydraulic connections the basic configuration can be identified as the combination of cascade and parallel configurations which can be decomposed step by step based on the calculation principle in section 3 2 as shown in fig 7 the specific steps are as follows 1 the two upstream parallel reservoirs f and g are regarded as one upstream reservoir u with which the downstream reservoir h can form a cascade reservoir subsystem the inflow of reservoir u is the sum of inflows of reservoirs f and g the safety discharge is the sum of safety discharges of f and g and the designed flood control capacity is the sum of flood control capacities of f and g 2 according to the method of aggregation decomposition in section 3 2 the upper limit of allowable excess storage of the system under acceptable risk is first obtained which is then decomposed to reservoirs u and h to gain the corresponding allowable excess storages δ w u max and δ w h max via risk hedging 3 since the allowable excess storage of reservoir u is known the risk hedging principle is used again to allocate δ w u max to the original two single reservoirs f and g to obtain δ w f max and δ w g max 4 evaluate whether the allowable excess water storage of each reservoir meets the expected water demands that is the excess storage of each reservoir is in the same proportion with the required water volume as shown in δ w f max δ w g max δ w h max df dg dh where df dg dh are the water demands of f g and h reservoirs in the following no rain period if not it will return to the previous step in turn to adjust the discharge in the pre release for flood control stage qu out and qf out qg out so as to satisfy different water demands 4 joint operation for multi reservoir based on stochastic programming the dynamic control of flwls and joint operation of real time flood is to determine the optimal storage and drainage strategy optimal allocation strategy of flood control storage for each reservoir according to the forecast information current reservoir storage flood control objectives and other state information within the effective lead time and update the operation strategy with the forecasts storage compensation operation is a real time dynamic rolling process of forecast decision implementation zhou et al 2014 the operation rules of water level in flood season are as follows when the flood recedes and there is no rain forecasted the flwl of the reservoir can be raised through conserving floodwater under the premise of moderate risk in the early period of flood if the water level does not fall to the designed flwl the reservoir should pre release the excess water and transit to flood control mode to ensure flood control safety the upper bound of dc flwl obtained based on the forecast information is taken as the highest control water level of reservoir in the non flood period of flood season simulation operation is to seek the optimal strategy of each reservoir in this control field with the aim of maximum benefit of the multi reservoir system to account for forecasting errors monte carlo simulation method is used to generate the inflow scenario tree and stochastic programming is introduced into the real time rolling operation of reservoirs the optimal strategy is obtained by optimizing the expected objective value under all inflow scenarios the purpose of this module is to simulate the operation of multi reservoir system in flood season so as to analyze the changes of benefit and risk under the implementation of dc flwl 4 1 inflow scenario tree based on monte carlo simulation a scenario tree consists of a set of nodes and connections between nodes heitsch and römisch 2009 xu et al 2015 starting from the root node of the first period the tree gradually branches to the subsequent period forming a tree structure the nodes at the end of a period are called leaf nodes and the path from each root node to leaf node constitutes an inflow scenario these inflow scenarios are a discrete representation of the stochastic process of reservoir inflow it has been assumed that the relative error of flood forecast obeys the normal distribution with the mean value of 0 n 0 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of the flood forecast relative error which can be obtained from historical forecast data random inflows to each reservoir inflow are generated by monte carlo simulation method shown in eq 13 13 q i t s q i t f 1 σ e t where q i t s is the simulated stochastic inflow at time t q i t f is the forecasted inflow at time t et is the standard normal random variable the set of inflows generated through simulation is defined as scenario tree q i t j t 1 t y j 1 j in which j is the total scenario number and q i t j represents the jth inflow process of the ith reservoir starting from the current moment to the end of the effective lead time the scenario tree provides input data for real time operation model 4 2 stochastic optimization model 1 objective function taking the maximum total power generation of the reservoir system as the objective the

a large scale mixed reservoir system in pi river basin which is part of the huai river basin in china see fig 8 is selected as a case study the pi river basin located in the east asian monsoon region has an uneven distribution of rainfall in both time and space with a dense population and high rate of cultivated land simultaneously owing to these factors water shortage in the area is the main constraint on development at present three reservoirs named bailianya bly mozitan mzt and foziling fzl have been built on the east pi river with a catchment area of 1840 km2 xianghongdian xhd reservoir is located on the west pi river which as a catchment area of 1400 km2 during flood seasons the operating policy of the multi reservoir system in pi river basin is the traditional static control of flood limited water level sc flwl when a flood occurs the reservoirs conduct flood regulation based on the fixed operation rules which have been made in the design stage of the reservoirs fig 9 demonstrates the system topology the characteristics and parameters of each reservoir are listed in table 1 the reservoir system includes two individual flood control points and one common flood control point which are huoshan at the downstream of bmf reservoirs bly mzt and fzl dushan at the downstream of xhd reservoir and hengpaitou at the downstream of the whole system the safety discharge at the three flood control points is 3450 2500 and 8400 m3 s respectively 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 data description in order to analyze the influence of different year type and year distribution on floodwater utilization three typical years i e wet year 2015 normal year 2011 and dry year 2014 are selected from the years from tigge supplies forecast 2007 the data used are the forecasted 3 h runoff series and rainfall series collected from tigge in flood season from june to september the forecast period in the inflow forecast system of bmf reservoir system is 48 h and that of xhd reservoir is 72 h in this paper 24 h with high forecast accuracy is selected as the operation period for rolling operation statistical analysisshows the standard deviation of forecast relative error to be 0 20 a set of 10 scenarios was generated by monte carlo simulation as the input of the joint operation model and the expected value of model output has been used for results display the initial water levels in flood season of the four reservoirs were set as the designed flwls the acceptable risk p 0 was set at 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 for model calculation for comparison and analysis the calculation of static control of flood limited water level sc flwl and dynamic control of flood limited water level without considering risk dc flwl were also performed sc flwl is calculated according to the original designed flwl and flood control regulation rules of each reservoir and dc flwl is controlled by the optimal allocation strategy under the flood control regulation rules 5 2 2 results of aggregation decomposition model due to the safety discharge rate of common flood control point being greater than the sum of that of the two individual flood control points bmf reservoirs and xhd reservoir can be calculated separately in the determination of the upper bounds of flwls xhd reservoir is a single reservoir subsystem and bmf reservoirs are a mixed reservoirs subsystem taking the year 2015 as an example the results of aggregation decomposition model for dc flwl are shown in fig 10 in which fig 10 a shows the total excess storage of the multi reservoir system during the flood season and fig 10 b the standardization of the upper bounds of flwls with p 0 20 it can be seen from fig 10 that the upper bounds of flwls are dynamic curves changing with time which is determined by current forecast information and storage capacity of each reservoir the reason for the situation that there is no excess storage in fig 10 is the forecast of rainfall in the current period and the flood control capacity should beprovided from fig 10 a it can be seen that the curve of dc has the highest position that is the allowable excess storage is the maximum the reason is that there is no risk constraint in the model since the uncertainties are not taken into account in terms of the schemes with the acceptable risk limit the curves lower with the decrease of the acceptable risk that is the allowable excess storage decreases gradually which indicates that the risk control is at the cost of sacrificing the benefits of excess storage moreover the distance between each curve decreases with the increase of acceptable risk which suggests that the marginal benefit of increasing risk decreases this is due to the property of risk curve that the risk increases with the excess storage and the increasing rate also increases lu et al 2020 on the contrary the excess storage has a positive relation to the acceptable risk with the increasing rate decreasing fig 10 b displays the dynamic flwls of each reservoir on p 0 20 from which it can be seen that the processes of the four reservoirs have a similar trend as the curve in fig 10 a whereas bmf reservoirs have higher consistency the reason lies in that the three reservoirs are a mixed subsystem with hydraulic connections and xhd is treated as a single reservoir independently in addition on the premise of the overall consistency there are also some differences among the three reservoirs which is to offset the excess storage risk through the compensated allocation of the storage of the three reservoirs the comparison of the standardized average upper bounds of flwls for each reservoir under different schemes is shown in fig 11 in addition to the upper water level decreasing with the decrease of acceptable risk same as fig 10 a it can also be seen that the average allowable excess storage of bly is the largest mzt is the smallest and fzl is located in between the reason is that the flood control capacities of bly and fzl are greater than mzt and the excess water storage required for fzl is reduced in the decomposition phase because it can receive the outflows from upstream reservoirs 5 2 3 results of simulation operation the simulation of real time operation is performed for flood seasons in the three typical years with the water levels controlled by the upper bounds of flwls the hydropower generated hg and spilled water sw volume have been collated to evaluate the benefit the results of hg and sw of sc flwl and dc flwl schemes are listed in table 2 compared with sc flwl the increase of hg and decrease of sw in dc flwl under different acceptable risks are shown in fig 12 from table 2 it can be seen that through the implementation of dc flwl the reservoir system can generate more hydropower and decrease spill greatly in the deterministic dc flwl without considering risk the reservoir system increases hydropower production by 30 88 106 kwh 17 01 11 43 106 kwh 7 52 and 13 44 106 kwh 12 06 in the wet year normal year and dry year respectively on average the increased hydropower production is 18 58 million kwh with an increase rate of 12 53 the benefit of dc flwl is remarkable from fig 12 it can be seen that 1 there is a positive correlation between the increase of hg and the acceptable risk that is the hg increases with the acceptable risk and the sw decreases correspondingly this is because the upper bounds of flwls are positively proportional to the acceptable risk and the higher acceptable risk allows higher upper bounds so that the water level constraint in the optimal operation model is relaxed to get a larger benefit 2 the curve shows a convex function trend that is the relationship between benefit and acceptable risk is positive with the increasing rate decreasing which indicates that marginal benefit is decreasing this is consistent with the relationship between excess storage and risk the increased benefit of dc flwl in the wet year is the highest followed by the dry year and lowest in the normal year the reason for this result is the different runoff distribution in three typical years flood occurs the most frequently and flood volume is the largest in the wet year thus there are sufficient floodwaters to be used although the total water amount in the dry year is lower than that of the normal year there are more small and medium flood occurrences thus the available floodwaters are greater and the spilled water is less than that of the normal year to demonstrate the effectiveness of floodwaters utilization eq 19 has been utilized to calculate the water resource utilization rate chen et al 2013 for the multi reservoir system during flood seasons 19 η 1 i 1 n s w i i 1 n i w i where η is water resource utilization efficiency swi is spilled water of the ith reservoir iwi is the inflow volume of the ith reservoir during flood season the results are listed in table 3 table 3 indicates that the water resource utilization rate can be significantly improved by the implementation of dc flwl for the reservoir system notably the water resource utilization rate is increased by 10 95 on average with the deterministic dc flwl compared to sc flwl taking p 0 20 to represent the mode of dc flwl considering risk constraint the comparison of water resource utilization rates of the three modes is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that 1 the water resource utilization rate of dc flwl with risk constraint is lower than that of dc flwl without considering risk but the difference is not significant 2 the water resource utilization rate in wet normal and dry years increases gradually which is due to the decrease in spilled water volume figs 14 16 display the joint operating process of the four reservoirs during flood season in the wet normal and dry years under dc flwl mode with p 0 20 risk constraint it can be seen from the figures that the water level is controlled by the upper bound of flwl obtained through risk hedging when the reservoir receives the flood the reservoir water level is raised timely by conserving a certain amount of flood resources for subsequent use when there is no flood or medium and small flood occur the water level of the reservoir is adjusted dynamically according to the forecast so as to avoid water spilloperating under the original designed flwl the floodwaters are effectively utilized to increase the benefit of power generation taking the wet year as an example as shown in fig 14 floods occur in late july and early august respectively in bmf reservoirs thus the reservoirs retain the flood on the premise of ensuring the flood control safety the excess water storage is used after the flood to generate hydropower with turbine flow capacity and the water level is gradually decreased there is more excess storage in fzl since it has the outflows from upstream reservoirs as the inflow as a result the period of power generation at turbine flow capacity is longer in the flood recession and the power generation benefit is greater than that of bly and mzt as a single reservoir subsystem the operation of xhd is relatively independent the operation strategy is mainly based on the upper limit of excess storage determined by pre release calculation and the reservoir flood control requirements 6 conclusion flood limited water level flwl is the most important and sensitive parameter that affects the comprehensive efficiency of the reservoir system during flood seasons currently the aggregation decomposition model without considering the forecast uncertainty is mainly established for dynamic control of flood limited water level for a multi reservoir system in this study risk hedging is introduced into the original deterministic model to establish a stochastic programming model considering risk constraint for floodwater utilization of a multi reservoir system four reservoirs in the pi river basin are taken as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model the main conclusions are as follows 1 the dynamic control of flood limited water levels in a multi reservoir system can significantly increase the hydropower generated and decrease spilled water volume for the case study of pi river basin compared with the original design scheme the power generated increases by 18 58 million kwh with an increase rate of 12 53 and the water resource utilization rate increases by 10 95 on average 2 in the operation model considering risk constraint hydropower generated increases as acceptable risk rises with a corresponding decrease in spilled water volume however the marginal benefit decreases with the acceptable risk 3 the water resource utilization rate of the risk constrained model is slightly lower than that of the deterministic model without considering risk but the difference is not significant the water resource utilization rate increases gradually in the wet normal and dry years declaration

4471,floodwater utilization through dynamic operating flood limited water levels flwls of reservoirs plays an important role in flood control and water conservation this study proposes a risk based aggregation decomposition method for floodwater utilization of a complex multi reservoir system the original system is decomposed into four basic configurations for the subsystem with hydraulic connections the upper bound of flwl of each reservoir is identified based on a given risk level for the subsystem and risk hedging between reservoirs a stochastic programming model to maximize hydropower generation is then established for joint operation of the multi reservoir system to find and update the optimal operation strategy during flood seasons the mixed cascade reservoirs in the pi river basin are selected as a case study the application results are compared with those of the original design model and deterministic operation model without considering risk which shows that joint operation and dynamic control of flwls 1 significantly increases the power generation and improves the utilization rate of floodwaters compared to those of the original design model 2 power production rate increases with the acceptable risk but the increasing rate between them decreases with higher levels of risk 3 results in lower utilization rate of floodwaters compared to that of the deterministic model but the difference is not significant the proposed method provides a framework for risk based decision making in floodwater utilization to enhance the comprehensive benefits of a multi reservoir system keywords multi reservoir system flood limited water level hydropower generation aggregation and decomposition risk hedging 1 introduction with continuous development of social economy human demand for water resources is becoming more and more intense scarcity of water resources has become one of the major factors restricting social progress chen et al 2016 reservoir through which distribution of natural runoff is changed by storing abundant water in flood season to meet requirements in non flood season is one of the major and effective engineering measures for integrated water resources management yeh 1985 zhou et al 2014 however most of the reservoirs are built for multiple purposes which are often in conflicts with each other such as flood control power generation water supply navigation and other functions janga reddy and nagesh kumar 2007 therefore optimizing reservoir operation to maximize its comprehensive benefits is an important problem to be solved flood limited water level flwl is the maximum allowed water level reserved for water supply during flood seasons when a reservoir has no needs to retain flood meeting demands the water level of the reservoir should be kept at or below the designed flood limited water level flwl so that the flood control capacity could be reserved to accommodate a possible impending large flood supposing that a flood occurs the reservoir flood control capacity is provided to accommodate the flood and the water level is then raised during the flood when the flood recedes the reservoir water level must be lowered to the designed flwl as soon as possible this operation mode is the so called static control of flood limited water level sc flwl tan et al 2017 lu et al 2020a 2020b it is simple to conduct sc flwl but providing the maximum flood control capacity by keeping a reservoir comparatively emptyduring the entire flood season just to accommodate low probability events such as design flood and check flood which gives too much priority to flood control neglects the variation in the severity of probable flood events and real time forecast information thus affecting the benefit of floodwater utilization ding et al 2015 chang et al 2017 to resolve the conflict between flood control and water conservation in flood season many scholars have studied the problem the us army corps of engineers usace 1998 proposed multistage flwl by dividing the flood season into different stages and reallocating flood control storage liu et al 2015 determined the seasonal flwl optimally by maximizing multiple benefits with the constraint that the total flood risk is less than the original risk the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated through a case study of three gorges reservoir xie et al 2018 established an optimization model to maximize power generation and water supply and found the optimal seasonal flwl by a nonlinear optimization technique the complex method the model was applied to danjiangkou reservoir and a considerable benefit increase was achieved with availability of meteorological and hydrological forecasting dynamic control of flood limited water level dc flwl yun and singh 2008 diao and wang 2011 chen et al 2013 ding et al 2015 peng et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 lu et al 2020a 2020b emerged which makes use of real time forecast information to change the flwl within dynamic control bounds li et al 2010 proposed a dynamic control operation model consisting of a pre release module a refill operation module and a risk analysis module then estimated the bound of dc flwlthrough monte carlo simulation ding et al 2015 ding et al 2017 established a two stage operation model for dc flwl with consideration of both forecast uncertainty and acceptable flood risk and obtained hedging rules between water conservation and flood control currently the technique of determining dc flwl for a single reservoir is relatively mature but is under developed in the case of multiple reservoir systems additionally comprehensive management of a river basin is inseparable from the joint operation of a multi reservoir system zhang et al 2011 due to hydrological hydraulic and storage compensation between reservoirs dc flwl of reservoirs becomes more complicated chen et al 2013 zhong et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 2018 zhong et al 2014 developed a model for determining the upper bounds of flwls in a cascade reservoir system in which the upstream and downstream reservoirs are connected through the storage compensation for the shared flood control responsibility chen et al 2013 proposed a method for the joint operation and dc flwls for cascade reservoirs based on aggregation and decomposition of large scale system for floodwaters utilization of reservoirs according to this method first the cascade reservoirs are aggregated into a single reservoir so that the upper bound of the conserved water excess storage of the whole system can be determined through the capacity constrained pre release method the decomposition method is then used to decompose the aggregated reservoir to individual reservoir units according to the hydraulic connection of upstream and downstream reservoirs thus the excess storage relationship between reservoirs is obtained however owing to possible partial and uncertain forecasts dc flwl for a multi reservoir system may cause additional flood control risk when the weather forecast fails to capture the rainfall or the hydrological forecast underestimates the actual inflow the reservoir water level cannot be drawn safely down to the designed flwl which has an influence on the subsequent flood control operation tan et al 2017 developed a model with consideration of storage compensation regulation and the uncertainty of flood spatial pattern using a copula function zhou et al 2015 proposed an integrated model consisting of a flood control risk analysis module a utilization benefits analysis module and a multi objective evaluation module to derive optimal refill operation rules for cascade reservoirs although these studies supported further development of dc flwl in a multi reservoir system there are some limitations listed as follows 1 the risk rate related to real time dc flwl was not quantified precisely and not integrated into the operation model 2 the risk complementarity between reservoirs was not taken into account although the conserved water levels of different reservoirs can be coordinated to minimize the total risk 3 the real time rolling operation was based on the forecast information in the effective lead time but lacked the consideration of forecast uncertainty in this paper a complex multi reservoir system is decomposed into four basic configurations with due consideration of forecast uncertainty and space compensation of risk the upper bound of flwl of each reservoir in the system is determined under a certain acceptable risk level which is set as the upper limit water level in the joint operation model considering floodwater utilization for the reservoir system the optimal storage allocation strategy in flood season is sought and updated in order to maximize system benefits then the benefits of different schemes can be evaluated and compared the multi reservoir system in the pi river basin is selected as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the decomposition of a complex multi reservoir system is presented in section 2 in section 3 the allowable dynamic control range of the flwl of each reservoir is determined based on the aggregation decomposition method considering risk constraints in section 4 the optimal combination of flwls gaining the maximal system benefits is derived in the control bounds determined in section 3 section 5 presents the case study results as well as analysis and discussion finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 decomposition of a complex multi reservoir system a complex multi reservoir system usually contains reservoirs with hydraulic connections individualflood control points and common flood control points there might be series parallel or mixed connections between the reservoirs fig 1 presents a generalized configuration of a complex multi reservoir system which consists of multi stage reservoirs and multiple flood control points according to the different connections between reservoirs and the needs of floodwaters utilization the complex system is decomposed into four basic configurations as shown in fig 2 a consists of a single reservoir with one flood control point b consists of two cascade reservoirs with two flood control points c consists of two parallel reservoirs with three flood control points in which s d and s e are called individual flood control points while s is common flood control point d consists of three mixed cascade reservoirs with three flood control points these four configurations represent all the basic types of reservoirs with hydraulic connections a large complex multi reservoir system can be decomposed into different subsystems step by step according to these structures to calculate the available water storage of floodwaters in real time fig 3 shows the framework of the proposed methodology which can be divided into two modules i e aggregation decomposition model for dc flwl considering risk constraints section 3 and storage compensation operation model for the multi reservoir system based on stochastic programming section 4 3 aggregation decomposition model for dc flwl considering risk constraints the process of reservoir flood regulation can be separated into three procedures pre release before a flood occurs flood regulation during the flood event and refill during the recession period ding et al 2015 floodwater conservation is conducted in the flood recession period under the condition of no rain forecast in the following days the method of two stage pre release based on forecasts lu et al 2020 is used to calculate the amount of floodwater that can be conserved above the designed flwl according to the meteorological and hydrological forecast information in order to ensure flood control safety the reservoir water level should be lowered to the designed flwl before the next flood occurs so as not to affect the subsequent flood regulation choudhury 2010 provided that the forecast is reliable the excess storage is composed of the water for beneficial uses in the no rain period and the water of pre release for flood control in the early period of the next flood however both weather forecast and hydrological forecast have uncertainties the forecast information is a random variable with certain distribution accordingly the excess storage is also a random variable with a specific distribution we denote the excess storage as w lu et al 2020 deduced the probability density function of w based on the rainfall forecast results from tigge thorpex interactive grand global ensemble which integrates ensemble precipitation products from different centers in which the improved truncated gaussian distribution was taken to fit the norain day forecast error and the normal distribution was used to describe the flood forecast error this function is shown in eq 1 1 f w w a 1 a 2 exp w μ 1 μ 2 2 2 σ 3 2 0 w 1 exp x σ 1 2 w μ 2 σ 2 2 μ 1 σ 3 2 2 2 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 2 d x y 0 a 2 0 w 1 exp w x μ 2 2 2 σ 2 2 d x where a 1 μ 1 σ 1 y 0 are the distribution parameters of pre release water for beneficial uses in the no rain period w 1 is the upper bound of pre release water for beneficial uses a 2 μ 2 σ 2 are the distribution parameters of pre release water for flood control in flood period and σ 3 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 the probability that the initial regulation water level of the next flood exceeding the designed flwl is defined as the risk rate of reservoir excess storage as shown in eq 2 2 p p r o b v 0 v x p r o b v x w s w v x p r o b w w s where v 0 represents the storage corresponding to the initial water level of the subsequent flood considering uncertainty v x denotes the storage at the designed flwl w s is the actual excess storage determined in the decision the risk increases with the actual excess storage from eqs 1 and 2 the risk curve of reservoir excess storage can be obtained as shown in fig 4 the end point of the curve point a in the figure represents the deterministic upper limit of excess storage w max given the acceptable risk value p 0 the upper bound of allowable excess storage w max can be gained the following risk calculations for subsystems are all based on this principle 3 1 a single reservoir with one flood control point if the uncertainty is not taken into account the excess storage of reservoir a in the subsystem of fig 2 a at the current time can be expressed as eq 3 3 w a max t 1 d q a m q a i n t δ t 1 t d 1 d t y α a q a s q a f l t δ t 2 where qa m is the maximum water flow for utilization qa in t is the reservoir inflow in the no rain period d is the forecasted no rain days αa is the discount coefficient of safety discharge at downstream qa s is the safety discharge at downstream of reservoir a qa fl t is the reservoir inflow in the early period of the next flood ty is the effective lead time of flood forecast t 1 and t 2 are the time intervals of weather forecast and flood forecast respectively based on the risk curve fig 4 derived from the risk calculations the upper bound of allowable excess storage w a max can be obtained according to the acceptable risk 3 2 two cascade reservoirs with two flood control points for reservoirs with hydraulic connections the aggregation decomposition method can be used for the determination of excess storage all of the reservoirs are aggregated into a virtual aggregated reservoir and the forecast accuracy of the whole basin is analyzed to find the relationship between the total excess storage of the aggregated reservoir and the risk the upper bound of the total excess storage is then obtained according to the acceptable risk the decomposition module is used to generate the relationship between the excess storages of reservoirs according to their hydraulic connections the total excess storage is optimally allocated to individual reservoir units by minimizing the total risk of reservoirs based on the risk hedging principle you and cai 2008 zhao et al 2014 3 2 1 aggregation module the cascade reservoirs shown in fig 2 b are aggregated into a large virtual reservoir whose inflow is the sum of all the inflows in the cascade system and the outflow is the outflow of downstream reservoir c the designed flood control capacity of the aggregated reservoir is the sum of the flood control capacities of the upstream and the downstream reservoirs the upper bound of the deterministic excess storage without considering uncertainty of the aggregated reservoir is shown as eq 4 4 w max t 1 d q b m q c m δ q q in t δ t 1 t d 1 d t y α c q c s q fl t δ t 2 where qb m and qc m are the maximum water flows for utilization of reservoir b and c respectively δ q is the reuse water of the two reservoirs that is the part of water used by reservoir b that is not stored and flows into reservoir c qin t is the inflow of the aggregated reservoir in no rain period expressed as eq 5 αc is the discount coefficient for downstream safety discharge of reservoir c qc s is the safety discharge at downstream of reservoir c qfl t is the inflow of the aggregated reservoir in the early flood period expressed as eq 6 5 q in t q b i n t q qj i n t 6 q fl t q b f l t q qj f l t where qb in t and qqj in t are respectively the inflow of reservoir b and lateral inflow in no rain period qb fl t and qqj fl t are respectively the inflow of reservoir b and lateral inflow in the early flood period the no rain forecast accuracy in the whole basin is analyzed and the flood forecast error is referenced to obtain the relevant parameters based on the calculated risk curve the upper bound of allowable excess storage of the aggregated reservoir considering risk constraint can be obtained under a given acceptable risk 3 2 2 decomposition module due to the hydraulic connection with the upstream and downstream reservoirs the excess storage of one reservoir is affected by the current storage of other reservoirs thus there is a mutual restriction among the reservoirs the total excess storage of the system can be allocated to each reservoir according to the hydraulic connectivity the decomposition module obtains the coordination relationship between the allowable excess storage of each reservoir under the current forecast information and the optimal allocation is made by risk hedging for the cascade reservoirs in fig 2 b the pre release water of reservoir b affects the inflow of reservoir c the upper limits of deterministic excess storages of the two reservoirs are shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 w b max t 1 d q b m q b i n t δ t 1 t d 1 d t y q b o u t q b f l t δ t 2 8 w c max t 1 d q c m q qj i n t δ q δ t 1 t d 1 d t y α c q c s q qj f l t q b o u t δ t 2 where qb out is the release discharge of reservoir b in the pre release for flood control stage which is the key variable to coordinate the upper bounds of excess storages of reservoirs b and c the range of qb out should meet the following requirements 9 q b f l t q b o u t α b q b s where αb denotes the discount coefficient for downstream safety discharge of reservoir b and qb s is the safety discharge at downstream of reservoir b the more pre release water for flood control of reservoir b the more excess storage the larger inflow of reservoir c and the less excess storage that is there is a negative correlation between wb max and wc max on condition that the uncertainty is not considered the corresponding wc max can be determined according to a given wb max the relationship between them is as follows 10 w b max w cmax w max in combination with section 3 2 1 adding the risk constraint of the aggregated reservoir eq 10 should be written as follows 11 w b max w c max w max where w b max and w c max are the upper bounds of allowable excess storages of reservoirs b and c with risk constraints respectively then the upper bounds of flwls of reservoirs b and c z b max z c max are identified as f v bx w b max f v cx w c max in which vbx and vcx are the storage capacities corresponding to the designed flwls of reservoirs b and c and f represents the relationship between reservoir water level and storage the lower bound is set as the original designed flwl if the upper limits of the deterministic flwls are zb max and zc max the optimization search interval is the area covered by the upper curve in fig 5 the optimization range will be narrowed with the interval boundary reduced after considering the risk constraint as shown in fig 5 in the multi reservoir system the hedging and offsetting of the flood control risks can be managed by the compensating allocation of flood control capacity between reservoirs based on eqs 7 and 8 the risk calculation of reservoirs b and c is introduced to obtain the corresponding risk curves of excess storage as shown in fig 6 under the condition that the total excess storage of the system is fixed the optimal allocation scheme of excess storages among reservoirs can be found by minimizing the weighted total risk of reservoirs eq 12 according to the principle of risk hedging 12 min λ b p b λ c p c where pb and pc are respectively the excess storage risks of reservoirs b and c λb and λc denote the weighting factors for reservoirs b and c which can be determined according to the reservoir safety importance level and real time flood control requirements if the water allocation results do not satisfy the expected requirements such as ensuring that there is a certain amount of excess water storage in both reservoirs and the excess storages of the two reservoirs are in the same proportion of the required water it will return to the storage decomposition phase and re coordinate the allocation by adjusting qb out 3 3 two parallel reservoirs with three flood control points for the parallel reservoirs shown in fig 2 c there is no direct hydraulic connection between reservoirs d and e but they jointly undertake the flood control safety of downstream common flood control point we denote qs as the safety discharge at the common flood control point s qs d and qs e as the safety discharges at the individual flood control points s d and s e the excess storage is calculated in two cases 1 qs qs d qs e the common flood control point will not work and the excess storages of the two reservoirs can be calculated separately as a single reservoir 2 qs qs d qs e allocate qs to reservoirs d and e in proportion via discounting at qs d and qs e the discounted safety discharge is then the maximum allowable discharge to pre release for flood control and the excess storages of the two reservoirs are calculated according to the single reservoir model 3 4 three mixed reservoirs with three flood control points compared with the cascade and parallel reservoir subsystems the mixed reservoirs have more complex hydraulic connections the basic configuration can be identified as the combination of cascade and parallel configurations which can be decomposed step by step based on the calculation principle in section 3 2 as shown in fig 7 the specific steps are as follows 1 the two upstream parallel reservoirs f and g are regarded as one upstream reservoir u with which the downstream reservoir h can form a cascade reservoir subsystem the inflow of reservoir u is the sum of inflows of reservoirs f and g the safety discharge is the sum of safety discharges of f and g and the designed flood control capacity is the sum of flood control capacities of f and g 2 according to the method of aggregation decomposition in section 3 2 the upper limit of allowable excess storage of the system under acceptable risk is first obtained which is then decomposed to reservoirs u and h to gain the corresponding allowable excess storages δ w u max and δ w h max via risk hedging 3 since the allowable excess storage of reservoir u is known the risk hedging principle is used again to allocate δ w u max to the original two single reservoirs f and g to obtain δ w f max and δ w g max 4 evaluate whether the allowable excess water storage of each reservoir meets the expected water demands that is the excess storage of each reservoir is in the same proportion with the required water volume as shown in δ w f max δ w g max δ w h max df dg dh where df dg dh are the water demands of f g and h reservoirs in the following no rain period if not it will return to the previous step in turn to adjust the discharge in the pre release for flood control stage qu out and qf out qg out so as to satisfy different water demands 4 joint operation for multi reservoir based on stochastic programming the dynamic control of flwls and joint operation of real time flood is to determine the optimal storage and drainage strategy optimal allocation strategy of flood control storage for each reservoir according to the forecast information current reservoir storage flood control objectives and other state information within the effective lead time and update the operation strategy with the forecasts storage compensation operation is a real time dynamic rolling process of forecast decision implementation zhou et al 2014 the operation rules of water level in flood season are as follows when the flood recedes and there is no rain forecasted the flwl of the reservoir can be raised through conserving floodwater under the premise of moderate risk in the early period of flood if the water level does not fall to the designed flwl the reservoir should pre release the excess water and transit to flood control mode to ensure flood control safety the upper bound of dc flwl obtained based on the forecast information is taken as the highest control water level of reservoir in the non flood period of flood season simulation operation is to seek the optimal strategy of each reservoir in this control field with the aim of maximum benefit of the multi reservoir system to account for forecasting errors monte carlo simulation method is used to generate the inflow scenario tree and stochastic programming is introduced into the real time rolling operation of reservoirs the optimal strategy is obtained by optimizing the expected objective value under all inflow scenarios the purpose of this module is to simulate the operation of multi reservoir system in flood season so as to analyze the changes of benefit and risk under the implementation of dc flwl 4 1 inflow scenario tree based on monte carlo simulation a scenario tree consists of a set of nodes and connections between nodes heitsch and römisch 2009 xu et al 2015 starting from the root node of the first period the tree gradually branches to the subsequent period forming a tree structure the nodes at the end of a period are called leaf nodes and the path from each root node to leaf node constitutes an inflow scenario these inflow scenarios are a discrete representation of the stochastic process of reservoir inflow it has been assumed that the relative error of flood forecast obeys the normal distribution with the mean value of 0 n 0 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of the flood forecast relative error which can be obtained from historical forecast data random inflows to each reservoir inflow are generated by monte carlo simulation method shown in eq 13 13 q i t s q i t f 1 σ e t where q i t s is the simulated stochastic inflow at time t q i t f is the forecasted inflow at time t et is the standard normal random variable the set of inflows generated through simulation is defined as scenario tree q i t j t 1 t y j 1 j in which j is the total scenario number and q i t j represents the jth inflow process of the ith reservoir starting from the current moment to the end of the effective lead time the scenario tree provides input data for real time operation model 4 2 stochastic optimization model 1 objective function taking the maximum total power generation of the reservoir system as the objective the

a large scale mixed reservoir system in pi river basin which is part of the huai river basin in china see fig 8 is selected as a case study the pi river basin located in the east asian monsoon region has an uneven distribution of rainfall in both time and space with a dense population and high rate of cultivated land simultaneously owing to these factors water shortage in the area is the main constraint on development at present three reservoirs named bailianya bly mozitan mzt and foziling fzl have been built on the east pi river with a catchment area of 1840 km2 xianghongdian xhd reservoir is located on the west pi river which as a catchment area of 1400 km2 during flood seasons the operating policy of the multi reservoir system in pi river basin is the traditional static

control point which are huoshan at the downstream of bmf reservoirs bly mzt and fzl dushan at the downstream of xhd reservoir and hengpaitou at the downstream of the whole system the safety discharge at the three flood control points is 3450 2500 and 8400 m3 s respectively 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 data description in order to analyze the influence of different year type and year distribution on floodwater utilization three typical years i e wet year 2015 normal year 2011 and dry year 2014 are selected from the years from tigge supplies forecast 2007 the data used are the forecasted 3 h runoff series and rainfall series collected from tigge in flood season from june to september the forecast period in the inflow forecast system of bmf reservoir system is 48 h and that of xhd reservoir is 72 h in this paper 24 h with high forecast accuracy is selected as the operation period for rolling operation statistical analysisshows the standard deviation of forecast relative error to be 0 20 a set of 10 scenarios was generated by monte carlo simulation as the input of the joint operation model and the expected value of model output has been used for results display the initial water levels in flood season of the four reservoirs were set as the designed flwls the acceptable risk p 0 was set at 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 for model calculation for comparison and analysis the calculation of static control of flood limited water level sc flwl and dynamic control of flood limited water level without considering risk dc flwl were also performed sc flwl is calculated according to the original designed flwl and flood control regulation rules of each reservoir and dc flwl is controlled by the optimal allocation strategy under the flood control regulation rules 5 2 2 results of aggregation decomposition model due to the safety discharge rate of common flood control point being greater than the sum of that of the two individual flood control points bmf reservoirs and xhd reservoir can be calculated separately in the determination of the upper bounds of flwls xhd reservoir is a single reservoir subsystem and bmf reservoirs are a mixed reservoirs subsystem taking the year 2015 as an example the results of aggregation decomposition model for dc flwl are shown in fig 10 in which fig 10 a shows the total excess storage of the multi reservoir system during the flood season and fig 10 b the standardization of the upper bounds of flwls with p 0 20 it can be seen from fig 10 that the upper bounds of flwls are dynamic curves changing with time which is determined by current forecast information and storage capacity of each reservoir the reason for the situation that there is no excess storage in fig 10 is the forecast of rainfall in the current period and the flood control capacity should beprovided from fig 10 a it can be seen that the curve of dc has the highest position that is the allowable excess storage is the maximum the reason is that there is no risk constraint in the model since the uncertainties are not taken into account in terms of the schemes with the acceptable risk limit the curves lower with the decrease of the acceptable risk that is the allowable excess storage decreases gradually which indicates that the risk control is at the cost of sacrificing the benefits of excess storage moreover the distance between each curve decreases with the increase of acceptable risk which suggests that the marginal benefit of increasing risk decreases this is due to the property of risk curve that the risk increases with the excess storage and the increasing rate also increases lu et al 2020 on the contrary the excess storage has a positive relation to the acceptable risk with the increasing rate decreasing fig 10 b displays the dynamic flwls of each reservoir on p 0 20 from which it can be seen that the processes of the four reservoirs have a similar trend as the curve in fig 10 a whereas bmf reservoirs have higher consistency the reason lies in that the three reservoirs are a mixed subsystem with hydraulic connections and xhd is treated as a single reservoir independently in addition on the premise of the overall consistency there are also some differences among the three reservoirs which is to offset the excess storage risk through the compensated allocation of the storage of the three reservoirs the comparison of the standardized average upper bounds of flwls for each reservoir under different schemes is shown in fig 11 in addition to the upper water level decreasing with the decrease of acceptable risk same as fig 10 a it can also be seen that the average allowable excess storage of bly is the largest mzt is the smallest and fzl is located in between the reason is that the flood control capacities of bly and fzl are greater than mzt and the excess water storage required for fzl is reduced in the decomposition phase because it can receive the outflows from upstream reservoirs 5 2 3 results of simulation operation the simulation of real time operation is performed for flood seasons in the three typical years with the water levels controlled by the upper bounds of flwls the hydropower generated hg and spilled water sw volume have been collated to evaluate the benefit the results of hg and sw of sc flwl and dc flwl schemes are listed in table 2 compared with sc flwl the increase of hg and decrease of sw in dc flwl under different acceptable risks are shown in fig 12 from table 2 it can be seen that through the implementation of dc flwl the reservoir system can generate more hydropower and decrease spill greatly in the deterministic dc flwl without considering risk the reservoir system increases hydropower production by 30 88 106 kwh 17 01 11 43 106 kwh 7 52 and 13 44 106 kwh 12 06 in the wet year normal year and dry year respectively on average the increased hydropower production is 18 58 million kwh with an increase rate of 12 53 the benefit of dc flwl is remarkable from fig 12 it can be seen that 1 there is a positive correlation between the increase of hg and the acceptable risk that is the hg increases with the acceptable risk and the sw decreases correspondingly this is because the upper bounds of flwls are positively proportional to the acceptable risk and the higher acceptable risk allows higher upper bounds so that the water level constraint in the optimal operation model is relaxed to get a larger benefit 2 the curve shows a convex function trend that is the relationship between benefit and acceptable risk is positive with the increasing rate decreasing which indicates that marginal benefit is decreasing this is consistent with the relationship between excess storage and risk the increased benefit of dc flwl in the wet year is the highest followed by the dry year and lowest in the normal year the reason for this result is the different runoff distribution in three typical years flood occurs the most frequently and flood volume is the largest in the wet year thus there are sufficient floodwaters to be used although the total water amount in the dry year is lower than that of the normal year there are more small and medium flood occurrences thus the available floodwaters are greater and the spilled water is less than that of the normal year to demonstrate the effectiveness of floodwaters utilization eq 19 has been utilized to calculate the water resource utilization rate chen et al 2013 for the multi reservoir system during flood seasons 19 η 1 i 1 n s w i i 1 n i w i where η is water resource utilization efficiency swi is spilled water of the ith reservoir iwi is the inflow volume of the ith reservoir during flood season the results are listed in table 3 table 3 indicates that the water resource utilization rate can be significantly improved by the implementation of dc flwl for the reservoir system notably the water resource utilization rate is increased by 10 95 on average with the deterministic dc flwl compared to sc flwl taking p 0 20 to represent the mode of dc flwl considering risk constraint the comparison of water resource utilization rates of the three modes is shown in fig 13 it can be seen that 1 the water resource utilization rate of dc flwl with risk constraint is lower than that of dc flwl without considering risk but the difference is not significant 2 the water resource utilization rate in wet normal and dry years increases gradually which is due to the decrease in spilled water volume figs 14 16 display the joint operating process of the four reservoirs during flood season in the wet normal and dry years under dc flwl mode with p 0 20 risk constraint it can be seen from the figures that the water level is controlled by the upper bound of flwl obtained through risk hedging when the reservoir receives the flood the reservoir water level is raised timely by conserving a certain amount of flood resources for subsequent use when there is no flood or medium and small flood occur the water level of the reservoir is adjusted dynamically according to the forecast so as to avoid water spilloperating under the original designed flwl the floodwaters are effectively utilized to increase the benefit of power generation taking the wet year as an example as shown in fig 14 floods occur in late july and early august respectively in bmf reservoirs thus the reservoirs retain the flood on the premise of ensuring the flood control safety the excess water storage is used after the flood to generate hydropower with turbine flow capacity and the water level is gradually decreased there is more excess storage in fzl since it has the outflows from upstream reservoirs as the inflow as a result the period of power generation at turbine flow capacity is longer in the flood recession and the power generation benefit is greater than that of bly and mzt as a single reservoir subsystem the operation of xhd is relatively independent the operation strategy is mainly based on the upper limit of excess storage determined by pre release calculation and the reservoir flood control requirements 6 conclusion flood limited water level flwl is the most important and sensitive parameter that affects the comprehensive efficiency of the reservoir system during flood seasons currently the aggregation decomposition model without considering the forecast uncertainty is mainly established for dynamic control of flood limited water level for a multi reservoir system in this study risk hedging is introduced into the original deterministic model to establish a stochastic programming model considering risk constraint for floodwater utilization of a multi reservoir system four reservoirs in the pi river basin are taken as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model the main conclusions are as follows 1 the dynamic control of flood limited water levels in a multi reservoir system can significantly increase the hydropower generated and decrease spilled water volume for the case study of pi river basin compared with the original design scheme the power generated increases by 18 58 million kwh with an increase rate of 12 53 and the water resource utilization rate increases by 10 95 on average 2 in the operation model considering risk constraint hydropower generated increases as acceptable risk rises with a corresponding decrease in spilled water volume however the marginal benefit decreases with the acceptable risk 3 the water resource utilization rate of the risk constrained model is slightly lower than that of the deterministic model without considering risk but the difference is not significant the water resource utilization rate increases gradually in the wet normal and dry years declaration

status and the gross primary productivity gpp of phytoplankton in lake poyang a large floodplain lake system in china this study hypothesized that wlf is the key controlling regulator of the lake s nutrient status phytoplankton growth and gpp driven by its influence on the lake s hydrological connectivity in combination with water flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters the results showed that the intra annual water levels in this lake varied from 7 61 m to 20 82 m while inter annual water levels significantly decreased throughout 1989 2018 p 0 05 except for ph most environmental variables and nutrients differed significantly each season mean gpp and chlorophyll a chl a concentration during the water rising period was clearly higher compared to the dry season wet season and falling period moreover nutrient concentration was the main determining factor of phytoplankton growth and gpp during different periods while water temperature wt also played a key role in influencing phytoplankton biomass and gpp during the water rising period there was also a direct correlation between wlf and gpp during the water rising period and wlf significantly affected nutrient concentration subsequently impacting gpp this study can benefit our overall knowledge of hydrological and ecological dynamics in floodplain lake systems while providing an important reference for policymakers in the management of dams and water quality in floodplain lake systems globally keywords water level phytoplankton primary productivity floodplain lake poyang 1 introduction in recent years eutrophication has attracted progressively more attention from the general public as well as researchers anderson et al 2014 jia et al 2019a wang et al 2019 in view of the recent occurrence of lake eutrophication in china liu et al 2010 investigated 84 of a select number of chinese lakes i e 103 lakes in total and predicted that the nutrient enrichment trend in large floodplains will continue to increase into the future phytoplankton community characteristics and primary productivity reflect the ecological and nutritional status of water bodies they are also important indicators used to evaluate the eutrophication trophic level and the overall health status of water bodies islam et al 2012 phillips et al 2013 phytoplankton growth and community characteristics control the gross primary productivity gpp of water bodies given that phytoplankton are main primary producers in many lakes jiang et al 2014 phytoplankton play a crucial role in the global carbon c cycle as well as under climate change conditions this is because the contribution of photosynthesis in aquatic environments is 50 of the global primary production pinedo gonzalez et al 2015 gpp representing phytoplankton biomass and their growth rates wang et al 2015 is sensitive to changes of nutrient and hydrological conditions wu et al 2014a it is mainly regulated by nutrient supplies such as nitrogen

al 2016 wu et al 2019 2017 underwater light conditions dembowska and kubiak wojcicka 2017 and water retention times wu et al 2014a this is because rising water levels dilute or increase lake nutrients consequently phytoplankton growth may be affected under such conditions wu et al 2013 gao et al 2020a additionally hakanson et al 2000 indicated that a decrease in water levels may lead to a significant deterioration in water quality in large subtropical lakes the lake and river floodplains are hydrologically complex and dynamic systems that exhibit high wlfs and frequent flooding and drying events li et al 2018b thomas et al 2015 moreover they have long been recognized as globally threatened ecosystems while being highly sensitive to anthropogenic intervention and climate change entwistle et al 2019 gao et al 2021 however to date little research has been conducted on the effects of wlf on the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton primary productivity in floodplains here we hypothesized that wlf is the key controlling regulator of a floodplain lake system s nutrient status and gpp and driven by its influence on its hydrological connectivity water flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters accordingly the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the spatial patterns of the phytoplankton community the gpp and the nutrient status of lake poyang 2 to determine whether the environmental factors that control gpp vary according to changes in water levels subject to different seasons of the lake 3 to ascertain wlf over the long term and its effect on nutrients within the lake results from this study will strengthen our understanding of eutrophication regulation measures in floodplains under high wlf conditions while also providing comprehensive knowledge on hydrological and ecological changes in floodplain lake systems worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake poyang 115 49 e 116 46 e 28 24 n 29 46 n in jiangxi province is the largest freshwater lake in china the watershed area of the lake is 1 622 105 km2 fig 1 five tributaries primarily drain into the lake namely the gan river fu river xin river rao river and xiu river which then discharge into the yangtze river from a narrow channel at the hukou gauging station to the north of the study area yao et al 2015 which can therefore be described as a water

2017 to 2019 hu and wei 2006 the phytoplankton samples sitting for 48 h were siphoned out of the supernatant leaving 60 ml of samples at the bottom then add 1 ml of formaldehyde solution and store it for laboratory test using hu and wei 2006 as a reference the species composition density and biomass of phytoplankton were determined applying the eyepiece lens of wide visual field method after vigorously shaking the concentrated and precipitated water samples 0 1 ml of the sample and 0 1 ml of the counter box were added and then carefully covered with glass following this the number of

acidification the absorbance values of the extract at 665 and 750 nm were determined respectively and the chl a concentration was calculated chen et al 2016b 2 3 data analysis in order to illustrate relationships among water levels and other factors four different time periods were used in this study fig 2 a namely the dry season ds december and january the rising period rp from february to june the wet season ws july and the falling period fp from august to november the classification of these four periods was mainly based on water level variation although the mean water level value in january 9 01 m was similar to that in february 8 99 m throughout the study period fig 2a the value in february was 0 76 m higher than that in january according to long term data from 1955 to 2011 wu et al 2014b therefore january and february were classified as different periods in this study moreover in different periods the hydrological connectivity and water flow velocity of poyang lake are different the water flow velocity of lake poyang in the rising period is relatively fast li et al 2014 and the hydrological connectivity in the wet season of lake poyang is obviously better than that

season 1 89 mg l 1 fig 4c later cyanophyta 45 54 became the dominant species during the wet season followed by bacillariophyta 22 19 the proportion of cyanophyta within the basin retention area was distinctly lower than the estuary areas during the wet season during the falling period fig 4d phytoplankton biomass at most sampling sites was higher than 6 mg l 1 and significantly varied from 0 99 to 14 80 mg l 1 which accounted for a similar proportion of bacillariophyta 31 56 and cyanophyta 29 38 moreover during the dry season and falling period phytoplankton biomass significantly correlated to gpp and chl a p 0 05 table 3 3 4 changes in environmental variables three trophic levels including mesotrophic 30 tli 50 lightly eutrophic 50 tli 60 and intermediately eutrophic 60 tli 70 were present in lake poyang throughout all periods fig 5 during the dry season trophic levels were lightly eutrophic and intermediately eutrophic 55 tli 68 which was obviously more severe compared to the other three periods 38 tli 56 namely mesotrophic and lightly eutrophic the mean tli during the dry season was 61 i e intermediately eutrophic which was significantly higher compared to the values from the three other periods 46 49 mesotrophic during the dry season and falling period the trophic levels of the basin retention area were distinctly less severe light compared to the estuaries and the mouth of the gan river into lake poyang nevertheless the trophic levels of the estuaries were apparently less severe lighter compared to the other areas during the wet season 4 discussion 4 1 long term wlf effects on the nutrient status of lake poyang in recent decades lake poyang has experienced dramatic hydrological changes and these changes have resulted in significant hydrological biological ecological and economic consequences in the region liu et al 2013 our results showed that the inter annual wlf of lake poyang is considerable particularly the maximum annual water level fig 6 a additionally m k test results on long term wlfs 1989 2018 showed that the annual maximum water level z 2 31 p 0 05 and the mean water level z 3 14 p 0 01 have significantly decreased over the last 30 years table 3 numerous studies have been published on long term wlf effects for example zhang et al 2017 reported that since the 1950 s lake poyang water levels have exhibited a weak declining trend on the whole but since 2003 lake poyang has experienced extreme dry periods over many years feng et al 2012 2015 reported on the inter annual and intra annual characteristics of lake poyang flooding between 2000 and 2010 and they found a statistically significant decline in mean annual and minimum flooded areas concerning climatic forcing zhao et al 2010 demonstrated that annual precipitation increased but was statistically insignificant while potential evaporation decreased significantly in lake poyang and the annual streamflow into the lake increased from the 1950 s to 2003 the bathymetry of lake poyang varied considerably due to natural erosion deposition cycles and anthropogenic activities e g land reclamation lake reclamation sand mining etc over the last few decades lai et al 2014 wu et al 2015 nutrient accumulation processes caused by wlfs within a floodplain can be counterbalanced by the relocation of nutrients such as uptake by algae and drift into the main river channel tockner et al 1999 gao and yu 2020 results from our study also indicated that tn concentration exhibited an increasing trend between 1989 and 2018 fig 6b it has been speculated that an increase in pollution from cities farmland and anthropogenic activities may have caused this detected increase in nutrients furthermore between 1989 and 1998 the annual maximum water level was negatively corelated to tp concentration p 0 05 moreover between 1999 and 2008 and between 1989 and 2018 annual mean water levels also exhibited a negative correlation to tn concentration p 0 05 table 2 given that high water levels dilute nutrients in water years with higher water levels will have lower nutrient concentration wu et al 2006 reported that tn no3 and nh4 concentrations have been higher by an approximate factor of two to three during periods of low water levels compared to periods of high water levels in certain lakes wu et al 2013 observed that between 2009 and 2011 dtn and dtp concentration in lake poyang increased from 1 18 to 1 74 and from 0 034 to 0 060 mg l 1 respectively 4 2 seasonal wlf effects on gpp in our study we observed that the main factors that determine phytoplankton growth and gpp varied alongside lake poyang water levels during the different periods investigated the main factors were nutrients wt and water levels through principal component analysis of environmental factors we found that the first two principal components described 30 23 and 25 01 of the environmental variation respectively fig 7 among them the environmental variables highly correlated with the first principal component were tp and wt with the loadings of 45 12 and 42 97 table 4 fig 7 which mainly represented the characteristics of climate and nutrients the environmental variables highly correlated with the second principal component were doc and dtc and the loadings reached 55 25 and 52 41 table 4 fig 7 which mainly represented the carbon level of water body many studies have found that nutrient concentration plays a critical role in phytoplankton growth and gpp jia et al 2019b seekell et al 2015 as fig 8 a shows during the dry season sio4 4 concentration was negatively and significantly correlated to phytoplankton biomass and density the phytoplankton community was dominated by diatom during the dry season rising period and falling period fig 4 moreover the tli of the dry season was the highest and most areas of lake poyang reached intermediately eutrophic index fig 5 silicate being a necessary diatom requirement closely controls the structure and metabolism of cells lu et al 2021 2020 thus silicate may also regulate phytoplankton growth processes and subsequently affect primary productivity gao et al 2016 ke et al 2014 moreover tn dtn and no3 were inversely and significantly correlated to gpp during the dry season fig 8a during the rising period phytoplankton gpp was highly significant and positively correlated to dtc doc and dic concentration fig 8b the level of inorganic c will affect the chemical element composition within algae subsequently affecting the nutritional structure of algae zhang et al 2015 further inorganic c could alter the competitive advantage of phytoplankton and affects its community structure some studies also found that doc concentration has a significant effect on phytoplankton gpp in lakes jia et al 2020 seekell et al 2015 furthermore we found highly significant p 0 01 and negative correlations between gpp and dtn dtp po4 3 during the rising period fig 8b this may be due to the fact that dissolved nutrient elements are more easily absorbed and utilized by phytoplankton during the wet season only nh4 concentration was correlated to gpp p 0 01 and only no3 concentration was correlated to phytoplankton biomass p 0 01 fig 8c similarly during the falling period tp was the only nutrient factor that explained phytoplankton gpp dynamics p 0 05 fig 8d pan et al 2009 found that tp was positively correlated to chl a in lakes connected to the yangtze river although the correlation was weaker compared to lakes not connected to the river our previous study also found that tp played a critical role in determining phytoplankton species composition in lake poyang during the wet season and dry season wang et al 2020 additionally during the falling period tp dtp po4 3 concentration was negatively correlated p 0 05 to phytoplankton biomass while nh4 dtn concentration was positively correlated p 0 01 to phytoplankton biomass fig 8d however wu et al 2013 reported that dtn and dtp concentration was both positively and significantly correlated to the phytoplankton biomass of the major groups furthermore wt also plays a key role in phytoplankton biomass and gpp during the rising period in lake poyang the relationship between wt and phytoplankton biomass and gpp was highly significant and inversely correlated during the rising period whereby correlation coefficients were both higher than 0 50 p 0 01 fig 8b zhang et al 2018 reported that wt was a principal parameter that dominated the contemporary diatom assemblage wu et al 2019 observed that wt significantly contributed to explaining chl a concentration during the falling period and wet season in lake poyang to a certain extent phytoplankton species composition determines the effect of temperature on algae diatoms were inversely correlated to temperature and they occurred preferentially at temperatures below 18 c while being directly correlated to higher discharge and a deeper mixing layer da silva et al 2005 wang et al 2011 furthermore the underwater light condition is important to phytoplankton growth providing energy for photosynthesis the strong vertical mixing of water reduces the transparency and leads to a decrease in light availability which results in low phytoplankton biomass and productivity ho et al 2010 our study found that water levels had a significant effect on phytoplankton gpp and environmental parameters we hypothesized that the wlf influences hydrological connectivity water flow velocity and other environmental parameters which subsequently affects the nutrient status phytoplankton growth and gpp water levels were significantly negatively correlated to gpp during the rising period p 0 05 fig 8b the water flow velocity was relatively fast approx 0 80 m s 1 li et al 2014 which was generally consistent to the wlf during the rising period liu et al 2015b generally elevated flow velocities inhibit phytoplankton growth valdes weaver et al 2006 furthermore when water levels are high the hydrological connectivity of lake poyang was significant as was the close exchange between materials energy and biology however during periods when water levels are low the hydrological connectivity of lake poyang was poor given that greater than 100 separate sub lakes appear hu et al 2019 therefore fluctuations in water flow velocity and hydrological connectivity alongside wlfs as well as the combination of water levels generally resulted in a negative correlation between water levels and gpp wu et al 2013 reported that due to wlfs and its complex shape the hydrology of lake poyang is highly variable which may affect phytoplankton community composition additionally the underwater light condition is critical for algae growth providing energy for photosynthesis moreover water flow may cause sediment resuspension which in turn would lead to low light conditions in lake poyang wu et al 2013 significant wlfs in lake poyang also play a key role in their impact on nutrients such as c n p and silicon si which subsequently influences phytoplankton growth and gpp for example doc was negatively and significantly correlated to water level during the dry season p 0 05 fig 8a dtc and doc were both negatively and significantly correlated to water level during the rising period fig 8b nh4 and dtn also exhibited significant inverse relationships with water level during the falling period fig 8d however during all four periods tp or po4 3 was significantly positively correlated to water levels liu et al 2016 found a positive relationship between water level and po4 p concentration r2 0 36 which was consistent with our results in particular positive relationships between water level and tn 0 99 tp 0 90 and sio4 4 0 77 were typically observed during the wet season fig 8c during the wet season under conditions of significant hydrological connectivity nutrients were frequently exchanged among rivers and lakes which may result in positive relationships moreover the water level had an extremely significant and positive relationship with wt during the dry season p 0 01 fig 8a due to the fact that variations in wt are roughly the same as variations in water levels previous studies have often neglected the wt effect in lake poyang wu et al 2019 our results showed that the phytoplankton community was dominated by bacillariophyta except during the wet season qian et al 2017 indicated that changes in environmental parameters related to wlfs caused variations in diatom biomass and community composition in lake poyang bacillariophyta occurred preferentially at lower temperatures da silva et al 2005 wang et al 2011 however cyanophyta can adapt well to low flow velocity and higher temperature conditions qian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 therefore cyanobacteria dominated during the wet season under slower water flow velocities and higher wts although high temperatures are typically accompanied by high transparency and high light intensity during the summer phytoplankton biomass was lower during the wet season and this was mainly due to dilution and washout effects qian et al 2017 wu et al 2013 concerning the eutrophication status liu et al 2014 confirmed that the degree of eutrophication under high water levels was lower than that of low water levels in their study on lake poyang which was consistent with our results similar phenomena have also occurred in lake dongting which is another lake connected to the yangtze river where a rise in water levels also played a role in the dilution of nutrients within the lake thus reducing the degree of eutrophication within the lake wang et al 2012 miao et al 2020 5 perspective understanding how the overall role of hydrologic dynamics driven by wlfs in lake poyang impacts phytoplankton growth and gpp can help us to clarify relationships between dams and phytoplankton yang et al 2012 in this study nutrients and water temperatures wts were found to be the main determining factors of phytoplankton growth and gpp in lake poyang during the four different periods investigated and wlfs can directly affect gpp while also affecting nutrients through their influence on hydrological connectivity water flow velocity and other environmental parameters which subsequently influences the nutrient status of phytoplankton growth and gpp in lake poyang as well as other such floodplain lakes according to the government authorities of jiangxi province the proposed poyang dam will only be used to contain water that normally returns back to the yangtze river during the dry season li 2011 this policy reveals a scenario of using a dam to conserve water during times when water levels in lake poyang are typically falling the operation of the proposed poyang dam will keep the water level above 14 m from september to october and 12 m from november to march which will result in a more extensive water surface area a longer water residence time better hydrological connectivity lower water flow velocity and higher water transparency during the falling period and dry season in lake poyang the hydrological condition of lake poyang may reduce potential impacts of nutrient and algae washout as well as cause the direct release of nutrients that accumulate throughout the dry season de domitrovic 2003 which may facilitate phytoplankton growth and gpp in lake poyang moreover cyanobacteria can adapt well to slow flow velocity and warm wts therefore this may have the effect of increasing the biomass of cyanophyta and its duration as the dominant algae qian et al 2016 consequently local managers should focus on dynamics associated with wlfs and hydrological conditions such as water flow velocity hydrologic connectivity and water residence time driven by wlfs to better adjust and protect the water environment of lake poyang credit authorship contribution statement shuoyue wang resources data curation writing original draft writing review

4472,a floodplain lake system can be described as a water conveyance type lake system that is subject to high water level fluctuations wlfs this study investigated the effects of wlf on the nutrient status and the gross primary productivity gpp of phytoplankton in lake poyang a large floodplain lake system in china this study hypothesized that wlf is the key controlling regulator of the lake s nutrient status phytoplankton growth and gpp driven by its influence on the lake s hydrological connectivity in combination with water flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters the results showed that the intra annual water levels in this lake varied from 7 61 m to 20 82 m while inter annual water levels significantly decreased throughout 1989 2018 p 0 05 except for ph most environmental variables and nutrients differed significantly each season mean gpp and chlorophyll a chl a concentration during the water rising period was clearly higher compared to the dry season wet season and falling period moreover nutrient concentration was the main determining factor of phytoplankton growth and gpp during different periods while water temperature wt also played a key role in influencing phytoplankton biomass and gpp during the water rising period there was also a direct correlation between wlf and gpp during the water rising period and wlf significantly affected nutrient concentration subsequently impacting gpp this study can benefit our overall knowledge of hydrological and ecological dynamics in floodplain lake systems while providing an important reference for policymakers in the management of dams and water quality in floodplain lake systems globally keywords water level phytoplankton primary productivity floodplain lake poyang 1 introduction in recent years eutrophication has attracted progressively more attention from the general public as well as researchers anderson et al 2014 jia et al 2019a wang et al 2019 in view of the recent occurrence of lake eutrophication in china liu et al 2010 investigated 84 of a select number of chinese lakes i e 103 lakes in total and predicted that the nutrient enrichment trend in large floodplains will continue to increase into the future phytoplankton community characteristics and primary productivity reflect the ecological and nutritional status of water bodies they are also important indicators used to evaluate the eutrophication trophic level and the overall health status of water bodies islam et al 2012 phillips et al 2013 phytoplankton growth and community characteristics control the gross primary productivity gpp of water bodies given that phytoplankton are main primary producers in many lakes jiang et al 2014 phytoplankton play a crucial role in the global carbon c cycle as well as under climate change conditions this is because the contribution of photosynthesis in aquatic environments is 50 of the global primary production pinedo gonzalez et al 2015 gpp representing phytoplankton biomass and their growth rates wang et al 2015 is sensitive to changes of nutrient and hydrological conditions wu et al 2014a it is mainly regulated by nutrient supplies such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p browning et al 2017 hagstrom and levin 2017 jia et al 2019b wilkerson et al 2015 ph jakobsen et al 2015 temperature liang et al 2017 transparency wu et al 2019 and mixing depth wu et al 2013 however water level fluctuation wlf which is emerging as an important component of hydrodynamics is a natural phenomenon that occurs in almost all aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2011 the inter annual and intra annual wlf of lakes evtimova and donohue 2016 liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 estuaries costa et al 2009 wetlands ye et al 2019 and reservoirs fadel et al 2015 li et al 2018a is important and assumed to be a key driving factor that controls phytoplankton biomass and species diversity dembowska and kubiak wojcicka 2017 fuentes and petrucio 2015 liu et al 2015a nutrients liu et al 2016 wu et al 2019 2017 underwater light conditions dembowska and kubiak wojcicka 2017 and water retention times wu et al 2014a this is because rising water levels dilute or increase lake nutrients consequently phytoplankton growth may be affected under such conditions wu et al 2013 gao et al 2020a additionally hakanson et al 2000 indicated that a decrease in water levels may lead to a significant deterioration in water quality in large subtropical lakes the lake and river floodplains are hydrologically complex and dynamic systems that exhibit high wlfs and frequent flooding and drying events li et al 2018b thomas et al 2015 moreover they have long been recognized as globally threatened ecosystems while being highly sensitive to anthropogenic intervention and climate change entwistle et al 2019 gao et al 2021 however to date little research has been conducted on the effects of wlf on the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton primary productivity in floodplains here we hypothesized that wlf is the key controlling regulator of a floodplain lake system s nutrient status and gpp and driven by its influence on its hydrological connectivity water flow velocity as well as other environmental parameters accordingly the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the spatial patterns of the phytoplankton community the gpp and the nutrient status of lake poyang 2 to determine whether the environmental factors that control gpp vary according to changes in water levels subject to different seasons of the lake 3 to ascertain wlf over the long term and its effect on nutrients within the lake results from this study will strengthen our understanding of eutrophication regulation measures in floodplains under high wlf conditions while also providing comprehensive knowledge on hydrological and ecological changes in floodplain lake systems worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites lake poyang 115 49 e 116 46 e 28 24 n 29 46 n in jiangxi province is the largest freshwater lake in china the watershed area of the lake is 1 622 105 km2 fig 1 five tributaries primarily drain into the lake namely the gan river fu river xin river rao river and xiu river which then discharge into the yangtze river from a narrow channel at the hukou gauging station to the north of the study area yao et al 2015 which can therefore be described as a water treatment inflow outflow and seasonal lake system jia et al 2019b the effect of these interactions determines the water level and its associated intra annual and inter annual variation the expansion and contraction of the lake area and droughts and floods that occur in the lake this lake experiences considerable intra annual wlfs i e 7 9 19 4 m liu et al 2015b the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1622 mm throughout the entire region under a typical warm and humid subtropical climate jin et al 2012 the rainy season is mostly concentrated from april to june accounting for between 42 and 53 of the total annual rainfall wu et al 2014a 2014b lake poyang is influenced by anthropogenic activity such as land reclamation fisheries dam construction sand excavation and transportation and it is consequently subject to serious environmental issues such as eutrophication in recent years the water body of lake poyang is in a mesotrophic state and eutrophication has occurred in some parts of the lake jia et al 2019a a total of 15 sampling sites were established in lake poyang for this study based on different geomorphic units environmental conditions spatial distribution and sampling processes fig 1 sampling sites 1 9 northwest as shown in fig 1b were established at the lake s retention area sample sites 10 14 southeast as shown in fig 1b were established at river estuaries at the point where water enters into lake poyang moreover sampling point 15 was established at the mouth of the gan river where it meets lake poyang a total of 15 sampling sites were used to analyze nutrients and chl a concentration in water samples 2 2 sample collection and analysis baseflow water samples from the 15 sampling sites were collected from a 0 to 40 cm surface water depth by means of manual sampling throughout 2017 2019 all collected water samples were immediately transferred to polyethylene plastic bottles 100 ml and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until they were transferred to the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research for chemical and biological analysis gao et al 2016 2 2 1 environment variables water level data were collected from the hukou hydrological station 114 16 e longitude 30 37 n latitude fig 1b located at the junction of lake poyang and the yangtze river which were used to determine water levels in lake poyang the data

was used to measure phosphate po4 3 and silicate sio4 4 concentration total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentration was tested using a digestion method jia and wang 2017 that employed a segmented continuous flow analyzer futura france long term 1989 2016 tn and tp concentration data from lake poyang were obtained through references chen et al 2016a 2013 hu et al 2010 jia and wang 2017 li 1996 2014 liu et al 2012 lyu 1994 wang 2007 xia and zhou 2007 yu et al 2009 2 2 3 phytoplankton phytoplankton and water samples used for chl a analysis obtained from the 15 sampling sites at a surface water depth of 0 50 cm were collected in 1000 ml 1 l and 500 ml dark polyethylene bottles using lugo s reagent fixation method and a 1 magnesium carbonate mgco3 suspension respectively from 2017 to 2019 hu and wei 2006 the phytoplankton samples sitting for 48 h were siphoned out of the supernatant leaving 60 ml of samples at the bottom then add 1 ml of formaldehyde solution and store it for laboratory test using hu and wei 2006 as a reference the species composition density and biomass of phytoplankton were determined applying the eyepiece lens of wide visual field method after vigorously shaking the concentrated and precipitated water samples 0 1 ml of the sample and 0 1 ml of the counter box were added and then carefully covered with glass following this the number of algae in each visual field and the visual field numbers were counted under a 10 and 40 microscope olympus cx41 the average values of the three parallel experiments were used to calculate the density and biomass of the samples according to huang 2000 meanwhile the species genera and phyla of phytoplankton were identified and biomass was estimated based on cell volume and number we stored chl a samples at 0 4 c under darkened conditions before they were transported to the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research and then analyzed using the hot ethanol method lorenzen 1967 water samples used for chl a analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate fiber filters the acetate fiber filters were treated for 8 h in a water bath 80 c prior to filtering the acetate fiber filters were cut and packed in glass test tubes fisher scientific after which a 10 ml 90 ethanol solution was added and extracted in a water bath pot at 75 c for 5 min following this the solution was centrifuged at 3500 r min for 10 min the extracted solution was determined using a uv 1100 spectrophotometer shanghai china the extracted solution was poured into a 1 cm colorimetric dish and absorbance values at 665 and 750 nm were determined a 1 mol l 1 hcl solution of 40 μl approx one drop was added to the 1 cm colorimetric dish containing the extracted solution after 20 min of acidification the absorbance values of the extract at 665 and 750 nm were determined respectively and the chl a concentration was calculated chen et al 2016b 2 3 data analysis in order to illustrate relationships among water levels and other factors four different time periods were used in this study fig 2 a namely the dry season ds december and january the rising period rp from february to june the wet season ws july and the falling period fp from august to november the classification of these four periods was mainly based on water level variation although the mean water level value in january 9 01 m was similar to that in february 8 99 m throughout the study period fig 2a the value in february was 0 76 m higher than that in january according to long term data from 1955 to 2011 wu et al 2014b therefore january and february were classified as different periods in this study moreover in different periods the hydrological connectivity and water flow velocity of poyang lake are different the water flow velocity of lake poyang in the rising period is relatively fast li et al 2014 and the hydrological connectivity in the wet season of lake poyang is obviously better than that

relatively wide rage 11 08 m during the rising period table 1 fig 2a as fig 2 shows all nutrient concentrations varied significantly between the four periods with p values 0 05 the different c concentration forms trended higher during the rising period and lower during the wet season while the sio4 4 concentration was highest during the falling period and lowest during the rising period fig 2b moreover the range in dtc concentration was significant namely between 11 00 and 18 62 mg l while dic and sio4 4 concentration ranged only slightly namely from 6 92 to 8 58 mg l and from 9 35 to 11 92 mg l respectively fig 2b for n tn and nh4 concentration was highest during the dry season and lowest during the rising period conversely no3 concentration was highest during the rising period fig 2c however nh4 concentration was low particularly during the rising period being close to zero fig 2c additionally dtn concentration peaked during the wet season and was lowest during the rising period fig 2c all different p concentration forms during the dry season trended higher compared to the other periods fig 2d apart from tp concentration during the dry season 1 11 mg l other concentration of the different p forms was typically below 0 30 mg l fig 2d 3 2 changes in gpp and chl a lake poyang gpp significantly differed under different wlfs fig 3 a mainly increasing during the rising period and wet season and mainly decreasing during the falling period and dry season furthermore gpp within the retention basin area was higher than the estuaries during the wet season and falling period while the opposite trend was observed during the dry season and rising period however gpp at the mouth of the gan river into lake poyang was higher during the rising period and lower during the other periods the mean gpp during the rising period 1012 11 mg m2d 1 was significantly higher compared to the wet season falling period and dry season 338 70 301 69 and 140 24 mg m2d 1 respectively the largest fluctuation 29 39 1741 04 mg m2d 1 was observed during the falling period and the highest gpp 1796 29 mg m2d 1 was observed during the rising period moreover significant variation was also observed during the wet season 26 72 1217 85 mg m2d 1 while moderate fluctuations were observed during the dry season and rising period the highest chl a concentrations in most sampling sites were observed during the rising period while the lowest were observed during the falling period and the dry season fig 3b chl a within the retention basin area was obviously higher compared to the estuaries during the wet season and chl a at the mouth of the gan river into lake poyang was higher during the rising period and lower during the other periods additionally mean chl a values during the rising period 13 38 μg l 1 were significantly higher compared to the dry season wet season and falling period 3 57 7 89 and 6 50 μg l 1 respectively chl a variation range during the falling period was small 0 56 7 81 μg l 1 while the other three periods exhibited much larger fluctuations additionally gpp and chl a showed highly significant correlations with each other p 0 01 except for the wet season p 0 01 table 3 3 3 changes in the phytoplankton community the phytoplankton community was dominated by bacillariophyta e g melosira granulata during the dry season rising period and falling period but cyanobacteria particularly oscillatoria was the dominant species during the wet season fig 4 the bacillariophyta biomass order was rising period falling period dry season wet season while the cyanobacteria biomass order was falling period wet season rising period dry season mean values of total phytoplankton biomass were significantly greater during the falling period 6 55 mg l 1 rising period 5 31 mg l 1 and wet season 4 16 mg l 1 compared to the dry season 2 12 mg l 1 additionally during the dry season fig 4a species in the class bacillariophyta dominated in almost all sites accounting for 67 of the total biomass with sampling site 9 having the highest overall bacillariophyta biomass 8 25 mg l 1 during the rising period fig 4b total biomass ranged between 0 99 and 17 38 mg l 1 with sampling site 14 having the highest overall bacillariophyta biomass 13 99 mg l 1 cyanophyta biomass increased dramatically from the rising period 0 27 mg l 1 to the wet season 1 89 mg l 1 fig 4c later cyanophyta 45 54 became the dominant species during the wet season followed by bacillariophyta 22 19 the proportion of cyanophyta within the basin retention area was distinctly lower than the estuary areas during the wet season during the falling period fig 4d phytoplankton biomass at most sampling sites was higher than 6 mg l 1 and significantly varied from 0 99 to 14 80 mg l 1 which accounted for a similar proportion of bacillariophyta 31 56 and cyanophyta 29 38 moreover during the dry season and falling period phytoplankton biomass significantly correlated to gpp and chl a p 0 05 table 3 3 4 changes in environmental variables three trophic levels including mesotrophic 30 tli 50 lightly eutrophic 50 tli 60 and intermediately eutrophic 60 tli 70 were present in lake poyang throughout all periods fig 5 during the dry season trophic levels were lightly eutrophic and intermediately eutrophic 55 tli 68 which was obviously more severe compared to the other three periods 38 tli 56 namely mesotrophic and lightly eutrophic the mean tli during the dry season was 61 i e intermediately eutrophic which was significantly higher compared to the values from the three other periods 46 49 mesotrophic during the dry season and falling period the trophic levels of the basin retention area were distinctly less severe light compared to the estuaries and the mouth of the gan river into lake poyang nevertheless the trophic levels of the estuaries were apparently less severe lighter compared to the other areas during the wet season 4 discussion 4 1 long term wlf effects on the nutrient status of lake poyang in recent decades lake poyang has experienced dramatic hydrological changes and these changes have resulted in significant hydrological biological ecological and economic consequences in the region liu et al 2013 our results showed that the inter annual wlf of lake poyang is considerable particularly the maximum annual water level fig 6 a additionally m k test results on long term wlfs 1989 2018 showed that the annual maximum water level z 2 31 p 0 05 and the mean water level z 3 14 p 0 01 have significantly decreased over the last 30 years table 3 numerous studies have been published on long term wlf effects for example zhang et al 2017 reported that since the 1950 s lake poyang water levels have exhibited a weak declining trend on the whole but since 2003 lake poyang has experienced extreme dry periods over many years feng et al 2012 2015 reported on the inter annual and intra annual characteristics of lake poyang flooding between 2000 and 2010 and they found a statistically significant decline in mean annual and minimum flooded areas concerning climatic forcing zhao et al 2010 demonstrated that annual precipitation increased but was statistically insignificant while potential evaporation decreased significantly in lake poyang and the annual streamflow into the lake increased from the 1950 s to 2003 the bathymetry of lake poyang varied considerably due to natural erosion deposition cycles and anthropogenic activities e g land reclamation lake reclamation sand mining etc over the last few decades lai et al 2014 wu et al 2015 nutrient accumulation processes caused by wlfs within a floodplain can be counterbalanced by the relocation of nutrients such as uptake by algae and drift into the main river channel tockner et al 1999 gao and yu 2020 results from our study also indicated that tn concentration exhibited an increasing trend between 1989 and 2018 fig 6b it has been speculated that an increase in pollution from cities farmland and anthropogenic activities may have caused this detected increase in nutrients furthermore between 1989 and 1998 the annual maximum water level was negatively corelated to tp concentration p 0 05 moreover between 1999 and 2008 and between 1989 and 2018 annual mean water levels also exhibited a negative correlation to tn concentration p 0 05 table 2 given that high water levels dilute nutrients in water years with higher water levels will have lower nutrient concentration wu et al 2006 reported that tn no3 and nh4 concentrations have been higher by an approximate factor of two to three during periods of low water levels compared to periods of high water levels in certain lakes wu et al 2013 observed that between 2009 and 2011 dtn and dtp concentration in lake poyang increased from 1 18 to 1 74 and from 0 034 to 0 060 mg l 1 respectively 4 2 seasonal wlf effects on gpp in our study we observed that the main factors that determine phytoplankton growth and gpp varied alongside lake poyang water levels during the different periods investigated the main factors were nutrients wt and water levels through principal component analysis of environmental factors we found that the first two principal components described 30 23 and 25 01 of the environmental variation respectively fig 7 among them the environmental variables highly correlated with the first principal component were tp and wt with the loadings of 45 12 and 42 97 table 4 fig 7 which mainly represented the characteristics of climate and nutrients the environmental variables highly correlated with the second principal component were doc and dtc and the loadings reached 55 25 and 52 41 table 4 fig 7 which mainly represented the carbon level of water body many studies have found that nutrient concentration plays a critical role in phytoplankton growth and gpp jia et al 2019b seekell et al 2015 as fig 8 a shows during the dry season sio4 4 concentration was negatively and significantly correlated to phytoplankton biomass and density the phytoplankton community was dominated by diatom during the dry season rising period and falling period fig 4 moreover the tli of the dry season was the highest and most areas of lake poyang reached intermediately eutrophic index fig 5 silicate being a necessary diatom requirement closely controls the structure and metabolism of cells lu et al 2021 2020 thus silicate may also regulate phytoplankton growth processes and subsequently affect primary productivity gao et al 2016 ke et al 2014 moreover tn dtn and no3 were inversely and significantly correlated to gpp during the dry season fig 8a during the rising period phytoplankton gpp was highly significant and positively correlated to dtc doc and dic concentration fig 8b the level of inorganic c will affect the chemical element composition within algae subsequently affecting the nutritional structure of algae zhang et al 2015 further inorganic c could alter the competitive advantage of phytoplankton and affects its community structure some studies also found that doc concentration has a significant effect on phytoplankton gpp in lakes jia et al 2020 seekell et al 2015 furthermore we found highly significant p 0 01 and negative correlations between gpp and dtn dtp po4 3 during the rising period fig 8b this may be due to the fact that dissolved nutrient elements are more easily absorbed and utilized by phytoplankton during the wet season only nh4 concentration was correlated to gpp p 0 01 and only no3 concentration was correlated to phytoplankton biomass p 0 01 fig 8c similarly during the falling period tp was the only nutrient factor that explained phytoplankton gpp dynamics p 0 05 fig 8d pan et al 2009 found that tp was positively correlated to chl a in lakes connected to the yangtze river although the correlation was weaker compared to lakes not connected to the river our previous study also found that tp played a critical role in determining phytoplankton species composition in lake poyang during the wet season and dry season wang et al 2020 additionally during the falling period tp dtp po4 3 concentration was negatively correlated p 0 05 to phytoplankton biomass while nh4 dtn concentration was positively correlated p 0 01 to phytoplankton biomass fig 8d however wu et al 2013 reported that dtn and dtp concentration was both positively and significantly correlated to the phytoplankton biomass of the major groups furthermore wt also plays a key role in phytoplankton biomass and gpp during the rising period in lake poyang the relationship between wt and phytoplankton biomass and gpp was highly significant and inversely correlated during the rising period whereby correlation coefficients were both higher than 0 50 p 0 01 fig 8b zhang et al 2018 reported that wt was a principal parameter that dominated the contemporary diatom assemblage wu et al 2019 observed that wt significantly contributed to explaining chl a concentration during the falling period and wet season in lake poyang to a certain extent phytoplankton species composition determines the effect of temperature on algae diatoms were inversely correlated to temperature and they occurred preferentially at temperatures below 18 c while being directly correlated to higher discharge and a deeper mixing layer da silva et al 2005 wang et al 2011 furthermore the underwater light condition is important to phytoplankton growth providing energy for photosynthesis the strong vertical mixing of water reduces the transparency and leads to a decrease in light availability which results in low phytoplankton biomass and productivity ho et al 2010 our study found that water levels had a significant effect on phytoplankton gpp and environmental parameters we hypothesized that the wlf influences hydrological connectivity water flow velocity and other environmental parameters which subsequently affects the nutrient status phytoplankton growth and gpp water levels were significantly negatively correlated to gpp during the rising period p 0 05 fig 8b the water flow velocity was relatively fast approx 0 80 m s 1 li et al 2014 which was generally consistent to the wlf during the rising period liu et al 2015b generally elevated flow velocities inhibit phytoplankton growth valdes weaver et al 2006 furthermore when water levels are high the hydrological connectivity of lake poyang was significant as was the close exchange between materials energy and biology however during periods when water levels are low the hydrological connectivity of lake poyang was poor given that greater than 100 separate sub lakes appear hu et al 2019 therefore fluctuations in water flow velocity and hydrological connectivity alongside wlfs as well as the combination of water levels generally resulted in a negative correlation between water levels and gpp wu et al 2013 reported that due to wlfs and its complex shape the hydrology of lake poyang is highly variable which may affect phytoplankton community composition additionally the underwater light condition is critical for algae growth providing energy for photosynthesis moreover water flow may cause sediment resuspension which in turn would lead to low light conditions in lake poyang wu et al 2013 significant wlfs in lake poyang also play a key role in their impact on nutrients such as c n p and silicon si which subsequently influences phytoplankton growth and gpp for example doc was negatively and significantly correlated to water level during the dry season p 0 05 fig 8a dtc and doc were both negatively and significantly correlated to water level during the rising period fig 8b nh4 and dtn also exhibited significant inverse relationships with water level during the falling period fig 8d however during all four periods tp or po4 3 was significantly positively correlated to water levels liu et al 2016 found a positive relationship between water level and po4 p concentration r2 0 36 which was consistent with our results in particular positive relationships between water level and tn 0 99 tp 0 90 and sio4 4 0 77 were typically observed during the wet season fig 8c during the wet season under conditions of significant hydrological connectivity nutrients were frequently exchanged among rivers and lakes which may result in positive relationships moreover the water level had an extremely significant and positive relationship with wt during the dry season p 0 01 fig 8a due to the fact that variations in wt are roughly the same as variations in water levels previous studies have often neglected the wt effect in lake poyang wu et al 2019 our results showed that the phytoplankton community was dominated by bacillariophyta except during the wet season qian et al 2017 indicated that changes in environmental parameters related to wlfs caused variations in diatom biomass and community composition in lake poyang bacillariophyta occurred preferentially at lower temperatures da silva et al 2005 wang et al 2011 however cyanophyta can adapt well to low flow velocity and higher temperature conditions qian et al 2016 sun et al 2019 therefore cyanobacteria dominated during the wet season under slower water flow velocities and higher wts although high temperatures are typically accompanied by high transparency and high light intensity during the summer phytoplankton biomass was lower during the wet season and this was mainly due to dilution and washout effects qian et al 2017 wu et al 2013 concerning the eutrophication status liu et al 2014 confirmed that the degree of eutrophication under high water levels was lower than that of low water levels in their study on lake poyang which was consistent with our results similar phenomena have also occurred in lake dongting which is another lake connected to the yangtze river where a rise in water levels also played a role in the dilution of nutrients within the lake thus reducing the degree of eutrophication within the lake wang et al 2012 miao et al 2020 5 perspective understanding how the overall role of hydrologic dynamics driven by wlfs in lake poyang impacts phytoplankton growth and gpp can help us to clarify relationships between dams and phytoplankton yang et al 2012 in this study nutrients and water temperatures wts were found to be the main determining factors of phytoplankton growth and gpp in lake poyang during the four different periods investigated and wlfs can directly affect gpp while also affecting nutrients through their influence on hydrological connectivity water flow velocity and other environmental parameters which subsequently influences the nutrient status of phytoplankton growth and gpp in lake poyang as well as other such floodplain lakes according to the government authorities of jiangxi province the proposed poyang dam will only be used to contain water that normally returns back to the yangtze river during the dry season li 2011 this policy reveals a scenario of using a dam to conserve water during times when water levels in lake poyang are typically falling the operation of the proposed poyang dam will keep the water level above 14 m from september to october and 12 m from november to march which will result in a more extensive water surface area a longer water residence time better hydrological connectivity lower water flow velocity and higher water transparency during the falling period and dry season in lake poyang the hydrological condition of lake poyang may reduce potential impacts of nutrient and algae washout as well as cause the direct release of nutrients that accumulate throughout the dry season de domitrovic 2003 which may facilitate phytoplankton growth and gpp in lake poyang moreover cyanobacteria can adapt well to slow flow velocity and warm wts therefore this may have the effect of increasing the biomass of cyanophyta and its duration as the dominant algae qian et al 2016 consequently local managers should focus on dynamics associated with wlfs and hydrological conditions such as water flow velocity hydrologic connectivity and water residence time driven by wlfs to better adjust and protect the water environment of lake poyang credit authorship contribution statement shuoyue wang resources data curation writing original draft writing review

4473,sulfonamide antibiotics sas are commonly used antibiotic classes in livestock worldwide sas are discharged to the environment and then may accumulate in rivers and aquifers thereby diminishing water quality and the overall health of the ecosystem while the occurrence and distribution of sas in water environments have been the subject of numerous investigations the fate and transport of sas in aquifers have been less understood in the present work four of the most used sas including sulfadiazine sdz sulfathiazole stz sulfamethazine sm2 and sulfamethoxazole smx were selected for laboratory experiments and modeling analysis the experiments were conducted in saturated columns filled with two common porous media quartz sands and limestone grains results showed that the sas had mobility changing on the order from high to low of smx sm2 sdz stz in the column with smx being the least absorbed sa by quartz sand or limestone grains moreover calcium ionsinhibited the transport of sas more strongly than that of sodium ions while the inhibitory effect was slightly enhanced with an increasing na concentration from 0 to 10 mm in contrast the presence of humic acid facilitated the transport of sas although the four sas have similar molecular structures their adsorption and transport characteristics were shown to be quite different the dynamics of the adsorption and transport of sas in groundwater can be effectively described by a two site adsorption model coupled with advection and dispersion this study sheds new light on the transport of sas contributing to a better understanding of how to control the presence and migration of antibiotics as new emerging contaminants in groundwater keywords sulfonamide antibiotics contaminant transport adsorption emerging contaminant 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics sas are a class of broad spectrum synthetic antibiotics that have been widely used to treat human gastrointestinal respiratory and urinary tract infections for more than senventy years boxall et al 2004 sas are also widely used in livestock agriculture ma et al 2016 and are excreted by livestock into the environment le page et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 endangering the ecosystem and human health carvalho and santos 2016 ben et al 2020 because most of the sas exist as anions and neutral species under neutral ph conditions sas are poorly adsorbed by common soil colloids in addition the hydrolyzability of sas is less than 20 and negatively correlated with ph and less than 10 under neutral conditions białk bielińska et al 2012 therefore the two dissipation mechanisms adsorption and hydrolysis cannot effectively remove sas sas thus enter groundwater through surface infiltration following irrigation or rainfall events this infiltration process is accompanied by natural elimination such as adsorption and redox reactions and advection and hydrodynamic dispersion within the groundwater flow sas may eventually return to surface water because groundwater interacts with surface water bodies green et al 2005 due to their resistance to degradation sas are one of the most detectable antibiotics in environment components including surface water 0 01 12 μg l 1 and groundwater 0 01 1 11 μg l 1 barnes et al 2008 baran et al 2011 spielmeyer et al 2017 deng et al 2018 notably groundwater serves as the main drinking water source in large parts of the world and is therefore crucial to water security and public health alley 2002 in addition groundwater is difficult to treat once it is contaminated and thus sas pollution in groundwater has prompted substantial concern physicochemical conditions e g applied mass and flow rate ph and dissolved organic matter and the properties of aquifer materials e g clay minerals have been found to affect the fate of antibiotics in groundwater halling sørensen et al 2003 thiele bruhn 2003 karcı and balcıoğlu 2009 schauss et al 2009 some factors facilitate the transport of sas while some inhibit it for instance unold et al 2010 found that a higher concentration input can lead to lower sulfadiazine retardation in soil and preferential flow caused the sa breakthrough curve to have a long late time tail and a shifted peak kay et al 2005 conducted a lysimeter experiment where the results indicated that clay effectively inhibited the migration of antibiotics in addition to clay carbonate rocks i e limestone and dolomite and gravel sand also constitute a significant portion of large volume groundwater aquifers throughout the world salehi et al 2008 esfandyari bayat et al 2015 wang et al 2018 furthermore the divalent calcium cation ca2 was found to inhibit tetracycline transport by increasing humic acid aggregation and enhancing electrostatic attraction cheng et al 2016 however the influence of electrolyte solutions and organic matter on the transport of sas is poorly understood this is however necessary to support the formulation of cost effective measures for the protection of groundwater from sa pollution in the present study four of the most commonly detected sas including sulfadiazine sdz sulfathiazole stz sulfamethazine sm2 and sulfamethoxazole smx qiu et al 2019 were selected to investigate their adsorption process through batch experiments and to explore their different transport behaviors in column experiments all four sas were present simultaneously in the system in a typical surface water related concentration of 10 μg l 1 the aim of this study was to identify the transport mechanisms of these four sas under different physicochemical conditions in the presence of humic acid ha and various cations a numerical transport model was used to better describe and quantify the transport characteristics of sas due to different subsurface environmental factors 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals stz 99 cas 72 14 0 and sm2 99 cas 57 68 1 were purchased from aladdin shanghai china and sdz 99 cas 68 35 9 and smx 99

aggregation before use 2 2 porous media pure quartz sand sio2 99 8 was purchased from shiling corporation guangxi china limestone grains were purchased from huayu trading co ltd guangzhou china both quartz sand and limestone grains were sieved to obtain particles with a specific diameter range of 0 5 to 0 7 mm for further use the median grain diameter d 50 of the two media were both 0 6 mm and their uniformity indices were both 1 1 quartz sand was successively treated with deionized water 10 nitric acid v v and ultrapure water to remove organic impurities and metallic compounds limestone grains were washed with ultrapure water to remove impurities then both quartz sand and limestone grains were oven dried overnight at 105 c and stored under nitrogen until use the surface appearance composition and specific surface area ssa of the quartz sand and limestone grains were assayed the methods and results of these assays are given in supplementary material text s4 2 3 batch adsorption experiments all the experiments were conducted in 100 ml brown glass bottles at the initial ph of 7 0 considering that quartz sand also known as silica sand constitutes a significant portion of aquifers that store substantial groundwater resources salehi et al 2008 esfandyari bayat et al 2015 wang et al 2018 and has no other impurities such as calcium ions in limestone interference quartz sand was selected for the batch experiment to better explain the adsorption mechanism of sas the subsequent experiments were done under the same conditions except that quartz sand was replaced by limestone containing less silica to further explore the impact of adsorption on sa transport dynamics the adsorption experiments were started by mixing quartz sand 2 00 g with sas mixture solutions 50 ml which were performed with all four antibiotics added simultaneously five solutions of the mixture of stz sm2 sdz and smx were prepared with the concentration of 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively the bottles containing the solutions were placed in a thermostatic oscillation incubator spx 250 b d shanghai boxun industrial co ltd at 150 r min 1 and 22 5 c and stored in darkness sample aliquots 1 ml of the supernatants of individual samples were taken at 0 5 1 2 4 6 10 16 24 48 and 72 h respectively and each sample was passed through a 0 22 µm syringe filter pes millipore a blank control and three parallel samples were also made for use in the analysis to account for any experimental error sas in the filtered samples were quantified by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry lc qqq ms ms 1290 6470 agilent co usa 2 4 column experiments the setup for the column transport experiment is shown in fig 1 and text s1 the bespoke plexiglass columns had an internal diameter of 5 cm and a length of 30 cm and were covered with black tape to block light the columns were set to run in upflow mode to ensure that the porous medium was in continuous contact with the solute and was thus saturated throughout the experiment a constant water flow velocity of 0 3 ml min 1 was maintained by use of a peristaltic pump labv1 mc6 channel 10 roller pump head baoding shenchen pump co ltd which enabled the connection of a maximum of six tubes at a time the initial ph was 7 0 0 1 for the first set of experiments two columns were filled as uniformly as possible with quartz sand and limestone grains with the porosity of 0 35 0 01 and 0 46 0 01 respectively at the same flowrate of 0 3 ml min 1 the pore water velocities were 0 62 m day 1 and 0 48 m day 1 in the quartz sand and limestone columns respectively these velocities were probably close to the upper limit of real world natural gradient groundwater velocity i e for a gravel sandy aquifer but were common under forced gradient experimental conditions e g scheutz et al 2008 pure water as the background solution as shown in fig 1 was input for 5 pvs then the influent switched to sas solution a second set of experiments was conducted to examine the effect of the background solution on the transport characteristics of sas limestone grains were used because the difference in the breakthrough curves btcs of the sas through this porous medium was more pronounced than the quartz sand column the background solutions used in the three limestone columns were 0 5 mm of cacl2 1 5 mm of nacl and 10 mm of nacl all four sas were mixed and dissolved into the background solution and pumped into the three columns to determine the effects of cation type and ionic strength on the transport process of sas in addition in another limestone column 10 mg l 1 ha was the background solution and sas were mixed with the background solution pumped into the column this experiment was to explore the effect of humic acid on sas migration all the test solutions were mixtures of the four sas with the concentration of 0 01 mg l 1 for each sa the sa source was injected for a pulse of 1 4 pore volumes pvs 1 pv is 206 06 ml in the quartz sand column and 270 83 ml in the limestone gains column followed by 5 pvs of sa free background solution each column was pre equilibrated with 10 pvs of its own background solution before a transport experiment was commenced a fraction collector bs 100a huxi china was used to collect effluent samples at pre specified times conservative tracer transport tests were performed using a 100 mg l 1 nabr solution to determine column performance and water flow characteristics to obtain breakthrough tracer curves btcs bromide ion concentrations were determined by ion chromatography on a thermo scientific aquion ic dionex co usa and the sa concentrations were quantified by lc qqq ms 1290 6470 agilent co usa a comparison of the

provided in text s2 2 6 transport model previous studies have shown that the flow rate affects the adsorption of sdz and thus its transport unold et al 2010 fan et al 2011 found that the chemical nonequilibrium two site sorption model well fitted the results of batch and miscible displacement experiments conducted to investigate the migration of sm2 in four types of soil given the influence of flow rate on the migration of sas analyzed in text s3 shown by fig s3 a chemical nonequilibrium model was selected to simulate the dynamic characteristics of sa transport we used a one dimensional transport model to analyze the experimental results and quantify the transport characteristics of sas in the test columns and the kinetic interactions between the solutes and the porous medium the transport model is based on the advection dispersion equation coupled with two site freundlich sorption the governing equation can be written as follows van genuchten and wagenet 1989 1 c t ρ θ s 1 t ρ θ s 2 t d 2 c z 2 v c z where c is the concentration of sas in the aqueous phase ml 3 t is the time t ρ is the bulk density of the porous medium ml 3 θ is the volumetric water content dimensionless d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 z is the vertical spatial coordinate l v is the velocity of pore water lt 1 and s 1 mm 1 and s 2 are the sa concentrations in the solid phase with respect to sorption site 1 and site 2 respectively the sorption in site 1 is instantaneous and site 2 has time dependent kinetic ssoprtion with the following rate equations equilibrium model for site

optimization routine the remaining parameters ρ θ d and v were derived from the experimental conditions table s4 the degree of model fitting was represented by the r2 statistics of the inverse solution text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption the batch adsorption experiments generally showed that smx sdz and sm2 exhibited high equilibrium concentrations with the medium exhibiting varying adsorption capacity of these compounds after 4 h stz was the most retained one with the lowest equilibrium concentration in the quartz sand column and it had a mass recovery rate of 0 85 fig 2 a and table s2 the results of the batch adsorption experiment were fitted with the freundlich adsorption isotherm fig 2b fig s4 and table s3 and the adsorption kinetics of the sas on quartz sand could be described by a pseudo second order model with an r 2 0 9 fig s2 kf the adsorption equilibrium constant followed the order from low to high of smx sm2 sdz stz similar to the order smx sm2 sulfachloropyridazine stz reported by leal et al 2013 for soils from brazil the adsorption constant kf obtained by data fitting was small table 2 demonstrating that quartz sand has a low adsorption capacity for the four antibiotics generally all the four sas exhibited a relatively low adsorption affinity in terms of the chemical structure sas only have the anilino group but no other functional groups that can form multiple adsorption mechanisms hu et al 2019 for a given ph the fraction of anionic sas α can be estimated by the value of pk a2 table 1 using the following equation snoeyink and jenkins 1980 4 α a c t a a h a a 1 1 1 10 p h p k a 2 where ct a is the number of moles of species containing sas ha is the concentration of non ionized sas and a is the concentration of anionic sas under neutral ph experimental conditions the portions of anionic α stz smx sdz and sm2 calculated by eq 4 were 38 65 87 37 81 36 and 28 45 respectively the previous study showed that the more anions there are in an aqueous solution the greater electrostatic repulsion it has on the negatively charged solid medium surface białk bielińska et al 2012 this results in decreased adsorption of such a compound and thus an increase in its migration ability this was consistent with the observed adsorption order from the lowest to the highest α of stz sdz smx interestingly although α for stz 38 65 was greater than α for sm2 28 45 the migration capacity of stz was lower than that of sm2 this was mainly due to the spatial steric resistance of sm2 adsorbed with soil being greater than that of stz which is attributable to the different substituents on sm2 and stz zhou et al 2016 as considerably different interaction mechanisms seem to be involved in antibiotic adsorption and k oc table 1 cannot account for the variation due to non hydrophobic interactions tolls 2001 k oc does account for the adsorption transport behavior of sas in general the presence of one compound may reduce the adsorption of another compound conkle et al 2010 thereby affecting the behavior of different environmental components downstream e g groundwater sediment surface water white et al 2011 the results of the experiment using the mixture of four sas also showed that when multiple sas were present stz was more easily adsorbed by quartz sand than the other three sas and thus stz might have a greater effect on sediment sorption for smx however its adsorption was so low that can be ignored when modeled with the advection diffusion equation ma et al 2019 while its strong mobility may cause greater effect on downstream sediments than the other sas 3 2 effect of porous medium type the surface of the quartz sand was smoother than that of the limestone grains according to the scanning electron microscopy sem analysis fig 3 a and b the ssa of the limestone grains was 0 3 m2g 1 five times greater than that of the quartz sand 0 06 m2g 1 except for stz the btcs of the sas in the quartz sand column were symmetric and peaked rapidly and then decreased showing a low degree of late time tailing however the btcs of the sas in the limestone grain medium were asymmetric peaked after a time lag and exhibited tailing fig 4 the asymmetric btcs with a late tie tailing can be quantified by either the two zone physical process model i e physical mass exchange between the mobile and immobile domains or the two site chemically nonequilibrium transport model i e multiple chemical adsorption with mixed instantaneous and kinetic adsorption sites warrick 2002 in our experiments the btcs of the conservative tracer bromide ion in quartz sand and limestone grains were both symmetric fig s1 and could be successfully described by the classical advection dispersion equation this suggested that the characteristics of the sa btcs were caused by a chemical nonequilibrium process rather than a physical nonequilibrium process the difference in sa transport behaviors in the quartz and limestone columns is mainly due to the different surface areas and charges in the two porous media liao et al 2016 in that the rougher surface and larger ssa of the limestone grains provided more favorable sites for the adsorption of sas the mass recovery rate of the four sas in the quartz sand was higher than that in the limestone grains this might be related to the low concentration of impurities in the limestone grains facilitating the adsorption of sas however their differences in mass recovery rates were not significant suggesting that the retention of sas in both media was not significant this is mainly due to the large electrostatic repulsion between sa molecules and the negatively charged medium grains moreover the x ray diffraction xrd analysis showed that the quartz sand consisted almost entirely of quartz while the limestone grains contained a high proportion of calcium and a low proportion of other metallic elements magnesium aluminum and iron fig 3c and 3d therefore the limestone grains may have released a small amount of ca2 thereby enhancing the surface charge screening fan et al 2015 between sas and the limestone grains and leading to the asymmetric btcs of sas the cationic effect on the btcs was not observed in the btc of smx which is discussed further in section 3 3 the experimental results depicted in fig 4 show that the btcs of the four sas peaked at 1 7 pv in quartz sand and 2 pv in limestone grains implying rapid transport which are inconsistent with the delayed peak observed in natural soil in reference unold et al 2010 this discrepancy may be due to the subsurface porous media in the field being more heterogeneous and containing various active sorption sites based on the typical characteristics of btcs obtained from the experiments we found that the two site freundlich sorption model described sa btcs in the limestone grains well with r 2 0 98 table 3 in the quartz sand the two site model could be simplified by the one site equilibrium model only kf and β were needed in the simplified model to simulate the transport process of sas the successful application of this model lays the foundation for further study on the adsorption of sas in saturated porous media 3 3 effects of electrolyte solution the observed and calculated btcs of sas transported in the limestone media under different electrolyte solutions are plotted in fig 5 the results showed that both the type and concentration of cations influenced the mobility of the sas notably when nacl was used as the electrolyte the mass recovery decreased slightly as the nacl concentration increased from 1 5 mm to 10 mm fig 5b 5c resulting in reduced mobility of sdz and sm2 in the column in contrast 0 5 mm of cacl2 with the same ionic strength 1 5 mm nacl significantly increased the adsorption affinity of sas by the porous medium as shown in fig 6 ca2 obviously enhanced the adsorption of stz sdz and sm2 by decreasing their mass recovery rates below 0 8 while the impact of ca2 on smx s adsorption is much weaker according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory the presence of electrolytes can reduce electrostatic repulsion derjaguin and landau 1993 several previous studies have shown that cationic bridging is an important mechanism in electronegative particle deposition dong et al 2017 pham et al 2009 furthermore ca2 has been found to neutralize negative charges on the limestone surface more effectively than na lv et al 2018 this may explain why the adsorption of sas was greater in the cacl2 solution than that in the nacl solution with the same ionic strength i e there was stronger electrostatic attraction between the absorbent particles and the sas in the presence of cacl2 due to ca2 more effectively quenching the negative charge on the particles in addition the contribution of inorganic colloidal impurities in the limestone to sas migration cannot be excluded cheng et al 2016 showed that ca2 can reduce the movement of colloids carrying contaminants and thereby enhance their adsorption and deposition however for smx due to its strong electrostatic repulsion with the limestone grains adding the cations with the experimental concentrations cannot neutralize the excessive negative charges in the solution and hence the addition of cations has no obvious effect on smx migration in general the simulation results corroborated the significance of the electrolyte in the transport of sas in the limestone media as the r2 values were 0 97 fig 5 table 3 in general the experimental group containing the electrolyte solution showed an increase of kf compared to the pure water blank control group indicating that the presence of a cation increased the adsorption of sas in particular for sdz and sm2 increasing na increased the fraction of equilibrium sites coefficient f of instantaneous adsorption and hence the mass recovery rate decreased in addition at the same ionic strength in the electrolyte solution e g 1 5 mm nacl and 0 50 mm cacl2 the values of α2 of sas in nacl were lower than those in cacl2 implying less chemical mass transfer between the solid and aqueous phases than that in cacl2 this reflected the fact that ca2 was more effective than na in enhancing the association of sas in the limestone solid phase the kf in pure water limestone grains was respectively large and small for stz and smx so that their transport was not obviously affected by na and ca2 and it was difficult to evaluate the parameter changes under these conditions 3 4 effect of humic acid humic acid ha enhanced the mobility of the sas resulting in an earlier peak in the btcs and the increased peak c c0 value fig 6 although it did not increase the mass recovery of stz the presence of ha increased the negative charge in the solution making it more difficult for sas to be adsorbed similarly zhang et al 2010 concluded that tetracycline was preferentially bound to the colloidal moieties of ha e g carboxyl and phenolic groups and remained in the aqueous phase due to h bonding interactions moreover because of its hydrophobic and non polar fractions ha has been shown to compete with sas for adsorption sites and have a strong affinity for limestone surfaces kretzschmar 1999 previous studies have illustrated that ha molecules adsorbed on a medium surface acts as a masking agent and preferentially occupies attachment sites wang et al 2012 xia et al 2017 which may disturb the interaction between sas and limestone media and hence facilitate the transport of sas in addition it has been found that non polar ha molecules are more likely to be adsorbed on the solid surface resulting in less ha molecules in the aqueous phase to form the contaminant ha chefetz et al 2008 at the same time ha has been shown to complexate with calcium ions in limestone zhou et al 2005 but sas was difficult to complexate with calcium ions further preventing the adsorption of sas by limestone advection dispersion coupled with a two site adsorption model was able to simulate the btcs of sas in the presence of ha the model simulations also matched the experimental btcs of the sas with ha very well with r 2 values 0 98 fig 6 table 3 the best fit kf values for sas transported in the limestone media decreased when ha was present table 3 the calculation results showed that fkf and α2 values were low for sas transported with ha at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 indicating that the presence of ha weakened both the instantaneous adsorption and the kinetic processes of sas in limestone gains these results further demonstrated that ha can substantially facilitate the migration of sas in limestone grains in particular the fitted parameters of stz were less affected than those of the other three sas when 10 mg l 1 of ha was present indicating that 10 mg l 1 of ha has little effect on the adsorption of stz although the simulation results matched the experimental data well the model results may not be reliable if there were excessive parameterization overall the degree of change of adsorption enhancement or weakening was different for the four sas which was strongly associated sa molecular structures and medium properties conde cid et al 2019 since the four sas were mixed with the same concentration under different background solution conditions in the experiments one solution condition may influence the adsorption of some sas without obviously affecting the other sas this discrepancy can be identified by comparing the best fit model parameters the control mechanism is mainly the electrostatic interaction between the sa molecules and the medium under a certain background 4 conclusions this study monitored and quantified the fate and transport behavior of sas in porous media under various physicochemical conditions where the concentrations of sas in the experiments were typically found in groundwater the four sas had mobilities in the order from high to low of smx sm2 sdz stz with smx being barely absorbed and thus posing a greater risk to groundwater quality than the other sas the results showed that the fate of the four sas examined in this study was influenced by the type of porous media i e surface area and surface charge and sa migration in limestone grains was more complex than that in the quartz sand column notably ca2 inhibited the transport of sas more strongly than na and ha promoted the transport of sas which further suggests that hydrochemical factors such as ionic strength ionic type and ha concentration influence the adsorption and transport dynamics of sas in saturated porous media in addition the dynamics of adsorption and transport of sas in groundwater was effectively simulated using a two site adsorption model by fitting the data observed in the column experiments this study led to a better mechanistic understanding of critical factors that control the fate and transport of sas in porous media an important and environmentally ubiquitous class of antibiotics that are emerging contaminants in aquifers our findings will contribute to the development of effective strategies for protecting groundwater from sas credit authorship contribution

4473,sulfonamide antibiotics sas are commonly used antibiotic classes in livestock worldwide sas are discharged to the environment and then may accumulate in rivers and aquifers thereby diminishing water quality and the overall health of the ecosystem while the occurrence and distribution of sas in water environments have been the subject of numerous investigations the fate and transport of sas in aquifers have been less understood in the present work four of the most used sas including sulfadiazine sdz sulfathiazole stz sulfamethazine sm2 and sulfamethoxazole smx were selected for laboratory experiments and modeling analysis the experiments were conducted in saturated columns filled with two common porous media quartz sands and limestone grains results showed that the sas had mobility changing on the order from high to low of smx sm2 sdz stz in the column with smx being the least absorbed sa by quartz sand or limestone grains moreover calcium ionsinhibited the transport of sas more strongly than that of sodium ions while the inhibitory effect was slightly enhanced with an increasing na concentration from 0 to 10 mm in contrast the presence of humic acid facilitated the transport of sas although the four sas have similar molecular structures their adsorption and transport characteristics were shown to be quite different the dynamics of the adsorption and transport of sas in groundwater can be effectively described by a two site adsorption model coupled with advection and dispersion this study sheds new light on the transport of sas contributing to a better understanding of how to control the presence and migration of antibiotics as new emerging contaminants in groundwater keywords sulfonamide antibiotics contaminant transport adsorption emerging contaminant 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics sas are a class of broad spectrum synthetic antibiotics that have been widely used to treat human gastrointestinal respiratory and urinary tract infections for more than senventy years boxall et al 2004 sas are also widely used in livestock agriculture ma et al 2016 and are excreted by livestock into the environment le page et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 endangering the ecosystem and human health carvalho and santos 2016 ben et al 2020 because most of the sas exist as anions and neutral species under neutral ph conditions sas are poorly adsorbed by common soil colloids in addition the hydrolyzability of sas is less than 20 and negatively correlated with ph and less than 10 under neutral conditions białk bielińska et al 2012 therefore the two dissipation mechanisms adsorption and hydrolysis cannot effectively remove sas sas thus enter groundwater through surface infiltration following irrigation or rainfall events this infiltration process is accompanied by natural elimination such as adsorption and redox reactions and advection and hydrodynamic dispersion within the groundwater flow sas may eventually return to surface water because groundwater interacts with surface water bodies green et al 2005 due to their resistance to degradation sas are one of the most detectable antibiotics in environment components including surface water 0 01 12 μg l 1 and groundwater 0 01 1 11 μg l 1 barnes et al 2008 baran et al 2011 spielmeyer et al 2017 deng et al 2018 notably groundwater serves as the main drinking water source in large parts of the world and is therefore crucial to water security and public health alley 2002 in addition groundwater is difficult to treat once it is contaminated and thus sas pollution in groundwater has prompted substantial concern physicochemical conditions e g applied mass and flow rate ph and dissolved organic matter and the properties of aquifer materials e g clay minerals have been found to affect the fate of antibiotics in groundwater halling sørensen et al 2003 thiele bruhn 2003 karcı and balcıoğlu 2009 schauss et al 2009 some factors facilitate the transport of sas while some inhibit it for instance unold et al 2010 found that a higher concentration input can lead to lower sulfadiazine retardation in soil and preferential flow caused the sa breakthrough curve to have a long late time tail and a shifted peak kay et al 2005 conducted a lysimeter experiment where the results indicated that clay effectively inhibited the migration of antibiotics in addition to clay carbonate rocks i e limestone and dolomite and gravel sand also constitute a significant portion of large volume groundwater aquifers throughout the world salehi et al 2008 esfandyari bayat et al 2015 wang et al 2018 furthermore the divalent calcium cation ca2 was found to inhibit tetracycline transport by increasing humic acid aggregation and enhancing electrostatic attraction cheng et al 2016 however the influence of electrolyte solutions and organic matter on the transport of sas is poorly understood this is however necessary to support the formulation of cost effective measures for the protection of groundwater from sa pollution in the present study four of the most commonly detected sas including sulfadiazine sdz sulfathiazole stz sulfamethazine sm2 and sulfamethoxazole smx qiu et al 2019 were selected to investigate their adsorption process through batch experiments and to explore their different transport behaviors in column experiments all four sas were present simultaneously in the system in a typical surface water related concentration of 10 μg l 1 the aim of this study was to identify the transport mechanisms of these four sas under different physicochemical conditions in the presence of humic acid ha and various cations a numerical transport model was used to better describe and quantify the transport characteristics of sas due to different subsurface environmental factors 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals stz 99 cas 72 14 0 and sm2 99 cas 57 68 1 were purchased from aladdin shanghai china and sdz 99 cas 68 35 9 and smx 99

aggregation before use 2 2 porous media pure quartz sand sio2 99 8 was purchased from shiling corporation guangxi china limestone grains were purchased from huayu trading co ltd guangzhou china both quartz sand and limestone grains were sieved to obtain particles with a specific diameter range of 0 5 to 0 7 mm for further use the median grain diameter d 50 of the two media were both 0 6 mm and their uniformity indices were both 1 1 quartz sand was successively treated with deionized water 10 nitric acid v v and ultrapure water to remove organic impurities and metallic compounds limestone grains were washed with ultrapure water to remove impurities then both quartz sand and limestone grains were oven dried overnight at 105 c and stored under nitrogen until use the surface appearance composition and specific surface area ssa of the quartz sand and limestone grains were assayed the methods and results of these assays are given in supplementary material text s4 2 3 batch adsorption experiments all the experiments were conducted in 100 ml brown glass bottles at the initial ph of 7 0 considering that quartz sand also known as silica sand constitutes a significant portion of aquifers that store substantial groundwater resources salehi et al 2008 esfandyari bayat et al 2015 wang et al 2018 and has no other impurities such as calcium ions in limestone interference quartz sand was selected for the batch experiment to better explain the adsorption mechanism of sas the subsequent experiments were done under the same conditions except that quartz sand was replaced by limestone containing less silica to further explore the impact of adsorption on sa transport dynamics the adsorption experiments were started by mixing quartz sand 2 00 g with sas mixture solutions 50 ml which were performed with all four antibiotics added simultaneously five solutions of the mixture of stz sm2 sdz and smx were prepared with the concentration of 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 10 mg l 1 respectively the bottles containing the solutions were placed in a thermostatic oscillation incubator spx 250 b d shanghai boxun industrial co ltd at 150 r min 1 and 22 5 c and stored in darkness sample aliquots 1 ml of the supernatants of individual samples were taken at 0 5 1 2 4 6 10 16 24 48 and 72 h respectively and each sample was passed through a 0 22 µm syringe filter pes millipore a blank control and three parallel samples were also made for use in the analysis to account for any experimental error sas in the filtered samples were quantified by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry lc qqq ms ms 1290 6470 agilent co usa 2 4 column experiments the setup for the column transport experiment is shown in fig 1 and text s1 the bespoke plexiglass columns had an internal diameter of 5 cm and a length of 30 cm and were covered with black tape to block light the columns were set to run in upflow mode to ensure that the porous medium was in continuous contact with the solute and was thus saturated throughout the experiment a constant water flow velocity of 0 3 ml min 1 was maintained by use of a peristaltic pump labv1 mc6 channel 10 roller pump head baoding shenchen pump co ltd which enabled the connection of a maximum of six tubes at a time the initial ph was 7 0 0 1 for the first set of experiments two columns were filled as uniformly as possible with quartz sand and limestone grains with the porosity of 0 35 0 01 and 0 46 0 01 respectively at the same flowrate of 0 3 ml min 1 the pore water velocities were 0 62 m day 1 and 0 48 m day 1 in the quartz sand and limestone columns respectively these velocities were probably close to the upper limit of real world natural gradient groundwater velocity i e for a gravel sandy aquifer but were common under forced gradient experimental conditions e g scheutz et al 2008 pure water as the background solution as shown in fig 1 was input for 5 pvs then the influent switched to sas solution a second set of experiments was conducted to examine the effect of the background solution on the transport characteristics of sas limestone grains were used because the difference in the breakthrough curves btcs of the sas through this porous medium was more pronounced than the quartz sand column the background solutions used in the three limestone columns were 0 5 mm of cacl2 1 5 mm of nacl and 10 mm of nacl all four sas were mixed and dissolved into the background solution and pumped into the three columns to determine the effects of cation type and ionic strength on the transport process of sas in addition in another limestone column 10 mg l 1 ha was the background solution and sas were mixed with the background solution pumped into the column this experiment was to explore the effect of humic acid on sas migration all the test solutions were mixtures of the four sas with the concentration of 0 01 mg l 1 for each sa the sa source was injected for a pulse of 1 4 pore volumes pvs 1 pv is 206 06 ml in the quartz sand column and 270 83 ml in the limestone gains column followed by 5 pvs of sa free background solution each column was pre equilibrated with 10 pvs of its own background solution before a transport experiment was commenced a fraction collector bs 100a huxi china was used to collect effluent samples at pre specified times conservative tracer transport tests were performed using a 100 mg l 1 nabr solution to determine column performance and water flow characteristics to obtain breakthrough tracer curves btcs bromide ion concentrations were determined by ion chromatography on a thermo scientific aquion ic dionex co usa and the sa concentrations were quantified by lc qqq ms 1290 6470 agilent co usa a comparison of the

mixture of 0 2 formic acid with 2 mmol l 1 ammonium acetate and mobile phase b was 100 acetonitrile and 80 mobile phase a and 20 mobile phase b were used throughout the analysis the flow rate was 0 4 ml min 1 the injection volume was 1 μl and the column temperature was 30 c the mass spectrometry parameters were listed in tables 1 and s1 details of quality assurance and quality control were provided in text s2 2 6 transport model previous studies have shown that the flow rate affects the adsorption of sdz and thus its transport unold et al 2010 fan et al 2011 found that the chemical nonequilibrium two site sorption model well fitted the results of batch and miscible displacement experiments conducted to investigate the migration of sm2 in four types of soil given the influence of flow rate on the migration of sas analyzed in text s3 shown by fig s3 a chemical nonequilibrium model was selected to simulate the dynamic characteristics of sa transport we used a one dimensional transport model to analyze the experimental results and quantify the transport characteristics of sas in the test columns and the kinetic interactions between the solutes and the porous medium the transport model is based on the advection dispersion equation coupled with two site freundlich sorption the governing equation can be written as follows van genuchten and wagenet 1989 1 c t ρ θ s 1 t ρ θ s 2 t d 2 c z 2 v c z where c is the concentration of sas in the aqueous phase ml 3 t is the time t ρ is the bulk density of the porous medium ml 3 θ is the volumetric water content dimensionless d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 z is the vertical spatial coordinate l v is the velocity of pore water lt 1 and s 1 mm 1 and s 2 are the sa concentrations in the solid phase with respect to sorption site 1 and site 2 respectively the sorption in site 1 is instantaneous and site 2 has time dependent kinetic ssoprtion with the following rate equations equilibrium model for site 1 and kinetic model for site 2 2 s 1 f k f c β 3 d s 2 dt α 2 1 f k f c β s 2 where kf is the freundlich coefficient msolute 1 βl3βmsoil 1 β is the dimensionless freundlich exponent f is the fraction of the equilibrium sites s 1 and α2 is the first order sorption rate coefficient for site 2 t 1 the above mentioned transport model was solved using the numerical code hydrus 1d v 4 17 0140 simunek 2005 the inlet represented a mass flux boundary and the outlet was a free exit boundary the model parameters f k f α 2 and β were estimated by the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares optimization routine the remaining parameters ρ θ d and v were derived from the experimental conditions table s4 the degree of model fitting was represented by the r2 statistics of the inverse solution text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption the batch adsorption experiments generally showed that smx sdz and sm2 exhibited high equilibrium concentrations with the medium exhibiting varying adsorption capacity of these compounds after 4 h stz was the most retained one with the lowest equilibrium concentration in the quartz sand column and it had a mass recovery rate of 0 85 fig 2 a and table s2 the results of the batch adsorption experiment were fitted with the freundlich adsorption isotherm fig 2b fig s4 and table s3 and the adsorption kinetics of the sas on quartz sand could be described by a pseudo second order model with an r 2 0 9 fig s2 kf the adsorption equilibrium constant followed the order from low to high of smx sm2 sdz stz similar to the order smx sm2 sulfachloropyridazine stz reported by leal et al 2013 for soils from brazil the adsorption constant kf obtained by data fitting was small table 2 demonstrating that quartz sand has a low adsorption capacity for the four antibiotics generally all the four sas exhibited a relatively low adsorption affinity in terms of the chemical structure sas only have the anilino group but no other functional groups that can form multiple adsorption mechanisms hu et al 2019 for a given ph the fraction of anionic sas α can be estimated by the value of pk a2 table 1 using the following equation snoeyink and jenkins 1980 4 α a c t a a h a a 1 1 1 10 p h p k a 2 where ct a is the number of moles of species containing sas ha is the concentration of non ionized sas and a is the concentration of anionic sas under neutral ph experimental conditions the portions of anionic α stz smx sdz and sm2 calculated by eq 4 were 38 65 87 37 81 36 and 28 45 respectively the previous study showed that the more anions there are in an aqueous solution the greater electrostatic repulsion it has on the negatively charged solid medium surface białk bielińska et al 2012 this results in decreased adsorption of such a compound and thus an increase in its migration ability this was consistent with the observed adsorption order from the lowest to the highest α of stz sdz smx interestingly although α for stz 38 65 was greater than α for sm2 28 45 the migration capacity of stz was lower than that of sm2 this was mainly due to the spatial steric resistance of sm2 adsorbed with soil being greater than that of stz which is attributable to the different substituents on sm2 and stz zhou et al 2016 as considerably different interaction mechanisms seem to be involved in antibiotic adsorption and k oc table 1 cannot account for the variation due to non hydrophobic interactions tolls 2001 k oc does account for the adsorption transport behavior of sas in general the presence of one compound may reduce the adsorption of another compound conkle et al 2010 thereby affecting the behavior of different environmental components downstream e g groundwater sediment surface water white et al 2011 the results of the experiment using the mixture of four sas also showed that when multiple sas were present stz was more easily adsorbed by quartz sand than the other three sas and thus stz might have a greater effect on sediment sorption for smx however its adsorption was so low that can be ignored when modeled with the advection diffusion equation ma et al 2019 while its strong mobility may cause greater effect on downstream sediments than the other sas 3 2 effect of porous medium type the surface of the quartz sand was smoother than that of the limestone grains according to the scanning electron microscopy sem analysis fig 3 a and b the ssa of the limestone grains was 0 3 m2g 1 five times greater than that of the quartz sand 0 06 m2g 1 except for stz the btcs of the sas in the quartz sand column were symmetric and peaked rapidly and then decreased showing a low degree of late time tailing however the btcs of the sas in the limestone grain medium were asymmetric peaked after a time lag and exhibited tailing fig 4 the asymmetric btcs with a late tie tailing can be quantified by either the two zone physical process model i e physical mass exchange between the mobile and immobile domains or the two site chemically nonequilibrium transport model i e multiple chemical adsorption with mixed instantaneous and kinetic adsorption sites warrick 2002 in our experiments the btcs of the conservative tracer bromide ion in quartz sand and limestone grains were both symmetric fig s1 and could be successfully described by the classical advection dispersion equation this suggested that the characteristics of the sa btcs were caused by a chemical nonequilibrium process rather than a physical nonequilibrium process the difference in sa transport behaviors in the quartz and limestone columns is mainly due to the different surface areas and charges in the two porous media liao et al 2016 in that the rougher surface and larger ssa of the limestone grains provided more favorable sites for the adsorption of sas the mass recovery rate of the four sas in the quartz sand was higher than that in the limestone grains this might be related to the low concentration of impurities in the limestone grains facilitating the adsorption of sas however their differences in mass recovery rates were not significant suggesting that the retention of sas in both media was not significant this is mainly due to the large electrostatic repulsion between sa molecules and the negatively charged medium grains moreover the x ray diffraction xrd analysis showed that the quartz sand consisted almost entirely of quartz while the limestone grains contained a high proportion of calcium and a low proportion of other metallic elements magnesium aluminum and iron fig 3c and 3d therefore the limestone grains may have released a small amount of ca2 thereby enhancing the surface charge screening fan et al 2015 between sas and the limestone grains and leading to the asymmetric btcs of sas the cationic effect on the btcs was not observed in the btc of smx which is discussed further in section 3 3 the experimental results depicted in fig 4 show that the btcs of the four sas peaked at 1 7 pv in quartz sand and 2 pv in limestone grains implying rapid transport which are inconsistent with the delayed peak observed in natural soil in reference unold et al 2010 this discrepancy may be due to the subsurface porous media in the field being more heterogeneous and containing various active sorption sites based on the typical characteristics of btcs obtained from the experiments we found that the two site freundlich sorption model described sa btcs in the limestone grains well with r 2 0 98 table 3 in the quartz sand the two site model could be simplified by the one site equilibrium model only kf and β were needed in the simplified model to simulate the transport process of sas the successful application of this model lays the foundation for further study on the adsorption of sas in saturated porous media 3 3 effects of electrolyte solution the observed and calculated btcs of sas transported in the limestone media under different electrolyte solutions are plotted in fig 5 the results showed that both the type and concentration of cations influenced the mobility of the sas notably when nacl was used as the electrolyte the mass recovery decreased slightly as the nacl concentration increased from 1 5 mm to 10 mm fig 5b 5c resulting in reduced mobility of sdz and sm2 in the column in contrast 0 5 mm of cacl2 with the same ionic strength 1 5 mm nacl significantly increased the adsorption affinity of sas by the porous medium as shown in fig 6 ca2 obviously enhanced the adsorption of stz sdz and sm2 by decreasing their mass recovery rates below 0 8 while the impact of ca2 on smx s adsorption is much weaker according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory the presence of electrolytes can reduce electrostatic repulsion derjaguin and landau 1993 several previous studies have shown that cationic bridging is an important mechanism in electronegative particle deposition dong et al 2017 pham et al 2009 furthermore ca2 has been found to neutralize negative charges on the limestone surface more effectively than na lv et al 2018 this may explain why the adsorption of sas was greater in the cacl2 solution than that in the nacl solution with the same ionic strength i e there was stronger electrostatic attraction between the absorbent particles and the sas in the presence of cacl2 due to ca2 more effectively quenching the negative charge on the particles in addition the contribution of inorganic colloidal impurities in the limestone to sas migration cannot be excluded cheng et al 2016 showed that ca2 can reduce the movement of colloids carrying contaminants and thereby enhance their adsorption and deposition however for smx due to its strong electrostatic repulsion with the limestone grains adding the cations with the experimental concentrations cannot neutralize the excessive negative charges in the solution and hence the addition of cations has no obvious effect on smx migration in general the simulation results corroborated the significance of the electrolyte in the transport of sas in the limestone media as the r2 values were 0 97 fig 5 table 3 in general the experimental group containing the electrolyte solution showed an increase of kf compared to the pure water blank control group indicating that the presence of a cation increased the adsorption of sas in particular for sdz and sm2 increasing na increased the fraction of equilibrium sites coefficient f of instantaneous adsorption and hence the mass recovery rate decreased in addition at the same ionic strength in the electrolyte solution e g 1 5 mm nacl and 0 50 mm cacl2 the values of α2 of sas in nacl were lower than those in cacl2 implying less chemical mass transfer between the solid and aqueous phases than that in cacl2 this reflected the fact that ca2 was more effective than na in enhancing the association of sas in the limestone solid phase the kf in pure water limestone grains was respectively large and small for stz and smx so that their transport was not obviously affected by na and ca2 and it was difficult to evaluate the parameter changes under these conditions 3 4 effect of humic acid humic acid ha enhanced the mobility of the sas resulting in an earlier peak in the btcs and the increased peak c c0 value fig 6 although it did not increase the mass recovery of stz the presence of ha increased the negative charge in the solution making it more difficult for sas to be adsorbed similarly zhang et al 2010 concluded that tetracycline was preferentially bound to the colloidal moieties of ha e g carboxyl and phenolic groups and remained in the aqueous phase due to h bonding interactions moreover because of its hydrophobic and non polar fractions ha has been shown to compete with sas for adsorption sites and have a strong affinity for limestone surfaces kretzschmar 1999 previous studies have illustrated that ha molecules adsorbed on a medium surface acts as a masking agent and preferentially occupies attachment sites wang et al 2012 xia et al 2017 which may disturb the interaction between sas and limestone media and hence facilitate the transport of sas in addition it has been found that non polar ha molecules are more likely to be adsorbed on the solid surface resulting in less ha molecules in the aqueous phase to form the contaminant ha chefetz et al 2008 at the same time ha has been shown to complexate with calcium ions in limestone zhou et al 2005 but sas was difficult to complexate with calcium ions further preventing the adsorption of sas by limestone advection dispersion coupled with a two site adsorption model was able to simulate the btcs of sas in the presence of ha the model simulations also matched the experimental btcs of the sas with ha very well with r 2 values 0 98 fig 6 table 3 the best fit kf values for sas transported in the limestone media decreased when ha was present table 3 the calculation results showed that fkf and α2 values were low for sas transported with ha at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 indicating that the presence of ha weakened both the instantaneous adsorption and the kinetic processes of sas in limestone gains these results further demonstrated that ha can substantially facilitate the migration of sas in limestone grains in particular the fitted parameters of stz were less affected than those of the other three sas when 10 mg l 1 of ha was present indicating that 10 mg l 1 of ha has little effect on the adsorption of stz although the simulation results matched the experimental data well the model results may not be reliable if there were excessive parameterization overall the degree of change of adsorption enhancement or weakening was different for the four sas which was strongly associated sa molecular structures and medium properties conde cid et al 2019 since the four sas were mixed with the same concentration under different background solution conditions in the experiments one solution condition may influence the adsorption of some sas without obviously affecting the other sas this discrepancy can be identified by comparing the best fit model parameters the control mechanism is mainly the electrostatic interaction between the sa molecules and the medium under a certain background 4 conclusions this study monitored and quantified the fate and transport behavior of sas in porous media under various physicochemical conditions where the concentrations of sas in the experiments were typically found in groundwater the four sas had mobilities in the order from high to low of smx sm2 sdz stz with smx being barely absorbed and thus posing a greater risk to groundwater quality than the other sas the results showed that the fate of the four sas examined in this study was influenced by the type of porous media i e surface area and surface charge and sa migration in limestone grains was more complex than that in the quartz sand column notably ca2 inhibited the transport of sas more strongly than na and ha promoted the transport of sas which further suggests that hydrochemical factors such as ionic strength ionic type and ha concentration influence the adsorption and transport dynamics of sas in saturated porous media in addition the dynamics of adsorption and transport of sas in groundwater was effectively simulated using a two site adsorption model by fitting the data observed in the column experiments this study led to a better mechanistic understanding of critical factors that control the fate and transport of sas in porous media an important and environmentally ubiquitous class of antibiotics that are emerging contaminants in aquifers our findings will contribute to the development of effective strategies for protecting groundwater from sas credit authorship contribution

4474,the implication of optimal low impact development lid implementations has been attracting researchers attention aiming to alleviate the detrimental impacts of urbanization and climate change and enhance resilience the rapidly increasing number of publications on lid optimization over recent years makes it one of the leading edge research areas in the field of urban stormwater management this study aims to conduct a systematic bibliometric review of the optimization and resilience within lid stormwater management practices lid related publications of 17 years 2004 2020 august were retrieved from the web of science database and thoroughly analyzed this review looks into the progression of current research themes previous work outcomes and key research gaps using a clustering tool four main research clusters have been identified employing text mining each cluster reflecting a research theme is identified based on the analysis of the top fifteen papers the clusters themes are outlined as 1 optimizing lid type and size 2 spatial layout optimization with parameter uncertainty and climate and land use change impacts 3 hydraulic lid parameter optimization and adoption of multi criteria analysis and 4 experimental studies on bioretention for quantity and quality assessment subsequently the cross cutting research gaps are identified considering all articles climate change and resilience are identified as key hot topics from authors keyword analysis highlighting current research frontiers and laying out the directions for future research thrust in this critically

urbanization industrialization and climate change impact the intensity frequency and duration of extreme weather events such as floods droughts waterlogging seneviratne et al 2012 urban areas and their drainage systems have been significantly affected by this change from past decades degrading urban resilience the proliferation of impervious surfaces disrupts the natural hydrological cycle that results in excessive runoff guo and guo 2018 crippling drainage systems ability to convey high runoff volumes and increasing the potential for urban floods becciu and raimondi 2015 urban stormwater management thus emerged to address pressing concerns to mitigate such risks the goal of the traditional stormwater management approaches gray infrastructures such as tunnels gutters curbs is to drain the stormwater through a centralized system as soon as possible wu et al 2019 eckart et al 2017 however in recent decades a shift towards a decentralized system known as low impact development lid started to immerge aiming to preserve predevelopment hydrology or to mimic the natural water cycle damodaram et al 2010 across new zealand and north america the term lid is most widely used to indicate a control measure although this study focuses explicitly on lid it is worth mentioning that some other terms are used to refer either to the lid approach or lid like approaches such as water sensitive urban design wsud in australia urban design and development in new zealand liudd and sustainable urban drainage systems in europe suds fletcher et al 2015 these approaches aim to maintain hydrological restoration manage stormwater close to its source and drain stormwater more sustainably than conventional approaches a stormwater management approach can be sustainable if it encompasses water quantity and quality management and provides co benefits like increasing biodiversity feasibility and amenity lid was first conceptualized in the early 1990s by the environmental resources department of prince george s county usa wu et al 2019 however the term was first used by burrill and nolfi 1977 in their study on reducing stormwater management costs prince george s country then developed a manual on lid to increase its adaptability across the world coffman 2000 the overall aim of lid implementation is to i provide quantity guo and guo 2018 jia et al 2012 and quality controls of stormwater liu et al 2015 ii treat runoff as close to the source as possible iii increase natural hydrological processes such as evaporation infiltration and storage ahiablame et al 2013 dolowitz et al 2012 dhalla and zimmer 2010 usepa 2000 and iv enhance ecological benefits vogel et al 2015 some commonly used lid practices include rain barrel rb or cistern green roofs gr bio retention cell bc or bioretention br rain gardens rg soakaways permeable pavement pp vegetative swales vs infiltration trenches it infiltration basins ib rooftop downspout disconnection tree box filters and other green infrastructures gi however the combined application of lid and other bmp best management practice such as detention pond detention tank dt pipe systems can serve as the best option to satisfy stormwater management goals ashley et al 2011a 2011b damodaram and zechman 2013 nowadays optimal design of lid is a key in stormwater management where the overall goal is to achieve a specified objective with limited available resources the optimization objective can take many forms such as reducing runoff volume peak flow combined sewer overflow cso volume pollutant load first flush volume or minimizing cost optimal design of lids such as appropriate lid selection spatial layout and size can be obtained by either taking one individual lid or considering a range of lids under different design storm scenarios or probabilistic rainfall events as lid implementation is gaining popularity in recent decades many optimization approaches are evolving to facilitate the design of optimal lid systems moreover stormwater management infrastructures are exposed to more frequent extreme precipitation events due to climate change therefore resilience needs to be considered in the design of lid systems although there are several review papers on lids as discussed in section 1 1 none of them has focused on optimization and resilience within lids moreover the bibliometric review approach is a new technique that can add important information about publications in a specific research field therefore this paper aims to provide a systematic and bibliometric literature review on lids optimization and resilience further details about this study s scope and approach are provided in section 1 2 1 1 categories of lid review papers there are currently some literature review articles in the lid approach area and they can be classified into three categories the first category mainly deals with literature review papers that focus on the evolution scope goal implication of several terminologies used in urban drainage management and several perturbations and possibilities in implementing lids or gis for example fletcher et al 2015 described the development over time of several urban drainage terms such as lid wsud bmp suds iuwm scms and classified them based on underpinning principles and scopes of each term a systematic literature review is conducted by huang et al 2020 in which the evolution of nature based solutions based on their terminologies is described along with their benefits and limitations vogel et al 2015 discussed thirteen critical questions on the lid or gi at the individual level or whole in climate change and socioeconomic context similarly jayasooriya et al 2020 reviewed the concerns and possibilities in implementing gi optimally in the industrial area and identified their potential benefits limitations and threats the second category deals with reviews primarily based on the performance evaluation of lids at different scales i e numerical field and experimental as an illustration eckart et al 2017 provided a synopsis of infiltration based and retention based lid s execution they evaluated their performance in terms of quantity and quality as a stormwater management approach different modelling techniques as well as hurdles towards lid implementation were also discussed ahiablame et al 2012 presented a comprehensive review to evaluate the efficacy hydrologic and water quality aspects of different lid practices especially br rg pp gr and swale systems using field and experimental studies beneficial uses of lid in terms of quantity and quality are the central research theme of the review article of shafique and kim 2015 beecham et al 2019 evaluated the quantitative and qualitative performance of intensive and extensive green roofs and living walls they described several optimization methods for plant performance based on numerous numerical and experimental studies vogel and moore 2016 conducted a review on stormwater quantity and quality performance determination considering runoff control and runoff quality improvement and execution and evaluation of lid gi measures at a watershed scale the review paper of kaykhosravi et al 2018 discussed eleven types of models used to evaluate lid and gi s performance their features and hydrological and hydraulic modelling aspects in the third category reviews are conducted based on optimization approaches on several lids zhang and chui 2018 mainly focused on the location optimization of several lid bmp and gi measures along with the factors that impact lid allocation they also discussed various spatial allocation optimization tools classified them based on their goals and allocation components and evaluated the impacts of lid distribution patterns centralized or decentralized on optimization objectives shishegar et al 2018 identified different optimization problems using eighty articles from the scopus database and divided them in terms of objective functions static and dynamic control approach stormwater management approach and uncertainty considerations they identified the publication trend graph of the last ten years on this field and found that sustainable urban drainage system requires further research to make them climate resilient 1 2 current study focus and approach as can be inferred from the above overview all review papers focused on a specific part of the lid and optimization field the bibliometric literature review approach is gaining popularity to explore the intrinsic structure and progression across many research fields haggag et al 2020 ezzeldin and el dakhakhni 2020 munoz ecija et al 2017 portillo salido 2010 it helps determine the prolificacy of authors institutions countries and international affiliations through analyzing the networks of articles keywords and authors romero and portillo salido 2019 the analysis helps investigate research frontiers and hotspots this approach has been used in several research areas such as city interdependence haggag et al 2020 structural ezzeldin and el dakhakhni 2020 supply chain management gelsomino et al 2016 xu et al 2018a economics and sociology korom 2019 and medical and health sciences tranfield et al 2003 in the context of water resources management troian and gomes 2020 carried out a bibliometric analysis on a multicriteria approach to manage water resources and paved a way to deal with water pollution and water distribution management this approach was also adopted in china to ensure water security and minimize conflict between water demand and supply zhu et al 2019 they provided an overview through network analysis to quantify blue green and green water approaches using two frameworks water footprint assessment and life cycle cost assessment a bibliometric analysis was also conducted in several studies on drinking water and wastewater quality durán sánchez et al 2020 wambu and ho 2016 wang et al 2010 integrated water resources management durán sánchez et al 2018 and stormwater management wu et al 2019 this study illustrates a bibliometric analysis and a systematic review of lid focusing on optimization and resilience it provides insights into the inherent structure and emerging research areas in the specified study topic i e lid optimization and resilience to the best of the authors knowledge there are no published lid bibliometric reviews and no systematic reviews on lid optimization and resilience the bibliometric analysis of extensive literature database provides unabridged affiliation data of authors institutions and countries the analysis output acts as a potential information source for identifying collaboration trends and build a procreation tool for future international collaboration moed and halevi 2014 the bibliometric analysis helps determine the contents of research clusters and identify gaps and future research areas this study aims to explore the trends of approximately 17 years of research output in the field of lid optimization and resilience and identify research opportunities by answering the following questions i how diverse is the lid optimization research output ii which authors and publications are prominent in the field iii what is the extent of related collaborative work focusing on lid performance evaluation and optimization a systematic literature review and comprehensive bibliometric and network analysis are carried out using different tools bibexcel is applied to generate the necessary data file employed by gephi to perform citation analysis by determining the page rank score and carrying out co citation analysis through cluster formation using the louvain algorithm vosviewer is employed to facilitate the identification of the most prominent authors countries and sources or journals in this field using text mining text mining can extract essential information from unstructured or semi structured data that helps to identify the main research topics and their categorization underlying research themes and interconnections the following section provides the methodology details of this literature review study 2 methodology this review combines systematic and bibliometric approaches that enable critical analysis through information integration tranfield et al 2003 rowley and slack 2004 manalo et al 2004 as such the review discerns the dominant articles and authors identifies current research topics and paves the way for future research directions by highlighting ongoing research interests and trends fig 1 the web of science core collection database is used to retrieve articles focusing on resilience and optimization of low impact development although the search period contains 44 years from 1976 to 2020 publications in the lid field began only in 2004 therefore articles that are published during the period of 17 years 2004 to 2020 august are collected and considered for further analysis the selected topic resilience and optimization of low impact development consists of three terms therefore three search strings are selected to ensure that the keywords capture all features of the topic the first search string contains the term low impact development the second string contains optimization related terms i e optimization or optimisation or multi criteria or multicriteria or multi objective or multi objective and the last or third string contains resilient related terms such as resilience or resilient using these finalized keywords the search resulted in 191 papers these papers cover several topics especially lid performance assessment lids optimal design and resilience assessment by incorporating climate and land use change impacts some articles also mentioned the guidelines and strategies adopted by several countries to implement lids the primary aim underlying these publications is to manage urban stormwater effectively using different lid practices single combined to gain the maximum benefit at minimum cost which is the intrinsic aim of the optimization process some inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered for the final selection of the most relevant articles from 191 papers both titles and abstracts were carefully reviewed to identify the most relevant ones based on the selected criteria studies related to lid performances quantity quality optimal design the impact of climate change on performance were included in contrast studies about cities guidelines and challenges that are not related to lid implementation strategies were excluded some performance criteria such as thermal effect determination in the lid application area and the articles that mainly focused on flood risk or environmental risk assessment were also excluded finally 177 papers out of 191 are selected for further network and content analyses fig 2 depicts the evolution of publications and citations number per year available in the database on lid and its optimal design as can be inferred prior to 2004 no articles were published on this topic from 2004 to 2014 publication number lies in the range of 1 to 6 per year after 2014 an increasing trend is observed reaching its peak in 2019 with 50 publications similarly for citations a surge is observed from 2013 and in 2019 citation number is maximum which is 724 citation and publication numbers continue to increase with time as data for the year 2020 is incomplete both graphs showed a decline in the trend that may not be representative of actual trends 3 bibliometric review traditional literature reviews use a comprehensive approach for analyzing theories based on examining methodologies results and discussions of every research article and ultimately provide a framework for future work jesson et al 2011 in contrast the bibliometric analysis uses quantitative and statistical approaches of published articles to describe the connections between them based on a specific topic or research field by assessing the co citation time by other published papers melewar et al 2012 in 1969 alan pritchard used the term bibliometrics in his article based on scientific bibliography garfield 2009 the analysis mainly focused on the research area of authors the paper s content and citation network which help find data statistics such as keywords and affiliation xu et al 2018a among various techniques social network analysis sna is the most frequently used method in bibliometric analysis it helps to visualize and describe community structures emphasizing the importance of selecting the most frequent keywords and citations through this network al et al 2012 de miguel molina et al 2015 various software packages such as excel bibexcel histcite and sitkis have been used in bibliometric analyses for a long time where each one has multiple advantages and disadvantages persson et al 2009 in this study bibexcel is used for bibliographic analysis and both gephi and vosviewer are used for visualization bibexcel is selected for bibliometric and statistical perusal because it allows importing data from all databases such as web of science and scopus it also enables data coupling with network analysis and visualization tools like citespace wu et al 2019 gephi vosviewer and citenet explorer van eck and waltman 2017 histcite and pajek mrvar and batagelj 2016 and ucinet and igraph in r kolaczyk and csárdi 2014 to analyze the networks and visualize them graphically gephi and vosviewer are chosen because of their ability to handle extensive network data and format visualization alternatives improved filtering ability built in network analysis tool and enhanced clustering ability bastian et al 2009 gephi 2013 van eck and waltman 2013 in this paper local citations influential authors and countries are identified using vosviewer however gephi is used for citation and co citation analysis by page rank and clustering methods subsequently content analysis is conducted for each cluster for better comprehension of the research theme vosviewer is also used for term map generation based on a corpus of documents using the same functional procedure as text mining van and waltman 2011 a net file from bibexcel is used as an input in gephi which results in 167 nodes articles with 5 337 edges i e ways by which articles are connected 3 1 citation analysis citation analysis maps the significance or popularity of a publication tsay 2009 ding and cronin 2011 fig 3 shows the studies with a threshold of a minimum of 20 citations each the analysis resulted in 31 articles each article is represented by a node where the node size increases with the number of citations of the corresponding article table 1 summarizes the top ten articles in the field of lid and its optimal design based on local and global citations local citation indicates the number of citations within the 167 node network on the other hand global citation implies the overall citation number across all databases considering other research fields and areas goyal and kumar 2020 according to a local citation lee et al 2012 rank as first with 140 citations followed by eckart et al 2017 and jia et al 2012 with 108 and 105 citations respectively considering global citations lee et al 2012 rank first with 151 citations and jia et al 2012 rank second with 125 citations followed by eckart et al 2017 and pyke et al 2011 with 111 and 109 citations respectively among them lee et al 2012 jia et al 2012 and eckart et al 2017 are the most influential studies with the highest citations based on the two citation categories 3 2 page rank analysis brin and page 1998 introduced the page rank algorithm as a measure of prestige and eminence this algorithm alleviates the drawback of citation analysis ding et al 2009 citation from an ambiguous paper and a very highly cited paper carries the same citation analysis weight maslov and redner 2008 however page rank gives more value to a paper if other prestigious articles cite it originally page rank is introduced to give precedence to the webpages based on keyword search in any search engine such as google brin and page 1998 but now it is used to identify the linkage between articles the top ten articles based on page rank are listed in table 2 from table 2 a disparity is observed while the top ten papers are compared based on page rank and both local and global citations only two papers i e eckart et al 2017 and vogel et al 2015 are the common papers among the categories the other four eminent articles top based on page rank are zhang and chui 2018 li et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 and mani et al 2019 these four papers mainly dealt with optimization strategies in lids such as allocation and scenario optimization to evaluate hydrological performance considering cost and runoff reduction 3 3 author and country analysis in the finalized datasets 610 authors from 38 countries published 167 articles vosviewer software is used to find the top ten authors and countries where the minimum number of publications per author or country is considered three in table 3 the top ten authors are listed based on the maximum number of citations whereas in table 4 countries are listed based on the maximum number of published studies among the authors haifeng jia ranks first with 312 citations followed by shawl yu and jenny zhen with 278 and 208 citations haifeng jia and shawl yu also published the highest number of articles 8 and 6 respectively as these two authors have the maximum number of documents with higher citations they are considered experts in the area of lid practices as shown in table 4 the usa is ranked first whereas china ranked second with 69 and 63 respectively as the most contributing countries in the lid resilience and optimization field after analyzing these three countries major research themes it is found that all of them experienced major lid benefits such as quantity and quality control of stormwater runoff 3 4 co authorship country network map vosviewer visualization tool is used to map a network of co authorship and country relationships this network provides information about prospective partners working in a specific area the map is made based on a threshold value of 5 minimum documents of a country eleven countries out of 38 countries meet this criterion fig 4 depicts a collaborative country coauthor map consisting of nine countries in four clusters two countries among eleven are not included in the map as they have no links with the other nine countries cluster formation is based on the measurement of concurring term recurrency of each country romerio portillo salido 2019 for example the yellow cluster fig 4 shows that the usa and italy worked in the same research field the nodes in fig 4 represent the number of documents per country where the node size increases with the number of published articles however the curved lines represent collaboration the thicker the line the more co authorships between the connected countries considering this the usa node is the largest with 69 articles followed by china and iran with 63 and 12 papers respectively line thickness between the usa and china is the greatest with link strength 15 however link strength between the usa and australia is one which shows minimum collaboration among all countries the usa worked most with other countries with link strength 31 followed by china and iran with link strength 15 and 5 respectively collaborative networks or links help to identify collaboration between authors from different countries for example researchers from canada collaborated most with iran link strength 3 followed by the usa and china with link strength 2 and 1 respectively china is the leading country in the green cluster which showed an associated work with the usa link strength 15 followed by england link strength 5 australia link strength 2 singapore and canada link strength 1 respectively 3 5 co citation analysis co citation analysis results in a network that comprises nodes and edges representing respectively articles and concurrence of pairs of articles in another article barnett 2011 the primary purpose of co citation analysis is to measure the recurrency of cited articles together in other documents trujillo and long 2018 this type of analysis presents a comprehensive approach to investigating a research area s inner structure in a bibliometric study the similarity in the research area or concept depends on the frequency of citations between two papers xu et al 2018a gephi is used for co citation analysis using the net file created by bibexcel after importing this file it is found that 167 papers are co cited by other articles in the 177 node network and the arrangement of these nodes in this co cited map is randomly generated in bibliometric research the clustering technique has been widely used for determining a group of related articles or authors radicchi et al 2004 a network of 167 articles is partitioned into several clusters where each cluster is formed by the dense connection between nodes blondel et al 2008 edge density or weight is smaller between nodes of different clusters and higher between the same cluster nodes leydesdorff et al 2017 here co citation analysis is conducted through cluster formation where relevant articles with similar themes are grouped in one cluster each cluster is further investigated to identify the publications intrinsic characteristics evaluate the topics and analyze the content of each topic s top articles nowadays the clustering mechanism is gaining eminence in network analysis and was used by many researchers the network structure is measured by modularity the thicker nodes connection the higher the modularity cluster quality is measured by the modularity index brandes et al 2007 louvain algorithm vanquished other methods in optimizing modularity while dealing with computation time and large networks this method uses optimization techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters by iterative optimization where the modularity index is escalated the louvain method follows an iterative approach consisting of two phases to determine the optimal cluster number in the first phase a different cluster is allotted for each node which results in numerous clusters then neighbours j of each node i is considered and determined gain of modularity by eliminating i from its cluster and replacing it in j cluster if a positive increase is achieved in the second phase node i is placed in the cluster where the maximum gain is evaluated the overall mechanism is repeated sequentially and stops when the local modularity value is maximum applying this algorithm on the final 167 filtered articles resulted in four clusters fig 5 where cluster 1 contains 65 articles and clusters 2 3 4 comprises 56 25 and 21 articles respectively each cluster s research focus is identified through the analysis of the top 15 papers based on page rank table 5 the selected leading papers are also analyzed using the vosviewer text mining function for term map generation the term map provides a general direction of actively developing research areas romero portillo salido 2019 after that the content analysis of each cluster is conducted to assess the main research insights 3 6 term map vosviewer tool is used to detect major research trends and explore dissimilarities within the top 15 papers of each cluster which eventually helps in topic identification zahedi and van eck 2015 the papers content is analyzed using a text mining function within vosviewer to generate a two dimensional term map van and waltman 2011 the connectedness between terms is illustrated by the distance between two terms and the term occurrence is represented by the term size fig 6 this relatedness is measured based on co occurrences of the term in the articles each text in the term map density map is expressed by its label and colour as vosviewer circumvents label overlapping only some terms are represented by their labels the default colour range blue green yellow is used for map visualization if the term s frequency is high it carries greater weight and the yellow colour reflects it with a larger label size whereas the blue colour presents the less frequent term with a smaller label size van and waltman 2018 fig 6 represents the term map where the research clusters are mapped separately in cluster 1 sustain swmm runoff design and hydrological performance are the most frequent terms as they lie in the yellow zone cluster 2 represents spatial allocation and cost effectiveness of lid considering climate change in cluster 3 the frequently used terms are related to lids and their performance such as detention tank permeable pavement green roof hydrological performance and hydraulic conductivity some decision making approaches such as the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and analytical hierarchy process ahp are also present in the cluster 3 articles terms such as field experiments pollutants removals such as phosphorus zn and pb using bioretention are the focus of cluster 4 a combination of terms in each cluster is further used for topic identification 3 7 clusters content analysis the four clusters content based on 60 articles 15 articles per cluster are shown in tables 6 9 review articles are shown separately in table 10 a brief description of the content analysis is given below 3 7 1 cluster 1 design optimization type area and performance evaluation of multiple lids cluster 1 has emerged in 2011 and it has the largest number of articles 65 articles this research cluster s primary focuses on optimal lid unit and type selection from multiple lid options swmm and sustain models are mainly used along with an optimization algorithm for this purpose among the 15 studies seven studies focused on optimization three papers provide reviews about lid aspects and the other five articles evaluate hydrological performance table 6 in the review papers factors benefits and limitations of several lids and optimal gi approaches in residential areas are discussed sustain with the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is used in three studies to determine optimal combination lid scenarios especially for gr br and rb swmm with different algorithms such as moaloa hs r toolbox is applied in three articles to select lids optimally the other five studies analyzed the hydrological performance i e runoff and peak reduction of lids 3 7 2 cluster 2 cost optimization for lid deployment considering climate change and parameter uncertainty it is the second largest cluster with 56 papers publications in cluster 2 emerged in 2006 this cluster mainly examines lids allocation among the top 15 articles in this cluster eleven articles focused on allocation strategies considering cost as an objective function to reduce runoff volume runoff peak and pollutant loads table 7 the rest of the three studies determined optimal drainage schemes to achieve runoff and pollution control targets one review paper of this cluster mainly discussed the factors affecting lid placement and evaluated the impacts of numerous lid distribution patterns the most used lids in this cluster are pp br and gr climate change and uncertainty in model parameters and rainfall were also considered in the articles of this cluster 3 7 3 cluster 3 parameter optimization and adoption of multi criteria approach this cluster contains 25 papers where the first publication appeared in 2004 apart from size and location optimization this cluster dealt with several lid optimization applications six studies out of fifteen use multicriteria approaches such as ahp topsis index ranking system for optimal selection of lids type and placement and three studies focusing on several lid parameter optimization table 8 this cluster s papers contain one review paper which focuses on the different lid models used to evaluate lids performance four of the fifteen top studies have also discussed lids allocation incorporating combined detention facilities and storage tanks with other lids while cluster 2 considers only lids except for any end of pipe facilities apart from the cluster s main focus two studies discussed the factors causing plant stress for tree trench and gr s hydrological performance 3 7 4 cluster 4 experimental studies on bioretention performance this cluster emerged in 2007 it contains 21 papers nine out of the top 15 papers in this cluster discuss the bioretention s performance in terms of quantity volume peak discharge peak delay time and pollutant removal efficiency table 9 bioretention br is the commonly used lid measure in this cluster twelve studies and it is used both individually and in conjunction with other lids such as pp gr swale etc unlike other clusters experimental analysis and water quality improvement are the main focus of this research cluster 3 8 research cluster progression the evolution of the four research clusters is developed to identify the progress of research on lids optimization and lids resilence fig 7 represents the total number of published articles in each cluster from 2004 to 2020 it shows that cluster 1 emerged in 2011 and developed steadily with time research related to clusters 2 started in 2006 steady development is observed in cluster 2 from 2006 but a sudden drop is observed in 2018 from 10 to 5 articles however it continued to rise again in 2019 with 20 articles cluster 3 emerged at the earliest stage 2004 and showed continuous growth in publications with time although cluster 4 appeared in 2007 with seldom publications three papers only until 2015 where four studies are documented then in 2016 and 2017 the number of publications dropped to one but in 2018 it increased to six to recapitulate cluster 1 had the highest number of papers between 2004 and 2020 followed by clusters 2 3 then 4 clusters 1 and 2 continue to grow in recent years with many publications compared to clusters 3 and 4 which implies that research themes under cluster 1 and 2 are the hotspot topics in the lid field in the following section the author s keywords are analyzed to understand the emerging trends of keywords which eventually determine the hotspot research theme 4 emerging research theme and gap identifications 4 1 emerging themes the author s keywords are selected as a criterion for evaluating the emerging research theme comerio and strozzi 2019 used this criterion to identify the main thread of research articles the vosviewer is used in this study to analyze the author s keywords an author s keyword is considered a frequent one if it occurs at least five times in all abstracts and titles among 554 keywords 21 meet the threshold category in these 21 keywords similar words like lid or low impact development and irrelevant words such as city sponge and urban are eliminated this filtering resulted in 13 keywords as listed in table 11 among this list low impact development is the most recurrent keyword with 50 occurrences the three subsequent most frequent words are optimization 32 occurrences swmm 24 occurrences and green infrastructure 16 occurrences the evolving nature of the keywords with timescale is shown in fig 8 which depicts that best management practices and their costing were the main research area in 2014 bioretention was the most investigated lid in the year between 2016 and 2017 after 2017 the major research fields were green infrastructures and multi objective optimization approaches using mainly genetic algorithm ga nsga ii from 2018 climate change impact and resilient design were becoming prominent and still worth investigating areas 5 research gaps the author s keyword analysis is used to exhibit research theme progression and discover the research gaps and future hotspot topics where all documents under each cluster 167 articles are considered based on the author s keyword analysis resilience climate change and uncertainty are the hotspot keywords in recent years clusters 1 and 2 deal with several optimization approaches where the number of documents showed an increasing trend therefore gaps and directions for future work for clusters 1 and 2 are combined based on cluster 1 and 2 optimization of lid type and the area was performed for pp gr rg rb vs br it based on either quantity improvement runoff volume and peak volume reduction or quality improvement pollutant load reduction at a minimum cost xu et al 2019 xu et al 2017 mani et al 2019 overall optimal scenario selection of lid type size and location were determined for pp gr br rb rg and it to minimize volume and cost seo et al 2017 ghodsi et al 2020 fan et al 2017 xu et al 2019 all performance criteria quantity quality cost can be combined as optimization objectives for several lids in the future also the hydrological performance can be assessed based on this combined approach for both single lid and a combination of multiple lids for resilient lid design both climate change cc and land use change luc are considered and optimal type area location are determined for multiple lids such as pp br gr rb vs liu et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2018b optimal it design is investigated under the cc scenario in the future this design can be optimized considering either luc or combined cc and luc scenarios the uncertainty in parameters such as infiltration rate release rate build up and wash off coefficient impermeability latifi et al 2019 raei et al 2019 and rainfall characteristics latifi et al 2019 gu et al 2018 2020 ng et al 2020 were considered for selecting optimal lid type and area from vs br percolation well catch basin rb gr pp and it for pp gr and bc the monte carlo approach was used for spatial location optimization guo et al 2018 september design optimization of rg considering uncertainty was not done in the previous studies so incorporating uncertainty of both parameters and rainfall characteristics in rg s optimal design and other lids such as rb gr pp it will be a worth investigating research area in future in cluster 3 parameter optimization is conducted using the pso algorithm to determine hydraulic properties for pp and gr brunetti et al 2016 piro et al 2019 and shape parameters for the stormwater filter brunetti et al 2017 so optimal parameter values for other lids such as br rg rb vs it can be considered in future studies several multicriteria decision analysis approaches such as ahp topsis index ranking system were applied for leaky well rg gr soakaway infiltration facility to select optimal lid type ahammed et al 2012 gogate et al 2017 luan et al 2019 xing et al 2016 multi criteria approaches can be used in conjunction with the optimization techniques for other lids to get the overall optimal solution in the future the most used lid in cluster 4 is bioretention experimental studies are conducted in the majority of the articles lying in this cluster to evaluate the performance quantity quality of br fassman beck et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 li et al 2014 mei et al 2013 morash et al 2019 wan et al 2018 swmm is used as a hydrologic hydraulic model in two of the studies to measure these performances zhang et al 2018 lucas and sample 2015 platz et al 2020 experimental investigations on other lids can be done in future studies and the results can be used for numerical model validation 6 discussion an evolutionary increase in the number of research articles in the stormwater management field provides an opportunity to conduct a meta research on the lids optimization field to conduct this review first the related articles were retrieved from the web of science core collection database a publication trend graph is generated to show the emergence and growth rate of these articles later bibexcel is used to create an appropriate file format coupled with other visualization software analysis tools such as gephi and vosviewer citation analysis is done on a local and global basis as well as page rank analysis to identify highly cited and prominent articles in this research field vosviewer is also used to determine the most influential authors based on citations and find the top countries based on document numbers co citation analysis is performed through clustering using gephi to group related articles where four clusters are identified for each cluster using vosviewer text mining was applied on the top 15 papers based on page rank scores to identify the research subthemes a term map was generated to help in naming the research theme of each cluster and uncover its inherent concept analyzing the latent topics within each cluster and considering the identified keywords help in providing recommendations for future research works finally the analysis of authors keywords is performed using all four clusters documents to discover the emerging research themes clusters 1 and 2 showed a steady development rate with greater publications compared to the other clusters a boost in the publication is observed in 2006 for both clusters 1 and 2 the analysis illustrates that the research themes under these two clusters are the current research frontiers so lid optimization research can be divided into three major streams cluster 1 and cluster 2 form one stream where type unit and area optimization is the main focus the second stream contains cluster 3 where parameter optimization of several lids and adaptation of multicriteria decision analysis is observed the last stream deals with cluster 4 where several experimental studies especially on br are discussed cluster 1 contains the highest number of articles although it appeared later than the other clusters this cluster mainly deals with optimal lid type and lid unit selection it contains three review papers i factors impacting lids performance ii infiltration and retention based lids and the models that are used for assessing lids performance and iii issues and challenges related to implementing gi in industrial areas besides bc pp and gr are the mainly used lids in these studies the majority of the studies applied swmm with several multi objective algorithms while some studies used sustain and its integrated algorithms to get the optimal solutions some other studies focused on improving drainage systems performance using gr bc pp rg and rb cluster 2 is the second largest cluster the majority of the articles in this cluster illustrate several deployment strategies of lids such as centralized distributed or combined the rest of the articles focused on selecting optimal scenarios based on quantity and quality control criteria this cluster s research articles also considered the uncertainty of input parameters such as rainfall imperviousness co efficient build up and wash off co efficient and determined the optimal scheme under different climate change scenarios previously flow control was the major criteria to obtain the optimal solution however shifting towards the incorporation of cc and luc along with different uncertain parameters is observed from this cluster progression both clusters 1 and 2 dealt with design optimization type unit area location however cluster 2 focused on uncertainty and combined luc and cc scenarios in these studies the objective function was either volume or peak flow or cost minimization in the future multi objective functions can be considered using two or more objectives including reducing the time of concentration ff volume and hydrological residence footprint also luc and cc impacts can be incorporated into optimization techniques to get the climate resilient solution the combined uncertainty effect lying under rainfall and hydraulic soil properties can be also considered for the lids such as gr rg rb pp in the future cluster 3 focuses on multi criteria approaches and lids parameter optimization six out of fifteen studies applied various multicriteria techniques such as ahp topsis to select the appropriate lid type and placement parameter optimization was done on pp gr br and stormwater filter only therefore there is an opportunity to perform parameter optimization on other lids the results can be used as constraints or decision variables to determine the optimum solution that satisfies all design objectives a combined multicriteria analysis and optimal solutions obtained from several climate change scenarios can be used in the future to get the best solution and make the drainage infrastructure climate resilient cluster 4 articles included experimental studies focusing on assessing the performance of br both quantitively and qualitatively in these studies br was used as a single measure or as part of other lids in the future similar studies can be conducted on several different lids to assess their performance and collect data to help in validating numerical models the prevailing and emerging thread of research articles is obtained using authors keywords evolution the progressive nature of keywords with a timespan showed that bmp was previously used as a stormwater management measure in 2014 later br was used as a subset of bmp measure during 2016 2017 after 2017 a shift towards using gi with multi objective optimization is observed finally the analysis revealed that climate change and resilience are cutting edge research themes that also support the steady development and progression of clusters 1 and 2 therefore combining optimization of lid size e g length width depth with luc and cc analyses can be considered to make climate resilient drainage infrastructure 7 limitations of the study in this study only the top fifteen papers selected based on page rank score of each cluster are considered for topic identification and content analysis this selection is made because the lead papers are capable of illustrating the main research focus of the clusters fahimnia et al 2015 however as the rest of the articles are not considered each cluster s overall topic determination gets affected future studies can perform the analysis by including all articles underlying each cluster to facilitate more accurate topic identification and content analysis besides articles from recent years such as four or five years can be chosen for keyword analysis to map the recent influential and prominent themes in this field paul et al 2017 the results obtained from this mapping can help further content analysis through clustering and enable researchers to identify the current hotspot topics and their corresponding gaps moreover this field s publications can be classified based on several study methods such as review analysis meta analysis empirical and conceptual study this data will help future researchers to select and carry out proper study methods in their specified fields 8 conclusions lid implementation and its optimal design is an emerging topic in the stormwater management field thus drawing several researchers attention this review employs systematic literature and bibliometric analysis on the field of lid practices and their optimization and resilience the field s state of the art development is summarized in this review paper to help researchers preceptors decision makers and several stakeholders the consequent maps of authors countries and terms generated by bibliometric network analysis and text mining techniques are useful and captivating appliances among the researchers community the following key conclusions can be drawn out from the bibliometric and content analysis 1 the publication trend graph depicts that articles in this field emerged from 2004 and the growth rate got its propulsion after 2014 2 citation and page rank analysis revealed the paper entitled performance and implementation of low impact development a review eckart et al 2017 as the prestigious and popular paper highest page rank score which is 0 01296 in the lid field which has received 108 local and 111 global citations 3 haifeng jia is identified as the prominent author in this field with 312 citations and the usa ranked first in publishing a larger number of articles in this research area 69 documents 4 co citation analysis identified four research clusters cluster 1 2 3 and 4 contains 65 56 25 and 21 articles respectively cluster 1 focuses on optimal lid size and unit selection from multiple options cluster 2 deals with the optimal allocation strategy of lids with cost minimization cluster 3 uses hydraulic parameter optimization for pp gr and stormwater filters several multicriteria approaches were adopted in this cluster to get the optimal selection of lids finally the main research theme of cluster 4 is performance evaluation quality and quantity of br at the experimental scale 5 the evolution of research clusters with time is identified in addition to exhibit research theme progression and discover future hotspot topics the authors keyword analysis revealed that climate change and resilience are now the major focus in this research era based on the above discussions the following recommendations can be adopted in the near future 1 runoff volume and peak control first flush reduction minimizing hydrological footprint residence lengthening the time of concentration or time to peak and life cycle cost all together can be used to formulate a multiple objective optimization problem to get the most effective solution 2 combined cc and luc impacts should be considered in optimizing the design of rg and it 3 the combined uncertainty effect lying under rainfall and hydraulic soil properties infiltration rate can be considered for the lids such as pp rg gr and rb in the future 4 parameter optimization can be considered for lids especially rb rg it vs and the results can be incorporated into optimization algorithms to determine the optimal solution that satisfies all design objectives 5 in the future multicriteria approaches can be used together with optimization algorithms output to reach the best solution 6 experimental studies can be conducted on various lids except br to collect actual data of their performances runoff volume the concentration of pollutant loads which can be used later for numerical model validation finally the analyses presented herein can benefit different stakeholders in the

4474,the implication of optimal low impact development lid implementations has been attracting researchers attention aiming to alleviate the detrimental impacts of urbanization and climate change and enhance resilience the rapidly increasing number of publications on lid optimization over recent years makes it one of the leading edge research areas in the field of urban stormwater management this study aims to conduct a systematic bibliometric review of the optimization and resilience within lid stormwater management practices lid related publications of 17 years 2004 2020 august were retrieved from the web of science database and thoroughly analyzed this review looks into the progression of current research themes previous work outcomes and key research gaps using a clustering tool four main research clusters have been identified employing text mining each cluster reflecting a research theme is identified based on the analysis of the top fifteen papers the clusters themes are outlined as 1 optimizing lid type and size 2 spatial layout optimization with parameter uncertainty and climate and land use change impacts 3 hydraulic lid parameter optimization and adoption of multi criteria analysis and 4 experimental studies on bioretention for quantity and quality assessment subsequently the cross cutting research gaps are identified considering all articles climate change and resilience are identified as key hot topics from authors keyword analysis highlighting current research frontiers and laying out the directions for future research thrust in this critically important emerging research field keywords low impact development optimization bibliometric analysis research cluster climate change resilience nomenclature acronyms ahp analytical hierarchy process

integration swmm storm water management model topsis the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution vs vegetative swales wsud water sensitive urban design 1 introduction urbanization industrialization and climate change impact the intensity frequency and duration of extreme weather events such as floods droughts waterlogging seneviratne et al 2012 urban areas and their drainage systems have been significantly affected by this change from past decades degrading urban resilience the proliferation of impervious surfaces disrupts the natural hydrological cycle that results in excessive runoff guo and guo 2018 crippling drainage systems ability to convey high runoff volumes and increasing the potential for urban floods becciu and raimondi 2015 urban stormwater management thus emerged to address pressing concerns to mitigate such risks the goal of the traditional stormwater management approaches gray infrastructures such as tunnels gutters curbs is to drain the stormwater through a centralized system as soon as possible wu et al 2019 eckart et al 2017 however in recent decades a shift towards a decentralized system known as low impact development lid started to immerge aiming to preserve predevelopment hydrology or to mimic the natural water cycle damodaram et al 2010 across new zealand and north america the term lid is most widely used to indicate a control measure although this study focuses explicitly on lid it is worth mentioning that some other terms are used to refer either to the lid approach or lid like approaches such as water sensitive urban design wsud in australia urban design and development in new zealand liudd and sustainable urban drainage systems in europe suds fletcher et al 2015 these approaches aim to maintain hydrological restoration manage stormwater close to its source and drain stormwater more sustainably than conventional approaches a stormwater management approach can be sustainable if it encompasses water quantity and quality management and provides co benefits like increasing biodiversity feasibility and amenity lid was first conceptualized in the early 1990s by the environmental resources department of prince george s county usa wu et al 2019 however the term was first used by burrill and nolfi 1977 in their study on reducing stormwater management costs prince george s country then developed a manual on lid to increase its adaptability across the world coffman 2000 the overall aim of lid implementation is to i provide quantity guo and guo 2018 jia et al 2012 and quality controls of stormwater liu et al 2015 ii treat runoff as close to the source as possible iii increase natural hydrological processes such as evaporation infiltration and storage ahiablame et al 2013 dolowitz et al 2012 dhalla and zimmer 2010 usepa 2000 and iv enhance ecological benefits vogel et al 2015 some commonly used lid practices include rain barrel rb or cistern green roofs gr bio retention cell bc or bioretention br rain gardens rg soakaways permeable pavement pp vegetative swales vs infiltration trenches it infiltration basins ib rooftop downspout disconnection tree box filters and other green infrastructures gi however the combined application of lid and other bmp best management practice such as detention pond detention tank dt pipe systems can serve as the best option to satisfy stormwater management goals ashley et al 2011a 2011b damodaram and zechman 2013 nowadays optimal design of lid is a key in stormwater management where the overall goal is to achieve a specified objective with limited available resources the optimization objective can take many forms such as reducing runoff volume peak flow combined sewer overflow cso volume pollutant load first flush volume or minimizing cost optimal design of lids such as appropriate lid selection spatial layout and size can be obtained by either taking one individual lid or considering a range of lids under different design storm scenarios or probabilistic rainfall events as lid implementation is gaining popularity in recent decades many optimization approaches are evolving to facilitate the design of optimal lid systems moreover stormwater management infrastructures are exposed to more frequent extreme precipitation events due to climate change therefore resilience needs to be considered in the design of lid systems although there are several review papers on lids as discussed in section 1 1 none of them has focused on optimization and resilience within lids moreover the bibliometric review approach is a new technique that can add important information about publications in a specific research field therefore this paper aims to provide a systematic and bibliometric literature review on lids optimization and resilience further details about this study s scope and approach are provided in section 1 2 1 1 categories of lid review papers there are currently some literature review articles in the lid approach area and they can be classified into three categories the first category mainly deals with literature review papers that focus on the evolution scope goal implication of several terminologies used in urban drainage management and several perturbations and possibilities in implementing lids or gis for example fletcher et al 2015 described the development over time of several urban drainage terms such as lid wsud bmp suds iuwm scms and classified them based on underpinning principles and scopes of each term a systematic literature review is conducted by huang et al 2020 in which the evolution of nature based solutions based on their terminologies is described along with their benefits and limitations vogel et al 2015 discussed thirteen critical questions on the lid or gi at the individual level or whole in climate change and socioeconomic context similarly jayasooriya et al 2020 reviewed the concerns and possibilities in implementing gi optimally in the industrial area and identified their potential benefits limitations and threats the second category deals with reviews primarily based on the performance evaluation of lids at different scales i e numerical field and experimental as an illustration eckart et al 2017 provided a synopsis of infiltration based and retention based lid s execution they evaluated their performance in terms of quantity and quality as a stormwater management approach different modelling techniques as well as hurdles towards lid implementation were also discussed ahiablame et al 2012 presented a comprehensive review to evaluate the efficacy hydrologic and water quality aspects of different lid practices especially br rg pp gr and swale systems using field and experimental studies beneficial uses of lid in terms of quantity and quality are the central research theme of the review article of shafique and kim 2015 beecham et al 2019 evaluated the quantitative and qualitative performance of intensive and extensive green roofs and living walls they described several optimization methods for plant performance based on numerous numerical and experimental studies vogel and moore 2016 conducted a review on stormwater quantity and quality performance determination considering runoff control and runoff quality improvement and execution and evaluation of lid gi measures at a watershed scale the review paper of kaykhosravi et al 2018 discussed eleven types of models used to evaluate lid and gi s performance their features and hydrological and hydraulic modelling aspects in the third category reviews are conducted based on optimization approaches on several lids zhang and chui 2018 mainly focused on the location optimization of several lid bmp and gi measures along with the factors that impact lid allocation they also discussed various spatial allocation optimization tools classified them based on their goals and allocation components and evaluated the impacts of lid distribution patterns centralized or decentralized on optimization objectives shishegar et al 2018 identified different optimization problems using eighty articles from the scopus database and divided them in terms of objective functions static and dynamic control approach stormwater management approach and uncertainty considerations they identified the publication trend graph of the last ten years on this field and found that sustainable urban drainage system requires further research to make them climate resilient 1 2 current study focus and approach as can be inferred from the above overview all review papers focused on a specific part of the lid and optimization field the bibliometric literature review approach is gaining popularity to explore the intrinsic structure and progression across many research fields haggag et al 2020 ezzeldin and el dakhakhni 2020 munoz ecija et al 2017 portillo salido 2010 it helps determine the prolificacy of authors institutions countries and international affiliations through analyzing the networks of articles keywords and authors romero and portillo salido 2019 the analysis helps investigate research frontiers and hotspots this approach has been used in several research areas such as city interdependence haggag et al 2020 structural ezzeldin and el dakhakhni 2020 supply chain management gelsomino et al 2016 xu et al 2018a economics and sociology korom 2019 and medical and health sciences tranfield et al 2003 in the context of water resources management troian and gomes 2020 carried out a bibliometric analysis on a multicriteria approach to manage water resources and paved a way to deal with water pollution and water distribution management this approach was also adopted in china to ensure water security and minimize conflict between water demand and supply zhu et al 2019 they provided an overview through network analysis to quantify blue green and green water approaches using two frameworks water footprint assessment and life cycle cost assessment a bibliometric analysis was also conducted in several studies on drinking water and wastewater quality durán sánchez et al 2020 wambu and ho 2016 wang et al 2010 integrated water resources management durán sánchez et al 2018 and stormwater management wu et al 2019 this study illustrates a bibliometric analysis and a systematic review of lid focusing on optimization and resilience it provides insights into the inherent structure and emerging research areas in the specified study topic i e lid optimization and resilience to the best of the authors knowledge there are no published lid bibliometric reviews and no systematic reviews on lid optimization and resilience the bibliometric analysis of extensive literature database provides unabridged affiliation data of authors institutions and countries the analysis output acts as a potential information source for identifying collaboration trends and build a procreation tool for future international collaboration moed and halevi 2014 the bibliometric analysis helps determine the contents of research clusters and identify gaps and future research areas this study aims to explore the trends of approximately 17 years of research output in the field of lid optimization and resilience and identify research opportunities by answering the following questions i how diverse is the lid optimization research output ii which authors and publications are prominent in the field iii what is the extent of related collaborative work focusing on lid performance evaluation and optimization a systematic literature review and comprehensive bibliometric and network analysis are carried out using different tools bibexcel is applied to generate the necessary data file employed by gephi to perform citation analysis by determining the page rank score and carrying out co citation analysis through cluster formation using the louvain algorithm vosviewer is employed to facilitate the identification of the most prominent authors countries and sources or journals in this field using text mining text mining can extract essential information from unstructured or semi structured data that helps to identify the main research topics and their categorization underlying research themes and interconnections the following section provides the methodology details of this literature review study 2 methodology this review combines systematic and bibliometric approaches that enable critical analysis through information integration tranfield et al 2003 rowley and slack 2004 manalo et al 2004 as such the review discerns the dominant articles and authors identifies current research topics and paves the way for future research directions by highlighting ongoing research interests and trends fig 1 the web of science core collection database is used to retrieve articles focusing on resilience and optimization of low impact development although the search period contains 44 years from 1976 to 2020 publications in the lid field began only in 2004 therefore articles that are published during the period of 17 years 2004 to 2020 august are collected and considered for further analysis the selected topic resilience and optimization of low impact development consists of three terms therefore three search strings are selected to ensure that the keywords capture all features of the topic the first search string contains the term low impact development the second string contains optimization related terms i e optimization or optimisation or multi criteria or multicriteria or multi objective or multi objective and the last or third string contains resilient related terms such as resilience or resilient using these finalized keywords the search resulted in 191 papers these papers cover several topics especially lid performance assessment lids optimal design and resilience assessment by incorporating climate and land use change impacts some articles also mentioned the guidelines and strategies adopted by several countries to implement lids the primary aim underlying these publications is to manage urban stormwater effectively using different lid practices single combined to gain the maximum benefit at minimum cost which is the intrinsic aim of the optimization process some inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered for the final selection of the most relevant articles from 191 papers both titles and abstracts were carefully reviewed to identify the most relevant ones based on the selected criteria studies related to lid performances quantity quality optimal design the impact of climate change on performance were included in contrast studies about cities guidelines and challenges that are not related to lid implementation strategies were excluded some performance criteria such as thermal effect determination in the lid application area and the articles that mainly focused on flood risk or environmental risk assessment were also excluded finally 177 papers out of 191 are selected for further network and content analyses fig 2 depicts the evolution of publications and citations number per year available in the database on lid and its optimal design as can be inferred prior to 2004 no articles were published on this topic from 2004 to 2014 publication number lies in the range of 1 to 6 per year after 2014 an increasing trend is observed reaching its peak in 2019 with 50 publications similarly for citations a surge is observed from 2013 and in 2019 citation number is maximum which is 724 citation and publication numbers continue to increase with time as data for the year 2020 is incomplete both graphs showed a decline in the trend that may not be representative of actual trends 3 bibliometric review traditional literature reviews use a comprehensive approach for analyzing theories based on examining methodologies results and discussions of every research article and ultimately provide a framework for future work jesson et al 2011 in contrast the bibliometric analysis uses quantitative and statistical approaches of published articles to describe the connections between them based on a specific topic or research field by assessing the co citation time by other published papers melewar et al 2012 in 1969 alan pritchard used the term bibliometrics in his article based on scientific bibliography garfield 2009 the analysis mainly focused on the research area of authors the paper s content and citation network which help find data statistics such as keywords and affiliation xu et al 2018a among various techniques social network analysis sna is the most frequently used method in bibliometric analysis it helps to visualize and describe community structures emphasizing the importance of selecting the most frequent keywords and citations through this network al et al 2012 de miguel molina et al 2015 various software packages such as excel bibexcel histcite and sitkis have been used in bibliometric analyses for a long time where each one has multiple advantages and disadvantages persson et al 2009 in this study bibexcel is used for bibliographic analysis and both gephi and vosviewer are used for visualization bibexcel is selected for bibliometric and statistical perusal because it allows importing data from all databases such as web of science and scopus it also enables data coupling with network analysis and visualization tools like citespace wu et al 2019 gephi vosviewer and citenet explorer van eck and waltman 2017 histcite and pajek mrvar and batagelj 2016 and ucinet and igraph in r kolaczyk and csárdi 2014 to analyze the networks and visualize them graphically gephi and vosviewer are chosen because of their ability to handle extensive network data and format visualization alternatives improved filtering ability built in network analysis tool and enhanced clustering ability bastian et al 2009 gephi 2013 van eck and waltman 2013 in this paper local citations influential authors and countries are identified using vosviewer however gephi is used for citation and co citation analysis by page rank and clustering methods subsequently content analysis is conducted for each cluster for better comprehension of the research theme vosviewer is also used for term map generation based on a corpus of documents using the same functional procedure as text mining van and waltman 2011 a net file from bibexcel is used as an input in gephi which results in 167 nodes articles with 5 337 edges i e ways by which articles are connected 3 1 citation analysis citation analysis maps the significance or popularity of a publication tsay 2009 ding and cronin 2011 fig 3 shows the studies with a threshold of a minimum of 20 citations each the analysis resulted in 31 articles each article is represented by a node where the node size increases with the number of citations of the corresponding article table 1 summarizes the top ten articles in the field of lid and its optimal design based on local and global citations local citation indicates the number of citations within the 167 node network on the other hand global citation implies the overall citation number across all databases considering other research fields and areas goyal and kumar 2020 according to a local citation lee et al 2012 rank as first with 140 citations followed by eckart et al 2017 and jia et al 2012 with 108 and 105 citations respectively considering global citations lee et al 2012 rank first with 151 citations and jia et al 2012 rank second with 125 citations followed by eckart et al 2017 and pyke et al 2011 with 111 and 109 citations respectively among them lee et al 2012 jia et al 2012 and eckart et al 2017 are the most influential studies with the highest citations based on the two citation categories 3 2 page rank analysis brin and page 1998 introduced the page rank algorithm as a measure of prestige and eminence this algorithm alleviates the drawback of citation analysis ding et al 2009 citation from an ambiguous paper and a very highly cited paper carries the same citation analysis weight maslov and redner 2008 however page rank gives more value to a paper if other prestigious articles cite it originally page rank is introduced to give precedence to the webpages based on keyword search in any search engine such as google brin and page 1998 but now it is used to identify the linkage between articles the top ten articles based on page rank are listed in table 2 from table 2 a disparity is observed while the top ten papers are compared based on page rank and both local and global citations only two papers i e eckart et al 2017 and vogel et al 2015 are the common papers among the categories the other four eminent articles top based on page rank are zhang and chui 2018 li et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 and mani et al 2019 these four papers mainly dealt with optimization strategies in lids such as allocation and scenario optimization to evaluate hydrological performance considering cost and runoff reduction 3 3 author and country analysis in the finalized datasets 610 authors from 38 countries published 167 articles vosviewer software is used to find the top ten authors and countries where the minimum number of publications per author or country is considered three in table 3 the top ten authors are listed based on the maximum number of citations whereas in table 4 countries are listed based on the maximum number of published studies among the authors haifeng jia ranks first with 312 citations followed by shawl yu and jenny zhen with 278 and 208 citations haifeng jia and shawl yu also published the highest number of articles 8 and 6 respectively as these two authors have the maximum number of documents with higher citations they are considered experts in the area of lid practices as shown in table 4 the usa is ranked first whereas china ranked second with 69 and 63 respectively as the most contributing countries in the lid resilience and optimization field after analyzing these three countries major research themes it is found that all of them experienced major lid benefits such as quantity and quality control of stormwater runoff 3 4 co authorship country network map vosviewer visualization tool is used to map a network of co authorship and country relationships this network provides information about prospective partners working in a specific area the map is made based on a threshold value of 5 minimum documents of a country eleven countries out of 38 countries meet this criterion fig 4 depicts a collaborative country coauthor map consisting of nine countries in four clusters two countries among eleven are not included in the map as they have no links with the other nine countries cluster formation is based on the measurement of concurring term recurrency of each country romerio portillo salido 2019 for example the yellow cluster fig 4 shows that the usa and italy worked in the same research field the nodes in fig 4 represent the number of documents per country where the node size increases with the number of published articles however the curved lines represent collaboration the thicker the line the more co authorships between the connected countries considering this the usa node is the largest with 69 articles followed by china and iran with 63 and 12 papers respectively line thickness between the usa and china is the greatest with link strength 15 however link strength between the usa and australia is one which shows minimum collaboration among all countries the usa worked most with other countries with link strength 31 followed by china and iran with link strength 15 and 5 respectively collaborative networks or links help to identify collaboration between authors from different countries for example researchers from canada collaborated most with iran link strength 3 followed by the usa and china with link strength 2 and 1 respectively china is the leading country in the green cluster which showed an associated work with the usa link strength 15 followed by england link strength 5 australia link strength 2 singapore and canada link strength 1 respectively 3 5 co citation analysis co citation analysis results in a network that comprises nodes and edges representing respectively articles and concurrence of pairs of articles in another article barnett 2011 the primary purpose of co citation analysis is to measure the recurrency of cited articles together in other documents trujillo and long 2018 this type of analysis presents a comprehensive approach to investigating a research area s inner structure in a bibliometric study the similarity in the research area or concept depends on the frequency of citations between two papers xu et al 2018a gephi is used for co citation analysis using the net file created by bibexcel after importing this file it is found that 167 papers are co cited by other articles in the 177 node network and the arrangement of these nodes in this co cited map is randomly generated in bibliometric research the clustering technique has been widely used for determining a group of related articles or authors radicchi et al 2004 a network of 167 articles is partitioned into several clusters where each cluster is formed by the dense connection between nodes blondel et al 2008 edge density or weight is smaller between nodes of different clusters and higher between the same cluster nodes leydesdorff et al 2017 here co citation analysis is conducted through cluster formation where relevant articles with similar themes are grouped in one cluster each cluster is further investigated to identify the publications intrinsic characteristics evaluate the topics and analyze the content of each topic s top articles nowadays the clustering mechanism is gaining eminence in network analysis and was used by many researchers the network structure is measured by modularity the thicker nodes connection the higher the modularity cluster quality is measured by the modularity index brandes et al 2007 louvain algorithm vanquished other methods in optimizing modularity while dealing with computation time and large networks this method uses optimization techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters by iterative optimization where the modularity index is escalated the louvain method follows an iterative approach consisting of two phases to determine the optimal cluster number in the first phase a different cluster is allotted for each node which results in numerous clusters then neighbours j of each node i is considered and determined gain of modularity by eliminating i from its cluster and replacing it in j cluster if a positive increase is achieved in the second phase node i is placed in the cluster where the maximum gain is evaluated the overall mechanism is repeated sequentially and stops when the local modularity value is maximum applying this algorithm on the final 167 filtered articles resulted in four clusters fig 5 where cluster 1 contains 65 articles and clusters 2 3 4 comprises 56 25 and 21 articles respectively each cluster s research focus is identified through the analysis of the top 15 papers based on page rank table 5 the selected leading papers are also analyzed using the vosviewer text mining function for term map generation the term map provides a general direction of actively developing research areas romero portillo salido 2019 after that the content analysis of each cluster is conducted to assess the main research insights 3 6 term map vosviewer tool is used to detect major research trends and explore dissimilarities within the top 15 papers of each cluster which eventually helps in topic identification zahedi and van eck 2015 the papers content is analyzed using a text mining function within vosviewer to generate a two dimensional term map van and waltman 2011 the connectedness between terms is illustrated by the distance between two terms and the term occurrence is represented by the term size fig 6 this relatedness is measured based on co occurrences of the term in the articles each text in the term map density map is expressed by its label and colour as vosviewer circumvents label overlapping only some terms are represented by their labels the default colour range blue green yellow is used for map visualization if the term s frequency is high it carries greater weight and the yellow colour reflects it with a larger label size whereas the blue colour presents the less frequent term with a smaller label size van and waltman 2018 fig 6 represents the term map where the research clusters are mapped separately in cluster 1 sustain swmm runoff design and hydrological performance are the most frequent terms as they lie in the yellow zone cluster 2 represents spatial allocation and cost effectiveness of lid considering climate change in cluster 3 the frequently used terms are related to lids and their performance such as detention tank permeable pavement green roof hydrological performance and hydraulic conductivity some decision making approaches such as the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and analytical hierarchy process ahp are also present in the cluster 3 articles terms such as field experiments pollutants removals such as phosphorus zn and pb using bioretention are the focus of cluster 4 a combination of terms in each cluster is further used for topic identification 3 7 clusters content analysis the four clusters content based on 60 articles 15 articles per cluster are shown in tables 6 9 review articles are shown separately in table 10 a brief description of the content analysis is given below 3 7 1 cluster 1 design optimization type area and performance evaluation of multiple lids cluster 1 has emerged in 2011 and it has the largest number of articles 65 articles this research cluster s primary focuses on optimal lid unit and type selection from multiple lid options swmm and sustain models are mainly used along with an optimization algorithm for this purpose among the 15 studies seven studies focused on optimization three papers provide reviews about lid aspects and the other five articles evaluate hydrological performance table 6 in the review papers factors benefits and limitations of several lids and optimal gi approaches in residential areas are discussed sustain with the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is used in three studies to determine optimal combination lid scenarios especially for gr br and rb swmm with different algorithms such as moaloa hs r toolbox is applied in three articles to select lids optimally the other five studies analyzed the hydrological performance i e runoff and peak reduction of lids 3 7 2 cluster 2 cost optimization for lid deployment considering climate change and parameter uncertainty it is the second largest cluster with 56 papers publications in cluster 2 emerged in 2006 this cluster mainly examines lids allocation among the top 15 articles in this cluster eleven articles focused on allocation strategies considering cost as an objective function to reduce runoff volume runoff peak and pollutant loads table 7 the rest of the three studies determined optimal drainage schemes to achieve runoff and pollution control targets one review paper of this cluster mainly discussed the factors affecting lid placement and evaluated the impacts of numerous lid distribution patterns the most used lids in this cluster are pp br and gr climate change and uncertainty in model parameters and rainfall were also considered in the articles of this cluster 3 7 3 cluster 3 parameter optimization and adoption of multi criteria approach this cluster contains 25 papers where the first publication appeared in 2004 apart from size and location optimization this cluster dealt with several lid optimization applications six studies out of fifteen use multicriteria approaches such as ahp topsis index ranking system for optimal selection of lids type and placement and three studies focusing on several lid parameter optimization table 8 this cluster s papers contain one review paper which focuses on the different lid models used to evaluate lids performance four of the fifteen top studies have also discussed lids allocation incorporating combined detention facilities and storage tanks with other lids while cluster 2 considers only lids except for any end of pipe facilities apart from the cluster s main focus two studies discussed the factors causing plant stress for tree trench and gr s hydrological performance 3 7 4 cluster 4 experimental studies on bioretention performance this cluster emerged in 2007 it contains 21 papers nine out of the top 15 papers in this cluster discuss the bioretention s performance in terms of quantity volume peak discharge peak delay time and pollutant removal efficiency table 9 bioretention br is the commonly used lid measure in this cluster twelve studies and it is used both individually and in conjunction with other lids such as pp gr swale etc unlike other clusters experimental analysis and water quality improvement are the main focus of this research cluster 3 8 research cluster progression the evolution of the four research clusters is developed to identify the progress of research on lids optimization and lids resilence fig 7 represents the total number of published articles in each cluster from 2004 to 2020 it shows that cluster 1 emerged in 2011 and developed steadily with time research related to clusters 2 started in 2006 steady development is observed in cluster 2 from 2006 but a sudden drop is observed in 2018 from 10 to 5 articles however it continued to rise again in 2019 with 20 articles cluster 3 emerged at the earliest stage 2004 and showed continuous growth in publications with time although cluster 4 appeared in 2007 with seldom publications three papers only until 2015 where four studies are documented then in 2016 and 2017 the number of publications dropped to one but in 2018 it increased to six to recapitulate cluster 1 had the highest number of papers between 2004 and 2020 followed by clusters 2 3 then 4 clusters 1 and 2 continue to grow in recent years with many publications compared to clusters 3 and 4 which implies that research themes under cluster 1 and 2 are the hotspot topics in the lid field in the following section the author s keywords are analyzed to understand the emerging trends of keywords which eventually determine the hotspot research theme 4 emerging research theme and gap identifications 4 1 emerging themes the author s keywords are selected as a criterion for evaluating the emerging research theme comerio and strozzi 2019 used this criterion to identify the main thread of research articles the vosviewer is used in this study to analyze the author s keywords an author s keyword is considered a frequent one if it occurs at least five times in all abstracts and titles among 554 keywords 21 meet the threshold category in these 21 keywords similar words like lid or low impact development and irrelevant words such as city sponge and urban are eliminated this filtering resulted in 13 keywords as listed in table 11 among this list low impact development is the most recurrent keyword with 50 occurrences the three subsequent most frequent words are optimization 32 occurrences swmm 24 occurrences and green infrastructure 16 occurrences the evolving nature of the keywords with timescale is shown in fig 8 which depicts that best management practices and their costing were the main research area in 2014 bioretention was the most investigated lid in the year between 2016 and 2017 after 2017 the major research fields were green infrastructures and multi objective optimization approaches using mainly genetic algorithm ga nsga ii from 2018 climate change impact and resilient design were becoming prominent and still worth investigating areas 5 research gaps the author s keyword analysis is used to exhibit research theme progression and discover the research gaps and future hotspot topics where all documents under each cluster 167 articles are considered based on the author s keyword analysis resilience climate change and uncertainty are the hotspot keywords in recent years clusters 1 and 2 deal with several optimization approaches where the number of documents showed an increasing trend therefore gaps and directions for future work for clusters 1 and 2 are combined based on cluster 1 and 2 optimization of lid type and the area was performed for pp gr rg rb vs br it based on either quantity improvement runoff volume and peak volume reduction or quality improvement pollutant load reduction at a minimum cost xu et al 2019 xu et al 2017 mani et al 2019 overall optimal scenario selection of lid type size and location were determined for pp gr br rb rg and it to minimize volume and cost seo et al 2017 ghodsi et al 2020 fan et al 2017 xu et al 2019 all performance criteria quantity quality cost can be combined as optimization objectives for several lids in the future also the hydrological performance can be assessed based on this combined approach for both single lid and a combination of multiple lids for resilient lid design both climate change cc and land use change luc are considered and optimal type area location are determined for multiple lids such as pp br gr rb vs liu et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2018b optimal it design is investigated under the cc scenario in the future this design can be optimized considering either luc or combined cc and luc scenarios the uncertainty in parameters such as infiltration rate release rate build up and wash off coefficient impermeability latifi et al 2019 raei et al 2019 and rainfall characteristics latifi et al 2019 gu et al 2018 2020 ng et al 2020 were considered for selecting optimal lid type and area from vs br percolation well catch basin rb gr pp and it for pp gr and bc the monte carlo approach was used for spatial location optimization guo et al 2018 september design optimization of rg considering uncertainty was not done in the previous studies so incorporating uncertainty of both parameters and rainfall characteristics in rg s optimal design and other lids such as rb gr pp it will be a worth investigating research area in future in cluster 3 parameter optimization is conducted using the pso algorithm to determine hydraulic properties for pp and gr brunetti et al 2016 piro et al 2019 and shape parameters for the stormwater filter brunetti et al 2017 so optimal parameter values for other lids such as br rg rb vs it can be considered in future studies several multicriteria decision analysis approaches such as ahp topsis index ranking system were applied for leaky well rg gr soakaway infiltration facility to select optimal lid type ahammed et al 2012 gogate et al 2017 luan et al 2019 xing et al 2016 multi criteria approaches can be used in conjunction with the optimization techniques for other lids to get the overall optimal solution in the future the most used lid in cluster 4 is bioretention experimental studies are conducted in the majority of the articles lying in this cluster to evaluate the performance quantity quality of br fassman beck et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 li et al 2014 mei et al 2013 morash et al 2019 wan et al 2018 swmm is used as a hydrologic hydraulic model in two of the studies to measure these performances zhang et al 2018 lucas and sample 2015 platz et al 2020 experimental investigations on other lids can be done in future studies and the results can be used for numerical model validation 6 discussion an evolutionary increase in the number of research articles in the stormwater management field provides an opportunity to conduct a meta research on the lids optimization field to conduct this review first the related articles were retrieved from the web of science core collection database a publication trend graph is generated to show the emergence and growth rate of these articles later bibexcel is used to create an appropriate file format coupled with other visualization software analysis tools such as gephi and vosviewer citation analysis is done on a local and global basis as well as page rank analysis to identify highly cited and prominent articles in this research field vosviewer is also used to determine the most influential authors based on citations and find the top countries based on document numbers co citation analysis is performed through clustering using gephi to group related articles where four clusters are identified for each cluster using vosviewer text mining was applied on the top 15 papers based on page rank scores to identify the research subthemes a term map was generated to help in naming the research theme of each cluster and uncover its inherent concept analyzing the latent topics within each cluster and considering the identified keywords help in providing recommendations for future research works finally the analysis of authors keywords is performed using all four clusters documents to discover the emerging research themes clusters 1 and 2 showed a steady development rate with greater publications compared to the other clusters a boost in the publication is observed in 2006 for both clusters 1 and 2 the analysis illustrates that the research themes under these two clusters are the current research frontiers so lid optimization research can be divided into three major streams cluster 1 and cluster 2 form one stream where type unit and area optimization is the main focus the second stream contains cluster 3 where parameter optimization of several lids and adaptation of multicriteria decision analysis is observed the last stream deals with cluster 4 where several experimental studies especially on br are discussed cluster 1 contains the highest number of articles although it appeared later than the other clusters this cluster mainly deals with optimal lid type and lid unit selection it contains three review papers i factors impacting lids performance ii infiltration and retention based lids and the models that are used for assessing lids performance and iii issues and challenges related to implementing gi in industrial areas besides bc pp and gr are the mainly used lids in these studies the majority of the studies applied swmm with several multi objective algorithms while some studies used sustain and its integrated algorithms to get the optimal solutions some other studies focused on improving drainage systems performance using gr bc pp rg and rb cluster 2 is the second largest cluster the majority of the articles in this cluster illustrate several deployment strategies of lids such as centralized distributed or combined the rest of the articles focused on selecting optimal scenarios based on quantity and quality control criteria this cluster s research articles also considered the uncertainty of input parameters such as rainfall imperviousness co efficient build up and wash off co efficient and determined the optimal scheme under different climate change scenarios previously flow control was the major criteria to obtain the optimal solution however shifting towards the incorporation of cc and luc along with different uncertain parameters is observed from this cluster progression both clusters 1 and 2 dealt with design optimization type unit area location however cluster 2 focused on uncertainty and combined luc and cc scenarios in these studies the objective function was either volume or peak flow or cost minimization in the future multi objective functions can be considered using two or more objectives including reducing the time of concentration ff volume and hydrological residence footprint also luc and cc impacts can be incorporated into optimization techniques to get the climate resilient solution the combined uncertainty effect lying under rainfall and hydraulic soil properties can be also considered for the lids such as gr rg rb pp in the future cluster 3 focuses on multi criteria approaches and lids parameter optimization six out of fifteen studies applied various multicriteria techniques such as ahp topsis to select the appropriate lid type and placement parameter optimization was done on pp gr br and stormwater filter only therefore there is an opportunity to perform parameter optimization on other lids the results can be used as constraints or decision variables to determine the optimum solution that satisfies all design objectives a combined multicriteria analysis and optimal solutions obtained from several climate change scenarios can be used in the future to get the best solution and make the drainage infrastructure climate resilient cluster 4 articles included experimental studies focusing on assessing the performance of br both quantitively and qualitatively in these studies br was used as a single measure or as part of other lids in the future similar studies can be conducted on several different lids to assess their performance and collect data to help in validating numerical models the prevailing and emerging thread of research articles is obtained using authors keywords evolution the progressive nature of keywords with a timespan showed that bmp was previously used as a stormwater management measure in 2014 later br was used as a subset of bmp measure during 2016 2017 after 2017 a shift towards using gi with multi objective optimization is observed finally the analysis revealed that climate change and resilience are cutting edge research themes that also support the steady development and progression of clusters 1 and 2 therefore combining optimization of lid size e g length width depth with luc and cc analyses can be considered to make climate resilient drainage infrastructure 7 limitations of the study in this study only the top fifteen papers selected based on page rank score of each cluster are considered for topic identification and content analysis this selection is made because the lead papers are capable of illustrating the main research focus of the clusters fahimnia et al 2015 however as the rest of the articles are not considered each cluster s overall topic determination gets affected future studies can perform the analysis by including all articles underlying each cluster to facilitate more accurate topic identification and content analysis besides articles from recent years such as four or five years can be chosen for keyword analysis to map the recent influential and prominent themes in this field paul et al 2017 the results obtained from this mapping can help further content analysis through clustering and enable researchers to identify the current hotspot topics and their corresponding gaps moreover this field s publications can be classified based on several study methods such as review analysis meta analysis empirical and conceptual study this data will help future researchers to select and carry out proper study methods in their specified fields 8 conclusions lid implementation and its optimal design is an emerging topic in the stormwater management field thus drawing several researchers attention this review employs systematic literature and bibliometric analysis on the field of lid practices and their optimization and resilience the field s state of the art development is summarized in this review paper to help researchers preceptors decision makers and several stakeholders the consequent maps of authors countries and terms generated by bibliometric network analysis and text mining techniques are useful and captivating appliances among the researchers community the following key conclusions can be drawn out from the bibliometric and content analysis 1 the publication trend graph depicts that articles in this field emerged from 2004 and the growth rate got its propulsion after 2014 2 citation and page rank analysis revealed the paper entitled performance and implementation of low impact development a review eckart et al 2017 as the prestigious and popular paper highest page rank score which is 0 01296 in the lid field which has received 108 local and 111 global citations 3 haifeng jia is identified as the prominent author in this field with 312 citations and the usa ranked first in publishing a larger number of articles in this research area 69 documents 4 co citation analysis identified four research clusters cluster 1 2 3 and 4 contains 65 56 25 and 21 articles respectively cluster 1 focuses on optimal lid size and unit selection from multiple options cluster 2 deals with the optimal allocation strategy of lids with cost minimization cluster 3 uses hydraulic parameter optimization for pp gr and stormwater filters several multicriteria approaches were adopted in this cluster to get the optimal selection of lids finally the main research theme of cluster 4 is performance evaluation quality and quantity of br at the experimental scale 5 the evolution of research clusters with time is identified in addition to exhibit research theme progression and discover future hotspot topics the authors keyword analysis revealed that climate change and resilience are now the major focus in this research era based on the above discussions the following recommendations can be adopted in the near future 1 runoff volume and peak control first flush reduction minimizing hydrological footprint residence lengthening the time of concentration or time to peak and life cycle cost all together can be used to formulate a multiple objective optimization problem to get the most effective solution 2 combined cc and luc impacts should be considered in optimizing the design of rg and it 3 the combined uncertainty effect lying under rainfall and hydraulic soil properties infiltration rate can be considered for the lids such as pp rg gr and rb in the future 4 parameter optimization can be considered for lids especially rb rg it vs and the results can be incorporated into optimization algorithms to determine the optimal solution that satisfies all design objectives 5 in the future multicriteria approaches can be used together with optimization algorithms output to reach the best solution 6 experimental studies can be conducted on various lids except br to collect actual data of their performances runoff volume the concentration of pollutant loads which can be used later for numerical model validation finally the analyses presented herein can benefit different stakeholders in the
