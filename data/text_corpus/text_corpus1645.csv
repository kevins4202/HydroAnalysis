8225,study region southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin south of benin west africa study focus groundwater vulnerability and contamination in benin is a major concern that need proper attention as groundwater resource is the main source for irrigation and drinking water supply in most of districts of benin to protect this precious resource it is important to know the degree of vulnerability in each location of the basin in this study drastic additive model of drastic drasticlclu classic drastic weights modified using shannon s entropy entropy weight drastic entropy weight drasticlclu and avi were applied to the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin to assess the groundwater vulnerability across the basin the applied approaches were validated using nitrate no3 concentration the results showed that the addition of landcover land use parameter to the classic drastic helps to improve the method for better definition of the vulnerable areas in the basin and also the weight modification using entropy improved better the method as entropy weight drasticlclu showed the highest correlation with nitrate concentration across the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin keywords avi drastic drasticlclu entropy weight drastic entropy weight drasticlclu groundwater vulnerability nitrate pollution 1 introduction groundwater resource is a reliable source of water for agricultural industrial and domestic use due to its biological and chemical characteristics it is often used as an important source of drinking water where tap water reticulation infrastructure is undeveloped and surface water is inadequate however this important resource uses by half of the world s population oki and kanae 2006 is facing pollution and depleting at both local and regional scales aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 groundwater pollution is often attributed to the uncontrolled use of chemical compounds razandi et al 2015 agricultural activities such as the application of chemical fertilizers and manure have been identified as the main sources of surface and groundwater pollution since the early twentieth century while nitrate no3 is considered as the main pollutant at global scale ascott et al 2017 busico et al 2020 the pollution of groundwater causes degradation of the water quality and poses great concern because once it is polluted the remediation is extremely difficult requiring large budget and long time therefore monitoring and prevention have become necessary to protect groundwater resources busico et al 2020 in that logic strategies like mapping of groundwater vulnerability to contamination are important and required for groundwater quality and quantity preservation three classes of groundwater vulnerability assessment methods are officially recognized subjective rating index based methods statistical methods and process based methods national research council 1993 overlay and index based methods are based on combining maps of different physiographic attributes geology soil aquifer media depth to water table that control groundwater vulnerability to contamination of a given area by assigning a rating to each attribute the most frequently used are god foster et al 1987 drastic aller et al 1987 avi stempvoort et al 1993 epik doerfliger et al 1997 and sintacs civita 1994 the choice of the method mainly depends on the aquifer type and the data availability kazakis et al 2015 sintacs method is the most commonly applied both for specific and intrinsic vulnerability assessment in the mediterranean basin busico et al 2017 matzeu et al 2017 drastic has been successfully applied by many experts in various geographical location in the world such as china wang et al 2007 yu et al 2010 japan babiker et al 2005 usa frind et al 2006 and iran mohammadi et al 2009 avi was presented by stempvoort et al 1993 to be much easier than drastic and was successfully used by anornu et al 2013 thomas and yusrizal 2018 drastic method is relatively easy to use in practice but the results may be questioned because index based methods rely more on the subjective judgement of the analyst than on the actual hydrogeological processes merchant 1994 gogu and dassargues 2000 frind et al 2006 cheng yu et al 2012 it has been modified in many works this is the case of stigter et al 2006 where drastic was modified into susceptibility index si and cheng yu et al 2012 modified the classic drastic using an entropy weighed and fuzzy optimization they presented entropy weighted fuzzy optimization approach to be reliable for improving the classic drastic by reducing the uncertainty and subjectivity in weight assignment groundwater vulnerability to contamination assessment methods have their own limitations and advantages sometimes applying a set of method evaluate them and then select the one that gives the most reasonable results helps to identify the most suitable in the area of interest shrestha et al 2017 out of the several methods developed by engineers and scientists for groundwater vulnerability assessment two methods drastic and avi have been chosen for the present study they have been widely accepted to meet the needs of most countries globally anornu et al 2013 and based on the approach developed by cheng yu et al 2012 shannon s entropy is used to reduce the subjectivity from the classic drastic nitrate no3 is not naturally present in groundwater in hight concentration its presence indicate pollution from anthropogenic and agricultural activities singh et al 2015 sahajpreet et al 2017 and noori et al 2019 its concentration in groundwater has been selected to verify how reliable is a vulnerability assessment method and successfully used for the validation of rating methods arauzo 2017 elçi 2017 therefore the present paper evaluated the used method by using nitrate concentration in groundwater resources across the study area this paper aims to assess groundwater vulnerability in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin using two methods drastic and avi try to improve classic drastic by modifying standard weights with entropy validate the methods with observed nitrate concentration and use the suitable method to provide an improved groundwater vulnerability map for monitoring and evaluation of groundwater vulnerability in the south region of benin 2 study area the coastal sedimentary basin of benin covers approximately 10 of 114 000 km2 of the overall territory of benin it contains around 36 of the groundwater resources of this territory and shelters currently 65 of its population the republic of benin supplies its population in drinking water mainly from groundwater resources and according to the actual developing rate of the nation groundwater use is supposed to keep increasing hence the interest of this basin for the country in terms of water resources and specially groundwater resources boukari 1998 the basin is located in the south of benin and limited in the north by the precambrian basement in the south by the atlantic ocean in the west by the republic of togo and in the east by the republic of nigeria fig 1 the annual average rainfall across the area decreases from east 1400 mm yr 1 to the west 900 mm yr 1 with mean evapotranspiration about 1300 mm yr 1 it is part of the sub equatorial climate zone with average annual temperature of 27 c but may rise up to 38 c in dry seasons and may decrease down to 19 c in rainy seasons alassane et al 2015 the basin is characterized by wet and warm climate with two dry seasons and two rainy seasons 2 1 geology and hydrogeology the different geological units of the coastal sedimentary basin of benin are found to be part of the guinea gulf sedimentary which is widely shared between four countries of west africa nigeria benin togo and ghana based on the sedimentary indicators and lithology eights stratigraphic units are identified table 1 and fig 1 these eight units are described by boukari and alassane 2007 the southern coastal sedimentary basin contains two main aquifers continental terminal units v vi vii and turonian coniacian lower unit i and two less productive aquifers quaternary unit viii and lower paleocene unit ii separated from each other by clay and marls layers see figs 1 2 and table 1 the continental terminal aquifer is logged in miocene pliocene pleistocene continental deposits and characterized by a direct recharge from rainwater infiltration except the borders bouzid 1971 alassane et al 2015 it begins with a sandy clay marine layer containing glauconite followed by continental deposits which consist of sand sandy clay clay and sandstone le barbé et al 1993 the continental terminal deposits thickness is ranged between 60 m in the north and about 200 m in the southern fig 2 with north south groundwater flow direction its horizontal transmissivity varies from 4 10 3 to 14 10 3 m2 s 1 and the storage coefficient ranges between 2 10 4 and 9 10 4 boukari 1998 and alassane 2004 the second important aquifer named turonian coniacian aquifer is formed by sand and gravel this aquifer is unconfined and shallow in the north and becomes deeper in the southern region where it is confined by clay and marl materials fig 2 the aquifer s transmissivity is from 200 to 750 m2 day based on groundwater pumping tests carried by bouzid 1971 and igip 1984 groundwater flow differs from each plateau to another but trend to be from north west to south east kpegli et al 2018 the lower palaeocene aquifer unit ii consists of limestone and is mostly discontinuous and enclosed within the clay and marl materials its thickness is usually negligible from few meters to about 20 30 m the quaternary aquifer is found near rivers and streams in the ouémé valley fig 1 it consists of alluvial deposits coarse and fine sands that alternate with silt and clay materials the thickness of the quaternary deposits decreases gradually from south to north boukari 2002 kpegli et al 2018 3 materiels and methods the processing method followed in this study is shown in the following flowchart fig 3 3 1 drastic drastic index considers seven hydrogeological parameters aller et al 1987 depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer d r a s t i and c respectively the method produces an index using the weights and ratings assigned to each parameter by experts through delphi panel drastic has been successfully used well documented and reviewed by many researchers shrestha et al 2017 frind et al 2006 gogu and dassargues 2000 merchant 1994 the index is calculated using eq 1 1 d r a s t i c i n d e x k 1 7 p r p w where p is the parameter and r w are respectively the corresponding ratings and weights the relative weight is ranged from 1 to 5 and assigned based on the important role of each parameter in the contaminants flow in groundwater system while the rating is ranged from 1 to 10 and assigned to various ranges of values using curves documented by aller et al 1987 the overall drastic index from eq 1 defines the relative value of groundwater vulnerability whereas high drastic index corresponds to worse potential vulnerability of the aquifer drastic index depends mainly on the aquifer characteristics and has no dimension the methodology flowchart is showed in fig 4 all the data related to the parameters for drastic index computation has been collected and prepared as follow 3 1 1 depth to water table depth to water table is the gap of distance between water table and land surface deep water table allows generally the infiltrated polluted water to have enough contact with the sedimentary layer where process of attenuation become effective in removing contaminants depth to water table map of our study area was realized using more than two thousand and nine hundred wells and boreholes for an interpolation in arcgis using inverse distance weight interpolation tools the boreholes and wells data were collected from the national water service direction of benin dgeau benin 3 1 2 net recharge this parameter represents the quantity of water that reaches the ground water table after penetration through ground surface the net recharge data collected for the study area is not showing a good spatial repartition across the basin to be used as representative data therefore for the groundwater net recharge parameter this study used the soil potential water retention 3 1 3 soil potential water retention the soil potential water retention s physically defines the total amount of water that a soil can store the soil potential water retention is especially used by soil conservation service curve number scs cn method for the direct runoff estimation the scs cn was formerly established by soil conservation services usda in 1954 and recorded in 1956 mishra and ayyub 2019 s is function of the land cover and the soil structure of the given catchment and can be calculated using eq 2 2 s 25400 c n 254 cn is the curve number and it is computed based on the hydrological soil group and land cover land use of the study area 3 1 4 aquifer media the aquifer media map is obtained from the hydrogeological map of the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin it was collected from the ministry of mine energy and water of benin the map is georeferenced and digitalize in arcgis ratings were assigned to each hydrogeological unit 3 1 5 soil media the soil map of the study area was realized by national geographic institute of west africa in 1967 willaine and volkoff 1967 and updated by the republic of benin the update map was acquired from the ministry of rural development of benin the collected map was georeferenced digitalized to create a shapefile in arcgis the shapefile map was reclassified and rates based on the drastic standard 3 1 6 topography topography slope map was developed in arcgis from the digital elevation model dem map using slope spatial analysis tool the dem map was downloaded from the authorized open website dive gis regions with low slope trend to retain water for long this long water retention allows a greater infiltration of recharge of water and a greater potential for contaminant migration and to ground water contamination and vice versa based on this logic high rating was assigned to flat areas 3 1 7 impact of vadose zone the impact of vadose zone map was generated from the geological map of the study area which was obtained from the ministry of mine energy and water of benin after georeferencing the geological map in arcgis it was digitalized and ratings have been assigned to each geological unit 3 1 8 hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity map was realized based generally on the transmissivity data the transmissivity data in the study area was collected from the national society of water of benin soneb and download from some previous research instead of calculating the hydraulic conductivity this study directly uses the transmissivity value for the drastic index computation the transmissivity map was reclassified and rates 3 2 drasticlclu additive model groundwater vulnerability assessment using classic drastic approach does not consider the actual human activities in the land surface as all the input parameters consider only the intrinsic characteristics of an aquifer aname et al 2013 to include actual pollution effect the pollutant type and source are added as an additional new parameter land cover land use lclu the drastic pollution risk index is therefore calculated using eq 3 3 drastic lclu index k 1 8 pr pw where p is the parameter r and w are the ratings and weights respectively 3 2 1 land cover land use lclu the lclu map of the study area is extracted from west africa land cover land use dynamic map from the official website of usaid usgss the most obvious change in land cover is the major expansion of agricultural land across most regions of benin agricultural areas including plantations and irrigated agriculture progressed from 9 2 to 27 1 of the total country area with an increase of over 5 percent about 600 km2 per year between 1975 and 2013 and keep increasing benin s agriculture is characterized by cropland associated with oil palm trees although they already covered most of the terre de barre tb plateau across the sedimentary coastal basin by 1975 oil palms farmland increased by about 28 over the last 38 year period usgs 2015 years ago the coastal sedimentary basin was still covered in dense biologically diverse forest by 2013 it lost 58 of its remaining dense forest which now only represents 0 2 percent of the overall country between 1975 and 2013 benin s population had tripled and as result the surface area of villages towns and cities has expanded by 24 urban and agricultural landscape increased to the detriment of natural ecosystem 3 3 entropy weight drastic although the drastic index method is not difficult in practice however the results can actually be questioned because the index based method relies especially on human judgment from experts frind et al 2006 merchant 1994 also as demonstrated by stigter et al 2006 for chemical contaminants that are conservative drastic excessively considers the attenuation potential of unsaturated layers aquifer and soil and underestimates the dilution role three parameters soil media the effects of vadose zones and hydraulic conductivity of aquifer were removed from drastic and it was modified into a si sustainability index by adding land use as a new parameter to reflect the role of anthropogenic activities the uncertainty of the drastic method arises primarily from the human judgement subjective nature of weights and ratings assigning therefore reducing the uncertainty associated with the subjective nature of assigning weights and ratings would improve and make the method more reliable for groundwater vulnerability assessment entropy has been applied in varied engineering and science disciplines it is effective and appropriate for quantifying risks and uncertainties mishra and ayyub 2019 based on the classic drastic weight modification approach documented by cheng yu et al 2012 this study modified the parameters weights assigned by the conventional drastic shannon s entropy is used to calculate the uncertainty in the ratings assigned to each parameter the concept of entropy information was introduced by shannon as follow mishra and ayyub 2019 4 h c i 1 n p i log p i c is a coefficient pi is the probability of signal i appearing in the information and log pi is the information associates to each particular outcome h represents the expected value of all the signals content the procedure used in this study for weight modification is applied in 3 different steps step 1 normalization the study area is divided in districts using the administrative map of benin here each district represents a target zone assuming that there are n target zones and m parameters in the evaluation method a variable value matrix x is established using ratings eq 5 the matrix is a set of ratings that identify the different characteristics of the subzone for a given single parameter where x ij is the average value of the rating of subzone i for parameter j x ij values are generated in arcgis from the ratings spatial distribution maps using zonal statistics as table tool 5 x x 11 x 12 x 1 m x 21 x 22 x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x nm i 1 2 n j 1 2 m as the goal is to reduce the uncertainty in the ratings and weights assigning this paper uses ratings as input for the entropy method for all parameters low rating indicates low vulnerability to contamination the characteristic matrix x is normalised as follow 6 r ij max x j x ij max x j min x j d r a s t i c and lclu where max x j are the maximum values of xj min x j are the minimum values and the normalization value of parameter j in subzone i is defined as rij after normalization x is turned into the matrix of relative membership degree r 7 r r 11 r 12 r 1m r 21 r 22 r 2m r n1 r n2 r nm step 2 entropy calculation the entropy calculation starts with the calculation of the proportion pij the proportion represents the vulnerability probability of subzone i to parameter j 8 p ij r ij i 1 n rij since more different factors should be given a greater consideration in the assessment system variance was factored into the new weight modification scheme a parameter with a larger variance might have a larger weight the ej variation is calculated as follow the c coefficient in eq 4 is 1 log m which is generally used 9 e j 1 log m i 1 n p ij log p ij step 3 weight adjustment this step consists to a definition of a new weight by modifying the relative weight assigned by drastic the modification takes into consideration the variance in weight specification and the variance in parameter ratings in the classic drastic the new weight is calculated based on cheng yu et al 2012 for each parameter j the new modified weight is the product of the relative variance in the ratings and its classic weight from drastic the new weight is then defined in eq 10 10 w j wj 1 ej j 1 m 1 ej this weight modification is used to reduce the influence of subjective nature and the new vulnerability is assessed using eq 1 by substituting the original weight wj of classic drastic with the modified weight wj the new weight brings a change in the drastic index the new index values are not in the same order with the classic drastic classification therefore the classic drastic classification cannot be used the classification is then adapted to the study by considering the observation from the map realized using the classic drastic 3 4 entropy weight drasticlclu entropy weight drasticlclu approach uses the same procedure as described above the only difference is that this model uses eight parameters instead of seven in the drastic model the entropy weight procedure described above is used to compute the new weight by changing the initial seven parameters to eight parameters once the weights are calculated the new risk to pollution map is developed in arcgis using eq 2 by substituting the original weight wj of classic drastic with the modified weight wj 3 5 aquifer vulnerability index avi the avi aquifer vulnerability index method developed by stempvoort et al 1993 is a groundwater vulnerability to contamination mapping method which considers only two variables the thickness of the sedimentary unit of unsaturated zone d and the hydraulic conductivity k of each of these layers avi is easier than drastic as it uses only two variables it is derived from the hydraulic resistance c which is calculated using the two parameters as showed in the following equation 11 c n 1 i d i k i where c hydraulic resistance di thickness of the sedimentary layer m ki hydraulic conductivity of each layer m day the hydraulic resistance is classify into five classes stempvoort et al 1993 0 10 extremely high 10 100 high 100 1000 moderate 1000 10 000 low 10 000 extremely low in this study to calculate the avi four dominants geological units maestrichtian turonien coniancen eocene upper paleocene miocene pliocene and quaternary deposits are used these are the most important and well known layers the hydraulic conductivity of these layers was collected from previous research across the study basin the thickness of each stratigraphic layer is estimated using two thousand and five hundred boreholes lithologic log data from the dgeau benin data base from arcgis the thickness estimated in each point was interpolated across the study area using kriging interpolation tools 4 results 4 1 drastic and drasticlclu results ratings of all the eight parameters are summarized in appendix table a1 and the spatial distribution maps are showed in fig 5 4 1 1 drastic depth to water table layer was developed based on dgeau base data the layer was reclassified and given ratings range from 1 to 10 fig 5 i the majority of the study area mainly the plateaus have depth to water table higher than 30 m followed by a range of value between 9 9 and 15 5 m appendix table a1 the soil potential water retention calculated using the scs curve number method showed values range between 320 and 323 mm yr in the south of the basin smaller range of values are observed in the north east and east of the basin 193 23 and 212 220 mm yr respectively the aquifer media layer was realized from the hydrogeological map of the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin using spatial analyst tool in arcgis the map was reclassified and ratings have been assigned from 1 to 8 based on the contribution of each hydrogeological unit to vulnerability fig 5 iii the soil media map was reclassified into six different classes rating was assigned to each class and range from 1 to 10 fig 5 iv the area is mainly covered by sand and gravel sand fine grain in the centre and near to the northern region respectively the topography slope layer was developed from dem and reclassified in two classes the basin is relatively flat showing values less than 2 5 and range between 2 5 5 fig 5 v flat area trend to have less runoff and allowing more infiltration therefore it was given ratings from 9 to 10 the impact of vadose zone layer was developed from the geological map of the basin the map was reclassified and ratings have been assigned to each geological unit fig 5 vi the unsaturated zone in the south of the basin consists of sand gravel tidal and lagoon deposits and alluvial deposit which cover more than 35 of the basin the ratings assigned to each geological unit are summarized in appendix table a1 the spatial distribution map of aquifer transmissivity across the basin was reclassified in six classes appendix table a1 ratings was assigned from 5 to 10 and showed in fig 5 vii the land cover land use map of the basin was classified into built up area 6 woody wetland 0 15 forest 5 91 mixed plantation 0 37 woody savanna 16 07 waste sandy land 1 65 cropland and fallow with oil palms 39 10 agriculture 19 05 and water bodies 2 42 dovonou et al 2017 and some unpublished article wrote by the national university of abomey calavi proved that groundwater in some districts of our study area is mainly polluted by agricultural activities based on this the highest rating was assigned to agricultural areas and following the documentation from secunda et al 1998 rating was assigned to each source of pollution fig 5 viii drastic index was calculated by multiplying each map with its respective weight and adding all seven map parameters according to eq 1 using raster calculator in spatial analyst tools of arcgis the intrinsic vulnerability map obtained using drastic method is shown in fig 6 i the map shows that 68 75 of the study area is under low vulnerable zone follow by the medium and high class of vulnerability which covers 19 08 and 11 7 respectively table 2 the area under very low vulnerable zone is small 0 48 drastic method did not show any extremely high vulnerable area 4 1 2 drasticlclu the additive model drasticlclu was realized in arc gis by overlaying the eight parameters using eq 2 and show in fig 6 ii based on this model the area is classified into four potential risk areas statistics showed in table 2 49 12 of the aquifer area is under medium potential risk area while 24 72 21 99 and 4 16 are under high low and very high potential risk areas respectively the modified drasticlclu model showing higher classes of groundwater risk to pollution in the study area compare to those generated using the drastic model drastic and drasticlclu delineate the southern region of the basin under medium high and very high vulnerable zones 4 2 entropy weight drastic and entropy weight drasticlclu 4 2 1 entropy weight drastic using the entropy steps described previously a new weight has been generated for each parameter of drastic as showed in eq 10 the different weights are calculated and summarized in table 3 entropy weight drastic map was generated in arcgis using raster calculator tool by substituting the new entropy weight in eq 1 the intrinsic vulnerability map using entropy weight drastic is shown in fig 6 iii based on the observation from the classic drastic map the map obtained using entropy weight drastic was classified in three vulnerability classes table 4 and fig 6 iii low medium and high vulnerable zones which occupied 50 22 32 65 and 17 13 respectively compare to the classic drastic this model showed no very low vulnerable zone but a higher percentage for the areas under medium and high vulnerable area 4 2 2 entropy weight drasticlclu new modified weight using the eight parameters was calculated using the entropy weigh methods described above the calculated weights are showed in table 3 the groundwater risk to pollution map using entropy weight drasticlclu is shown in fig 6 iv with this model the basin is divided into very high high medium and low class of potential risk table 4 and fig 6 iv large area of the study region is occupied by medium groundwater risk to pollution area 57 43 the low potential risk area is mainly in north east and some central part of the study basin and covers 21 99 of the overall area 24 72 and 4 16 are covered by high and very high potential risk to pollution respectively 4 3 avi results the thickness estimated for each layer is shown in fig 7 the clay layer is extremely thin in the south of the region with an increasing thickness from the south to the center in the center of the study area this layer is thick with an estimated thickness reaching about 111 m and start to decrease when going to the northern region the sand layer is found to be relatively thick in the center and the southern region of the study basin sand layer thickness reaches 60 m in certain region fig 7 sand layer thickness sandy clay layer is showing an average thickness between 40 and 80 m across the basin this layer is less thick in the south and thinner in the south east the sand gravel layer is showing a thickness relatively important in the plateaus this layer thickness decreases from the center to the norther region the hydraulic conductivity of the four layers used is collected and summarized in table 5 the intrinsic groundwater vulnerability map using avi is shown in fig 8 the map was realized in arcgis using the estimated thicknesses and hydraulic conductivity of each layer according to eq 11 in case of avi model the study basin is under three classes of vulnerability both table 6 and fig 8 the low class of vulnerability is found in small part of center and north east of the study area this class of vulnerability covers just 0 083 of the overall basin the largest part of the study basin is occupied by moderate class of vulnerability 68 28 the rest of the area is under high class of vulnerability which is found across the area this occupied 31 66 of the total basin 5 discussion 5 1 spatial correlation between the vulnerability maps to make a comparison between the different approaches used it is important to see the similarities and differences between the results from each model beside the observation and interpretation of maps this study chose to show the spatial relationship between the vulnerability and risk to pollution maps produced from each model by calculating the spatial correlation the spatial correlation between all the groundwater vulnerability assessment maps is calculated in arc gis and showed in table 7 the spatial correlation between all the drastic approaches is higher than 0 85 this high correlation proved that all these approaches are showing similar results but there are still some significant differences too the correlation between drastic approaches and avi is between 0 34 and 0 31 this negative correlation observed showed that drastic and avi are showing same class of vulnerability mainly in term of medium class of vulnerability in some regions of the study basin but still the correlation coefficient is too low the study basin contains more 65 of the overall population of benin and due to lack of effective wastewater infrastructures domestic and industrial wastewater generated is not collected and appropriately treated this contribute to pollution of shallow aquifer and this can be observed in case of drastic approaches entropy weight drasticlclu in the south of the basin where the vulnerability is high and very high because the area corresponds to build up areas with high population density and insufficient sewerage systems avi also showed high vulnerability class in the south of the basin but not in the appropriate districts if we compare avi map to lclu map avi results showed high vulnerable zone in the north specially in the north west of the study basin whereas all the drastic approaches showed low and medium class of vulnerability in the same region of the basin avi did not show any very high class of vulnerability the results in term of low and high risk zones are less comparable for drastic approaches and avi the big difference between groundwater vulnerable areas assessment in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin maps using drastic and avi is also observed by the low correlation between the different methods 5 2 validation of the used methods with nitrate no3 concentration groundwater nitrate concentration is commonly used in many researches as main pollutant of groundwater to evaluate the actual human influence on the aquifer because in general nitrate doesn t naturally exist in groundwater and its presence in the groundwater resource is mostly related to a contamination from anthropogenic activities and agricultural activities singh et al 2015 sahajpreet et al 2017 and noori et al 2019 its concentration across the study area can help to determine which one from the used method is giving greater definition of the vulnerable areas nitrate concentration in 234 wells and boreholes across the study area was used for interpolation in arcgis two different correlation coefficients are calculated pearson s correlation coefficient and spearman s rank correlation coefficient the calculated correlations are summarized in table 8 and the plots showed in fig 9 some previous research on the study basin such as dovonou et al 2017 and unpublished papers wrote as graduation thesis in the university of abomey calavi benin have proved that groundwater in the study region is mainly polluted by nitrate and nitrite therefore the best method for groundwater vulnerability mapping in the study basin should show a good correlation with nitrate concentration based on pearson correlation coefficient the degree of relationship between avi and nitrate concentration across the study basin is very weak in order of 0 08 drastic approaches and nitrate concentration have showed moderate correlation with values range between 0 53 and 0 61 this indicates that drastic approaches trend to give better estimation of the vulnerable and pollution risk zones compare to avi the best correlation is observed between drasticlclu and nitrate correlation the reason for this correlation is probably the consideration of the additive parameter lclu which helps to improve the method by including the actual pollution sources for better definition of vulnerable areas according to spearman rank coefficient correlation the correlation between nitrate and avi is 0 09 this correlation is too low to be considered drastic approaches and nitrate showing a correlation range between 0 75 and 0 78 this is found to be in the order of value showed by some applications in the world kazakis et al 2015 huan et al 2012 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 the strongest correlation is observed between entropy weight drasticlclu and nitrate concentration 0 78 first the modification of drastic by adding a new parameter to include the actual pollution source improved the classic model by showing a better correlation with nitrate and second the modification of the conventional weight using entropy weight approach helped to increase the correlation with nitrate across the study area groundwater vulnerability to pollution map assessed using entropy weight drasticlclu showed that south east south west and central districts of the study basin are covered by high and very high vulnerable zones these areas with high and very high potential risk classes contain some districts that were reported as groundwater pollution zones by boukari 1998 dovonou et al 2017 if we compare the pollution risk map from entropy weight drasticlclu and the lclu map most of the high and very high risk areas are concentrate in the build up and agricultural areas waste from these areas may serve as source of pollution 5 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is used to indicate the most important and influential variables in the intrinsic groundwater vulnerability prediction this is important both for the experts that implement a vulnerability model and for the users that utilize vulnerability maps it can guide users to a more efficient interpretation of the vulnerability index this paper used single parameter sensitivity and map removal sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of each single parameter on the final groundwater vulnerability map 5 3 1 single parameter sensitivity analysis the single parameter sensitivity analysis makes a comparison between the real or effective weight of each parameter and the theoretical weight from the standard drastic w the effective weight is calculated for each cell using eq 12 babiker et al 2005 12 w p r p w v x 100 where pr and pw are respectively the rating value and weight of each parameter w is the effective weight and v is the overall vulnerability index the effective weight of each parameter was calculated and summarized in table 9 5 3 2 map removal sensitivity analysis this method is used to determine the sensitivity of each parameter to the overall vulnerability map by removing one or more parameters at once from the overall vulnerability it is expressed in eq 13 babiker et al 2005 13 s v n v n v x 100 where v is the modified drastic index v is the overall drastic index n and n are respectively the number of input layers used to calculate v and v and s is the sensitivity value table 10 is showing the sensitivity of each removing parameter both sensitivity analysis method showed lclu and soil potential water retention as the most important parameters in groundwater pollution risk assessment in the study basin these parameters lead to the high and very high potential risk observed in the south of the basin 6 conclusion the present study used drastic approaches and avi methods for groundwater vulnerability assessment in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin the drastic method has been modified first by considering a new parameter showing the impacts of human on groundwater vulnerability lclu second by using entropy to reduce the uncertainty in the subjective nature from assigning weight and ratings in the classic drastic beside the spatial correlation used to compare the methods nitrate concentration in groundwater resources across our study area was used to validate the different approaches used in the study the results of the actual study can be summarized as follow compare to avi drastic gave better simulation of groundwater vulnerability to contamination in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin the modification of drastic by adding lclu improved the method for better result furthermore the modification of the standard weight using shannon s entropy improved the method for a better performance based on the correlation observed between entropy weight drasticlclu and nitrate concentration therefore in practice entropy weight drasticlclu can be used to simulate groundwater potential risk to pollution in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin using entropy weight drasticlclu the majority of the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin is covered by moderate vulnerable area as the moderate class of vulnerability covers 57 43 of the overall basin 21 56 18 and 2 17 are covered by low high and very high respectively lclu and net recharge parameters came out as the most important parameters from both single sensitivity and map removal sensitivity analysis this importance explains the medium to very high vulnerability classes observed in the south of the study area fig 6 iv as net recharge is mainly high in that area and the lclu high ratings due the importance of these two parameters the accuracy in their data collection is important for better vulnerability to pollution assessment declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists

8225,study region southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin south of benin west africa study focus groundwater vulnerability and contamination in benin is a major concern that need proper attention as groundwater resource is the main source for irrigation and drinking water supply in most of districts of benin to protect this precious resource it is important to know the degree of vulnerability in each location of the basin in this study drastic additive model of drastic drasticlclu classic drastic weights modified using shannon s entropy entropy weight drastic entropy weight drasticlclu and avi were applied to the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin to assess the groundwater vulnerability across the basin the applied approaches were validated using nitrate no3 concentration the results showed that the addition of landcover land use parameter to the classic drastic helps to improve the method for better definition of the vulnerable areas in the basin and also the weight modification using entropy improved better the method as entropy weight drasticlclu showed the highest correlation with nitrate concentration across the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin keywords avi drastic drasticlclu entropy weight drastic entropy weight drasticlclu groundwater vulnerability nitrate pollution 1 introduction groundwater resource is a reliable source of water for agricultural industrial and domestic use due to its biological and chemical characteristics it is often used as an important source of drinking water where tap water reticulation infrastructure is undeveloped and surface water is inadequate however this important resource uses by half of the world s population oki and kanae 2006 is facing pollution and depleting at both local and regional scales aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 groundwater pollution is often attributed to the uncontrolled use of chemical compounds razandi et al 2015 agricultural activities such as the application of chemical fertilizers and manure have been identified as the main sources of surface and groundwater pollution since the early twentieth century while nitrate no3 is considered as the main pollutant at global scale ascott et al 2017 busico et al 2020 the pollution of groundwater causes degradation of the water quality and poses great concern because once it is polluted the remediation is extremely difficult requiring large budget and long time therefore monitoring and prevention have become necessary to protect groundwater resources busico et al 2020 in that logic strategies like mapping of groundwater vulnerability to contamination are important and required for groundwater quality and quantity preservation three classes of groundwater vulnerability assessment methods are officially recognized subjective rating index based methods statistical methods and process based methods national research council 1993 overlay and index based methods are based on combining maps of different physiographic attributes geology soil aquifer media depth to water table that control groundwater vulnerability to contamination of a given area by assigning a rating to each attribute the most frequently used are god foster et al 1987 drastic aller et al 1987 avi stempvoort et al 1993 epik doerfliger et al 1997 and sintacs civita 1994 the choice of the method mainly depends on the aquifer type and the data availability kazakis et al 2015 sintacs method is the most commonly applied both for specific and intrinsic vulnerability assessment in the mediterranean basin busico et al 2017 matzeu et al 2017 drastic has been successfully applied by many experts in various geographical location in the world such as china wang et al 2007 yu et al 2010 japan babiker et al 2005 usa frind et al 2006 and iran mohammadi et al 2009 avi was presented by stempvoort et al 1993 to be much easier than drastic and was successfully used by anornu et al 2013 thomas and yusrizal 2018 drastic method is relatively easy to use in practice but the results may be questioned because index based methods rely more on the subjective judgement of the analyst than on the actual hydrogeological processes merchant 1994 gogu and dassargues 2000 frind et al 2006 cheng yu et al 2012 it has been modified in many works this is the case of stigter et al 2006 where drastic was modified into susceptibility index si and cheng yu et al 2012 modified the classic drastic using an entropy weighed and fuzzy optimization they presented entropy weighted fuzzy optimization approach to be reliable for improving the classic drastic by reducing the uncertainty and subjectivity in weight assignment groundwater vulnerability to contamination assessment methods have their own limitations and advantages sometimes applying a set of method evaluate them and then select the one that gives the most reasonable results helps to identify the most suitable in the area of interest shrestha et al 2017 out of the several methods developed by engineers and scientists for groundwater vulnerability assessment two methods drastic and avi have been chosen for the present study they have been widely accepted to meet the needs of most countries globally anornu et al 2013 and based on the approach developed by cheng yu et al 2012 shannon s entropy is used to reduce the subjectivity from the classic drastic nitrate no3 is not naturally present in groundwater in hight concentration its presence indicate pollution from anthropogenic and agricultural activities singh et al 2015 sahajpreet et al 2017 and noori et al 2019 its concentration in groundwater has been selected to verify how reliable is a vulnerability assessment method and successfully used for the validation of rating methods arauzo 2017 elçi 2017 therefore the present paper evaluated the used method by using nitrate concentration in groundwater resources across the study area this paper aims to assess groundwater vulnerability in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin using two methods drastic and avi try to improve classic drastic by modifying standard weights with entropy validate the methods with observed nitrate concentration and use the suitable method to provide an improved groundwater vulnerability map for monitoring and evaluation of groundwater vulnerability in the south region of benin 2 study area the coastal sedimentary basin of benin covers approximately 10 of 114 000 km2 of the overall territory of benin it contains around 36 of the groundwater resources of this territory and shelters currently 65 of its population the republic of benin supplies its population in drinking water mainly from groundwater resources and according to the actual developing rate of the nation groundwater use is supposed to keep increasing hence the interest of this basin for the country in terms of water resources and specially groundwater resources boukari 1998 the basin is located in the south of benin and limited in the north by the precambrian basement in the south by the atlantic ocean in the west by the republic of togo and in the east by the republic of nigeria fig 1 the annual average rainfall across the area decreases from east 1400 mm yr 1 to the west 900 mm yr 1 with mean evapotranspiration about 1300 mm yr 1 it is part of the sub equatorial climate zone with average annual temperature of 27 c but may rise up to 38 c in dry seasons and may decrease down to 19 c in rainy seasons alassane et al 2015 the basin is characterized by wet and warm climate with two dry seasons and two rainy seasons 2 1 geology and hydrogeology the different geological units of the coastal sedimentary basin of benin are found to be part of the guinea gulf sedimentary which is widely shared between four countries of west africa nigeria benin togo and ghana based on the sedimentary indicators and lithology eights stratigraphic units are identified table 1 and fig 1 these eight units are described by boukari and alassane 2007 the southern coastal sedimentary basin contains two main aquifers continental terminal units v vi vii and turonian coniacian lower unit i and two less productive aquifers quaternary unit viii and lower paleocene unit ii separated from each other by clay and marls layers see figs 1 2 and table 1 the continental terminal aquifer is logged in miocene pliocene pleistocene continental deposits and characterized by a direct recharge from rainwater infiltration except the borders bouzid 1971 alassane et al 2015 it begins with a sandy clay marine layer containing glauconite followed by continental deposits which consist of sand sandy clay clay and sandstone le barbé et al 1993 the continental terminal deposits thickness is ranged between 60 m in the north and about 200 m in the southern fig 2 with north south groundwater flow direction its horizontal transmissivity varies from 4 10 3 to 14 10 3 m2 s 1 and the storage coefficient ranges between 2 10 4 and 9 10 4 boukari 1998 and alassane 2004 the second important aquifer named turonian coniacian aquifer is formed by sand and gravel this aquifer is unconfined and shallow in the north and becomes deeper in the southern region where it is confined by clay and marl materials fig 2 the aquifer s transmissivity is from 200 to 750 m2 day based on groundwater pumping tests carried by bouzid 1971 and igip 1984 groundwater flow differs from each plateau to another but trend to be from north west to south east kpegli et al 2018 the lower palaeocene aquifer unit ii consists of limestone and is mostly discontinuous and enclosed within the clay and marl materials its thickness is usually negligible from few meters to about 20 30 m the quaternary aquifer is found near rivers and streams in the ouémé valley fig 1 it consists of alluvial deposits coarse and fine sands that alternate with silt and clay materials the thickness of the quaternary deposits decreases gradually from south to north boukari 2002 kpegli et al 2018 3 materiels and methods the processing method followed in this study is shown in the following flowchart fig 3 3 1 drastic drastic index considers seven hydrogeological parameters aller et al 1987 depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer d r a s t i and c respectively the method produces an index using the weights and ratings assigned to each parameter by experts through delphi panel drastic has been successfully used well documented and reviewed by many researchers shrestha et al 2017 frind et al 2006 gogu and dassargues 2000 merchant 1994 the index is calculated using eq 1 1 d r a s t i c i n d e x k 1 7 p r p w where p is the parameter and r w are respectively the corresponding ratings and weights the relative weight is ranged from 1 to 5 and assigned based on the important role of each parameter in the contaminants flow in groundwater system while the rating is ranged from 1 to 10 and assigned to various ranges of values using curves documented by aller et al 1987 the overall drastic index from eq 1 defines the relative value of groundwater vulnerability whereas high drastic index corresponds to worse potential vulnerability of the aquifer drastic index depends mainly on the aquifer characteristics and has no dimension the methodology flowchart is showed in fig 4 all the data related to the parameters for drastic index computation has been collected and prepared as follow 3 1 1 depth to water table depth to water table is the gap of distance between water table and land surface deep water table allows generally the infiltrated polluted water to have enough contact with the sedimentary layer where process of attenuation become effective in removing contaminants depth to water table map of our study area was realized using more than two thousand and nine hundred wells and boreholes for an interpolation in arcgis using inverse distance weight interpolation tools the boreholes and wells data were collected from the national water service direction of benin dgeau benin 3 1 2 net recharge this parameter represents the quantity of water that reaches the ground water table after penetration through ground surface the net recharge data collected for the study area is not showing a good spatial repartition across the basin to be used as representative data therefore for the groundwater net recharge parameter this study used the soil potential water retention 3 1 3 soil potential water retention the soil potential water retention s physically defines the total amount of water that a soil can store the soil potential water retention is especially used by soil conservation service curve number scs cn method for the direct runoff estimation the scs cn was formerly established by soil conservation services usda in 1954 and recorded in 1956 mishra and ayyub 2019 s is function of the land cover and the soil structure of the given catchment and can be calculated using eq 2 2 s 25400 c n 254 cn is the curve number and it is computed based on the hydrological soil group and land cover land use of the study area 3 1 4 aquifer media the aquifer media map is obtained from the hydrogeological map of the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin it was collected from the ministry of mine energy and water of benin the map is georeferenced and digitalize in arcgis ratings were assigned to each hydrogeological unit 3 1 5 soil media the soil map of the study area was realized by national geographic institute of west africa in 1967 willaine and volkoff 1967 and updated by the republic of benin the update map was acquired from the ministry of rural development of benin the collected map was georeferenced digitalized to create a shapefile in arcgis the shapefile map was reclassified and rates based on the drastic standard 3 1 6 topography topography slope map was developed in arcgis from the digital elevation model dem map using slope spatial analysis tool the dem map was downloaded from the authorized open website dive gis regions with low slope trend to retain water for long this long water retention allows a greater infiltration of recharge of water and a greater potential for contaminant migration and to ground water contamination and vice versa based on this logic high rating was assigned to flat areas 3 1 7 impact of vadose zone the impact of vadose zone map was generated from the geological map of the study area which was obtained from the ministry of mine energy and water of benin after georeferencing the geological map in arcgis it was digitalized and ratings have been assigned to each geological unit 3 1 8 hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity map was realized based generally on the transmissivity data the transmissivity data in the study area was collected from the national society of water of benin soneb and download from some previous research instead of calculating the hydraulic conductivity this study directly uses the transmissivity value for the drastic index computation the transmissivity map was reclassified and rates 3 2 drasticlclu additive model groundwater vulnerability assessment using classic drastic approach does not consider the actual human activities in the land surface as all the input parameters consider only the intrinsic characteristics of an aquifer aname et al 2013 to include actual pollution effect the pollutant type and source are added as an additional new parameter land cover land use lclu the drastic pollution risk index is therefore calculated using eq 3 3 drastic lclu index k 1 8 pr pw where p is the parameter r and w are the ratings and weights respectively 3 2 1 land cover land use lclu the lclu map of the study area is extracted from west africa land cover land use dynamic map from the official website of usaid usgss the most obvious change in land cover is the major expansion of agricultural land across most regions of benin agricultural areas including plantations and irrigated agriculture progressed from 9 2 to 27 1 of the total country area with an increase of over 5 percent about 600 km2 per year between 1975 and 2013 and keep increasing benin s agriculture is characterized by cropland associated with oil palm trees although they already covered most of the terre de barre tb plateau across the sedimentary coastal basin by 1975 oil palms farmland increased by about 28 over the last 38 year period usgs 2015 years ago the coastal sedimentary basin was still covered in dense biologically diverse forest by 2013 it lost 58 of its remaining dense forest which now only represents 0 2 percent of the overall country between 1975 and 2013 benin s population had tripled and as result the surface area of villages towns and cities has expanded by 24 urban and agricultural landscape increased to the detriment of natural ecosystem 3 3 entropy weight drastic although the drastic index method is not difficult in practice however the results can actually be questioned because the index based method relies especially on human judgment from experts frind et al 2006 merchant 1994 also as demonstrated by stigter et al 2006 for chemical contaminants that are conservative drastic excessively considers the attenuation potential of unsaturated layers aquifer and soil and underestimates the dilution role three parameters soil media the effects of vadose zones and hydraulic conductivity of aquifer were removed from drastic and it was modified into a si sustainability index by adding land use as a new parameter to reflect the role of anthropogenic activities the uncertainty of the drastic method arises primarily from the human judgement subjective nature of weights and ratings assigning therefore reducing the uncertainty associated with the subjective nature of assigning weights and ratings would improve and make the method more reliable for groundwater vulnerability assessment entropy has been applied in varied engineering and science disciplines it is effective and appropriate for quantifying risks and uncertainties mishra and ayyub 2019 based on the classic drastic weight modification approach documented by cheng yu et al 2012 this study modified the parameters weights assigned by the conventional drastic shannon s entropy is used to calculate the uncertainty in the ratings assigned to each parameter the concept of entropy information was introduced by shannon as follow mishra and ayyub 2019 4 h c i 1 n p i log p i c is a coefficient pi is the probability of signal i appearing in the information and log pi is the information associates to each particular outcome h represents the expected value of all the signals content the procedure used in this study for weight modification is applied in 3 different steps step 1 normalization the study area is divided in districts using the administrative map of benin here each district represents a target zone assuming that there are n target zones and m parameters in the evaluation method a variable value matrix x is established using ratings eq 5 the matrix is a set of ratings that identify the different characteristics of the subzone for a given single parameter where x ij is the average value of the rating of subzone i for parameter j x ij values are generated in arcgis from the ratings spatial distribution maps using zonal statistics as table tool 5 x x 11 x 12 x 1 m x 21 x 22 x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x nm i 1 2 n j 1 2 m as the goal is to reduce the uncertainty in the ratings and weights assigning this paper uses ratings as input for the entropy method for all parameters low rating indicates low vulnerability to contamination the characteristic matrix x is normalised as follow 6 r ij max x j x ij max x j min x j d r a s t i c and lclu where max x j are the maximum values of xj min x j are the minimum values and the normalization value of parameter j in subzone i is defined as rij after normalization x is turned into the matrix of relative membership degree r 7 r r 11 r 12 r 1m r 21 r 22 r 2m r n1 r n2 r nm step 2 entropy calculation the entropy calculation starts with the calculation of the proportion pij the proportion represents the vulnerability probability of subzone i to parameter j 8 p ij r ij i 1 n rij since more different factors should be given a greater consideration in the assessment system variance was factored into the new weight modification scheme a parameter with a larger variance might have a larger weight the ej variation is calculated as follow the c coefficient in eq 4 is 1 log m which is generally used 9 e j 1 log m i 1 n p ij log p ij step 3 weight adjustment this step consists to a definition of a new weight by modifying the relative weight assigned by drastic the modification takes into consideration the variance in weight specification and the variance in parameter ratings in the classic drastic the new weight is calculated based on cheng yu et al 2012 for each parameter j the new modified weight is the product of the relative variance in the ratings and its classic weight from drastic the new weight is then defined in eq 10 10 w j wj 1 ej j 1 m 1 ej this weight modification is used to reduce the influence of subjective nature and the new vulnerability is assessed using eq 1 by substituting the original weight wj of classic drastic with the modified weight wj the new weight brings a change in the drastic index the new index values are not in the same order with the classic drastic classification therefore the classic drastic classification cannot be used the classification is then adapted to the study by considering the observation from the map realized using the classic drastic 3 4 entropy weight drasticlclu entropy weight drasticlclu approach uses the same procedure as described above the only difference is that this model uses eight parameters instead of seven in the drastic model the entropy weight procedure described above is used to compute the new weight by changing the initial seven parameters to eight parameters once the weights are calculated the new risk to pollution map is developed in arcgis using eq 2 by substituting the original weight wj of classic drastic with the modified weight wj 3 5 aquifer vulnerability index avi the avi aquifer vulnerability index method developed by stempvoort et al 1993 is a groundwater vulnerability to contamination mapping method which considers only two variables the thickness of the sedimentary unit of unsaturated zone d and the hydraulic conductivity k of each of these layers avi is easier than drastic as it uses only two variables it is derived from the hydraulic resistance c which is calculated using the two parameters as showed in the following equation 11 c n 1 i d i k i where c hydraulic resistance di thickness of the sedimentary layer m ki hydraulic conductivity of each layer m day the hydraulic resistance is classify into five classes stempvoort et al 1993 0 10 extremely high 10 100 high 100 1000 moderate 1000 10 000 low 10 000 extremely low in this study to calculate the avi four dominants geological units maestrichtian turonien coniancen eocene upper paleocene miocene pliocene and quaternary deposits are used these are the most important and well known layers the hydraulic conductivity of these layers was collected from previous research across the study basin the thickness of each stratigraphic layer is estimated using two thousand and five hundred boreholes lithologic log data from the dgeau benin data base from arcgis the thickness estimated in each point was interpolated across the study area using kriging interpolation tools 4 results 4 1 drastic and drasticlclu results ratings of all the eight parameters are summarized in appendix table a1 and the spatial distribution maps are showed in fig 5 4 1 1 drastic depth to water table layer was developed based on dgeau base data the layer was reclassified and given ratings range from 1 to 10 fig 5 i the majority of the study area mainly the plateaus have depth to water table higher than 30 m followed by a range of value between 9 9 and 15 5 m appendix table a1 the soil potential water retention calculated using the scs curve number method showed values range between 320 and 323 mm yr in the south of the basin smaller range of values are observed in the north east and east of the basin 193 23 and 212 220 mm yr respectively the aquifer media layer was realized from the hydrogeological map of the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin using spatial analyst tool in arcgis the map was reclassified and ratings have been assigned from 1 to 8 based on the contribution of each hydrogeological unit to vulnerability fig 5 iii the soil media map was reclassified into six different classes rating was assigned to each class and range from 1 to 10 fig 5 iv the area is mainly covered by sand and gravel sand fine grain in the centre and near to the northern region respectively the topography slope layer was developed from dem and reclassified in two classes the basin is relatively flat showing values less than 2 5 and range between 2 5 5 fig 5 v flat area trend to have less runoff and allowing more infiltration therefore it was given ratings from 9 to 10 the impact of vadose zone layer was developed from the geological map of the basin the map was reclassified and ratings have been assigned to each geological unit fig 5 vi the unsaturated zone in the south of the basin consists of sand gravel tidal and lagoon deposits and alluvial deposit which cover more than 35 of the basin the ratings assigned to each geological unit are summarized in appendix table a1 the spatial distribution map of aquifer transmissivity across the basin was reclassified in six classes appendix table a1 ratings was assigned from 5 to 10 and showed in fig 5 vii the land cover land use map of the basin was classified into built up area 6 woody wetland 0 15 forest 5 91 mixed plantation 0 37 woody savanna 16 07 waste sandy land 1 65 cropland and fallow with oil palms 39 10 agriculture 19 05 and water bodies 2 42 dovonou et al 2017 and some unpublished article wrote by the national university of abomey calavi proved that groundwater in some districts of our study area is mainly polluted by agricultural activities based on this the highest rating was assigned to agricultural areas and following the documentation from secunda et al 1998 rating was assigned to each source of pollution fig 5 viii drastic index was calculated by multiplying each map with its respective weight and adding all seven map parameters according to eq 1 using raster calculator in spatial analyst tools of arcgis the intrinsic vulnerability map obtained using drastic method is shown in fig 6 i the map shows that 68 75 of the study area is under low vulnerable zone follow by the medium and high class of vulnerability which covers 19 08 and 11 7 respectively table 2 the area under very low vulnerable zone is small 0 48 drastic method did not show any extremely high vulnerable area 4 1 2 drasticlclu the additive model drasticlclu was realized in arc gis by overlaying the eight parameters using eq 2 and show in fig 6 ii based on this model the area is classified into four potential risk areas statistics showed in table 2 49 12 of the aquifer area is under medium potential risk area while 24 72 21 99 and 4 16 are under high low and very high potential risk areas respectively the modified drasticlclu model showing higher classes of groundwater risk to pollution in the study area compare to those generated using the drastic model drastic and drasticlclu delineate the southern region of the basin under medium high and very high vulnerable zones 4 2 entropy weight drastic and entropy weight drasticlclu 4 2 1 entropy weight drastic using the entropy steps described previously a new weight has been generated for each parameter of drastic as showed in eq 10 the different weights are calculated and summarized in table 3 entropy weight drastic map was generated in arcgis using raster calculator tool by substituting the new entropy weight in eq 1 the intrinsic vulnerability map using entropy weight drastic is shown in fig 6 iii based on the observation from the classic drastic map the map obtained using entropy weight drastic was classified in three vulnerability classes table 4 and fig 6 iii low medium and high vulnerable zones which occupied 50 22 32 65 and 17 13 respectively compare to the classic drastic this model showed no very low vulnerable zone but a higher percentage for the areas under medium and high vulnerable area 4 2 2 entropy weight drasticlclu new modified weight using the eight parameters was calculated using the entropy weigh methods described above the calculated weights are showed in table 3 the groundwater risk to pollution map using entropy weight drasticlclu is shown in fig 6 iv with this model the basin is divided into very high high medium and low class of potential risk table 4 and fig 6 iv large area of the study region is occupied by medium groundwater risk to pollution area 57 43 the low potential risk area is mainly in north east and some central part of the study basin and covers 21 99 of the overall area 24 72 and 4 16 are covered by high and very high potential risk to pollution respectively 4 3 avi results the thickness estimated for each layer is shown in fig 7 the clay layer is extremely thin in the south of the region with an increasing thickness from the south to the center in the center of the study area this layer is thick with an estimated thickness reaching about 111 m and start to decrease when going to the northern region the sand layer is found to be relatively thick in the center and the southern region of the study basin sand layer thickness reaches 60 m in certain region fig 7 sand layer thickness sandy clay layer is showing an average thickness between 40 and 80 m across the basin this layer is less thick in the south and thinner in the south east the sand gravel layer is showing a thickness relatively important in the plateaus this layer thickness decreases from the center to the norther region the hydraulic conductivity of the four layers used is collected and summarized in table 5 the intrinsic groundwater vulnerability map using avi is shown in fig 8 the map was realized in arcgis using the estimated thicknesses and hydraulic conductivity of each layer according to eq 11 in case of avi model the study basin is under three classes of vulnerability both table 6 and fig 8 the low class of vulnerability is found in small part of center and north east of the study area this class of vulnerability covers just 0 083 of the overall basin the largest part of the study basin is occupied by moderate class of vulnerability 68 28 the rest of the area is under high class of vulnerability which is found across the area this occupied 31 66 of the total basin 5 discussion 5 1 spatial correlation between the vulnerability maps to make a comparison between the different approaches used it is important to see the similarities and differences between the results from each model beside the observation and interpretation of maps this study chose to show the spatial relationship between the vulnerability and risk to pollution maps produced from each model by calculating the spatial correlation the spatial correlation between all the groundwater vulnerability assessment maps is calculated in arc gis and showed in table 7 the spatial correlation between all the drastic approaches is higher than 0 85 this high correlation proved that all these approaches are showing similar results but there are still some significant differences too the correlation between drastic approaches and avi is between 0 34 and 0 31 this negative correlation observed showed that drastic and avi are showing same class of vulnerability mainly in term of medium class of vulnerability in some regions of the study basin but still the correlation coefficient is too low the study basin contains more 65 of the overall population of benin and due to lack of effective wastewater infrastructures domestic and industrial wastewater generated is not collected and appropriately treated this contribute to pollution of shallow aquifer and this can be observed in case of drastic approaches entropy weight drasticlclu in the south of the basin where the vulnerability is high and very high because the area corresponds to build up areas with high population density and insufficient sewerage systems avi also showed high vulnerability class in the south of the basin but not in the appropriate districts if we compare avi map to lclu map avi results showed high vulnerable zone in the north specially in the north west of the study basin whereas all the drastic approaches showed low and medium class of vulnerability in the same region of the basin avi did not show any very high class of vulnerability the results in term of low and high risk zones are less comparable for drastic approaches and avi the big difference between groundwater vulnerable areas assessment in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin maps using drastic and avi is also observed by the low correlation between the different methods 5 2 validation of the used methods with nitrate no3 concentration groundwater nitrate concentration is commonly used in many researches as main pollutant of groundwater to evaluate the actual human influence on the aquifer because in general nitrate doesn t naturally exist in groundwater and its presence in the groundwater resource is mostly related to a contamination from anthropogenic activities and agricultural activities singh et al 2015 sahajpreet et al 2017 and noori et al 2019 its concentration across the study area can help to determine which one from the used method is giving greater definition of the vulnerable areas nitrate concentration in 234 wells and boreholes across the study area was used for interpolation in arcgis two different correlation coefficients are calculated pearson s correlation coefficient and spearman s rank correlation coefficient the calculated correlations are summarized in table 8 and the plots showed in fig 9 some previous research on the study basin such as dovonou et al 2017 and unpublished papers wrote as graduation thesis in the university of abomey calavi benin have proved that groundwater in the study region is mainly polluted by nitrate and nitrite therefore the best method for groundwater vulnerability mapping in the study basin should show a good correlation with nitrate concentration based on pearson correlation coefficient the degree of relationship between avi and nitrate concentration across the study basin is very weak in order of 0 08 drastic approaches and nitrate concentration have showed moderate correlation with values range between 0 53 and 0 61 this indicates that drastic approaches trend to give better estimation of the vulnerable and pollution risk zones compare to avi the best correlation is observed between drasticlclu and nitrate correlation the reason for this correlation is probably the consideration of the additive parameter lclu which helps to improve the method by including the actual pollution sources for better definition of vulnerable areas according to spearman rank coefficient correlation the correlation between nitrate and avi is 0 09 this correlation is too low to be considered drastic approaches and nitrate showing a correlation range between 0 75 and 0 78 this is found to be in the order of value showed by some applications in the world kazakis et al 2015 huan et al 2012 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 the strongest correlation is observed between entropy weight drasticlclu and nitrate concentration 0 78 first the modification of drastic by adding a new parameter to include the actual pollution source improved the classic model by showing a better correlation with nitrate and second the modification of the conventional weight using entropy weight approach helped to increase the correlation with nitrate across the study area groundwater vulnerability to pollution map assessed using entropy weight drasticlclu showed that south east south west and central districts of the study basin are covered by high and very high vulnerable zones these areas with high and very high potential risk classes contain some districts that were reported as groundwater pollution zones by boukari 1998 dovonou et al 2017 if we compare the pollution risk map from entropy weight drasticlclu and the lclu map most of the high and very high risk areas are concentrate in the build up and agricultural areas waste from these areas may serve as source of pollution 5 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is used to indicate the most important and influential variables in the intrinsic groundwater vulnerability prediction this is important both for the experts that implement a vulnerability model and for the users that utilize vulnerability maps it can guide users to a more efficient interpretation of the vulnerability index this paper used single parameter sensitivity and map removal sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of each single parameter on the final groundwater vulnerability map 5 3 1 single parameter sensitivity analysis the single parameter sensitivity analysis makes a comparison between the real or effective weight of each parameter and the theoretical weight from the standard drastic w the effective weight is calculated for each cell using eq 12 babiker et al 2005 12 w p r p w v x 100 where pr and pw are respectively the rating value and weight of each parameter w is the effective weight and v is the overall vulnerability index the effective weight of each parameter was calculated and summarized in table 9 5 3 2 map removal sensitivity analysis this method is used to determine the sensitivity of each parameter to the overall vulnerability map by removing one or more parameters at once from the overall vulnerability it is expressed in eq 13 babiker et al 2005 13 s v n v n v x 100 where v is the modified drastic index v is the overall drastic index n and n are respectively the number of input layers used to calculate v and v and s is the sensitivity value table 10 is showing the sensitivity of each removing parameter both sensitivity analysis method showed lclu and soil potential water retention as the most important parameters in groundwater pollution risk assessment in the study basin these parameters lead to the high and very high potential risk observed in the south of the basin 6 conclusion the present study used drastic approaches and avi methods for groundwater vulnerability assessment in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin the drastic method has been modified first by considering a new parameter showing the impacts of human on groundwater vulnerability lclu second by using entropy to reduce the uncertainty in the subjective nature from assigning weight and ratings in the classic drastic beside the spatial correlation used to compare the methods nitrate concentration in groundwater resources across our study area was used to validate the different approaches used in the study the results of the actual study can be summarized as follow compare to avi drastic gave better simulation of groundwater vulnerability to contamination in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin the modification of drastic by adding lclu improved the method for better result furthermore the modification of the standard weight using shannon s entropy improved the method for a better performance based on the correlation observed between entropy weight drasticlclu and nitrate concentration therefore in practice entropy weight drasticlclu can be used to simulate groundwater potential risk to pollution in the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin using entropy weight drasticlclu the majority of the southern coastal sedimentary basin of benin is covered by moderate vulnerable area as the moderate class of vulnerability covers 57 43 of the overall basin 21 56 18 and 2 17 are covered by low high and very high respectively lclu and net recharge parameters came out as the most important parameters from both single sensitivity and map removal sensitivity analysis this importance explains the medium to very high vulnerability classes observed in the south of the study area fig 6 iv as net recharge is mainly high in that area and the lclu high ratings due the importance of these two parameters the accuracy in their data collection is important for better vulnerability to pollution assessment declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists

8226,study region pra river basin prb located in ghana study focus now hydrological and climate change impact studies are shifting towards reliance on openly accessible databases particularly for regions with limited observed datasets there is therefore the need to evaluate the reliability of such datasets in order to reduce modelling uncertainties and boost confidence in modelling results we present an evaluation of the performance of nine cordex rca4 regional climate model simulations in replicating the observed precipitation for a 31 year period 1975 2005 new hydrological insights for the region on the annual timescale canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es reproduced minimal annual mean biases 0 8 18 4 and thus selected for the seasonal and monthly timescale analysis generally with the exception of spring march april and may all the selected models were able to simulate quite well the seasonal climatology of the pra river basin prb with noticeable distinctions in the reproducibility of the spatial patterns variability and magnitude of the observed data the multi model ensemble means indicated strong correlation with observations r 0 75 but with weak spatial variability σ 0 25 it is recommended that for climate impact assessment and hydrologic modelling studies multi model ensembles of canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es be used however on singular basis the canesm2 and hadgem2 es rca4 simulation outputs present better representation of the climate of the basin keywords pra river basin regional climate modelling precipitation cordex africa 1 introduction globally concerns on cutting down greenhouse gas ghgs emissions have gained strides in the past decade owing to the devastating contributory role to climate change o neill et al 2017 pittock 2017 prather and holmes 2017 urry 2015 the exploit to reduce ghgs is further necessitated by increases in human induced causative factors such as population growth agricultural exploitation urbanization and technological advancement which aggravate the climate change phenomenon by altering the atmosphere biospheric system griggs and noguer 2002 liu and bae 2018 morris et al 2017 o neill et al 2017 paul et al 2018 valentini et al 2014 van vuuren et al 2017 based on the medium variant population projection scenario proposed by the un department of economics and social affairs undesa world population is expected to rise from 7 6 billion in 2018 to a total of 11 2 billion by the year 2100 undesa 2017 though the change is not so astronomical compared to the lapse time 79 years from now it is expedient to however acknowledge that these changes will correspondingly trigger surges in socio economic development agriculture diversity and industrialization culminating into major shifts in land uses and climatic patterns inevitably these developmental trajectories will result in alterations of the atmosphere biosphere system with the hydrological cycle being the most affected duan et al 2017 tan et al 2017 in a bid to minimize the impact of such changes in the future hydrologic and climate scientist have foster joint research initiatives of predicting future hydrological dynamics as a result of climate change and land use alterations osei et al 2018 this approach is deemed one of the most reliable means of evaluating water resources availability of the future under climate change xu 1999 ultimately the broader agenda is to inform policy action through empirically based scientific evidence some of the renowned approaches in this arena of science are the use of general circulation models gcms or regional climate models rcms in generating forcing variables as inputs into hydrologic models muthuwatta et al 2018 roth et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 tan et al 2017 an added advantage in the use of rcms and gcms is the ability to make predictive studies for even ungauged basins owing to this advantage many researchers have employed rcms and gcms in their quest to comprehending the biosphere hydrologic cycle climate change nexus chilkoti et al 2017 trang et al 2017 akinsanola et al 2018 oyerinde et al 2017 in west africa sylla et al 2016 evaluated the shift in climate zones as a result of anthropogenic activities using ensembles of cmip5 gcm cordex rcm and hires regcm4 their results indicate the relevance of the application of rcms and gcms simulation outputs in unraveling the anthropogenic consequences to climate alterations yira et al 2017 also assessed the impact of climate change on hydrological processes of a tropical west african catchment using ensemble of rcms under two rcp scenarios notwithstanding oyerinde et al 2017 affirms the inconsistencies found in gcms application and how this translates into difficulties in modeling the perturbations in hydro climatic conditions of regions in view of this the ability of rcms and gcms in replicating precipitation as an essential climatic input for a given climatic region for hydrologic modelling cannot be overstated it is worth noting that the inconsistencies noted in rcms and gcms can in part be attributed to the physical discrepancies in geographic locations of particular climatic regions which are very much sensitive to land surface scheme components of global circulation models natural climate variability and imperfect characterization of tropical precipitation systems have also been noted to contribute to the divergence found in model simulation outputs cook and vizy 2006 foley 2010 the performance evaluation of rcms and gcms also ensures the selection of an appropriate global or regional model for evaluating the dynamics of climate change on water resources pertinent to the call of climate modeling and it impact assessment on diverse related fields are the roles played by precipitation and temperature in fact changes in these two climatological variables gives indication of the changes occurring in global climate and thus their frequent assessment remains imperative to understanding the perturbations therein in its entirety the application of rcms and gcms in espousing future climate changes in semi arid ghana has not been well articulated with the few works agyekum et al 2018 annor et al 2018 jin et al 2018 darko et al 2019 okafor et al 2019 focusing primarily on the volta basin it is imperious to admit that though these studies have contributed significantly to understanding the climatology of ghana its application has been skewed towards the volta basin harnessing water resources of ghana in a sustainable manner in the near future and ensuring the continual survival of ecosystem services calls for pragmatic measures in the wake of climate change and thus scaling out climate change studies into other equally important basins become crucial in this study we focused our attention on the pra river basin prb primarily because of two major reasons i the prb has the highest density of settlements in ghana both rural and urban bessah et al 2018 and thus the impact of future climate change resulting in floods droughts and other related events will be dire and ii the prb is home to some rare and endangered ecosystem species uicn paco 2010 most of which are water reliant and thus ensuring their continual survival and provision of their essential ecosystem services remain fundamental to this end resilient climate change adaptation strategies backed by apt scientific evidence need to be deployed along the divergent hierarchy of the decision making process to inform policy makers engineers and planners the current study evaluates the performance of nine rcms in replicating the observed precipitation a key determinant of the hydrologic cycle of the pra river basin with the aim of providing a firm understanding for the selection of appropriate rcms for future impact assessment of climate change on hydrological dynamics of the basin in section 2 the observational and model datasets their sources and the analysis performed are presented section 3 discusses the results with study limitations given in section 4 the study is summarized and concluded in section 5 2 study area and data availability 2 1 study area the pra river basin prb is a key river system in south central part of ghana it is located between geographic latitudes 05 00 00 n 7 11 24 n and longitudes 00 26 30 w 02 14 40 w fig 1 the pra river is drained mainly by the anum birim offin and the oda river tributaries with a drainage area of about 23 200 km2 water resources commission wrc 2012 the prb spans four regions namely ashanti eastern central and western with corresponding coverage areas of 55 23 15 and 7 respectively water resources commission wrc 2012 originating from the eastern and north western fringes of ghana the pra river traverses a distance of 240 km before finally emptying into the gulf of guinea generally topography of the basin is flat with some isolated cases of higher altitudes in the mid and northern portions fig 1 the basin is found within the forest ecological zone of ghana with a wet sub equatorial climatic condition characterized by two rainy seasons major and minor occurring in may july and september november respectively the mean annual precipitation for 1981 2010 is about 1 446 mm bessah et al 2020 with noted spatio temporal variations in the westwards and south westwards directions mean annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated to be 1650 mm kankam yeboah et al 2013 the average minimum and maximum air temperatures are 23 c and 33 c awotwi et al 2019 the prb is home to about 4 2 million people most of whom are engaged in agriculture subsistence farming remains the major farming option where farm crops such as maize cassava and plantain are cultivated to cater for the needs of the family large commercial farms focus on the production of only cocoa farming activities in the prb are mainly rain fed as irrigation technologies are pervasive and as a result understanding the precipitation patterns with its seasonal and interannual variations will provide a resourceful tool for farmers in farm planning and scheduling surface water resources of the basin originate from precipitation and are thus very useful for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes there exist a number of dams constructed on different tributaries of the pra river to provide water for economic development reduction in precipitation amount due to drought will hamper water supply for domestic agricultural and industrial uses translating into stunted economic growth the study area is renowned for its high gold deposits especially in the tarkwaian and birimian rock series smith et al 2016 tetteh and effisah otoo 2017 with active mining companies such as anglogold ashanti resolute amansie limited chirano gold mines among others operating from here these companies rely on surface water or ground water sources for their operational activities and thus any changes in the precipitation and temperature patterns within the basin will adversely affect operations of these companies 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 observational data the difficulties encountered in the acquisition of ground observed climatological variables resulting from lack of well distributed gauging networks and policy directives on data usage is driving the frontiers of hydro climatological studies into relying on open source gridded datasets annor et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 open source datasets provide an avenue where huge climatic datasets are freely acquired for hydrological and climate impact assessment without limitation to local or regional scale tendencies one such open source data is the gridded precipitation data based on gauge satellite products the accuracy of various types of open source gridded data is thoroughly examined in the literature nerini et al 2015 with successful applications with hydrologic models for hydrological assessment at the basin scale skoulikaris et al 2020 in this study version 7 v7 of the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation time series dataset was used as reference data in validating precipitation outputs from the models available at ftp ftp dwd de pub data gpcc html fulldata monthly v2018 doi download html the gpcc was chosen over other available open source gridded precipitation datasets such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp tropical precipitation measuring mission trmm and climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph because of its ability to capture the high variability observed in west african climate agyekum et al 2018 annor et al 2018 okafor et al 2019 it is also the case that gpcc has been extensively used in the evaluation of africa climate zones with proven track record of robustness asfaw et al 2018 agyeman et al 2017 nikulin et al 2012 nicholson et al 2003 moreover the development of gpcc saw the incorporation of quite a substantial number of gauge records from the west african sub region annor et al 2018 the gpcc version 7 consists of gridded daily time step precipitation data with spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 covering the entire globe and spanning 1901 2013 2 2 2 model data the regional climate model rcm simulation outputs analyzed in this work are that from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute rossby centre regional climate model rca4 driven by nine 9 global circulation models gcms the simulation outputs were all from the same ensemble members i e realization initialization and perturbation 1 r1i1p1 these datasets forms part of the cordex africa project which features in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 5 the choice of rcm rca4 was premise on the extensive use of rca4 model output simulations and data availability for the rcp scenarios okafor et al 2019 wilcke and bärring 2016 which provide relevant sources of information for climate change impacts assessment as well as for hydrologic modelling of the basin table 1 presents the nine forcing gcms their acronyms and their spatial resolution for the purposes of analysis daily time step outputs of model simulations were acquired for precipitation for a 31 year period 1975 2005 for ease of comparison all the model datasets were bilinearly interpolated into a 0 5 0 5 grid resolution conforming to that of the observed bias adjustments were not executed as the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the raw climate simulation outputs to the observed however it is imperative that bias corrections be carried out when outputs of model simulations are being used for impact assessment 2 2 3 methods the performance of the models in replicating the observed precipitation over the prb was carried out at the annual seasonal and monthly timescales during 1975 2005 this time period was chosen to maximize observational data availability in the prb domain spatial relative biases of the models were generated based on the annual mean and annual totals for precipitation at the seasonal scale analysis was grouped based on the standard seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son to discriminate how well the models predict the observed with respect to seasons the temporal patterns variability and errors inherent in the models were assessed using the pattern correlation standardized deviation and root mean square difference respectively these metrics were summarized using the taylor diagram gleckler et al 2008 pincus et al 2008 taylor 2001 trends in seasonal precipitation were analyzed with the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 and change point detection with the non parametric pettitt test pettitt 1979 the mann kendall and pettitt test were computed at the 95 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual mean climatology first the annual performance of the selected downscaled rca4 cordex africa multi model simulations in comparison with the gpcc precipitation data i e observed were examined fig 2 canesm2 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 hadgem2 es and ipsl underestimated the observed mean annual precipitation of 1331 3 mm yr with corresponding values of 1040 2 mm yr 1224 6 mm yr 608 mm yr 1307 8 mm yr and 1328 4 mm yr respectively csiro is an outlier when it comes to simulating the long term mean annual precipitation hadgem2 es and ipsl closely predicted the observed mean annual precipitation models that overestimated the observed were ec earth miroc5 mpi and noresm 1 with corresponding values of 1416 3 mm yr 1664 4 mm yr 1499 3 mm yr and 1338 8 mm yr respectively the maximum observed precipitation 1877 8 mm yr though underestimated was closely simulated by canesm2 1707 7 mm yr cnrm cm5 1846 1 mm yr and slightly overestimated by hadgem2 es 1991 6 mm yr spatial mean relative bias plots of the rca 4 models and the observed are shown in fig 3 except csiro mk3 all the remaining models consistently overestimated the long term annual mean precipitation with mean bias ranges of 0 8 to 45 6 for a greater portion of the prb canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es captured fairly the observed precipitation with mean biases of 0 8 16 7 18 1 and 18 4 respectively canesm2 estimates very well the observed precipitation over the middle belt of the prb with overestimations and underestimations recorded in the northern and southern sections of the basin respectively fig 3a bessah et al 2018 also found canesm2 and ipsl to be performing well for the prb however their analysis focused on temperature generally for all the models analysed in this study except csiro mk3 the observed precipitation in the northern parts of the prb were greatly overestimated with narrowing trends towards the southern direction the overestimations of the observed were high with descending pattern in the order for miroc5 max 63 1 avg 45 6 min 13 5 mpi lr max 57 2 avg 39 5 min 4 5 and noresm 1 max 51 6 avg 27 0 min 23 1 miroc5 and csiro mk3 were the two rca4 models found to be on the extremes with miroc5 overestimating the observed over the entire prb whiles csiro mk3 underestimated the observed for the whole basin for csiro mk3 the under estimations were higher in the southern part of the basin with bias of 60 improving through the middle belt bias of 43 and the northern section 25 unlike csiro mk3 miroc5 rather showed increasing deviation in the mean observed precipitation in the south to north direction of the basin based on the annual mean climatology it seems to suggest that canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es are predicting relatively well the observed annual mean precipitation considering the predictive power of the four rca4 cordex africa models further analysis at the seasonal and monthly timescales is limited to only these models and their ensemble mean 3 2 climatological mean for seasonal totals the climatological mean for seasonal totals is presented for the standard seasons winter december january february djf spring march april may mam summer june july august jja and fall september october november son for canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es and ensemble mean figs 4 7 winter and summer observed precipitation were respectively underestimated and overestimated by all the models in winter minimal precipitation is recorded with heavy precipitation in the summer season the nonperformance of these models in simulating the characteristics of winter and summer precipitation could be attributed to the model s inability to capture the inherent characteristics of the atmospheric and physiologic conditions eg convective clouds vegetation orography that dictates precipitation patterns at a shorter time scale wilby and wigley 1997 it is also the case that in summer precipitation varies substantially in space as a result of differing convective activities which may militate against the performance of the models at the mesoscale nicholson and grist 2003 laing and fritsch 1993 over the prb the magnitude of the underestimations was higher in the northern part and decreases down south for the winter period fig 4 whilst for summer a range of spatial variability in bias magnitude was observed fig 6 in summer ipsl exhibited a stronger positive mean bias magnitude in the south of the basin contradicting that from cnrm cm5 which rather showed a stronger magnitude in the north of the basin these disparities suggest that depending on the governing boundary conditions upon which these models were built sharp contrast could be detected owing to how the models translate scale related sensitivities of cloud feedback effects water vapour and other geographic physiognomies into its system for both spring and fall cnrm cm5 and the ensemble mean revealed the least deviations from the observed precipitation figs 5 and 7 in both seasons cnrm cm5 overestimates the observed mean bias of 3 8 for spring and 2 5 for fall the ensemble mean indicated good model performance however with underestimations to the tune of 9 9 and 2 2 respectively for spring and fall findings show that there is not a particular model that does well for all the seasons and thus leveraging on the respective seasonal strength of each of the models could improve the credence of climate change impact assessment overestimations of the observed precipitation predominantly occurred in the northern part of the basin during spring and fall periods 3 3 annual cycles of monthly climatology for climate impact analysis where seasonality and sensitivity of precipitation as a variable is essential for forecasting it is imperative that climate models are able to predict the migration pattern of precipitation onset through till its cessation in the northwardly direction laux et al 2008 the long term monthly climatology averaged over the prb was examined with results presented in fig 8 model simulations indicate the presence of bimodal precipitation patterns peaking in june and october over the prb in accordance with that detected by the observed dataset the first peak 228 55 mm in the observed data gpcc occurs in june with hadgem2 es 236 25 mm closely capturing this peak although overestimated the remaining models including the ensemble mean canesm2 165 30 mm cnrm cm5 151 90 mm ipsl 187 98 mm ensemble mean 156 66 mm underestimated the peak precipitation for the period the second peak in the observed data occurred in october 159 52 mm and was underestimated by all the models a general observation is that hadgem2 es reproduce well the long term monthly variations over the prb in comparison with the observed gpcc the precipitation pattern decreases from june to a minimum 76 67 mm in august indicating the occurrence of a mild dry season all the models failed to capture this mild dry season observed in the summer period with hadgem2 es relatively mimicking this characteristic of the annual cycle the general precipitation pattern with respect to onset mild dry season and cessation is similar to that reported for the volta basin by okafor et al 2019 it is instructive to note that although the prb is not part of the volta basin these two basins share a boundary and thus similar characteristics in bimodal precipitation patterns is not out of the ordinary in fact the volta basin and the prb all recorded their bimodal precipitation peaks in the same months of june and october okafor et al 2019 the models were unable to capture exactly the mild dry season which occurred in the summer period although they followed the general pattern observed in the gpcc dataset with the exception of ipsl variations in magnitude of the model simulations for august viz a viz those of the observed gpcc dataset were noticeable earlier studies by laux et al 2008 and agyekum et al 2018 indicate that the guinea coast in which the prb is located exhibits similar precipitation patterns with major and minor peaks in june and september mainly the onset of precipitation for the prb is in february with all the models capturing the time extent however with differing magnitude similar observation is true for the cessation of precipitation in november 3 4 interannual variability the deviations of annual mean precipitation from the long term mean for the period 1975 2005 was examined for all the four models and the multi model ensemble mean fig 9 the interannual variability provides information on the consistency of the models compared to the observed gpcc from fig 9 the models captured to a large extent the interannual variability that characterized the precipitation patterns within the prb however with some disparities in the magnitude and timing akinsanola et al 2015 and okafor et al 2019 reported similar features of the cordex africa models in capturing the interannual variability of observed data the performance of the models was also assessed using their predictive power in identifying wet and dry years during 1975 2005 the wet and dry years were identified based upon whether the annual mean precipitation for a particular year was greater or lesser than the long term mean for the period 1975 2005 for the period in question thirteen dry years and eighteen wet years were identified based on the observed gpcc fig 10 the ensemble mean and hadgem2 es simulated similar occurrence of dry and wet years but not necessarily for corresponding years as recorded by the gpcc fig 10 the remaining models canesm2 cnrm cm5 and ipsl overestimated the occurrence of dry and wet years deviation ranges for all the models were 0 56 32 28 and 2 41 32 62 for dry and wet years respectively in comparison with the long term mean of the observed considering wet years 1979 was found to be the wettest 1731 mm with precipitation amount in excess of 30 from the long term mean 1331 4 mm for 1975 2005 the multi model ensemble mean of the rca4 simulations predicted fairly well the 1979 wet year 1242 mm with 28 variation from that observed by gpcc 1731 mm the driest year 936 mm coincided with 1983 with 29 7 deviation from the long term mean 1331 4 mm for the gpcc data similarly the multi model ensemble mean simulated quite well the 1983 dry conditions 1215 mm with a margin of error of about 8 7 from the long term mean of the observed gpcc dataset 3 5 taylor diagrams in order to assess the various model s ability to reproduce the spatio temporal patterns and variability inherent in the gpcc observed precipitation data taylor diagrams taylor 2001 were plotted for the prb fig 11 the taylor diagram presents a statistical summary of model s predictive power of variability pattern and errors in comparison with gpcc data using the normalized standardized deviation σ correlation coefficient r and root mean square difference the vertical or horizontal axis the main arc and inner arcs indicate respectively the normalized standard deviation correlation and root mean square difference all the models showed differences in variability and pattern at the seasonal scale in winter ipsl and canesm2 showed a positive correlation with the gpcc data however reproducing weakly the temporal variability σ 0 25 inherent in the observed in spring all the models presented a negative correlation no points shown on the taylor diagram indicating the inability of the models in predicting the characteristics of precipitation in this season in summer ipsl r 0 40 canesm2 r 0 20 and hadgem2 es r 0 25 correlated positively with the observed indicating the capability of the models in simulating the spatial pattern of precipitation although low low temporal variability was captured by ipsl and canesm2 with σ ranging 0 25 0 50 contrary to the variability performance of ipsl and canesm2 hadgem2 es showed high variability σ 1 40 in summer for fall hadgem2 es and cnrm cm5 simulates similar spatio temporal variability σ 0 60 but with dissimilarities in pattern recognition hadgem2 es r 0 10 and cnrm cm5 r 0 20 the ensemble mean of the rca4 simulations correlated negatively for winter and spring but positively for summer and fall the positive correlation for the summer and fall season is attributed to the maximum precipitation patterns occurring mostly during these seasons for summer and fall the ensemble means captured well the spatial patterns of the observed gpcc data r 0 75 but poorly simulated the variability σ 0 25 of the observed in general the hadgem2 es rca4 model performed well both in terms of simulating the spatio temporal patterns and variability of the observed gpcc data although the ensemble mean performed creditably well with respect to the spatial patterns of the observed precipitation it fell short in capturing the observed spatial variability 3 6 trend analysis further assessment of the rca4 simulation models was carried out using the mann kendall test to analyze the trends inherent in the models in the observed precipitation the trend analyses were performed at the 95 confidence level with corresponding threshold value z of 1 96 the null hypothesis of no trend in the time series data is rejected should z s z α 2 the pettitt test was used in identifying the change point within the time series data of the observed and model simulations with the significance of the change point being detected at the 95 confidence level the trend test results for the four standard seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son are presented in table 2 a snapshot of the trend statistics indicates a general decline in observed and simulated precipitation for all the seasons except fall although these declines are not significant during winter observed precipitation reduced by 0 17 mm per season however this reduction is not significant p 0 05 canesm2 cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es were able to capture the declining pattern of precipitation in winter nonetheless with differing magnitudes canesm2 and cnrm cm5 depicted relatively well the decline in observed precipitation by 0 12 mm and 0 16 mm per season respectively predicted increases in precipitation were recorded by ipsl 0 09 mm per season and the ensemble mean 0 03 mm per season during the winter season contrary to that detected in the observed similar observation is made in spring for the declining trend in observed precipitation 0 72 mm per season which is fairly captured by canesm2 1 19 mm per season and cnrm cm5 0 17 mm per season in summer canesm2 and hadgem2 es detected the decreasing patterns of precipitation with magnitudes exceeding that of the observed data the ensemble mean for winter spring and summer gave contradictory performance of the observed with most indicating precipitation increases over 0 1 mm per season none of the models were able to simulate adequately the change points noticed in the observed dataset this goes to suggest that although some of the models have capabilities of capturing the trends they are unable to detect the point of transition in the observed precipitation it could generally be inferred from the trend analysis that precipitation occurring over the prb is declining although the rate of decline may seem to be insignificant the uncertainty of lack of significance in precipitation within climate models for this region is commonly known from previous studies okafor et a 2019 agyekum et al 2018 and also translates to future climate projections the decline in precipitation over the prb could have detrimental implications on water resources availability ecosystem services and functions as well as on socio eco hydrological characteristics of the basin 4 study limitations the study presents useful information for the climate and hydrologic modeling community and in particular for the study region however the study comes along with some limitations only one rcm driven by multiple gcms was considered although this approach eliminates modeling uncertainty associated with the use of multiple rcms driven by gcms it also presents the challenge of not capturing the full range of uncertainties that could have been observed had variant rcms been used in order to project future changes in precipitation over the prb a process based evaluation is needed to ascertain the validity and ability of the models to represent key processes and dynamic features that control precipitation 5 summary and conclusions nine rca4 cordex africa multi model simulations together with their ensemble mean have been analyzed to evaluate their performance in reproducing the observed precipitation over the prb this assessment comes on the backdrop that climate change and hydrologic studies are shifting from the over reliance on ground station observed data to the use of climate models satellite based information and thus the reliability of such datasets need to be affirmed to boost confidence in modelling exercises that rely on such types of datasets performance metrics were computed on the annual monthly and seasonal scales the findings of the study are summarized as follows based on the timescale the nine rca4 models exhibited varying degree of reproducibility of the observed precipitation in the prb with canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es predicting relatively fairly the observed across all timescales on the annual scale canesm2 and ipsl gave good prediction of the observed with mean biases of 0 8 and 16 7 respectively on the monthly timescale simulation outputs from hadgem2 es indicated relatively good performance metrics in comparison with the observed the spatio temporal pattern and variability characterizing the precipitation of the prb was captured relatively well by the simulation outputs of the hadgem2 es model canesm2 model equally detected the trends that were inherent in the observed gpcc data there is a general decline in precipitation over the prb for the summer season where a greater proportion of the precipitation is recorded a declining rate of 0 05 mm per season was noted in the observed although this decline was insignificant the basin is also noted to be going drier at a rate of 0 17 mm per season in the winter period which happens to be the driest period in the year in conclusion for hydro climatological studies relying on rcm model simulations it is recommended that the timescale at which the assessment is carried out be factored in the selection of the appropriate model overall canesm2 and hadgem2 es performed creditably well irrespective of the timescale and thus could be employed for detailed impact assessment the discrepancies that exist in the models as compared to the observed maybe related to the convective parameterizations used in the models and thus remain a

regions with limited observed datasets there is therefore the need to evaluate the reliability of such datasets in order to reduce modelling uncertainties and boost confidence in modelling results we present an evaluation of the performance of nine cordex rca4 regional climate model simulations in replicating the observed precipitation for a 31 year period 1975 2005 new hydrological insights for the region on the annual timescale canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es reproduced minimal annual mean biases 0 8 18 4 and thus selected for the seasonal and monthly timescale analysis generally with the exception of spring march april and may all the selected models were able to simulate quite well the seasonal climatology of the pra river basin prb with noticeable distinctions in the reproducibility of the spatial patterns variability and magnitude of the observed data the multi model ensemble means indicated strong correlation with observations r 0 75 but with weak spatial variability σ 0 25 it is recommended that for climate impact assessment and hydrologic modelling studies multi model ensembles of canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es be used however on singular basis

pittock 2017 prather and holmes 2017 urry 2015 the exploit to reduce ghgs is further necessitated by increases in human induced causative factors such as population growth agricultural exploitation

world population is expected to rise from 7 6 billion in 2018 to a total of 11 2 billion by the year 2100 undesa 2017 though the change is not so astronomical compared to the lapse time 79 years from now it is expedient to however acknowledge that these changes will correspondingly trigger surges in socio economic development agriculture diversity and industrialization culminating into major shifts in land uses and climatic patterns inevitably these developmental trajectories will result in alterations of the atmosphere biosphere system with the hydrological cycle being the most affected duan et al 2017 tan et al 2017 in a bid to minimize the impact of such changes in the future hydrologic and climate scientist have foster joint research initiatives of predicting future hydrological dynamics as a result of climate change and land use alterations osei et al 2018 this approach is deemed one of the most reliable means of evaluating water resources availability of the future under climate change xu 1999 ultimately the broader agenda is to inform policy action through empirically based scientific evidence some of the renowned approaches in this arena of science are the use of general circulation models gcms or regional climate models rcms in generating forcing variables as inputs into hydrologic models muthuwatta et al 2018 roth et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 tan et al 2017 an added advantage in the use of rcms and gcms is the ability to make predictive studies for even ungauged basins owing to this advantage many researchers have employed rcms and gcms in their quest to comprehending the biosphere hydrologic cycle climate change nexus chilkoti et al 2017 trang et al 2017 akinsanola et al 2018 oyerinde et al 2017 in west africa sylla et al 2016 evaluated the shift in climate zones as a result of anthropogenic activities using ensembles of cmip5 gcm cordex rcm and hires regcm4 their results indicate the relevance of the application of rcms and gcms simulation outputs in unraveling the anthropogenic consequences to climate alterations yira et al 2017 also assessed the impact of climate change on hydrological processes of a tropical west african catchment using ensemble of rcms under two rcp scenarios notwithstanding oyerinde et al 2017 affirms the inconsistencies found in gcms application and how this translates into difficulties in modeling the perturbations in hydro climatic conditions of regions in view of this the ability of rcms and gcms in replicating precipitation as an essential climatic input for a given climatic region for hydrologic modelling cannot be overstated it is worth noting that the inconsistencies noted in rcms and gcms can in part be attributed to the physical discrepancies in geographic locations of particular climatic regions which are very much sensitive to land surface scheme components of global circulation models natural climate variability and imperfect characterization of tropical precipitation systems have also been noted to contribute to the divergence found in model simulation outputs cook and vizy 2006 foley 2010 the performance evaluation of rcms and gcms also ensures the selection of an appropriate global or regional model for evaluating the dynamics of climate change on water resources pertinent to the call of climate modeling and it impact assessment on diverse related fields are the roles played by precipitation and temperature in fact changes in these two climatological variables gives indication of the changes occurring in global climate and thus their frequent assessment remains imperative to understanding the perturbations therein in its entirety the application of rcms and gcms in espousing future climate changes in semi arid ghana has not been well articulated with the few works agyekum et al 2018 annor et al 2018 jin et al 2018 darko et al 2019 okafor et al 2019 focusing primarily on the volta basin it is imperious to admit that though these studies have contributed significantly to understanding the climatology of ghana its application has been skewed towards the volta basin harnessing water resources of ghana in a sustainable manner in the near future and ensuring the continual survival of ecosystem services calls for pragmatic measures in the wake of climate change and thus scaling out climate change studies into other equally important basins become crucial in this study we focused our attention on the pra river basin prb primarily because of two major reasons i the prb has the highest density of settlements in ghana both rural and urban bessah et al 2018 and thus the impact of future climate change resulting in floods droughts and other related events will be dire and ii the prb is home to some rare and endangered ecosystem species uicn paco 2010 most of which are water reliant and thus ensuring their continual survival and provision of their essential ecosystem services remain fundamental to this end resilient climate change adaptation strategies backed by apt scientific evidence need to be deployed along the divergent hierarchy of the decision making process to inform policy makers engineers and planners the current study evaluates the performance of nine rcms in replicating the observed precipitation a key determinant of the hydrologic cycle of the pra river basin with the aim of providing a firm understanding for the selection of appropriate rcms for future impact assessment of climate change on hydrological dynamics of the basin in section 2 the observational and model datasets their sources and the analysis performed are presented section 3 discusses the results with study limitations given in section 4 the study is summarized and concluded in section 5 2 study area and data availability 2 1 study area the pra river basin prb is a key river system in south central part of ghana it is located between geographic latitudes 05 00 00 n 7 11 24 n and longitudes 00 26 30 w 02 14 40 w fig 1 the pra river is drained mainly by the anum birim offin and the oda river tributaries with a drainage area of about 23 200 km2 water resources commission wrc 2012 the prb spans four regions namely ashanti eastern central and western with corresponding coverage areas of 55 23 15 and 7 respectively water resources commission wrc 2012 originating from the eastern and north western fringes of ghana the pra river traverses a distance of 240 km before finally emptying into the gulf of guinea generally topography of the basin is flat with some isolated cases of higher altitudes in the mid and northern portions fig 1 the basin is found within the forest ecological zone of ghana with a wet sub equatorial climatic condition characterized by two rainy seasons major and minor occurring in may july and september november respectively the mean annual precipitation for 1981 2010 is about 1 446 mm bessah et al 2020 with noted spatio temporal variations in the westwards and south westwards directions mean annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated to be 1650 mm kankam yeboah et al 2013 the average minimum and maximum air temperatures are 23 c and 33 c awotwi et al 2019 the prb is home to about 4 2 million people most of whom are engaged in agriculture subsistence farming remains the major farming option where farm crops such as maize cassava and plantain are cultivated to cater for the needs of the family large commercial farms focus on the production of only cocoa farming activities in the prb are mainly rain fed as irrigation technologies are pervasive and as a result understanding the precipitation patterns with its seasonal and interannual variations will provide a resourceful tool for farmers in farm planning and scheduling surface water resources of the basin originate from precipitation and are thus very useful for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes there exist a number of dams constructed on different tributaries of the pra river to provide water for economic development reduction in precipitation amount due to drought will hamper water supply for domestic agricultural and industrial uses translating into stunted economic growth the study area is renowned for its high gold deposits especially in the tarkwaian and birimian rock series smith et al 2016 tetteh and effisah otoo 2017 with active mining companies such as anglogold ashanti resolute amansie limited chirano gold mines among others operating from here these companies rely on surface water or ground water sources for their operational activities and thus any changes in the precipitation and temperature patterns within the basin will adversely affect operations of these companies 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 observational data the difficulties encountered in the acquisition of ground observed climatological variables resulting from lack of well distributed gauging networks and policy directives on data usage is driving the frontiers of hydro climatological studies into relying on open source gridded datasets annor et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 open source datasets provide an avenue where huge climatic datasets are freely acquired for hydrological and climate impact assessment without limitation to local or regional scale tendencies one such open source data is the gridded precipitation data based on gauge satellite products the accuracy of various types of open source gridded data is thoroughly examined in the literature nerini et al 2015 with successful applications with hydrologic models for hydrological assessment at the basin scale skoulikaris et al 2020 in this study version 7 v7 of the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation time series dataset was used as reference data in validating precipitation outputs from the models available at ftp ftp dwd de pub data gpcc html fulldata monthly v2018 doi download html the gpcc was chosen over other available open source gridded precipitation datasets such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp tropical precipitation measuring mission trmm and climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph because of its ability to capture the high variability observed in west african climate agyekum et al 2018 annor et al 2018 okafor et al 2019 it is also the case that gpcc has been extensively used in the evaluation of africa climate zones with proven track record of robustness asfaw et al 2018 agyeman et al 2017 nikulin et al 2012 nicholson et al 2003 moreover the development of gpcc saw the incorporation of quite a substantial number of gauge records from the west african sub region annor et al 2018 the gpcc version 7 consists of gridded daily time step precipitation data with spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 covering the entire globe and spanning 1901 2013 2 2 2 model data the regional climate model rcm simulation outputs analyzed in this work are that from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute rossby centre regional climate model rca4 driven by nine 9 global circulation models gcms the simulation outputs were all from the same ensemble members i e realization initialization and perturbation 1 r1i1p1 these datasets forms part of the cordex africa project which features in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 5 the choice of rcm rca4 was premise on the extensive use of rca4 model output simulations and data availability for the rcp scenarios okafor et al 2019 wilcke and bärring 2016 which provide relevant sources of information for climate change impacts assessment as well as for hydrologic modelling of the basin table 1 presents the nine forcing gcms their acronyms and their spatial resolution for the purposes of analysis daily time step outputs of model simulations were acquired for precipitation for a 31 year period 1975 2005 for ease of comparison all the model datasets were bilinearly interpolated into a 0 5 0 5 grid resolution conforming to that of the observed bias adjustments were not executed as the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the raw climate simulation outputs to the observed however it is imperative that bias corrections be carried out when outputs of model simulations are being used for impact assessment 2 2 3 methods the performance of the models in replicating the observed precipitation over the prb was carried out at the annual seasonal and monthly timescales during 1975 2005 this time period was chosen to maximize observational data availability in the prb domain spatial relative biases of the models were generated based on the annual mean and annual totals for precipitation at the seasonal scale analysis was grouped based on the standard seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son to discriminate how well the models predict the observed with respect to seasons the temporal patterns variability and errors inherent in the models were assessed using the pattern correlation standardized deviation and root mean square difference respectively these metrics were summarized using the taylor diagram gleckler et al 2008 pincus et al 2008 taylor 2001 trends in seasonal precipitation were analyzed with the mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 and change point detection with the non parametric pettitt test pettitt 1979 the mann kendall and pettitt test were computed at the 95 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual mean climatology first the annual performance of the selected downscaled rca4 cordex africa multi model simulations in comparison with the gpcc precipitation data i e observed were examined fig 2 canesm2 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 hadgem2 es and ipsl underestimated the observed mean annual precipitation of 1331 3 mm yr with corresponding values of 1040 2 mm yr 1224 6 mm yr 608 mm yr 1307 8 mm yr and 1328 4 mm yr respectively csiro is an outlier when it comes to simulating the long term mean annual precipitation hadgem2 es and ipsl closely predicted the observed mean annual precipitation models that overestimated the observed were ec earth miroc5 mpi and noresm 1 with corresponding values of 1416 3 mm yr 1664 4 mm yr 1499 3 mm yr and 1338 8 mm yr respectively the maximum observed precipitation 1877 8 mm yr though underestimated was closely simulated by canesm2 1707 7 mm yr cnrm cm5 1846 1 mm yr and slightly overestimated by hadgem2 es 1991 6 mm yr spatial mean relative bias plots of the rca 4 models and the observed are shown in fig 3 except csiro mk3 all the remaining models consistently overestimated the long term annual mean precipitation with mean bias ranges of 0 8 to 45 6 for a greater portion of the prb canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es captured fairly the observed precipitation with mean biases of 0 8 16 7 18 1 and 18 4 respectively canesm2 estimates very well the observed precipitation over the middle belt of the prb with overestimations and underestimations recorded in the northern and southern sections of the basin respectively fig 3a bessah et al 2018 also found canesm2 and ipsl to be performing well for the prb however their analysis focused on temperature generally for all the models analysed in this study except csiro mk3 the observed precipitation in the northern parts of the prb were greatly overestimated with narrowing trends towards the southern direction the overestimations of the observed were high with descending pattern in the order for miroc5 max 63 1 avg 45 6 min 13 5 mpi lr max 57 2 avg 39 5 min 4 5 and noresm 1 max 51 6 avg 27 0 min 23 1 miroc5 and csiro mk3 were the two rca4 models found to be on the extremes with miroc5 overestimating the observed over the entire prb whiles csiro mk3 underestimated the observed for the whole basin for csiro mk3 the under estimations were higher in the southern part of the basin with bias of 60 improving through the middle belt bias of 43 and the northern section 25 unlike csiro mk3 miroc5 rather showed increasing deviation in the mean observed precipitation in the south to north direction of the basin based on the annual mean climatology it seems to suggest that canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es are predicting relatively well the observed annual mean precipitation considering the predictive power of the four rca4 cordex africa models further analysis at the seasonal and monthly timescales is limited to only these models and their ensemble mean 3 2 climatological mean for seasonal totals the climatological mean for seasonal totals is presented for the standard seasons winter december january february djf spring march april may mam summer june july august jja and fall september october november son for canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es and ensemble mean figs 4 7 winter and summer observed precipitation were respectively underestimated and overestimated by all the models in winter minimal precipitation is recorded with heavy precipitation in the summer season the nonperformance of these models in simulating the characteristics of winter and summer precipitation could be attributed to the model s inability to capture the inherent characteristics of the atmospheric and physiologic conditions eg convective clouds vegetation orography that dictates precipitation patterns at a shorter time scale wilby and wigley 1997 it is also the case that in summer precipitation varies substantially in space as a result of differing convective activities which may militate against the performance of the models at the mesoscale nicholson and grist 2003 laing and fritsch 1993 over the prb the magnitude of the underestimations was higher in the northern part and decreases down south for the winter period fig 4 whilst for summer a range of spatial variability in bias magnitude was observed fig 6 in summer ipsl exhibited a stronger positive mean bias magnitude in the south of the basin contradicting that from cnrm cm5 which rather showed a stronger magnitude in the north of the basin these disparities suggest that depending on the governing boundary conditions upon which these models were built sharp contrast could be detected owing to how the models translate scale related sensitivities of cloud feedback effects water vapour and other geographic physiognomies into its system for both spring and fall cnrm cm5 and the ensemble mean revealed the least deviations from the observed precipitation figs 5 and 7 in both seasons cnrm cm5 overestimates the observed mean bias of 3 8 for spring and 2 5 for fall the ensemble mean indicated good model performance however with underestimations to the tune of 9 9 and 2 2 respectively for spring and fall findings show that there is not a particular model that does well for all the seasons and thus leveraging on the respective seasonal strength of each of the models could improve the credence of climate change impact assessment overestimations of the observed precipitation predominantly occurred in the northern part of the basin during spring and fall periods 3 3 annual cycles of monthly climatology for climate impact analysis where seasonality and sensitivity of precipitation as a variable is essential for forecasting it is imperative that climate models are able to predict the migration pattern of precipitation onset through till its cessation in the northwardly direction laux et al 2008 the long term monthly climatology averaged over the prb was examined with results presented in fig 8 model simulations indicate the presence of bimodal precipitation patterns peaking in june and october over the prb in accordance with that detected by the observed dataset the first peak 228 55 mm in the observed data gpcc occurs in june with hadgem2 es 236 25 mm closely capturing this peak although overestimated the remaining models including the ensemble mean canesm2 165 30 mm cnrm cm5 151 90 mm ipsl 187 98 mm ensemble mean 156 66 mm underestimated the peak precipitation for the period the second peak in the observed data occurred in october 159 52 mm and was underestimated by all the models a general observation is that hadgem2 es reproduce well the long term monthly variations over the prb in comparison with the observed gpcc the precipitation pattern decreases from june to a minimum 76 67 mm in august indicating the occurrence of a mild dry season all the models failed to capture this mild dry season observed in the summer period with hadgem2 es relatively mimicking this characteristic of the annual cycle the general precipitation pattern with respect to onset mild dry season and cessation is similar to that reported for the volta basin by okafor et al 2019 it is instructive to note that although the prb is not part of the volta basin these two basins share a boundary and thus similar characteristics in bimodal precipitation patterns is not out of the ordinary in fact the volta basin and the prb all recorded their bimodal precipitation peaks in the same months of june and october okafor et al 2019 the models were unable to capture exactly the mild dry season which occurred in the summer period although they followed the general pattern observed in the gpcc dataset with the exception of ipsl variations in magnitude of the model simulations for august viz a viz those of the observed gpcc dataset were noticeable earlier studies by laux et al 2008 and agyekum et al 2018 indicate that the guinea coast in which the prb is located exhibits similar precipitation patterns with major and minor peaks in june and september mainly the onset of precipitation for the prb is in february with all the models capturing the time extent however with differing magnitude similar observation is true for the cessation of precipitation in november 3 4 interannual variability the deviations of annual mean precipitation from the long term mean for the period 1975 2005 was examined for all the four models and the multi model ensemble mean fig 9 the interannual variability provides information on the consistency of the models compared to the observed gpcc from fig 9 the models captured to a large extent the interannual variability that characterized the precipitation patterns within the prb however with some disparities in the magnitude and timing akinsanola et al 2015 and okafor et al 2019 reported similar features of the cordex africa models in capturing the interannual variability of observed data the performance of the models was also assessed using their predictive power in identifying wet and dry years during 1975 2005 the wet and dry years were identified based upon whether the annual mean precipitation for a particular year was greater or lesser than the long term mean for the period 1975 2005 for the period in question thirteen dry years and eighteen wet years were identified based on the observed gpcc fig 10 the ensemble mean and hadgem2 es simulated similar occurrence of dry and wet years but not necessarily for corresponding years as recorded by the gpcc fig 10 the remaining models canesm2 cnrm cm5 and ipsl overestimated the occurrence of dry and wet years deviation ranges for all the models were 0 56 32 28 and 2 41 32 62 for dry and wet years respectively in comparison with the long term mean of the observed considering wet years 1979 was found to be the wettest 1731 mm with precipitation amount in excess of 30 from the long term mean 1331 4 mm for 1975 2005 the multi model ensemble mean of the rca4 simulations predicted fairly well the 1979 wet year 1242 mm with 28 variation from that observed by gpcc 1731 mm the driest year 936 mm coincided with 1983 with 29 7 deviation from the long term mean 1331 4 mm for the gpcc data similarly the multi model ensemble mean simulated quite well the 1983 dry conditions 1215 mm with a margin of error of about 8 7 from the long term mean of the observed gpcc dataset 3 5 taylor diagrams in order to assess the various model s ability to reproduce the spatio temporal patterns and variability inherent in the gpcc observed precipitation data taylor diagrams taylor 2001 were plotted for the prb fig 11 the taylor diagram presents a statistical summary of model s predictive power of variability pattern and errors in comparison with gpcc data using the normalized standardized deviation σ correlation coefficient r and root mean square difference the vertical or horizontal axis the main arc and inner arcs indicate respectively the normalized standard deviation correlation and root mean square difference all the models showed differences in variability and pattern at the seasonal scale in winter ipsl and canesm2 showed a positive correlation with the gpcc data however reproducing weakly the temporal variability σ 0 25 inherent in the observed in spring all the models presented a negative correlation no points shown on the taylor diagram indicating the inability of the models in predicting the characteristics of precipitation in this season in summer ipsl r 0 40 canesm2 r 0 20 and hadgem2 es r 0 25 correlated positively with the observed indicating the capability of the models in simulating the spatial pattern of precipitation although low low temporal variability was captured by ipsl and canesm2 with σ ranging 0 25 0 50 contrary to the variability performance of ipsl and canesm2 hadgem2 es showed high variability σ 1 40 in summer for fall hadgem2 es and cnrm cm5 simulates similar spatio temporal variability σ 0 60 but with dissimilarities in pattern recognition hadgem2 es r 0 10 and cnrm cm5 r 0 20 the ensemble mean of the rca4 simulations correlated negatively for winter and spring but positively for summer and fall the positive correlation for the summer and fall season is attributed to the maximum precipitation patterns occurring mostly during these seasons for summer and fall the ensemble means captured well the spatial patterns of the observed gpcc data r 0 75 but poorly simulated the variability σ 0 25 of the observed in general the hadgem2 es rca4 model performed well both in terms of simulating the spatio temporal patterns and variability of the observed gpcc data although the ensemble mean performed creditably well with respect to the spatial patterns of the observed precipitation it fell short in capturing the observed spatial variability 3 6 trend analysis further assessment of the rca4 simulation models was carried out using the mann kendall test to analyze the trends inherent in the models in the observed precipitation the trend analyses were performed at the 95 confidence level with corresponding threshold value z of 1 96 the null hypothesis of no trend in the time series data is rejected should z s z α 2 the pettitt test was used in identifying the change point within the time series data of the observed and model simulations with the significance of the change point being detected at the 95 confidence level the trend test results for the four standard seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son are presented in table 2 a snapshot of the trend statistics indicates a general decline in observed and simulated precipitation for all the seasons except fall although these declines are not significant during winter observed precipitation reduced by 0 17 mm per season however this reduction is not significant p 0 05 canesm2 cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es were able to capture the declining pattern of precipitation in winter nonetheless with differing magnitudes canesm2 and cnrm cm5 depicted relatively well the decline in observed precipitation by 0 12 mm and 0 16 mm per season respectively predicted increases in precipitation were recorded by ipsl 0 09 mm per season and the ensemble mean 0 03 mm per season during the winter season contrary to that detected in the observed similar observation is made in spring for the declining trend in observed precipitation 0 72 mm per season which is fairly captured by canesm2 1 19 mm per season and cnrm cm5 0 17 mm per season in summer canesm2 and hadgem2 es detected the decreasing patterns of precipitation with magnitudes exceeding that of the observed data the ensemble mean for winter spring and summer gave contradictory performance of the observed with most indicating precipitation increases over 0 1 mm per season none of the models were able to simulate adequately the change points noticed in the observed dataset this goes to suggest that although some of the models have capabilities of capturing the trends they are unable to detect the point of transition in the observed precipitation it could generally be inferred from the trend analysis that precipitation occurring over the prb is declining although the rate of decline may seem to be insignificant the uncertainty of lack of significance in precipitation within climate models for this region is commonly known from previous studies okafor et a 2019 agyekum et al 2018 and also translates to future climate projections the decline in precipitation over the prb could have detrimental implications on water resources availability ecosystem services and functions as well as on socio eco hydrological characteristics of the basin 4 study limitations the study presents useful information for the climate and hydrologic modeling community and in particular for the study region however the study comes along with some limitations only one rcm driven by multiple gcms was considered although this approach eliminates modeling uncertainty associated with the use of multiple rcms driven by gcms it also presents the challenge of not capturing the full range of uncertainties that could have been observed had variant rcms been used in order to project future changes in precipitation over the prb a process based evaluation is needed to ascertain the validity and ability of the models to represent key processes and dynamic features that control precipitation 5 summary and conclusions nine rca4 cordex africa multi model simulations together with their ensemble mean have been analyzed to evaluate their performance in reproducing the observed precipitation over the prb this assessment comes on the backdrop that climate change and hydrologic studies are shifting from the over reliance on ground station observed data to the use of climate models satellite based information and thus the reliability of such datasets need to be affirmed to boost confidence in modelling exercises that rely on such types of datasets performance metrics were computed on the annual monthly and seasonal scales the findings of the study are summarized as follows based on the timescale the nine rca4 models exhibited varying degree of reproducibility of the observed precipitation in the prb with canesm2 ipsl cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es predicting relatively fairly the observed across all timescales on the annual scale canesm2 and ipsl gave good prediction of the observed with mean biases of 0 8 and 16 7 respectively on the monthly timescale simulation outputs from hadgem2 es indicated relatively good performance metrics in comparison with the observed the spatio temporal pattern and variability characterizing the precipitation of the prb was captured relatively well by the simulation outputs of the hadgem2 es model canesm2 model equally detected the trends that were inherent in the observed gpcc data there is a general decline in precipitation over the prb for the summer season where a greater proportion of the precipitation is recorded a declining rate of 0 05 mm per season was noted in the observed although this decline was insignificant the basin is also noted to be going drier at a rate of 0 17 mm per season in the winter period which happens to be the driest period in the year in conclusion for hydro climatological studies relying on rcm model simulations it is recommended that the timescale at which the assessment is carried out be factored in the selection of the appropriate model overall canesm2 and hadgem2 es performed creditably well irrespective of the timescale and thus could be employed for detailed impact assessment the discrepancies that exist in the models as compared to the observed maybe related to the convective parameterizations used in the models and thus remain a

8227,study region upper rio grande basin united states study focus both measured and modeled hydrologic studies report warming related changes in the hydrologic cycle however studies using measured data often rely on april 1 snow water equivalent swe instead of peak swe to understand climate related hydrograph shifts we investigate trends in maximum swe timing of maximum swe and snow depletion and length of the snowmelt window using measured data with both linear regression and mann kendall methods to provide an integrated understanding of the trends new hydrological insights for the region of 16 locations with the longest data record 1980 2018 in the region more than half had significant declines in maximum swe regional trends using all sites collectively showed a decline in maximum swe of 0 4 cm year maximum swe was earlier at 10 13 of 16 sites depending upon method trends at individual locations show a wide range in maximum swe advancement 18 48 days regional maximum swe advanced three weeks snowpack depletion was similarly early at more than half the sites although snowmelt occurs earlier there was no change in the snowmelt window days between peak swe and no snow the reduced maximum swe may relate to reduced snowfall increased sublimation or lower albedo associated with dust we describe the ecological and social impacts of these observed shifts in snow amount and runoff timing for headwaters communities water compacts mountain ecosystems and riparian vegetation keywords snow water equivalent snotel rio grande basin climate change 1 introduction changes in the hydrological cycle have been both modeled and observed across the western united states including earlier snowmelt runoff marshall et al 2019 regonda et al 2005 rhoades et al 2018 stewart et al 2005 reduced summer streamflow and less frequent low elevation snowfall knowles et al 2006 milly and dunne 2020 as expected in a warming climate while these observations occur broadly across the western united states there are important regional differences in observed changes to the hydrologic cycle harpold et al 2012 streamflow and climate data indicate a declining fraction of runoff attributable to snowpack in the upper rio grande urg headwaters catchment in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains of southern colorado and northern new mexico chavarria and gutzler 2018 this observed change confirms model projections of decreasing runoff from snowpack in the urg basin with increasing temperature elias et al 2015b a decrease in urg april 1 snow water equivalent swe of 25 1958 2015 chavarria and gutzler 2018 suggests a need to further investigate snowpack changes over the entire snowmelt window to better understand the characteristics of climate related hydrograph shifts and the implications for ecological and human communities we analyze trends using 40 years of measured snowpack conditions through the lens of key components of the hydrologic cycle we investigate trends in maximum swe timing of snow depletion and time between peak snow cover and snow depletion via both linear regression and the nonparametric mann kendall methods for an integrated understanding of the trends since liner regression is sensitive to outliers such as the abnormally high precipitation in the early 1980 s whereas the mann kendall test indicates if the data tend in one direction this study builds upon previous studies by investigating trends and variation in snowpack characteristics using observed data to test the hypothesis that climate change is already affecting observed snowpack and runoff in ways consistent with climate model projections observed changes have been attributed to regional scale warming kapnick and hall 2012 with variation in snowpack regimes across the western united states trujillo and molotch 2014 understanding the ecological and social implications of these alterations in the snowmelt hydrograph supports community based management and planning efforts 1 1 upper rio grande basin snowpack in the urg basin of colorado and new mexico provides critical water resources for various uses in this semiarid region the rio grande a bi national river supplies water to three large municipalities albuquerque new mexico el paso texas and juarez mexico an estimated 50 75 of the rio grande flow is sustained by snowmelt from the upper basin rango 2006 the rio grande is one of the most vulnerable mountain watersheds globally with a low supply index and a high demand immerzeel et al 2020 from the headwaters in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains of colorado the rio grande flows southward to eventually form the international boundary between texas and mexico tree ring analyses indicate that similar to today historic streamflow 1508 2002 in the basin was highly variable and droughts were common woodhouse et al 2012 climate change related streamflow declines may lead the rio grande into continual drought dettinger et al 2015 and increased aridification overpeck and udall 2020 which will be exacerbated by warmer temperatures such temperature increases have already been documented for this region usgcrp 2017 1 2 snowpack trends based upon observational data observed data provide direct evidence of swe trends over the western united states previous analysis of linear trends in urg april 1 swe 1930 1950 showed increasing swe in the early record and declining observed swe in the later record 1950 1997 in the new mexico mountains mote et al 2005 the mean swe in the 1990s was the lowest of any 10 year period in the record with temporal behavior of regional mean swe indicating interdecadal variability mote 2003 april 1 swe at nearly 1000 locations across western north america reveals regionally varying relationships with temperature and precipitation mote 2006 linear trends in april 1 swe 1960 2002 vary by elevation and latitude supporting a more in depth regional analysis of changes in swe over time mote 2006 kapnick and hall 2012 changes in the accumulation and melt of snowpack were once thought to be less apparent in the mountains of southern colorado and northern new mexico than those observed in other western mountain ranges especially the lower elevation ranges of oregon and california knowles et al 2006 stewart et al 2005a several studies published results indicating substantial declines in swe and april 1 snowpack in the coastal cascade and sierra nevada mountain ranges eastern oregon and southern idaho harpold et al 2012 mote 2003a this led to an assumption that colorado s high mountain snowpack may be less sensitive to the effects of climate change however recent observational studies using the regional kendall statistical test document substantial shifts in snowmelt timing even in the high elevation cold mountains of colorado clow 2010 even within the intermountain west the spatially and temporally variable hydroclimate and the variable changes in snowmelt timing across the region indicate spatially localized analysis of snowpack may be warranted to further understand shifts in components of the hydrological cycle and local variability in swe trends harpold et al 2012 especially shifts in peak runoff 1 3 snowmelt modeling in the upper rio grande modeling studies corroborate and extend observational studies minimizing the challenges posed by the limited spatial and temporal coverage of some data sets observations represent only a small portion of the spatial area whereas modeling studies can fulfill the need to expand to broader spatial scales and estimate the impact of anticipated changes in future temperature and precipitation regimes previous studies use hydrologic modeling of the basin to evaluate how anticipated changes in temperature and precipitation may impact snowpack and streamflow a modeling study relying upon the variable infiltration capacity model showed a downward trend in april 1 swe and earlier snowmelt in the west due primarily to warming hamlet et al 2005 the rio grande near del norte basin was simulated to represent an extremely wet year 1979 a dry year 1977 and a moderate year 1976 rango and martinec 1997 using a projected temperature increase of 4c the proportion of total annual runoff occurring in the summer was less in a dry year 76 than a wet year 93 simulated climate change increased the proportion of winter runoff and decreased the proportion of summer runoff in dry moderate and wet simulations of the rio grande another study showed most of the rio grande runoff was shifted from june july to april may in a warming climate rango and martinec 2000 model simulations of 24 sub basins of the urg with four future conditions warmer wetter warmer drier hotter wetter and hotter drier resulted in earlier peak streamflow and declines in snow covered area elias et al 2015a daily hydrographs show higher march april streamflow but lower flows from mid may to the end of the water year the changes in simulated streamflow due to climate change have recently been verified in the observational record using measured streamflow chavarria and gutzler 2018 with nearly 40 years of measured swe data at 16 sites in the urg focused analyses using the entire temporal record of observed snowpack data with linear nonparametric and regional trend analyses broadens understanding of how warming is already changing the high mountain snowpack window in the highly vulnerable rio grande watershed dettinger et al 2015 however trend analyses can be complicated by weather variability the early 1980s had record or near record snowfall in the rio grande serreze et al 1999 the unusually high precipitation in the early 1980s and the unusually low precipitation in 2018 may impact trend analysis leading to the need to evaluate different temporal windows based upon precipitation variability harpold et al 2012 to address these limitations we use varied statistical analytical methods and data record lengths to evaluate trends 2 methods 2 1 snow data we use measured data from the snotel sites in the urg with the longest measurement record to evaluate measured changes in snow water storage and snowmelt timing snow data of the snowpack telemetry snotel network through 2018 were obtained from the natural resources conservation service nrcs water and climate center https www wcc nrcs usda gov snow snotel data html snotel provides continuous data that enable observation of daily changes in snow cover not captured in biweekly or monthly surveys of the 44 snotel sites in the urg we selected 16 sites based on longevity 30 year or longer data record fig 1 table 1 the selected sites represent a wide geographic region including both the san juan and sangre de cristo mountain ranges tributary to the urg the sites also range in elevation by nearly 1 000 m 2560 to 3 536 m above sea level six of the sites are in the sangre de cristo mountains with varying aspects the remaining ten are in the san juan mountains with northern eastern and southern aspects 2 2 trend analyses snow water equivalent swe is an estimate of the depth of water that would theoretically be observed if the entire snowpack were to melt instantaneously we first organized the swe data into october 1 september 30 water years for example observations comprising water year 1984 would span october 1 1983 to september 30 1984 for each snotel site by water year combination we calculated 4 response variables from the swe data 1 maximum swe 2 arrival of maximum swe 3 arrival of snowpack depletion following maximum swe and 4 length of snowmelt window we defined maximum swe as the highest daily swe amount occurring at a site within a water year the arrival of maximum swe was the day on which this amount occurred expressed as number of days after the start of the water year when the maximum swe occurred on more than one day we chose the latest day as the response arrival of snowpack depletion was the first day after maximum swe on which a swe value of 0 was observed also expressed as number of days after the start of the water year since the precision of snotel sensors is reported to be 0 1 in nrcs 2020 we tested the analyses using a no snow threshold of 0 1 in and found very little difference in the results supplemental material we defined length of snowmelt window to be the number of days between maximum swe and snowpack depletion we ran linear regression and non parametric mann kendall tests separately for each of the 4 response variables and 16 snotel sites to assess trends by employing both tests we are accounting for outliers such as the high precipitation in the early 1980 s linear regression as well as the lack of normally distributed data mann kendall combining these statistical methods gives a more holistic picture than would relying upon only one to assess urg wide trends we also pooled the snotel sites and applied regional mann kendall tests for each of the 4 response variables all of these analyses were conducted in two ways 1 using data from water years 1980 2018 and 2 using water years 1984 2018 to avoid the effect of the exceptionally wet period observed in the early 1980s as recommended by harpold et al 2012 we used r for all data processing and analyses r core team 2019 wickham et al 2019 mann kendall tests were conducted with the rkt package marchetto 2017 and reported results as significant p 0 05 or marginally significant 0 05 p 0 10 3 results trends in annual maximum swe and timing were assessed using a linear regression 1980 2018 b linear regression 1984 2018 c regional mann kendall regression and d mann kendall regression 1984 2018 3 1 trends in maximum water held in urg snowpack trends using three methods a b and d indicate that the peak water held in the snowpack declined at 9 11 of 16 sites depending upon method based upon linear regression for the entire record 1980 2018 method a nine of 16 stations had a significant decline in maximum swe while the other seven stations showed no significant trend in maximum swe fig 2 table 2 the 1984 2018 timeframe changed results slightly with chamita swe declines no longer significant but two other stations whisky creek and middle creek with significant declines in annual swe using the shorter record using linear regression with the shorter record 1984 2018 method b ten of 16 stations had a significant decline in maximum annual swe the mann kendall test 1984 2018 method d for individual snotel sites showed declines in maximum annual swe at most snotel sites with 11 of 16 significant p 0 05 one marginal p 0 09 and four stations apishapa culebra north costilla and slumgullion with no significant change in maximum swe three of the four stations with no significant change in maximum swe are in the sangre de cristo mountains and the other site slumgullion is one of the highest in elevation these same sites also had no change using linear regression methods a and b above the regional mann kendall trends which synthesize data from all 16 snotel sites show a significant decline in annual maximum swe p 0 0001 table 3 the regional average decline in maximum swe 1984 2018 was 0 43 cm year equating to approximately 14 5 cm if extrapolated over the measurement record 3 2 trends in timing of maximum snow water equivalent trends using three methods a b and d indicate earlier maximum swe at 10 13 of 16 sites depending upon method nearly all 13 of 16 of the snotel stations had maximum swe occurring earlier in the year a fig 3 table 2 the shorter timeframe 1984 2018 method b resulted in 11 of 16 stations reporting significantly earlier maximum swe the individual snotel station mann kendall tests had 10 of 16 locations with significantly earlier maximum swe p 0 05 two more sites with marginally significantly earlier swe p 0 10 and four stations with no change in maximum swe timing hopewell culebra and slumgullion had no change in maximum swe timing in all three individual location trend analyses middle creek and cumbres trestle were not significant using the shorter timeframe but cumbres trestle approaches significance in the mann kendall analysis p 0 09 mann kendall trends at individual locations had slopes between 0 53 and 1 4 days per year or an average of 18 senorita divide to 48 lily pond days earlier maximum swe regional mann kendall analysis which collectively analyses data for all stations showed significantly earlier arrival of maximum swe p 0 0001 thiel sen s slope 0 6 days table 3 on average this equates to maximum swe approximately 22 days earlier in 2018 as compared with 1984 3 3 trends in timing of snowpack depletion to estimate if the snowpack in the urg is melting earlier we calculated the number of days between the beginning of each water year 1 october and the day with no snow for each year trends using three methods a b and d indicate that snow cover depletion occurred earlier in the year at 9 11 of 16 snotel sites depending upon analytical method fig 4 table 2 snow cover depletion was significantly earlier at the 7 stations with the lowest elevation ranging from 2560 to 3 048 m above sea level using all three methods the same stations showing no change in maximum swe timing also showed no change in snow cover depletion hopewell cumbres trestle culebra and slumgullion two sites were no longer significant using the shorter timeframe method b middle creek and north costilla reflecting importance of timeframe at certain sites but both sites were significant p 0 10 using the mann kendall method method d table 3 regional mann kendall analysis which collectively analyses data for all stations showed significantly earlier snowpack depletion p 0 0001 thiel sen s slope 0 5 days table 3 on average this equates to snowpack depletion approximately 17 days earlier in 2018 as compared with 1984 for those interested in specific dates by watershed the y axis on figs 3 and 4 corresponds to the day of the year 1 october 1 182 april 1 in non leap years for example in 1981 at senorita divide day 215 was the first day with no snow at the measured site which corresponds to may 4 of that year the slope indicates an estimate of the average number of days to maximum and zero swe for example maximum and zero swe at apishapa were an average of 34 and 33 days earlier respectively 3 4 trends in the length of the snowmelt window to evaluate if snowpack is melting faster we calculated the number of days between latest peak swe and no snow each year using linear regression on both timeframes 1980 2018 and 1984 2018 and nonparametric analyses 15 of 16 stations showed no change in the snowmelt window indicating that even though snowmelt may be earlier it still takes the same total mean number of days each year fig 5 table 2 only one snotel station had a significant trend in the length of the snowmelt window which appears to be increasing at that station regional mann kendall analyses indicate no change in the length of the snowmelt window table 3 the lack of trend in the duration of melt may be related to the physics of snowmelt since the same energy is required to melt the snowpack regardless of melt timing suggesting importance in time of year day length and latitude across different regions 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of using different methods given the unusually high snowpack in the early 1980 s we elected to analyze trends for two time periods one beginning in 1980 and one beginning in 1984 under the assumption that there might be more locations with significant declines using the entire record however neither max swe nor the snowmelt window reported an increase in significant trends using the longer record max swe and zero swe timing had 2 and 3 more significantly early locations with the longer record respectively while the longer record did not consistently lead to more significant trends it did lead to differing results at some sites linear regression results were different for max swe 3 sites max swe timing 2 sites and no swe timing 3 sites for the differing time periods similarly mann kendall results were different for max swe 3 sites swe timing 2 sites and no swe timing 2 sites reinforcing the importance of outliers on trend analyses nonparametric methods 1984 2018 resulted in one additional significant location for both max swe and zero swe timing indicating a difference in results based upon methodology and a more integrated understanding of the trends regional kendall trend analyses were helpful in generalizing basin wide trends our results indicate it may be advisable to analyze linear trends absent weather related anomal but nonparametric site and regional methods support broader understanding of impacts impacts vary on a site by site basis so if localized management is a primary objective then we recommend local site analysis 4 2 results compared with other observational studies our analysis differs from previous studies in three ways we use a more recent time frame 1980 2018 we use maximum annual swe rather than april 1 swe and we use multiple statistical methods to evaluate trends a previous study evaluating changes in snowmelt timing in the colorado mountains using regional mann kendall trend analysis found earlier snowmelt at both the sangre de cristo and san juan snotel stations but reported no significant trends using linear regression clow 2010 we found significant trends using all four methods and time frame combinations fig 6 our results indicate a statistically significant decline in maximum swe at 9 of 16 sites using linear regression perhaps reflecting the longer data record and selection of maximum swe mann kendall trends in our analysis 0 43 cm year are within the ranges reported for the sangre de cristo mountains 0 28 0 44 cm year but less than those reported for the san juan mountains 0 96 1 0 cm per year using 1978 2007 april 1 swe clow 2010 regional kendall trend maximum swe declined by 3 6 cm per decade clow 2010 and 4 3 cm per decade in this analysis perhaps reflecting the additional decade of data and the observed general warming trend usgcrp 2017 individual site mann kendall declines in this analysis ranged from 2 4 cm per decade red river pass to 9 7 cm per decade beartown our site analysis indicate considerable variation in swe decline by location that is lost when sites are analyzed collectively in the regional kendall trend analysis regional variation in snow provides resilience in that snow conditions can vary greatly across a basin and while one portion of a watershed my supply limited downstream water another portion of the watershed may augment streamflow while ice and permafrost changes are long lasting snow may vary greatly across subbasins and rebound more quickly than ice and permafrost hock et al 2019 earlier peak and zero snowpack reported here relates to the earlier snowmelt reported by others clow 2010 our results show basin wide maximum swe to be 6 0 days per decade earlier using regional kendall trend analysis 1984 2018 individual site mann kendall trends show maximum swe to be 5 8 14 0 days earlier per decade these results are reflective of earlier snowmelt onset for the sangre de cristo mountains 8 0 9 9 days per decade and the san juan mountains 6 0 7 9 days decade using 1979 2007 data clow 2010 both timing of maximum swe and snowmelt onset have advanced between one and two weeks earlier per decade similar to hamlet 2005 we found maximum swe accumulation and melt to be occurring earlier in the year and these trends are sensitive to winter temperature regimes however our changes occurred in high intermountain catchments which were reported to be fairly insensitive compared to the near coastal mountains of the pacific northwest and california hamlet 2005 the difference in findings may be our analyses extended the data record to 2018 adding an additional 15 years of information interestingly the four northern most sites in the san juan mountains apishapa culebra whisky creek and north costilla represent a cluster of sites with no significant decline in max swe but they are amongst the sites with generally lower historic swe and they represent mid elevation sites the 6 snotel sites with the lowest elevation had significant declines in max swe indicating that decreasing trends in max swe may be most evident at the lowest elevation sites more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow as a response to warming across the region was most evident at locations with minimum temperatures 5 c knowles et al 2006 however in the urg high elevation sites have the largest shift in maximum swe timing lilypond and reduction in snowpack depth beartown fig 7 4 3 potential causes of reduced snowpack and early runoff in the urg prior studies have suggested causes of reduced urg snowpack including reduced snowfall increased snowpack sublimation and lower albedo associated with dust loading on spring snowpack one of the most profound and widely anticipated changes in the urg hydrological cycle is the temperature induced shift of precipitation from snow towards rain and earlier melt of the snowpack musselman et al 2017 especially at lower elevation watersheds lynn et al 2020 the mean fractionation of precipitation that falls as snow has been shown to have a significant influence on the mean annual streamflow independent of precipitation amount berghuijs et al 2014 reduced snowfall indicated by reduction in snow and increase in rainfall during the historical snow accumulation season has been reported in the urg knowles et al 2006 and may be partially responsible for the decreasing snowpack trends in the urg increased sublimation of snowpack lapp et al 2005 and lower snow albedo associated with increased dust loading on spring snowpack painter et al 2012 may contribute to the observed trends in decreased snowpack and earlier melt window 4 4 implications of lower snowpack and earlier runoff 4 4 1 implications for downstream water management snowpack is a critically important source of natural water storage in many regions of the world including the western united states and is vulnerable immerzeel et al 2019 the enormous changes in supply and demand caused by climate change will force water managers to address new problems lópez moreno et al 2020 the rio grande supplies fresh water to more than 6 million people across three states and two countries the duration of snowpack in the urg basin critically controls the timing and magnitude of regional water supplies to power generation irrigation scheduling and planting harvesting dates legal water systems and wildfire regimes westerling and bryant 2006 climate change will increase the sensitivity of groundwater generation carroll et al 2019 and further affect the use and distribution of water resources in the urg basin water managers and planners currently face specific challenges in particular greater uncertainty in the timing and volume of water supply that may worsen with climate change changes in snowpack and streamflow timing may affect reservoir operations including flood control decision making and management additionally changes in the timing and magnitude of runoff may affect diversion storage and other water supply infrastructures economic impacts are also significant since changes in reservoir storage affect municipal agricultural and ski and river recreation activities 4 4 2 water law and interstate water compacts water law in the united states is a complex combination of federal and state regulations here we provide examples specific to the urg of the impacts of changes in water volume and timing on water policy and management water laws may have actions triggered on certain calendar dates that may no longer be appropriate in an environment with an earlier melt window in 2010 the colorado state engineer added flexibility to the irrigation season for producers in the san luis valley colorado an agricultural region in the urg state of colorado d o n r and division of water resources 2010 the former irrigation season typically began april 1 and ended november 1 the 2010 change codified flexibility by allowing the ability to establish the beginning and ending of an irrigation season in a particular year based upon environmental factors including temperature precipitation soil moisture as well as streamflow forecasts and other considerations this legal change directly helps irrigators cope with the observed earlier melt window by ensuring local management flexibility cody 2018 an additional element of legal flexibility relates to decreed amount of water delivered over 95 of the available surface waters in the united states are governed by interstate water compacts hall 2010 of the 27 interstate water compacts active in the united states two apply in the urg observed runoff shifts reported here directly affect the costilla creek compact colorado and new mexico and the rio grande compact colorado new mexico and texas the rio grande compact differs from other western compacts in that it provides for adjusted allocations based on actual flow levels hall 2010 under the rio grande compact colorado delivers a specified amount of water to new mexico each year starting at 10 000 acre feet and modified based upon water measured at four stations in the urg in contrast the costilla creek compact is based upon specific flow rate allotments and set flow rates for irrigable land costilla creek drains a small watershed along the colorado new mexico border tributary to the rio grande agricultural water demand often exceeds supply and the creek rarely reaches the rio grande climate change will further destabilize water in costilla creek hall 2010 argued that the costilla creek compact lacks provisions for water conservation ecosystem protection restricting transbasin diversions or otherwise managing water demand and is totally inadequate for adaptively managing or allocating water rights under the expected stress from climate change climate resilience will likely be enhanced by establishing legal management flexibility in both water delivery timing and amount while allowing for ecosystem protection and water conservation to balance the supply demand challenges xu et al 2014 4 4 3 reduced streamflow impacts on acequia communities acequia communities in the upper rio grande basin are amongst the most exposed to the impacts of declining streamflow from snowpack acequias are community irrigation canals that have a 400 year history in the region more than just a means of distributing water acequias are local institutions that are central to the society and culture of the agricultural communities who depend on them rivera 2011 acequia communities are typically situated in narrow valleys just below the high elevation tributary basins where annual snowpack accumulates in this topographical position they are the first users of water from snowmelt water from rio grande tributary streams is diverted through acequias to agricultural fields where it is released for flood irrigation cox and ross 2011 besides the value of the water for agriculture in this semi arid region acequia systems also provide ecosystem services seepage of water from the earthen canals combined with flood irrigation practices causes localized elevation of groundwater which in turn supports riparian vegetation along the main canals fernald et al 2007 historically acequia communities have been highly adaptable to water shortage and excess through the process of repartimiento or dividing of waters fernald et al 2012 rivera 2011 indeed the irrigation infrastructure of these communities developed over 100 s of years as did their water sharing traditions and responses to periodic drought for example acequia communities implement water rotation schedules during times of drought emergency water supplies are made available and farmers may plant low water use plants and cull livestock herds in proportion to their expected hay harvest rivera 2011 however a warming climate with reduced streamflow quantity and earlier peak streamflow poses unprecedented threats to acequia communities droughts are projected to become more frequent more severe and longer in duration cook et al 2015 snowpack in the basins above the communities provides a natural reservoir that releases its water during late spring and early summer timed perfectly for the growing season rivera 2011 but with low swe and low streamflow water levels in the tributary streams may be too low to provide the head needed to push water through the acequias rivera 1996 while acequia communities can respond to individual poor years consecutive years with insufficient water are more likely to adversely impact agriculture and impair the ecosystem services associated with flood irrigation 4 4 4 implications for mountain ecosystems mountain snowpack will also indirectly affect water supply through its effects on ecosystems the maximum snow depth and timing of snow depletion have long been considered key drivers for which species live where across mountain watersheds and how much the plants can grow during the snowfree season billings 1973 walker et al 1993 less snow means less water for plant growth though this also leads to earlier snow depletion dates and a lengthened snowfree season in which plants can grow steltzer and post 2009 the observed changes in mountain snowpack including earlier snow depletion decouple water availability and demand for mountain plants wieder et al 2017 and have likely driven changes in the timing of plant growth and the rate and amount of plant growth across the urg over the coming decades a shift in temperature snowline and snowfree season length will also lead to upslope migration of many plant species with consequent changes in mountain biodiversity freeman et al 2018 steinbauer et al 2018 and downslope migration of other plant species due to shifts in water availability rather than temperature crimmins et al 2011 decreased snowpack depth at lower elevations impacts spring denning sites for some mammals barsugli et al 2020 and reduces benefits of spring green wave foraging by migratory ungulates through spring drought aikens et al 2020 though no long term monitoring data on plant growth are available for snotel sites studies from other mountain regions suggest that the impacts of snowpack declines on plant growth are negative unless there is sufficient available water hock et al 2019 variation across the urg in the timing and amount of summer rainfall would lead to variation in plant growth and evapotranspiration as it does in other high elevation rocky mountain headwater basins carroll et al 2020 increasing temperatures raise evapotranspiration rates necessitating plants have more water available to sustain growth jai et al 2019 though declining snowpack would provide less and rains are increasingly more variable usgcrp 2017 water that is used by plants is not available for groundwater generation or sustaining river flows in summer months efforts are underway to characterize watershed wide evapotranspiration rates in the east river community watershed and develop models that predict the effects of changing snowpack on ecosystems and water supply hubbard et al 2018 4 4 5 implications for riparian vegetation the dominant cottonwoods populus spp and willows salix spp of riparian habitats in the rocky mountain west have life history strategies that are tightly linked to river hydrographs in particular the timing of seed dispersal by cottonwoods and most willows matches the timing of peak snowmelt discharge which assures that the small short lived seeds of these woody species fall on the most favorable seedbed of moist sediments cleared of other competing vegetation amlin and rood 2002 karrenberg et al 2002 gonzalez et al 2016 this synchrony in timing of snowmelt peak spring discharge and woody riparian seed dispersal is key to the long term maintenance of the highly diverse cottonwood willow woodland habitat thus any change in snowmelt that impacts the timing and or magnitude of the spring discharge peak is potentially problematic for riparian ecosystems the cue for cottonwood seed dispersal appears to be partially driven by day length since the broad window for seed dispersal is fairly constant across years mahoney and rood 1998 however a component of seeding phenology is triggered by temperature winter cooling followed by the onset of spring warming perry et al degree day modeling effectively predicts timing of peak seed release in the san joaquin river basin of california stella et al 2006 and likely applies in the rocky mountain region as well benjankar et al 2014 however in areas like the urg where warmer winters may become the norm the decline in winter chilling is likely to lead to a de coupling of seed release and peak discharge for populus and some salix species perry et al 2020 lower magnitude discharge peaks are known to wreak havoc on both cottonwood seedling establishment mahoney and rood 1998 johnson 2000 sher and marshall 2003 and on the long term survival of mature cottonwood forest williams and cooper 2005 merritt and poff 2010 as can be seen in myriad studies of dam controlled rivers flow regulation on dammed rivers essentially mimics the impact of prolonged drought on riparian woodlands dott et al 2016 giving us insights into how a water limited future might affect these highly diverse habitats 5 conclusions the observed impacts of climate change from the measured snowpack record of long term stations of the urg include a decline in maximum annual swe and advancement in maximum swe and snowmelt onset timing while there are important differences in site specific trends that could be helpful for local planning the regional mann kendall trend analysis provides generalizable results at the watershed scale and a broader understanding of watershed impacts the observed and continuing changes in maximum swe amount timing and advancement of the snowmelt window broadly affect both managed human systems such as water rights compacts and water resources as well as ecosystems including riparian and upland vegetation the importance of synchrony in timing of established ecological and human systems cannot be overstated in certain situations flexibilities can be added such as allowing for flexible local irrigation scheduling in other situations such as over allocated basins identifying flexibilities and bolstering adaptive capacity may require collaborative scientific investigation and community based responses finally certain anticipated impacts such as upslope migration of species and riparian vegetation seed dispersal timing mismatches may have limited adaptation solutions and require creative and novel solutions to maintain systemic

8227,study region upper rio grande basin united states study focus both measured and modeled hydrologic studies report warming related changes in the hydrologic cycle however studies using measured data often rely on april 1 snow water equivalent swe instead of peak swe to understand climate related hydrograph shifts we investigate trends in maximum swe timing of maximum swe and snow depletion and length of the snowmelt window using measured data with both linear regression and mann kendall methods to provide an integrated understanding of the trends new hydrological insights for the region of 16 locations with the longest data record 1980 2018 in the region more than half had significant declines in maximum swe regional trends using all sites collectively showed a decline in maximum swe of 0 4 cm year maximum swe was earlier at 10 13 of 16 sites depending upon method trends at individual locations show a wide range in maximum swe advancement 18 48 days regional maximum swe advanced three weeks snowpack depletion was similarly early at more than half the sites although snowmelt occurs earlier there was no change in the snowmelt window days between peak swe and no snow the reduced maximum swe may relate to reduced snowfall increased sublimation or lower albedo associated with dust we describe the ecological and social impacts of these observed shifts in snow amount and runoff timing for headwaters communities water compacts mountain ecosystems and riparian vegetation keywords snow water equivalent snotel rio grande basin climate change 1 introduction changes in the hydrological cycle have been both modeled and observed across the western united states including earlier snowmelt runoff marshall et al 2019 regonda et al 2005 rhoades et al 2018 stewart et al 2005 reduced summer streamflow and less frequent low elevation snowfall knowles et al 2006 milly and dunne 2020 as expected in a warming climate while these observations occur broadly across the western united states there are important regional differences in observed changes to the hydrologic cycle harpold et al 2012 streamflow and climate data indicate a declining fraction of runoff attributable to snowpack in the upper rio grande urg headwaters catchment in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains of southern colorado and northern new mexico chavarria and gutzler 2018 this observed change confirms model projections of decreasing runoff from snowpack in the urg basin with increasing temperature elias et al 2015b a decrease in urg april 1 snow water equivalent swe of 25 1958 2015 chavarria and gutzler 2018 suggests a need to further investigate snowpack changes over the entire snowmelt window to better understand the characteristics of climate related hydrograph shifts and the implications for ecological and human communities we analyze trends using 40 years of measured snowpack conditions through the lens of key components of the hydrologic cycle we investigate trends in maximum swe timing of snow depletion and time between peak snow cover and snow depletion via both linear regression and the nonparametric mann kendall methods for an integrated understanding of the trends since liner regression is sensitive to outliers such as the abnormally high precipitation in the early 1980 s whereas the mann kendall test indicates if the data tend in one direction this study builds upon previous studies by investigating trends and variation in snowpack characteristics using observed data to test the hypothesis that climate change is already affecting observed snowpack and runoff in ways consistent with climate model projections observed changes have been attributed to regional scale warming kapnick and hall 2012 with variation in snowpack regimes across the western united states trujillo and molotch 2014 understanding the ecological and social implications of these alterations in the snowmelt hydrograph supports community based management and planning efforts 1 1 upper rio grande basin snowpack in the urg basin of colorado and new mexico provides critical water resources for various uses in this semiarid region the rio grande a bi national river supplies water to three large municipalities albuquerque new mexico el paso texas and juarez mexico an estimated 50 75 of the rio grande flow is sustained by snowmelt from the upper basin rango 2006 the rio grande is one of the most vulnerable mountain watersheds globally with a low supply index and a high demand immerzeel et al 2020 from the headwaters in the san juan and sangre de cristo mountains of colorado the rio grande flows southward to eventually form the international boundary between texas and mexico tree ring analyses indicate that similar to today historic streamflow 1508 2002 in the basin was highly variable and droughts were common woodhouse et al 2012 climate change related streamflow declines may lead the rio grande into continual drought dettinger et al 2015 and increased aridification overpeck and udall 2020 which will be exacerbated by warmer temperatures such temperature increases have already been documented for this region usgcrp 2017 1 2 snowpack trends based upon observational data observed data provide direct evidence of swe trends over the western united states previous analysis of linear trends in urg april 1 swe 1930 1950 showed increasing swe in the early record and declining observed swe in the later record 1950 1997 in the new mexico mountains mote et al 2005 the mean swe in the 1990s was the lowest of any 10 year period in the record with temporal behavior of regional mean swe indicating interdecadal variability mote 2003 april 1 swe at nearly 1000 locations across western north america reveals regionally varying relationships with temperature and precipitation mote 2006 linear trends in april 1 swe 1960 2002 vary by elevation and latitude supporting a more in depth regional analysis of changes in swe over time mote 2006 kapnick and hall 2012 changes in the accumulation and melt of snowpack were once thought to be less apparent in the mountains of southern colorado and northern new mexico than those observed in other western mountain ranges especially the lower elevation ranges of oregon and california knowles et al 2006 stewart et al 2005a several studies published results indicating substantial declines in swe and april 1 snowpack in the coastal cascade and sierra nevada mountain ranges eastern oregon and southern idaho harpold et al 2012 mote 2003a this led to an assumption that colorado s high mountain snowpack may be less sensitive to the effects of climate change however recent observational studies using the regional kendall statistical test document substantial shifts in snowmelt timing even in the high elevation cold mountains of colorado clow 2010 even within the intermountain west the spatially and temporally variable hydroclimate and the variable changes in snowmelt timing across the region indicate spatially localized analysis of snowpack may be warranted to further understand shifts in components of the hydrological cycle and local variability in swe trends harpold et al 2012 especially shifts in peak runoff 1 3 snowmelt modeling in the upper rio grande modeling studies corroborate and extend observational studies minimizing the challenges posed by the limited spatial and temporal coverage of some data sets observations represent only a small portion of the spatial area whereas modeling studies can fulfill the need to expand to broader spatial scales and estimate the impact of anticipated changes in future temperature and precipitation regimes previous studies use hydrologic modeling of the basin to evaluate how anticipated changes in temperature and precipitation may impact snowpack and streamflow a modeling study relying upon the variable infiltration capacity model showed a downward trend in april 1 swe and earlier snowmelt in the west due primarily to warming hamlet et al 2005 the rio grande near del norte basin was simulated to represent an extremely wet year 1979 a dry year 1977 and a moderate year 1976 rango and martinec 1997 using a projected temperature increase of 4c the proportion of total annual runoff occurring in the summer was less in a dry year 76 than a wet year 93 simulated climate change increased the proportion of winter runoff and decreased the proportion of summer runoff in dry moderate and wet simulations of the rio grande another study showed most of the rio grande runoff was shifted from june july to april may in a warming climate rango and martinec 2000 model simulations of 24 sub basins of the urg with four future conditions warmer wetter warmer drier hotter wetter and hotter drier resulted in earlier peak streamflow and declines in snow covered area elias et al 2015a daily hydrographs show higher march april streamflow but lower flows from mid may to the end of the water year the changes in simulated streamflow due to climate change have recently been verified in the observational record using measured streamflow chavarria and gutzler 2018 with nearly 40 years of measured swe data at 16 sites in the urg focused analyses using the entire temporal record of observed snowpack data with linear nonparametric and regional trend analyses broadens understanding of how warming is already changing the high mountain snowpack window in the highly vulnerable rio grande watershed dettinger et al 2015 however trend analyses can be complicated by weather variability the early 1980s had record or near record snowfall in the rio grande serreze et al 1999 the unusually high precipitation in the early 1980s and the unusually low precipitation in 2018 may impact trend analysis leading to the need to evaluate different temporal windows based upon precipitation variability harpold et al 2012 to address these limitations we use varied statistical analytical methods and data record lengths to evaluate trends 2 methods 2 1 snow data we use measured data from the snotel sites in the urg with the longest measurement record to evaluate measured changes in snow water storage and snowmelt timing snow data of the snowpack telemetry snotel network through 2018 were obtained from the natural resources conservation service nrcs water and climate center https www wcc nrcs usda gov snow snotel data html snotel provides continuous data that enable observation of daily changes in snow cover not captured in biweekly or monthly surveys of the 44 snotel sites in the urg we selected 16 sites based on longevity 30 year or longer data record fig 1 table 1 the selected sites represent a wide geographic region including both the san juan and sangre de cristo mountain ranges tributary to the urg the sites also range in elevation by nearly 1 000 m 2560 to 3 536 m above sea level six of the sites are in the sangre de cristo mountains with varying aspects the remaining ten are in the san juan mountains with northern eastern and southern aspects 2 2 trend analyses snow water equivalent swe is an estimate of the depth of water that would theoretically be observed if the entire snowpack were to melt instantaneously we first organized the swe data into october 1 september 30 water years for example observations comprising water year 1984 would span october 1 1983 to september 30 1984 for each snotel site by water year combination we calculated 4 response variables from the swe data 1 maximum swe 2 arrival of maximum swe 3 arrival of snowpack depletion following maximum swe and 4 length of snowmelt window we defined maximum swe as the highest daily swe amount occurring at a site within a water year the arrival of maximum swe was the day on which this amount occurred expressed as number of days after the start of the water year when the maximum swe occurred on more than one day we chose the latest day as the response arrival of snowpack depletion was the first day after maximum swe on which a swe value of 0 was observed also expressed as number of days after the start of the water year since the precision of snotel sensors is reported to be 0 1 in nrcs 2020 we tested the analyses using a no snow threshold of 0 1 in and found very little difference in the results supplemental material we defined length of snowmelt window to be the number of days between maximum swe and snowpack depletion we ran linear regression and non parametric mann kendall tests separately for each of the 4 response variables and 16 snotel sites to assess trends by employing both tests we are accounting for outliers such as the high precipitation in the early 1980 s linear regression as well as the lack of normally distributed data mann kendall combining these statistical methods gives a more holistic picture than would relying upon only one to assess urg wide trends we also pooled the snotel sites and applied regional mann kendall tests for each of the 4 response variables all of these analyses were conducted in two ways 1 using data from water years 1980 2018 and 2 using water years 1984 2018 to avoid the effect of the exceptionally wet period observed in the early 1980s as recommended by harpold et al 2012 we used r for all data processing and analyses r core team 2019 wickham et al 2019 mann kendall tests were conducted with the rkt package marchetto 2017 and reported results as significant p 0 05 or marginally significant 0 05 p 0 10 3 results trends in annual maximum swe and timing were assessed using a linear regression 1980 2018 b linear regression 1984 2018 c regional mann kendall regression and d mann kendall regression 1984 2018 3 1 trends in maximum water held in urg snowpack trends using three methods a b and d indicate that the peak water held in the snowpack declined at 9 11 of 16 sites depending upon method based upon linear regression for the entire record 1980 2018 method a nine of 16 stations had a significant decline in maximum swe while the other seven stations showed no significant trend in maximum swe fig 2 table 2 the 1984 2018 timeframe changed results slightly with chamita swe declines no longer significant but two other stations whisky creek and middle creek with significant declines in annual swe using the shorter record using linear regression with the shorter record 1984 2018 method b ten of 16 stations had a significant decline in maximum annual swe the mann kendall test 1984 2018 method d for individual snotel sites showed declines in maximum annual swe at most snotel sites with 11 of 16 significant p 0 05 one marginal p 0 09 and four stations apishapa culebra north costilla and slumgullion with no significant change in maximum swe three of the four stations with no significant change in maximum swe are in the sangre de cristo mountains and the other site slumgullion is one of the highest in elevation these same sites also had no change using linear regression methods a and b above the regional mann kendall trends which synthesize data from all 16 snotel sites show a significant decline in annual maximum swe p 0 0001 table 3 the regional average decline in maximum swe 1984 2018 was 0 43 cm year equating to approximately 14 5 cm if extrapolated over the measurement record 3 2 trends in timing of maximum snow water equivalent trends using three methods a b and d indicate earlier maximum swe at 10 13 of 16 sites depending upon method nearly all 13 of 16 of the snotel stations had maximum swe occurring earlier in the year a fig 3 table 2 the shorter timeframe 1984 2018 method b resulted in 11 of 16 stations reporting significantly earlier maximum swe the individual snotel station mann kendall tests had 10 of 16 locations with significantly earlier maximum swe p 0 05 two more sites with marginally significantly earlier swe p 0 10 and four stations with no change in maximum swe timing hopewell culebra and slumgullion had no change in maximum swe timing in all three individual location trend analyses middle creek and cumbres trestle were not significant using the shorter timeframe but cumbres trestle approaches significance in the mann kendall analysis p 0 09 mann kendall trends at individual locations had slopes between 0 53 and 1 4 days per year or an average of 18 senorita divide to 48 lily pond days earlier maximum swe regional mann kendall analysis which collectively analyses data for all stations showed significantly earlier arrival of maximum swe p 0 0001 thiel sen s slope 0 6 days table 3 on average this equates to maximum swe approximately 22 days earlier in 2018 as compared with 1984 3 3 trends in timing of snowpack depletion to estimate if the snowpack in the urg is melting earlier we calculated the number of days between the beginning of each water year 1 october and the day with no snow for each year trends using three methods a b and d indicate that snow cover depletion occurred earlier in the year at 9 11 of 16 snotel sites depending upon analytical method fig 4 table 2 snow cover depletion was significantly earlier at the 7 stations with the lowest elevation ranging from 2560 to 3 048 m above sea level using all three methods the same stations showing no change in maximum swe timing also showed no change in snow cover depletion hopewell cumbres trestle culebra and slumgullion two sites were no longer significant using the shorter timeframe method b middle creek and north costilla reflecting importance of timeframe at certain sites but both sites were significant p 0 10 using the mann kendall method method d table 3 regional mann kendall analysis which collectively analyses data for all stations showed significantly earlier snowpack depletion p 0 0001 thiel sen s slope 0 5 days table 3 on average this equates to snowpack depletion approximately 17 days earlier in 2018 as compared with 1984 for those interested in specific dates by watershed the y axis on figs 3 and 4 corresponds to the day of the year 1 october 1 182 april 1 in non leap years for example in 1981 at senorita divide day 215 was the first day with no snow at the measured site which corresponds to may 4 of that year the slope indicates an estimate of the average number of days to maximum and zero swe for example maximum and zero swe at apishapa were an average of 34 and 33 days earlier respectively 3 4 trends in the length of the snowmelt window to evaluate if snowpack is melting faster we calculated the number of days between latest peak swe and no snow each year using linear regression on both timeframes 1980 2018 and 1984 2018 and nonparametric analyses 15 of 16 stations showed no change in the snowmelt window indicating that even though snowmelt may be earlier it still takes the same total mean number of days each year fig 5 table 2 only one snotel station had a significant trend in the length of the snowmelt window which appears to be increasing at that station regional mann kendall analyses indicate no change in the length of the snowmelt window table 3 the lack of trend in the duration of melt may be related to the physics of snowmelt since the same energy is required to melt the snowpack regardless of melt timing suggesting importance in time of year day length and latitude across different regions 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of using different methods given the unusually high snowpack in the early 1980 s we elected to analyze trends for two time periods one beginning in 1980 and one beginning in 1984 under the assumption that there might be more locations with significant declines using the entire record however neither max swe nor the snowmelt window reported an increase in significant trends using the longer record max swe and zero swe timing had 2 and 3 more significantly early locations with the longer record respectively while the longer record did not consistently lead to more significant trends it did lead to differing results at some sites linear regression results were different for max swe 3 sites max swe timing 2 sites and no swe timing 3 sites for the differing time periods similarly mann kendall results were different for max swe 3 sites swe timing 2 sites and no swe timing 2 sites reinforcing the importance of outliers on trend analyses nonparametric methods 1984 2018 resulted in one additional significant location for both max swe and zero swe timing indicating a difference in results based upon methodology and a more integrated understanding of the trends regional kendall trend analyses were helpful in generalizing basin wide trends our results indicate it may be advisable to analyze linear trends absent weather related anomal but nonparametric site and regional methods support broader understanding of impacts impacts vary on a site by site basis so if localized management is a primary objective then we recommend local site analysis 4 2 results compared with other observational studies our analysis differs from previous studies in three ways we use a more recent time frame 1980 2018 we use maximum annual swe rather than april 1 swe and we use multiple statistical methods to evaluate trends a previous study evaluating changes in snowmelt timing in the colorado mountains using regional mann kendall trend analysis found earlier snowmelt at both the sangre de cristo and san juan snotel stations but reported no significant trends using linear regression clow 2010 we found significant trends using all four methods and time frame combinations fig 6 our results indicate a statistically significant decline in maximum swe at 9 of 16 sites using linear regression perhaps reflecting the longer data record and selection of maximum swe mann kendall trends in our analysis 0 43 cm year are within the ranges reported for the sangre de cristo mountains 0 28 0 44 cm year but less than those reported for the san juan mountains 0 96 1 0 cm per year using 1978 2007 april 1 swe clow 2010 regional kendall trend maximum swe declined by 3 6 cm per decade clow 2010 and 4 3 cm per decade in this analysis perhaps reflecting the additional decade of data and the observed general warming trend usgcrp 2017 individual site mann kendall declines in this analysis ranged from 2 4 cm per decade red river pass to 9 7 cm per decade beartown our site analysis indicate considerable variation in swe decline by location that is lost when sites are analyzed collectively in the regional kendall trend analysis regional variation in snow provides resilience in that snow conditions can vary greatly across a basin and while one portion of a watershed my supply limited downstream water another portion of the watershed may augment streamflow while ice and permafrost changes are long lasting snow may vary greatly across subbasins and rebound more quickly than ice and permafrost hock et al 2019 earlier peak and zero snowpack reported here relates to the earlier snowmelt reported by others clow 2010 our results show basin wide maximum swe to be 6 0 days per decade earlier using regional kendall trend analysis 1984 2018 individual site mann kendall trends show maximum swe to be 5 8 14 0 days earlier per decade these results are reflective of earlier snowmelt onset for the sangre de cristo mountains 8 0 9 9 days per decade and the san juan mountains 6 0 7 9 days decade using 1979 2007 data clow 2010 both timing of maximum swe and snowmelt onset have advanced between one and two weeks earlier per decade similar to hamlet 2005 we found maximum swe accumulation and melt to be occurring earlier in the year and these trends are sensitive to winter temperature regimes however our changes occurred in high intermountain catchments which were reported to be fairly insensitive compared to the near coastal mountains of the pacific northwest and california hamlet 2005 the difference in findings may be our analyses extended the data record to 2018 adding an additional 15 years of information interestingly the four northern most sites in the san juan mountains apishapa culebra whisky creek and north costilla represent a cluster of sites with no significant decline in max swe but they are amongst the sites with generally lower historic swe and they represent mid elevation sites the 6 snotel sites with the lowest elevation had significant declines in max swe indicating that decreasing trends in max swe may be most evident at the lowest elevation sites more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow as a response to warming across the region was most evident at locations with minimum temperatures 5 c knowles et al 2006 however in the urg high elevation sites have the largest shift in maximum swe timing lilypond and reduction in snowpack depth beartown fig 7 4 3 potential causes of reduced snowpack and early runoff in the urg prior studies have suggested causes of reduced urg snowpack including reduced snowfall increased snowpack sublimation and lower albedo associated with dust loading on spring snowpack one of the most profound and widely anticipated changes in the urg hydrological cycle is the temperature induced shift of precipitation from snow towards rain and earlier melt of the snowpack musselman et al 2017 especially at lower elevation watersheds lynn et al 2020 the mean fractionation of precipitation that falls as snow has been shown to have a significant influence on the mean annual streamflow independent of precipitation amount berghuijs et al 2014 reduced snowfall indicated by reduction in snow and increase in rainfall during the historical snow accumulation season has been reported in the urg knowles et al 2006 and may be partially responsible for the decreasing snowpack trends in the urg increased sublimation of snowpack lapp et al 2005 and lower snow albedo associated with increased dust loading on spring snowpack painter et al 2012 may contribute to the observed trends in decreased snowpack and earlier melt window 4 4 implications of lower snowpack and earlier runoff 4 4 1 implications for downstream water management snowpack is a critically important source of natural water storage in many regions of the world including the western united states and is vulnerable immerzeel et al 2019 the enormous changes in supply and demand caused by climate change will force water managers to address new problems lópez moreno et al 2020 the rio grande supplies fresh water to more than 6 million people across three states and two countries the duration of snowpack in the urg basin critically controls the timing and magnitude of regional water supplies to power generation irrigation scheduling and planting harvesting dates legal water systems and wildfire regimes westerling and bryant 2006 climate change will increase the sensitivity of groundwater generation carroll et al 2019 and further affect the use and distribution of water resources in the urg basin water managers and planners currently face specific challenges in particular greater uncertainty in the timing and volume of water supply that may worsen with climate change changes in snowpack and streamflow timing may affect reservoir operations including flood control decision making and management additionally changes in the timing and magnitude of runoff may affect diversion storage and other water supply infrastructures economic impacts are also significant since changes in reservoir storage affect municipal agricultural and ski and river recreation activities 4 4 2 water law and interstate water compacts water law in the united states is a complex combination of federal and state regulations here we provide examples specific to the urg of the impacts of changes in water volume and timing on water policy and management water laws may have actions triggered on certain calendar dates that may no longer be appropriate in an environment with an earlier melt window in 2010 the colorado state engineer added flexibility to the irrigation season for producers in the san luis valley colorado an agricultural region in the urg state of colorado d o n r and division of water resources 2010 the former irrigation season typically began april 1 and ended november 1 the 2010 change codified flexibility by allowing the ability to establish the beginning and ending of an irrigation season in a particular year based upon environmental factors including temperature precipitation soil moisture as well as streamflow forecasts and other considerations this legal change directly helps irrigators cope with the observed earlier melt window by ensuring local management flexibility cody 2018 an additional element of legal flexibility relates to decreed amount of water delivered over 95 of the available surface waters in the united states are governed by interstate water compacts hall 2010 of the 27 interstate water compacts active in the united states two apply in the urg observed runoff shifts reported here directly affect the costilla creek compact colorado and new mexico and the rio grande compact colorado new mexico and texas the rio grande compact differs from other western compacts in that it provides for adjusted allocations based on actual flow levels hall 2010 under the rio grande compact colorado delivers a specified amount of water to new mexico each year starting at 10 000 acre feet and modified based upon water measured at four stations in the urg in contrast the costilla creek compact is based upon specific flow rate allotments and set flow rates for irrigable land costilla creek drains a small watershed along the colorado new mexico border tributary to the rio grande agricultural water demand often exceeds supply and the creek rarely reaches the rio grande climate change will further destabilize water in costilla creek hall 2010 argued that the costilla creek compact lacks provisions for water conservation ecosystem protection restricting transbasin diversions or otherwise managing water demand and is totally inadequate for adaptively managing or allocating water rights under the expected stress from climate change climate resilience will likely be enhanced by establishing legal management flexibility in both water delivery timing and amount while allowing for ecosystem protection and water conservation to balance the supply demand challenges xu et al 2014 4 4 3 reduced streamflow impacts on acequia communities acequia communities in the upper rio grande basin are amongst the most exposed to the impacts of declining streamflow from snowpack acequias are community irrigation canals that have a 400 year history in the region more than just a means of distributing water acequias are local institutions that are central to the society and culture of the agricultural communities who depend on them rivera 2011 acequia communities are typically situated in narrow valleys just below the high elevation tributary basins where annual snowpack accumulates in this topographical position they are the first users of water from snowmelt water from rio grande tributary streams is diverted through acequias to agricultural fields where it is released for flood irrigation cox and ross 2011 besides the value of the water for agriculture in this semi arid region acequia systems also provide ecosystem services seepage of water from the earthen canals combined with flood irrigation practices causes localized elevation of groundwater which in turn supports riparian vegetation along the main canals fernald et al 2007 historically acequia communities have been highly adaptable to water shortage and excess through the process of repartimiento or dividing of waters fernald et al 2012 rivera 2011 indeed the irrigation infrastructure of these communities developed over 100 s of years as did their water sharing traditions and responses to periodic drought for example acequia communities implement water rotation schedules during times of drought emergency water supplies are made available and farmers may plant low water use plants and cull livestock herds in proportion to their expected hay harvest rivera 2011 however a warming climate with reduced streamflow quantity and earlier peak streamflow poses unprecedented threats to acequia communities droughts are projected to become more frequent more severe and longer in duration cook et al 2015 snowpack in the basins above the communities provides a natural reservoir that releases its water during late spring and early summer timed perfectly for the growing season rivera 2011 but with low swe and low streamflow water levels in the tributary streams may be too low to provide the head needed to push water through the acequias rivera 1996 while acequia communities can respond to individual poor years consecutive years with insufficient water are more likely to adversely impact agriculture and impair the ecosystem services associated with flood irrigation 4 4 4 implications for mountain ecosystems mountain snowpack will also indirectly affect water supply through its effects on ecosystems the maximum snow depth and timing of snow depletion have long been considered key drivers for which species live where across mountain watersheds and how much the plants can grow during the snowfree season billings 1973 walker et al 1993 less snow means less water for plant growth though this also leads to earlier snow depletion dates and a lengthened snowfree season in which plants can grow steltzer and post 2009 the observed changes in mountain snowpack including earlier snow depletion decouple water availability and demand for mountain plants wieder et al 2017 and have likely driven changes in the timing of plant growth and the rate and amount of plant growth across the urg over the coming decades a shift in temperature snowline and snowfree season length will also lead to upslope migration of many plant species with consequent changes in mountain biodiversity freeman et al 2018 steinbauer et al 2018 and downslope migration of other plant species due to shifts in water availability rather than temperature crimmins et al 2011 decreased snowpack depth at lower elevations impacts spring denning sites for some mammals barsugli et al 2020 and reduces benefits of spring green wave foraging by migratory ungulates through spring drought aikens et al 2020 though no long term monitoring data on plant growth are available for snotel sites studies from other mountain regions suggest that the impacts of snowpack declines on plant growth are negative unless there is sufficient available water hock et al 2019 variation across the urg in the timing and amount of summer rainfall would lead to variation in plant growth and evapotranspiration as it does in other high elevation rocky mountain headwater basins carroll et al 2020 increasing temperatures raise evapotranspiration rates necessitating plants have more water available to sustain growth jai et al 2019 though declining snowpack would provide less and rains are increasingly more variable usgcrp 2017 water that is used by plants is not available for groundwater generation or sustaining river flows in summer months efforts are underway to characterize watershed wide evapotranspiration rates in the east river community watershed and develop models that predict the effects of changing snowpack on ecosystems and water supply hubbard et al 2018 4 4 5 implications for riparian vegetation the dominant cottonwoods populus spp and willows salix spp of riparian habitats in the rocky mountain west have life history strategies that are tightly linked to river hydrographs in particular the timing of seed dispersal by cottonwoods and most willows matches the timing of peak snowmelt discharge which assures that the small short lived seeds of these woody species fall on the most favorable seedbed of moist sediments cleared of other competing vegetation amlin and rood 2002 karrenberg et al 2002 gonzalez et al 2016 this synchrony in timing of snowmelt peak spring discharge and woody riparian seed dispersal is key to the long term maintenance of the highly diverse cottonwood willow woodland habitat thus any change in snowmelt that impacts the timing and or magnitude of the spring discharge peak is potentially problematic for riparian ecosystems the cue for cottonwood seed dispersal appears to be partially driven by day length since the broad window for seed dispersal is fairly constant across years mahoney and rood 1998 however a component of seeding phenology is triggered by temperature winter cooling followed by the onset of spring warming perry et al degree day modeling effectively predicts timing of peak seed release in the san joaquin river basin of california stella et al 2006 and likely applies in the rocky mountain region as well benjankar et al 2014 however in areas like the urg where warmer winters may become the norm the decline in winter chilling is likely to lead to a de coupling of seed release and peak discharge for populus and some salix species perry et al 2020 lower magnitude discharge peaks are known to wreak havoc on both cottonwood seedling establishment mahoney and rood 1998 johnson 2000 sher and marshall 2003 and on the long term survival of mature cottonwood forest williams and cooper 2005 merritt and poff 2010 as can be seen in myriad studies of dam controlled rivers flow regulation on dammed rivers essentially mimics the impact of prolonged drought on riparian woodlands dott et al 2016 giving us insights into how a water limited future might affect these highly diverse habitats 5 conclusions the observed impacts of climate change from the measured snowpack record of long term stations of the urg include a decline in maximum annual swe and advancement in maximum swe and snowmelt onset timing while there are important differences in site specific trends that could be helpful for local planning the regional mann kendall trend analysis provides generalizable results at the watershed scale and a broader understanding of watershed impacts the observed and continuing changes in maximum swe amount timing and advancement of the snowmelt window broadly affect both managed human systems such as water rights compacts and water resources as well as ecosystems including riparian and upland vegetation the importance of synchrony in timing of established ecological and human systems cannot be overstated in certain situations flexibilities can be added such as allowing for flexible local irrigation scheduling in other situations such as over allocated basins identifying flexibilities and bolstering adaptive capacity may require collaborative scientific investigation and community based responses finally certain anticipated impacts such as upslope migration of species and riparian vegetation seed dispersal timing mismatches may have limited adaptation solutions and require creative and novel solutions to maintain systemic

8228,study region georgia in the southeast usa study focus the water rich southeast usa has long been thought to be immune to climate change effects leading to unsustainable water withdrawals practices this study analyzed the impact of climate change and human activities e g irrigation on groundwater trends at 43 monitoring wells from 1981 to 2017 in four distinct hydrogeologic provinces of georgia usa we have corroborated the groundwater trend analysis with the surface water and climate trend analysis new hydrological insights the deep confined coastal plain and floridan aquifer systems show statistically significant declines in groundwater level by contrast the surficial aquifer system shows relatively neutral trends over the same period the water table in the shallower aquifers corresponds closely to the changes in the precipitation and streamflow trends a declining secular trend in the deeper confined aquifer is potentially attributable to the irrigation water withdrawals in georgia keywords climate change ground water trends surface water trends irrigation withdrawals 1 introduction groundwater is an important natural resource and is an integral part of the global freshwater supply gurdak et al 2009 in the united states groundwater is responsible for up to 40 percent of the freshwater supply with as many as 40 million people consuming groundwater alley et al 1999 gurdak et al 2009 many principal aquifers around the country are in danger of depletion due to climate change and human withdrawals brekke 2009 previous studies have found depleted groundwater aquifer mainly in semi arid to arid climates e g the central valley aquifer california miller et al 2009 the high plains aquifer ogallala aquifer that covers more than 450 000 km2 in eight states of the central united states has shown a continual decline in water table since the 1950s in some areas the drop is 50 m or higher sophocleous 2010 the water rich southeast usa fig 1 has long been thought immune to anthropogenic climate effects on surface and groundwater ingram et al 2013 nwf 2008 the southeast usa typically has high amounts of annual precipitation 1 9 to 1 4 m on average and its interannual variability is linked to the el nino and southern oscillation index enso ford and labosier 2014 labosier and quiring 2013 newman et al 2016 extreme rainfall events measured using the number of days with 3 in or more rainfall in a year have increased and climate model projections show intensification of the southeast s hydrologic cycle karl et al 2009 kumar et al 2015 kunkel et al 2013b melillo et al 2014 over the last 60 years the southeast usa experienced a nearly 40 larger population increase than the rest of the usa terando et al 2014 the 12 states comprising southeast population alabama arkansas florida georgia kentucky louisiana mississippi north carolina south carolina tennessee virginia and west virginia are expected to grow by 29 from 2010 to 2040 https demographics coopercenter org georgia s population is expected to grow by 24 the land use patterns are changing for example the urban area has increased by 200 from 1945 to 1992 sun et al 2008 wear 2002 the water demands have risen due to urban growth and irrigation expansion georgakakos et al 2010 according to painter 2019 overall water use in georgia has declined almost 50 since 1980 due in large part to declining surface water withdrawals 90 of total reduction and decreasing thermoelectric power cooling use 78 of total reduction the period from 1980 to 2000 showed an overall increase in water use with up to 159 increase in irrigation water use from 1990 to 2000 painter 2019 water use for irrigation primarily through groundwater withdrawals in the southern portion of the state is the largest use of groundwater in recent years painter 2019 in georgia acres irrigated have increased roughly 2 000 from 42 408 acres to 936 245 acres from 1976 to 2013 williams et al 2017 high levels of irrigation have been shown to cause aquifer storage loss changes in groundwater flow i e gaining stream to losing stream decreases in stream baseflow and decreases in aquifer recharge mitra et al 2016 2019 although the hydrogeological characteristics of major aquifers in the southeast have been investigated e g miller 1986 hicks et al 1987 johnson and bush 1988 davis 1996 williams and dixon 2015 self trail et al 2019 the effects of climate variability and land use change on groundwater decline and its relationship with hydrogeological characteristics is an active research area the sub seasonal to inter annual groundwater variability is mostly explained by climate variability almanaseer and sankarasubramanian 2012 humphrey et al 2016 however long term declining trends are attributed to the anthropogenic water abstraction in several regions e g northwest india and the middle east humphrey et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 voss et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012 found that a higher pumping rate than the recharge rate has resulted in a continual decline in groundwater in the central and southern high plains shamsudduha et al 2009 have attributed a declining water table 0 5 m 1 m per year to urbanization and dry season rice cultivation in bangladesh hydroclimatic time series show long term persistence ltp the clustering of wet or dry periods for several years also known as the hurst phenomenon hurst 1956 iliopoulou et al 2018 koutsoyiannis 2003 this is especially the case with groundwater data that shows a higher persistence than the precipitation shown later bloomfield and marchant 2013 found a positive correlation between site dependent ltp and groundwater drought s length that can lead to a reduction in streamflow hughes et al 2012 however the effects of ltp on the statistical significance of groundwater trends are not investigated the ltp presents a significant source of uncertainty that leads to an underestimation of variance in the time series and therefore can lead to a false identification of significant trends koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 we employ a nonparametric trend detection technique that accounts for the long term persistence in the time series as documented in our earlier work kumar et al 2009 robust identification of significant trends is helpful to investigate their drivers outside the natural variability realm banerjee et al 2017 kumar et al 2013b singh et al 2020 overall we identify two knowledge gaps 1 effects of ltp on groundwater trend s significance 2 the relationship among groundwater trends hydrogeological characteristics and anthropogenic drivers for georgia s aquifer system we address the knowledge gaps using a large dataset and advanced statistical techniques a total of 404 usgs groundwater monitoring wells have been collected out of which 43 wells had long term daily data availability for the recent historical period 1981 2017 and were analyzed for the changes in the water table a dataset of this size allows us to assess the role of natural and anthropogenic forcing e g land use change and irrigation by testing the hypothesis that effects of climate change on groundwater trends depend on the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system the deviation from the climate variability can potentially be attributed to the anthropogenic causes e g irrigation expansion in the region we organize this research as follows section 2 describes the study area data and methods including discussion about the hydrogeological characteristics data processing and nonparametric trend detection technique we present results from the trend analysis in section 3 we also explore the relationship of groundwater variability with surface water and climate variability in section 3 finally we relate the hydrogeological characteristics with the persistence in the time series using seasonal autocorrelation analysis kumar et al 2019 we present the discussion and implications of our findings in section 4 the conclusion from this study is presented in section 5 2 study area data and methods 2 1 climate georgia located in the southeast usa has a warm temperate climate fully humid precipitation and hot summer temperature kottek et al 2006 long term annual mean precipitation has not changed significantly in the state fig 1a historically georgia and the southeast s average temperature showed no significant warming trend over the 20th century no warming trends are attributed to natural variability and industrial pollution that has declined in recent years banerjee et al 2017 kumar et al 2013b kunkel and angel 2013a yu et al 2014 2 2 aquifer description the fall line divides the hydrogeology of georgia with shallow unconfined aquifers in the north and generally confined aquifer in the south where most agriculture is located fig 1b williams and kuniansky 2016 williams et al 2017 piedmont and blue ridge provinces dominate the northern half the aquifers here are typically unconfined and mostly composed of regolith or crystalline rock aquifers which store water in fractures joints contacts weathered zones and other features clarke and pierce 1985 gordon and painter 2018 the valley and ridge province has thrusted and folded parallel ridges underlain by resistant sandstone conglomerate or cherty dolostone and valleys underlain by siltstone shale limestone or other weathering prone rocks rutledge and mesko 1996 the groundwater is typically unconfined in joints fractures and solution openings clarke and pierce 1985 in this paper piedmont and blue ridge aquifer systems are lumped into one group the northern aquifer system nas due to the similarities of the aquifers and the lack of dense observation network fig 1b the south of the fall line is comprised of three different aquifer systems the floridan aquifer system fas carbonate rocks the coastal plain aquifer system cpas clastic rocks and the surficial aquifer system sas fig 1b gordon and painter 2018 williams and dixon 2015 aquifers are typically confined except for the northern extent of the coastal plain and the surficial aquifer system clarke and pierce 1985 the floridan aquifer system is one of the most productive in the us and is mainly used as the primary source of freshwater fanning and trent 2009 miller 1986 the floridan aquifer system is separated into the upper and lower floridan aquifers the upper floridan aquifer is of eocene to oligocene aged limestone dolomite and calcareous sand usgs 2006 the lower floridan aquifer is defined as the unit under the middle floridan confining unit which is exposed at the surface in some portions of southeast georgia as part of the floridan aquifer system miller 1988 the upper floridan aquifer is confined in areas where it is overlain by siliciclastic sediments or a low permeability miocene aged limestone and is unconfined at surface outcrops at the northern extent of the aquifer and through karst features to the southwest and southcentral parts of georgia miller 1986 williams and dixon 2015 denizman 2018 the aquifer thickens to the southeast up to a maximum depth of around 500 m miller 1986 the coastal plain aquifer system is composed of a thick wedge of unconsolidated to poorly consolidated jurassic to holocene clastic rocks that dips to the southeast from the fall line to the atlantic ocean renken 1996 the floridan aquifer system overlies the coastal plain aquifer system and both are hydraulically interconnected laterally lower floridan carbonates to the south which grades into coastal plain clastics of the same age to the north and vertically in the upper floridan gradual gradations or interfingering between clastics and carbonates and underlain by crystalline bedrock renken 1996 fig 2 the surficial aquifer system forms a thin irregular blanket of the terrace and alluvial sands that overlies the floridan aquifer system williams and dixon 2015 the surficial aquifer system acts as temporary groundwater storage that may ultimately recharge the underlying floridan aquifer system williams and kuniansky 2016 thus we have divided groundwater well data into four major aquifer systems 1 floridan aquifer system fas 2 coastal plain aquifer system cpas 3 surficial aquifer system sas and 4 northern aquifer system nas the deep confined aquifers in caps have a median depth of 194 m below the ground level the fas accounts for the maximum number of wells 27 out of 43 and has a median depth of 106 m in contrast the surficial aquifer has a median depth of 8 m table 1 2 3 data georgia groundwater table data for 404 monitoring wells were collected from the united states geological survey usgs national water information system nwis daily water table measurements were obtained from the database for each well for the period from 1951 to present however most of the wells did not have continuous daily measurements over this entire time interval to include the most wells possible 43 wells were determined to have 90 or more data available over a time range from 1981 to 2017 supplementary table 1 all the wells used in this study are designated as monitoring wells i e they are not used for human consumption and instrumentally record daily water table measurements other information retrieved from the nwis database includes latitude and longitude for the station name of the regional and local aquifer the depth of the well typically determines their aquifer category however usgs aquifer classification was ultimately used as the determining factor for aquifer categorization such as in areas where the surficial aquifer was identified but the coastal plains aquifer is known to outcrop fig 2 and supplementary table 1 additionally we employed usgs surface water observation streamflow falcone et al 2010 and high resolution parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate data to corroborate the groundwater analysis long term streamflow observations at reference sites that have minimal human interference are not available in georgia singh et al 2020 hence we employed streamflow observations from non reference sites prism uses climate observations from a wide range of monitoring networks applies quality control measures and topography dependent spatial interpolation techniques to develop high resolution 4 km spatial climate datasets to reveal short term and long term climate patterns for the conterminous united states daly et al 1994 2008 we also used usgs s 2012 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis irrigated agriculture 1 kilometer dataset to determine the irrigation extent in georgia pervez and brown 2010 fig 1b 2 4 metrics four groundwater statistics annual average ann mean 1 day minimum ann min 1 day maximum ann max and annual range the difference between 1 day max and 1 day min were computed to capture the complete spectrum of groundwater change in georgia the annual range is a measure of reliability an increasing trend in the annual range suggests less reliable groundwater availability i e a higher groundwater table in the wet season or the deeper groundwater tables in the dry season or both kumar et al 2014 the groundwater statistics were computed for each station and each year using the daily data then the annual time series were employed for the trend calculation using the nonparametric method we used the mean standardized departure msd eq 1 to average the time series of different groundwater wells in the given regions and to compare the groundwater variation with the climate variations 1 z x μ σ where x is the value being standardized e g annual mean time series μ is the mean of the distribution and σ is the standard deviation of the time series we standardize the time series locally e g at each station then average it across the aquifer system or the state wide hence the standard deviation of averaged msd can become smaller than one if the spatial variability or noise is greater e g state average msd of precipitation 2 5 nonparametric trend detection we compute trends using the theil sen method sen 1968 theil 1992 eq 2 and its significance is determined using nonparametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 if x 1 x 2 x n is a time series x of given length n in years then magnitude of trend tsa is given as below 2 t s a m e d i a n x j x i j i f o r a l l i j the trend significance calculation accounts for long term persistence in the time series as described in our previous study kumar et al 2009 the nonparametric method has the following advantages 1 it contains no prior assumption about the linear trend 2 it is more accurate in detecting trend higher power in non normally distributed data e g streamflow önöz and bayazit 2003 yue et al 2002 and 3 it is robust against outliers we determine ltp using the hurst coefficient h hurst 1951 the concept of the hurst coefficient is based on the hypothesis that hydroclimatic time series xt exhibit scale invariant properties koutsoyiannis 2003 i e 3 z i k k μ k l h z j l l μ where represents equality in finite dimensional joint distribution μ is the expected value of x t z i k is the aggregated stochastic process at a scale k an integer greater than 1 defined as 4 z i k p i 1 k 1 i k x p and z j k is the aggregated stochastic process at scale k and h is the hurst coefficient for a stationary and positively correlated time series h varies in the range 0 5 1 h 0 5 indicates independence and increasing values of h represent increasing ltp intensities koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 we estimated the hurst coefficient from the detrended data as the maximum likelihood estimator of a fractional gaussian noise process eq 3 hamed 2008 non gaussian data can also follow the fractional gaussian noise process koutsoyiannis 2000 2003 a full description of the application of the statistical methods is given in kumar et al 2009 if h is statistically significant then the variance of the time series is inflated empirically for statistical significance calculation using the nonparametric mann kendall test hamed 2008 kendall 1975 mann 1945 this methodology successfully identifies multi decadal climate variability in the southeastern us kumar et al 2013a a comparison with the short term persistence stp model is shown in the supplementary materials the stp method calculates the statistical significance after trend free pre whitening of the time series i e removing the influence of the lag1 autocorrelation from the detrended time series kumar et al 2009 yue et al 2002 2 6 linear trend attribution following humphrey et al 2016 we divided total long term variability x l o n g into linear x l i n and inter annual components x i n t e r where x l o n g is the annual time series the x l o n g is same as the x time series discussed above because we use annual time series i e sub seasonal or seasonal variability are not investigated we computed the inter annual variability component from the detrended time series x i n t e r i x l o n g i t s a i and attributed the remainder to the linear trend as follows 5 x l o n g x l i n x i n t e r 6 r l i n 1 σ i n t e r 2 σ l o n g 2 r l i n is the fraction of total variability explained by the linear trend component where σ l o n g 2 is the variance of x l o n g and σ i n t e r 2 is the variance of x i n t e r 2 7 comparison with grace water storage anomaly we performed time series comparisons between groundwater anomaly data and nasa s total water storage anomalies data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite to understand spatial representativeness of our monitoring well results the grace data measures variations in earth s gravity field which correlates with the regional changes in groundwater storage on earth s surface landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 2 8 memory time scale of the aquifer system we characterized the groundwater aquifers by their memory time scale using seasonal autocorrelation analysis as described by kumar et al 2019 the autocorrelation function of a first order markov process also known as the red noise process is given below amenu et al 2005 chikamoto et al 2015 delworth and manabe 1988 schlosser and milly 2002 7 ρ τ e x p t τ where ρ is autocorrelation function at a given lag t and τ is the decorrelation or e folding time scale also known as the memory time scale i e the lag at which the autocorrelation function becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero 3 results 3 1 regional climate trends the southeast usa has become wetter fig 1b as expected from the wet gets wetter paradigm and under the climate change scenario held and soden 2006 kumar et al 2015 however there are regional variations e g georgia did not experience a statistically significant long term precipitation trend over the last 65 years fig 1b most irrigation expansion has occurred over the southern half of georgia where productive aquifer systems are found fanning and trent 2009 miller 1986 thus the geology and the underlying aquifer systems have played an essential role in determining the spatial extent of the irrigation expansion in georgia fig 1c d most groundwater extraction is contributed to irrigation for crops in georgia painter 2019 3 2 groundwater trends in georgia the groundwater trends are overwhelmingly negative for annual average 1 day minimum and 1 day maximum statistics as much as 30 13 out of 43 of monitoring wells show significantly declining annual average trends under ltp consideration fig 3 and table 1 the number of monitoring wells showing declining trends is 42 for the annual minimum 18 out of 43 and 37 for the annual maximum 16 out of 43 statistics most monitoring wells showing declining trends are in the cpas and fas table 1 considering only stp the number of monitoring wells showing significantly declining trends increases e g 49 of wells 21 out of 43 show the declining trends under stp considerations supplementary fig s1 the range between 1 day maximum and 1 day minimum groundwater levels are increasing in georgia fig 3b the annual range is increasing at 35 of stations 15 out of 43 and decreasing at 12 5 out of 43 of monitoring wells the increasing annual range suggests less reliable groundwater availability kumar et al 2014 which can be due to a more profound decline in the 1 day minimum than the decrease in the 1 day maximum level the declining groundwater trends do not correspond with the minimal or statistically insignificant trend in annual precipitation fig 3 almost the entirety of georgia does not show statistically significant precipitation trends for all four statistics computed from monthly prism precipitation data fig 3 3 3 surface water streamflow trends in georgia observed streamflow records show minimal or no trend which is generally consistent with the minimal trend in the precipitation fig 4 human activities impact most watersheds 30 out of 33 and therefore are categorized as non reference watersheds falcone et al 2010 supplementary table 2 the usgs streamflow observations were processed using the same methodology as the groundwater data for their long term continuous daily data availability from 1981 to 2017 only three non reference watersheds 9 of all watersheds show a statistically significant declining trend in the annual 1 day minimum flow under the ltp considerations the other flow metrics including annual average annual range and annual maximum flow do not show a significant trend the number of stations showing a statistically significant trend in annual one day minimum flow increases to 15 out of which 13 show declining trends when only stp is considered supplementary fig s2 the streamflow trends shown in fig 4 are consistent with the other long term studies for example e g dudley et al 2020 analyzed stormflow trends from 1966 to 2015 and found a declining trend in the 7 day minimum flow for urban dominated watersheds in the southeast singh et al 2020 investigated long term streamflow trends 1951 2015 in the southeast using observations and climate modeling experiments they found no significant streamflow trends at reference watersheds and attributed it to the vegetation growth under elevated co2 concentration that negatively impacts water availability in the region overall we found a declining trend in the groundwater fig 3 whereas the surface water streamflow show no trend fig 4 3 4 drivers of the declining ground water trends in georgia the groundwater trends as a function of hydrogeologic characteristics water withdrawals and recharge variability precipitation anomalies are investigated here fig 5 shows annual averages of standardized anomalies averaged across different wells of the four aquifer systems and the state average we have also shown precipitation anomalies from the locations nearest to each well three out of four aquifer systems show declining groundwater trends that are statistically significant pvalue 0 05 for fas cpas and nas under stp consideration these three aquifer systems show long term persistence ltp table 2 only cpas shows a statistically significant declining trend after considering the ltp the sas shows no trend similar to the precipitation trend the fas largely influences the statewide average groundwater trend fig 5e due to the maximum number of monitoring wells in the aquifer 27 of the 43 the fas is hydrologically interconnected with surface water bodies and may act either as an unconfined or a confined aquifer depending on location therefore some similarity in trends between the surficial aquifer and the fas is expected likewise the fas shows similarities with the deeper mostly confined cpas a strong declining trend in the cpas combined with a milder decline in fas makes the statewide trend statistically significant table 2 the confined cpas shows the most substantial decline of any aquifer system in the state to elaborate it further we performed a correlation analysis between the groundwater anomaly and precipitation anomaly groundwater anomaly and enso index and precipitation anomaly and enso index considering all 37 years of data table 3 overall the surficial or shallower aquifers showed the highest correlation with precipitation and enso while the deeper aquifers showed the least correlation with the enso and precipitation one year lag enso index show slightly improved correlation with groundwater variability in all but the nas for example the correlation coefficient improves from 0 40 for the concurrent enso and groundwater to 0 53 for lag 1 enso and groundwater in the fas two year lag enso and groundwater correlations are considerably smaller not shown the groundwater shows a higher correlation with the precipitation than it did with the enso table 3 previous studies have also found the relationship between enso and the surface water and shallow aquifer systems mitra et al 2014 singh et al 2015 2016 additionally this study finds that the cpas the deepest aquifer system has the least correlation that is not statistically significant indicating a greater role of the human withdrawals i e the linear trend however the correlation between precipitation and detrended time series of groundwater x i n t e r eq 5 becomes statistically significant for all aquifers including the cpas table 3 suggesting that climate variability as an important driver of inter annual groundwater water variability contribution of the linear trend r l i n varies considerably across the aquifer systems table 2 and fig 5 for the state average the linear trend accounts for 31 of the total long term variability the linear trend contributes to 84 of the total variability in the cpas droughts and human withdrawals are both factors which have been shown to contribute to groundwater decline hughes et al 2012 humphrey et al 2016 there are several drought periods in the the time series e g drought period 1980 82 1985 89 1998 2003 2006 07 and 2012 which may have exacerbated the declining groundwater trends in georgia painter 2019 however the area underlain by the fas and cpas has been shown to have a 2000 increase in irrigation acreage between 1976 and 2013 williams et al 2017 fig 1d and to be mainly supplied by groundwater withdrawals for agricultural and domestic use painter 2019 this suggests that direct human intervention has played a larger role r l i n 84 for declining groundwater trends in the cpas the irrigation has also expanded considerably in the fas but it shows a smaller contribution of the linear trend 16 hence we conclude that contribution of the linear trends is dependent upon the hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer system 3 5 spatial variability in trends and comparison with the remotely sensed total water storage anomalies grace data there is considerable spatial variability in groundwater trends table 2 and fig 3 e g 13 out of 43 monitoring wells state wide show significant decline in annual mean trends with ltp consideration and 2 wells show increasing trends even in the cpas only 4 monitoring wells out of 10 show statistically significant decline out of four statistics investigated here annual 1 day minimum ann min shows highest number of wells 18 wells with statistically significant decline to understand the spatial representativeness of the our monitoring well results e g fig 5 we compare the state average results with the grace data that provides total water storage anomaly at coarse spatial resolution 100 km landerer and swenson 2012 the grace data show a very similar trend to groundwater throughout the comparative periods 2002 2016 correlation coefficient 0 87 fig 6 a strong agreement between the monitoring well data and grace indicates that the analysis is consistent with an independent water balance metric 3 6 characteristics of groundwater aquifers in georgia the memory time scale τ was least for the surficial aquifers system and highest for the deep aquifer system we computed the seasonal autocorrelation function for groundwater anomalies averaged for each aquifer fig 7 the unconfined sas shows the least memory among various aquifer systems around six months for all seasons with a slight increase in memory in the summer season the nas looks relatively similar to the sas but with slightly longer memory in the summer and fall seasons the fas shows more extended memory than the previous two aquifers substantially with a memory of 12 18 months depending on seasons lastly the confined cpas shows the most extended memory with a memory of over 24 months across all months the nas and fas show autocorrelation that approaches zero and then reemerges back to statistical significance previously this has been shown to indicate that deeper soil layers with more memory have forced a long memory in the shallower layers kumar et al 2019 similarly seasonally varying processes have been shown to provide long term thermal memory in extratropical oceans alexander and deser 1995 alexander et al 1999 deser et al 2003 the potential reemergence of groundwater appears to occur in both the fas and nas between 12 and 18 months reemergence is the strongest from late summer through winter months jas through djf the fas has a strong correlation from the jas season with a 17 month lead through the ndj season with a 14 month lead this indicates that the correlation of the jas season groundwater table anomaly with the djf groundwater table anomaly 17 months later e g jas 2015 anomaly correlating with djf 2016 2017 anomaly a similar reemergence is seen in the nas from the mjj season through the ndj season 3 7 discussion the groundwater trend analysis finds a declining trend especially in the confined aquifer system e g cpas our analysis suggests two different processes are affecting how groundwater aquifer systems are connected to climate variations in georgia the surficial or unconfined sas and nas aquifers show groundwater variability consistent with climate variability furthermore the groundwater variations in the fas are also correlated with the precipitation and enso table 3 on the contrary the confined aquifer cpas has the least correlation with precipitation and enso table 3 and the most significant declining trend after removing the linear trend the correlation between groundwater and precipitation become statistically significant suggesting that climate as an important driver of inter annual variability but the linear trend may be attributed human water withdrawals an application of the ltp method helped us to identify secular trends in climate and water data the number of stations showing statistically significant trend decreased considerably e g from 21 stations with decreasing trend in ann mean groundwater under stp consideration to 13 under ltp consideration the surface water shows minimal or no trend under ltp consistent with the precipitation trend and a decrease in surface water withdrawals in georgia painter 2019 hence we posit that the ltp method identifies robust trends for its biophysical interpretation and attribution the el nino phase ve enso typically lead to statewide increases in the groundwater table while the la nina phase ve enso typically leads to a decrease in groundwater table with the only exception being from 2013 to 2017 groundwater table decreased consistently during the 2013 2017 period even with a strong el nino phase singh et al 2015 found a positive correlation between enso and groundwater variation in the upper floridan aquifer in southwest georgia our new analysis shows the relationship is valid statewide not only in the upper floridan aquifer but also in the surficial aquifer and the northern aquifer systems despite the significant impacts of enso linked climate variability on shallow aquifers water level declines and storage decreases in the deeper confined aquifer are more likely caused by increased water withdrawal rose 2009 rugel et al 2012 seager et al 2009 singh et al 2016 the analysis of the memory time scale confirms the association and disassociation of the groundwater variability with climate drivers the unconfined sas especially and the largely unconfined nas to a lesser extent share similar short memory with precipitation 3 months supplementary fig s3 by contrast the deeper fas and the cpas have a significantly longer memory than two other aquifer systems and the climatic drivers of recharge precipitation significantly longer memory in the deeper more confined aquifers show a stronger impact of human water withdrawals e g 84 of total groundwater variability is attributable to linear trends in the cpas a previous study from kumar et al 2019 indicated that deeper soil layers with a long memory might influence the memory in the shallower layers this study however lacks the data to be able to quantify a reemergence mechanism in groundwater potential memory reemergence of groundwater occurs in the fas aquifer between 12 and 18 months a possible explanation for the reemergence in the fas could be due to the residence time of recharge from seasons of higher precipitation the nas is not underlain by the cpas and varies hydrogeologically from the other three aquifers most of the wells analyzed are clustered in the southern and southwestern portions of georgia e g fig 1b this corresponds to the highly irrigated region irrigation totals in the coastal plains regions of georgia have increased by roughly 2000 since 1973 williams et al 2017 irrigation has caused the fas to lose storage change recharge and discharge patterns from aquifers and cause some streams to change from gaining to losing streams mitra et al 2016 2014 singh et al 2016 2017 overall irrigation has been shown to significantly reduce overall water storage in georgia mitra et al 2019 our analysis shows that all the wells except those in the coastal region show decreasing trends in annual average maximum and minimum when ltp is considered the two coastal wells that differ from these have an overall increasing tendency fig 3a these wells have been reported to be near former municipal pumping locations and the increase in water table may be due to ceases of pumping and or natural recharge gadnr 2006 the only metric that shows an overall increasing trend is the annual range of water table range measures the variation between maximum and minimum the maximum and minimum are both decreasing but the minimum is decreasing faster therefore the range between the water table high and low is increasing over time this leads to a statewide increase in the range of the water table indicating unreliable water availability i e more energy is needed to pump the water from the deeper wells kumar et al 2014 4 conclusions groundwater table elevation data from 43 groundwater usgs monitoring wells having long term data 37 years were analyzed for their trend to identify possible climatic and non climatic irrigation drivers results of time series analysis indicated that groundwater levels have been decreasing on average across georgia and each aquifer has responded differently to climate influences the sas and nas show neutral reactions across the state and correspond to changes in precipitation and enso while the fas and cpas show moderate to severe groundwater depletion mann kendall trend analysis shows that statistically significant water table declines mainly occur in georgia s southern and southwestern portion with the most active irrigation fig 1b the mann kendall trend analysis of precipitation and streamflow shows no significant trend especially when ltp is considered the fas and cpas show the most significant decline across most statistics tested previous studies have shown the fas is affected by increasing irrigation withdrawal mitra et al 2016 2019 mitra et al 2014 singh et al 2016 2017 leading us to conclude that the deeper cpas is strongly affected by irrigation limitation of this study include 1 a rather short analysis period 37 years especially when groundwater show ltp additionally this study did not investigate relationship with low frequency climate variability mode e g pacific decadal oscillation which influences hydroclimate in the region meehl et al 2015 newman et al 2016 2 a limited geographic extent this study was limited to georgia whereas the floridan aquifer system extends southward to florida which has experienced considerable increase in groundwater withdrawals also marella 2014 it is likely that some of the observed decline in georgia may be attributable to the water withdrawals in the florida a comprehensive study that covers the full geographic extent of the aquifer system is warranted 3 we did not incorporate water withdrawals data directly in this study which relied on available literature for irrigation expansion data e g williams et al 2017 incorporating water withdrawals data can further strengthen the attribution of declining groundwater trends in georgia overall this study provides an elaborate analysis of past groundwater table trends in various georgia aquifer systems by incorporating streamflow and precipitation trends this study also provides a better understanding of how climatic and anthropogenic forcing affect different aquifers at different depths and hydrogeologic conditions results of this study support groundwater withdrawal policy that is dependent on aquifer type e g unsustainable water withdrawals from the deep confined aquifers can be disincentivized this study provides a framework for additional research to address groundwater trends throughout the southeast usa and other regions addressing the factors that influence groundwater fluctuations is critical to understanding how freshwater supply could change in

of georgia usa we have corroborated the groundwater trend analysis with the surface water and climate trend analysis new hydrological insights the deep confined coastal plain and floridan aquifer systems show statistically significant declines in groundwater level by contrast the surficial aquifer system shows relatively neutral trends over the same period the water table in the shallower aquifers corresponds closely to the changes in the precipitation and streamflow trends a declining secular trend in the deeper confined aquifer is potentially attributable to the irrigation water

the global freshwater supply gurdak et al 2009 in the united states groundwater is responsible for up to 40 percent of the freshwater supply with as many as 40 million people consuming groundwater

groundwater aquifer mainly in semi arid to arid climates e g the central valley aquifer california miller et al 2009 the high plains aquifer ogallala aquifer that covers more than 450 000 km2 in eight

been thought immune to anthropogenic climate effects on surface and groundwater ingram et al 2013 nwf 2008 the southeast usa typically has high amounts of annual precipitation 1 9 to 1 4 m on average

2002 the water demands have risen due to urban growth and irrigation expansion georgakakos et al 2010 according to painter 2019 overall water use in georgia has declined almost 50 since 1980 due in large part to declining surface water withdrawals 90 of total reduction and decreasing thermoelectric power cooling use 78 of total reduction the period from 1980 to 2000 showed an overall increase in water use with up to 159 increase in irrigation water use from 1990 to 2000 painter 2019 water use for irrigation primarily through groundwater withdrawals in the southern portion of the state is the largest use of groundwater in recent years painter 2019 in georgia acres irrigated have increased roughly 2 000 from 42 408 acres to 936 245 acres from 1976 to 2013 williams et al 2017 high levels of irrigation have been shown to cause aquifer storage loss changes in groundwater flow i e gaining stream to losing stream decreases in stream baseflow and decreases in aquifer recharge mitra et al 2016 2019 although the hydrogeological characteristics of major aquifers in the southeast have been investigated e g miller 1986 hicks et al 1987 johnson and bush 1988 davis 1996 williams and dixon 2015 self trail et al 2019 the effects of climate variability and land use change on groundwater decline and its relationship with hydrogeological characteristics is an active research area the sub seasonal to inter annual groundwater variability is mostly explained by climate variability almanaseer and sankarasubramanian 2012 humphrey et al 2016 however long term declining trends are attributed to the anthropogenic water abstraction in several regions e g northwest india and the middle east humphrey et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 voss et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012 found that a higher pumping rate than the recharge rate has resulted in a continual decline in groundwater in the central and southern high plains shamsudduha et al 2009 have attributed a declining water table 0 5 m 1 m per year to urbanization and dry season rice cultivation in bangladesh hydroclimatic time series show long term persistence ltp the clustering of wet or dry periods for several years also known as the hurst phenomenon hurst 1956 iliopoulou et al 2018 koutsoyiannis 2003 this is especially the case with groundwater data that shows a higher persistence than the precipitation shown later bloomfield and marchant 2013 found a positive correlation between site dependent ltp and groundwater drought s length that can lead to a reduction in streamflow hughes et al 2012 however the effects of ltp on the statistical significance of groundwater trends are not investigated the ltp presents a significant source of uncertainty that leads to an underestimation of variance in the time series and therefore can lead to a false identification of significant trends koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 we employ a nonparametric trend detection technique that accounts for the long term persistence in the time series as documented in our earlier work kumar et al 2009 robust identification of significant trends is helpful to investigate their drivers outside the natural variability realm banerjee et al 2017 kumar et al 2013b singh et al 2020 overall we identify two knowledge gaps 1 effects of ltp on groundwater trend s significance 2 the relationship among groundwater trends hydrogeological characteristics and anthropogenic drivers for georgia s aquifer system we address the knowledge gaps using a large dataset and advanced statistical techniques a total of 404 usgs groundwater monitoring wells have been collected out of which 43 wells had long term daily data availability for the recent historical period 1981 2017 and were analyzed for the changes in the water table a dataset of this size allows us to assess the role of natural and anthropogenic forcing e g land use change and irrigation by testing the hypothesis that effects of climate change on groundwater trends depend on the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system the deviation from the climate variability can potentially be attributed to the anthropogenic causes e g irrigation expansion in the region we organize this research as follows section 2 describes the study area data and methods including discussion about the hydrogeological characteristics data processing and nonparametric trend detection technique we present results from the trend analysis in section 3 we also explore the relationship of groundwater variability with surface water and climate variability in section 3 finally we relate the hydrogeological characteristics with the persistence in the time series using seasonal autocorrelation analysis kumar et al 2019 we present the discussion and implications of our findings in section 4 the conclusion from this study is presented in section 5 2 study area data and methods 2 1 climate georgia located in the southeast usa has a warm temperate climate fully humid precipitation and hot summer temperature kottek et al 2006 long term annual mean precipitation has not changed significantly in the state fig 1a historically georgia and the southeast s average temperature showed no significant warming trend over the 20th century no warming trends are attributed to natural variability and industrial pollution that has declined in recent years banerjee et al 2017 kumar et al 2013b kunkel and angel 2013a yu et al 2014 2 2 aquifer description the fall line divides the hydrogeology of georgia with shallow unconfined aquifers in the north and generally confined aquifer in the south where most agriculture is located fig 1b williams and kuniansky 2016 williams et al 2017 piedmont and blue ridge provinces dominate the northern half the aquifers here are typically unconfined and mostly composed of regolith or crystalline rock aquifers which store water in fractures joints contacts weathered zones and other features clarke and pierce 1985 gordon and painter 2018 the valley and ridge province has thrusted and folded parallel ridges underlain by resistant sandstone conglomerate or cherty dolostone and valleys underlain by siltstone shale limestone or other weathering prone rocks rutledge and mesko 1996 the groundwater is typically unconfined in joints fractures and solution openings clarke and pierce 1985 in this paper piedmont and blue ridge aquifer systems are lumped into one group the northern aquifer system nas due to the similarities of the aquifers and the lack of dense observation network fig 1b the south of the fall line is comprised of three different aquifer systems the floridan aquifer system fas carbonate rocks the coastal plain aquifer system cpas clastic rocks and the surficial aquifer system sas fig 1b gordon and painter 2018 williams and dixon 2015 aquifers are typically confined except for the northern extent of the coastal plain and the surficial aquifer system clarke and pierce 1985 the floridan aquifer system is one of the most productive in the us and is mainly used as the primary source of freshwater fanning and trent 2009 miller 1986 the floridan aquifer system is separated into the upper and lower floridan aquifers the upper floridan aquifer is of eocene to oligocene aged limestone dolomite and calcareous sand usgs 2006 the lower floridan aquifer is defined as the unit under the middle floridan confining unit which is exposed at the surface in some portions of southeast georgia as part of the floridan aquifer system miller 1988 the upper floridan aquifer is confined in areas where it is overlain by siliciclastic sediments or a low permeability miocene aged limestone and is unconfined at surface outcrops at the northern extent of the aquifer and through karst features to the southwest and southcentral parts of georgia miller 1986 williams and dixon 2015 denizman 2018 the aquifer thickens to the southeast up to a maximum depth of around 500 m miller 1986 the coastal plain aquifer system is composed of a thick wedge of unconsolidated to poorly consolidated jurassic to holocene clastic rocks that dips to the southeast from the fall line to the atlantic ocean renken 1996 the floridan aquifer system overlies the coastal plain aquifer system and both are hydraulically interconnected laterally lower floridan carbonates to the south which grades into coastal plain clastics of the same age to the north and vertically in the upper floridan gradual gradations or interfingering between clastics and carbonates and underlain by crystalline bedrock renken 1996 fig 2 the surficial aquifer system forms a thin irregular blanket of the terrace and alluvial sands that overlies the floridan aquifer system williams and dixon 2015 the surficial aquifer system acts as temporary groundwater storage that may ultimately recharge the underlying floridan aquifer system williams and kuniansky 2016 thus we have divided groundwater well data into four major aquifer systems 1 floridan aquifer system fas 2 coastal plain aquifer system cpas 3 surficial aquifer system sas and 4 northern aquifer system nas the deep confined aquifers in caps have a median depth of 194 m below the ground level the fas accounts for the maximum number of wells 27 out of 43 and has a median depth of 106 m in contrast the surficial aquifer has a median depth of 8 m table 1 2 3 data georgia groundwater table data for 404 monitoring wells were collected from the united states geological survey usgs national water information system nwis daily water table measurements were obtained from the database for each well for the period from 1951 to present however most of the wells did not have continuous daily measurements over this entire time interval to include the most wells possible 43 wells were determined to have 90 or more data available over a time range from 1981 to 2017 supplementary table 1 all the wells used in this study are designated as monitoring wells i e they are not used for human consumption and instrumentally record daily water table measurements other information retrieved from the nwis database includes latitude and longitude for the station name of the regional and local aquifer the depth of the well typically determines their aquifer category however usgs aquifer classification was ultimately used as the determining factor for aquifer categorization such as in areas where the surficial aquifer was identified but the coastal plains aquifer is known to outcrop fig 2 and supplementary table 1 additionally we employed usgs surface water observation streamflow falcone et al 2010 and high resolution parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate data to corroborate the groundwater analysis long term streamflow observations at reference sites that have minimal human interference are not available in georgia singh et al 2020 hence we employed streamflow observations from non reference sites prism uses climate observations from a wide range of monitoring networks applies quality control measures and topography dependent spatial interpolation techniques to develop high resolution 4 km spatial climate datasets to reveal short term and long term climate patterns for the conterminous united states daly et al 1994 2008 we also used usgs s 2012 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis irrigated agriculture 1 kilometer dataset to determine the irrigation extent in georgia pervez and brown 2010 fig 1b 2 4 metrics four groundwater statistics annual average ann mean 1 day minimum ann min 1 day maximum ann max and annual range the difference between 1 day max and 1 day min were computed to capture the complete spectrum of groundwater change in georgia the annual range is a measure of reliability an increasing trend in the annual range suggests less reliable groundwater availability i e a higher groundwater table in the wet season or the deeper groundwater tables in the dry season or both kumar et al 2014 the groundwater statistics were computed for each station and each year using the daily data then the annual time series were employed for the trend calculation using the nonparametric method we used the mean standardized departure msd eq 1 to average the time series of different groundwater wells in the given regions and to compare the groundwater variation with the climate variations 1 z x μ σ where x is the value being standardized e g annual mean time series μ is the mean of the distribution and σ is the standard deviation of the time series we standardize the time series locally e g at each station then average it across the aquifer system or the state wide hence the standard deviation of averaged msd can become smaller than one if the spatial variability or noise is greater e g state average msd of precipitation 2 5 nonparametric trend detection we compute trends using the theil sen method sen 1968 theil 1992 eq 2 and its significance is determined using nonparametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 if x 1 x 2 x n is a time series x of given length n in years then magnitude of trend tsa is given as below 2 t s a m e d i a n x j x i j i f o r a l l i j the trend significance calculation accounts for long term persistence in the time series as described in our previous study kumar et al 2009 the nonparametric method has the following advantages 1 it contains no prior assumption about the linear trend 2 it is more accurate in detecting trend higher power in non normally distributed data e g streamflow önöz and bayazit 2003 yue et al 2002 and 3 it is robust against outliers we determine ltp using the hurst coefficient h hurst 1951 the concept of the hurst coefficient is based on the hypothesis that hydroclimatic time series xt exhibit scale invariant properties koutsoyiannis 2003 i e 3 z i k k μ k l h z j l l μ where represents equality in finite dimensional joint distribution μ is the expected value of x t z i k is the aggregated stochastic process at a scale k an integer greater than 1 defined as 4 z i k p i 1 k 1 i k x p and z j k is the aggregated stochastic process at scale k and h is the hurst coefficient for a stationary and positively correlated time series h varies in the range 0 5 1 h 0 5 indicates independence and increasing values of h represent increasing ltp intensities koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 we estimated the hurst coefficient from the detrended data as the maximum likelihood estimator of a fractional gaussian noise process eq 3 hamed 2008 non gaussian data can also follow the fractional gaussian noise process koutsoyiannis 2000 2003 a full description of the application of the statistical methods is given in kumar et al 2009 if h is statistically significant then the variance of the time series is inflated empirically for statistical significance calculation using the nonparametric mann kendall test hamed 2008 kendall 1975 mann 1945 this methodology successfully identifies multi decadal climate variability in the southeastern us kumar et al 2013a a comparison with the short term persistence stp model is shown in the supplementary materials the stp method calculates the statistical significance after trend free pre whitening of the time series i e removing the influence of the lag1 autocorrelation from the detrended time series kumar et al 2009 yue et al 2002 2 6 linear trend attribution following humphrey et al 2016 we divided total long term variability x l o n g into linear x l i n and inter annual components x i n t e r where x l o n g is the annual time series the x l o n g is same as the x time series discussed above because we use annual time series i e sub seasonal or seasonal variability are not investigated we computed the inter annual variability component from the detrended time series x i n t e r i x l o n g i t s a i and attributed the remainder to the linear trend as follows 5 x l o n g x l i n x i n t e r 6 r l i n 1 σ i n t e r 2 σ l o n g 2 r l i n is the fraction of total variability explained by the linear trend component where σ l o n g 2 is the variance of x l o n g and σ i n t e r 2 is the variance of x i n t e r 2 7 comparison with grace water storage anomaly we performed time series comparisons between groundwater anomaly data and nasa s total water storage anomalies data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite to understand spatial representativeness of our monitoring well results the grace data measures variations in earth s gravity field which correlates with the regional changes in groundwater storage on earth s surface landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 2 8 memory time scale of the aquifer system we characterized the groundwater aquifers by their memory time scale using seasonal autocorrelation analysis as described by kumar et al 2019 the autocorrelation function of a first order markov process also known as the red noise process is given below amenu et al 2005 chikamoto et al 2015 delworth and manabe 1988 schlosser and milly 2002 7 ρ τ e x p t τ where ρ is autocorrelation function at a given lag t and τ is the decorrelation or e folding time scale also known as the memory time scale i e the lag at which the autocorrelation function becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero 3 results 3 1 regional climate trends the southeast usa has become wetter fig 1b as expected from the wet gets wetter paradigm and under the climate change scenario held and soden 2006 kumar et al 2015 however there are regional variations e g georgia did not experience a statistically significant long term precipitation trend over the last 65 years fig 1b most irrigation expansion has occurred over the southern half of georgia where productive aquifer systems are found fanning and trent 2009 miller 1986 thus the geology and the underlying aquifer systems have played an essential role in determining the spatial extent of the irrigation expansion in georgia fig 1c d most groundwater extraction is contributed to irrigation for crops in georgia painter 2019 3 2 groundwater trends in georgia the groundwater trends are overwhelmingly negative for annual average 1 day minimum and 1 day maximum statistics as much as 30 13 out of 43 of monitoring wells show significantly declining annual average trends under ltp consideration fig 3 and table 1 the number of monitoring wells showing declining trends is 42 for the annual minimum 18 out of 43 and 37 for the annual maximum 16 out of 43 statistics most monitoring wells showing declining trends are in the cpas and fas table 1 considering only stp the number of monitoring wells showing significantly declining trends increases e g 49 of wells 21 out of 43 show the declining trends under stp considerations supplementary fig s1 the range between 1 day maximum and 1 day minimum groundwater levels are increasing in georgia fig 3b the annual range is increasing at 35 of stations 15 out of 43 and decreasing at 12 5 out of 43 of monitoring wells the increasing annual range suggests less reliable groundwater availability kumar et al 2014 which can be due to a more profound decline in the 1 day minimum than the decrease in the 1 day maximum level the declining groundwater trends do not correspond with the minimal or statistically insignificant trend in annual precipitation fig 3 almost the entirety of georgia does not show statistically significant precipitation trends for all four statistics computed from monthly prism precipitation data fig 3 3 3 surface water streamflow trends in georgia observed streamflow records show minimal or no trend which is generally consistent with the minimal trend in the precipitation fig 4 human activities impact most watersheds 30 out of 33 and therefore are categorized as non reference watersheds falcone et al 2010 supplementary table 2 the usgs streamflow observations were processed using the same methodology as the groundwater data for their long term continuous daily data availability from 1981 to 2017 only three non reference watersheds 9 of all watersheds show a statistically significant declining trend in the annual 1 day minimum flow under the ltp considerations the other flow metrics including annual average annual range and annual maximum flow do not show a significant trend the number of stations showing a statistically significant trend in annual one day minimum flow increases to 15 out of which 13 show declining trends when only stp is considered supplementary fig s2 the streamflow trends shown in fig 4 are consistent with the other long term studies for example e g dudley et al 2020 analyzed stormflow trends from 1966 to 2015 and found a declining trend in the 7 day minimum flow for urban dominated watersheds in the southeast singh et al 2020 investigated long term streamflow trends 1951 2015 in the southeast using observations and climate modeling experiments they found no significant streamflow trends at reference watersheds and attributed it to the vegetation growth under elevated co2 concentration that negatively impacts water availability in the region overall we found a declining trend in the groundwater fig 3 whereas the surface water streamflow show no trend fig 4 3 4 drivers of the declining ground water trends in georgia the groundwater trends as a function of hydrogeologic characteristics water withdrawals and recharge variability precipitation anomalies are investigated here fig 5 shows annual averages of standardized anomalies averaged across different wells of the four aquifer systems and the state average we have also shown precipitation anomalies from the locations nearest to each well three out of four aquifer systems show declining groundwater trends that are statistically significant pvalue 0 05 for fas cpas and nas under stp consideration these three aquifer systems show long term persistence ltp table 2 only cpas shows a statistically significant declining trend after considering the ltp the sas shows no trend similar to the precipitation trend the fas largely influences the statewide average groundwater trend fig 5e due to the maximum number of monitoring wells in the aquifer 27 of the 43 the fas is hydrologically interconnected with surface water bodies and may act either as an unconfined or a confined aquifer depending on location therefore some similarity in trends between the surficial aquifer and the fas is expected likewise the fas shows similarities with the deeper mostly confined cpas a strong declining trend in the cpas combined with a milder decline in fas makes the statewide trend statistically significant table 2 the confined cpas shows the most substantial decline of any aquifer system in the state to elaborate it further we performed a correlation analysis between the groundwater anomaly and precipitation anomaly groundwater anomaly and enso index and precipitation anomaly and enso index considering all 37 years of data table 3 overall the surficial or shallower aquifers showed the highest correlation with precipitation and enso while the deeper aquifers showed the least correlation with the enso and precipitation one year lag enso index show slightly improved correlation with groundwater variability in all but the nas for example the correlation coefficient improves from 0 40 for the concurrent enso and groundwater to 0 53 for lag 1 enso and groundwater in the fas two year lag enso and groundwater correlations are considerably smaller not shown the groundwater shows a higher correlation with the precipitation than it did with the enso table 3 previous studies have also found the relationship between enso and the surface water and shallow aquifer systems mitra et al 2014 singh et al 2015 2016 additionally this study finds that the cpas the deepest aquifer system has the least correlation that is not statistically significant indicating a greater role of the human withdrawals i e the linear trend however the correlation between precipitation and detrended time series of groundwater x i n t e r eq 5 becomes statistically significant for all aquifers including the cpas table 3 suggesting that climate variability as an important driver of inter annual groundwater water variability contribution of the linear trend r l i n varies considerably across the aquifer systems table 2 and fig 5 for the state average the linear trend accounts for 31 of the total long term variability the linear trend contributes to 84 of the total variability in the cpas droughts and human withdrawals are both factors which have been shown to contribute to groundwater decline hughes et al 2012 humphrey et al 2016 there are several drought periods in the the time series e g drought period 1980 82 1985 89 1998 2003 2006 07 and 2012 which may have exacerbated the declining groundwater trends in georgia painter 2019 however the area underlain by the fas and cpas has been shown to have a 2000 increase in irrigation acreage between 1976 and 2013 williams et al 2017 fig 1d and to be mainly supplied by groundwater withdrawals for agricultural and domestic use painter 2019 this suggests that direct human intervention has played a larger role r l i n 84 for declining groundwater trends in the cpas the irrigation has also expanded considerably in the fas but it shows a smaller contribution of the linear trend 16 hence we conclude that contribution of the linear trends is dependent upon the hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer system 3 5 spatial variability in trends and comparison with the remotely sensed total water storage anomalies grace data there is considerable spatial variability in groundwater trends table 2 and fig 3 e g 13 out of 43 monitoring wells state wide show significant decline in annual mean trends with ltp consideration and 2 wells show increasing trends even in the cpas only 4 monitoring wells out of 10 show statistically significant decline out of four statistics investigated here annual 1 day minimum ann min shows highest number of wells 18 wells with statistically significant decline to understand the spatial representativeness of the our monitoring well results e g fig 5 we compare the state average results with the grace data that provides total water storage anomaly at coarse spatial resolution 100 km landerer and swenson 2012 the grace data show a very similar trend to groundwater throughout the comparative periods 2002 2016 correlation coefficient 0 87 fig 6 a strong agreement between the monitoring well data and grace indicates that the analysis is consistent with an independent water balance metric 3 6 characteristics of groundwater aquifers in georgia the memory time scale τ was least for the surficial aquifers system and highest for the deep aquifer system we computed the seasonal autocorrelation function for groundwater anomalies averaged for each aquifer fig 7 the unconfined sas shows the least memory among various aquifer systems around six months for all seasons with a slight increase in memory in the summer season the nas looks relatively similar to the sas but with slightly longer memory in the summer and fall seasons the fas shows more extended memory than the previous two aquifers substantially with a memory of 12 18 months depending on seasons lastly the confined cpas shows the most extended memory with a memory of over 24 months across all months the nas and fas show autocorrelation that approaches zero and then reemerges back to statistical significance previously this has been shown to indicate that deeper soil layers with more memory have forced a long memory in the shallower layers kumar et al 2019 similarly seasonally varying processes have been shown to provide long term thermal memory in extratropical oceans alexander and deser 1995 alexander et al 1999 deser et al 2003 the potential reemergence of groundwater appears to occur in both the fas and nas between 12 and 18 months reemergence is the strongest from late summer through winter months jas through djf the fas has a strong correlation from the jas season with a 17 month lead through the ndj season with a 14 month lead this indicates that the correlation of the jas season groundwater table anomaly with the djf groundwater table anomaly 17 months later e g jas 2015 anomaly correlating with djf 2016 2017 anomaly a similar reemergence is seen in the nas from the mjj season through the ndj season 3 7 discussion the groundwater trend analysis finds a declining trend especially in the confined aquifer system e g cpas our analysis suggests two different processes are affecting how groundwater aquifer systems are connected to climate variations in georgia the surficial or unconfined sas and nas aquifers show groundwater variability consistent with climate variability furthermore the groundwater variations in the fas are also correlated with the precipitation and enso table 3 on the contrary the confined aquifer cpas has the least correlation with precipitation and enso table 3 and the most significant declining trend after removing the linear trend the correlation between groundwater and precipitation become statistically significant suggesting that climate as an important driver of inter annual variability but the linear trend may be attributed human water withdrawals an application of the ltp method helped us to identify secular trends in climate and water data the number of stations showing statistically significant trend decreased considerably e g from 21 stations with decreasing trend in ann mean groundwater under stp consideration to 13 under ltp consideration the surface water shows minimal or no trend under ltp consistent with the precipitation trend and a decrease in surface water withdrawals in georgia painter 2019 hence we posit that the ltp method identifies robust trends for its biophysical interpretation and attribution the el nino phase ve enso typically lead to statewide increases in the groundwater table while the la nina phase ve enso typically leads to a decrease in groundwater table with the only exception being from 2013 to 2017 groundwater table decreased consistently during the 2013 2017 period even with a strong el nino phase singh et al 2015 found a positive correlation between enso and groundwater variation in the upper floridan aquifer in southwest georgia our new analysis shows the relationship is valid statewide not only in the upper floridan aquifer but also in the surficial aquifer and the northern aquifer systems despite the significant impacts of enso linked climate variability on shallow aquifers water level declines and storage decreases in the deeper confined aquifer are more likely caused by increased water withdrawal rose 2009 rugel et al 2012 seager et al 2009 singh et al 2016 the analysis of the memory time scale confirms the association and disassociation of the groundwater variability with climate drivers the unconfined sas especially and the largely unconfined nas to a lesser extent share similar short memory with precipitation 3 months supplementary fig s3 by contrast the deeper fas and the cpas have a significantly longer memory than two other aquifer systems and the climatic drivers of recharge precipitation significantly longer memory in the deeper more confined aquifers show a stronger impact of human water withdrawals e g 84 of total groundwater variability is attributable to linear trends in the cpas a previous study from kumar et al 2019 indicated that deeper soil layers with a long memory might influence the memory in the shallower layers this study however lacks the data to be able to quantify a reemergence mechanism in groundwater potential memory reemergence of groundwater occurs in the fas aquifer between 12 and 18 months a possible explanation for the reemergence in the fas could be due to the residence time of recharge from seasons of higher precipitation the nas is not underlain by the cpas and varies hydrogeologically from the other three aquifers most of the wells analyzed are clustered in the southern and southwestern portions of georgia e g fig 1b this corresponds to the highly irrigated region irrigation totals in the coastal plains regions of georgia have increased by roughly 2000 since 1973 williams et al 2017 irrigation has caused the fas to lose storage change recharge and discharge patterns from aquifers and cause some streams to change from gaining to losing streams mitra et al 2016 2014 singh et al 2016 2017 overall irrigation has been shown to significantly reduce overall water storage in georgia mitra et al 2019 our analysis shows that all the wells except those in the coastal region show decreasing trends in annual average maximum and minimum when ltp is considered the two coastal wells that differ from these have an overall increasing tendency fig 3a these wells have been reported to be near former municipal pumping locations and the increase in water table may be due to ceases of pumping and or natural recharge gadnr 2006 the only metric that shows an overall increasing trend is the annual range of water table range measures the variation between maximum and minimum the maximum and minimum are both decreasing but the minimum is decreasing faster therefore the range between the water table high and low is increasing over time this leads to a statewide increase in the range of the water table indicating unreliable water availability i e more energy is needed to pump the water from the deeper wells kumar et al 2014 4 conclusions groundwater table elevation data from 43 groundwater usgs monitoring wells having long term data 37 years were analyzed for their trend to identify possible climatic and non climatic irrigation drivers results of time series analysis indicated that groundwater levels have been decreasing on average across georgia and each aquifer has responded differently to climate influences the sas and nas show neutral reactions across the state and correspond to changes in precipitation and enso while the fas and cpas show moderate to severe groundwater depletion mann kendall trend analysis shows that statistically significant water table declines mainly occur in georgia s southern and southwestern portion with the most active irrigation fig 1b the mann kendall trend analysis of precipitation and streamflow shows no significant trend especially when ltp is considered the fas and cpas show the most significant decline across most statistics tested previous studies have shown the fas is affected by increasing irrigation withdrawal mitra et al 2016 2019 mitra et al 2014 singh et al 2016 2017 leading us to conclude that the deeper cpas is strongly affected by irrigation limitation of this study include 1 a rather short analysis period 37 years especially when groundwater show ltp additionally this study did not investigate relationship with low frequency climate variability mode e g pacific decadal oscillation which influences hydroclimate in the region meehl et al 2015 newman et al 2016 2 a limited geographic extent this study was limited to georgia whereas the floridan aquifer system extends southward to florida which has experienced considerable increase in groundwater withdrawals also marella 2014 it is likely that some of the observed decline in georgia may be attributable to the water withdrawals in the florida a comprehensive study that covers the full geographic extent of the aquifer system is warranted 3 we did not incorporate water withdrawals data directly in this study which relied on available literature for irrigation expansion data e g williams et al 2017 incorporating water withdrawals data can further strengthen the attribution of declining groundwater trends in georgia overall this study provides an elaborate analysis of past groundwater table trends in various georgia aquifer systems by incorporating streamflow and precipitation trends this study also provides a better understanding of how climatic and anthropogenic forcing affect different aquifers at different depths and hydrogeologic conditions results of this study support groundwater withdrawal policy that is dependent on aquifer type e g unsustainable water withdrawals from the deep confined aquifers can be disincentivized this study provides a framework for additional research to address groundwater trends throughout the southeast usa and other regions addressing the factors that influence groundwater fluctuations is critical to understanding how freshwater supply could change in

8229,study region lake urmia iran study focus there is widespread interest in restoring drying saline lakes at iran s hypersaline lake urmia managers have sought a uniform target lake level of 1274 1 m above sea level to lower salinity below 263 g l 1 and recover artemia to sufficient densities to support flamingos we suggest that addressing a broader range of objectives will allow more flexibility for managing the lake we define eight restoration objectives to lower salinity sustain artemia and flamingo populations separate islands from each other and the mainland reduce lakebed dust maintain commercially valuable ions and improve recreational access from resort beaches we use 40 years of experimental field satellite and model data to relate each objective to lake level we describe variations through time and associated uncertainties for meeting each objective new hydrological insights we show that 1 lake variations prevent setting a precise target restoration level 2 the current target may not sufficiently lower salinity to recover artemia to sufficient densities to support flamingos 3 restoration objectives do not converge to a single lake level tradeoffs are murky 4 lake urmia managers should focus on multiple ecosystem services and track how they are met as lake level varies over time and 5 as information about the lake improves managers should adapt their management strategies to meet the most attainable objectives keywords water management lake level uncertainty multiple objectives tradeoffs saline lake 1 introduction saline lakes of climatic conditions and are desiccating worldwide wurtsbaugh et al 2017 this desiccation poses major scientific economic and political challenges to restore and manage lakes and their contributing watersheds

dead sea and in total for great salt lake usa great salt lake advisory council s l c 2019 at these and other locations restoration efforts may restore fisheries improve biodiversity reduce or mitigate dust reduce salinity conserve islands and lakeshore improve recreational access and conserve brine shrimp table a 1 in the appendix and references within actions to achieve these objectives such as inter basin transfers water conservation diking and dust mitigation can cost billions of dollars edwards and null 2019 great salt lake advisory council s l c 2019 white et al 2015 successful lake restoration must define objectives quantify metrics to indicate when objectives are reached and integrate across connected natural and human components from the contributing basin fig a 1 in the appendix integration often occurs with limited data that varies over time and uncertainties in the processes that cause variations malkawi and tsur 2016 welsh et al 2013 for example uncertainties in a lake s bathymetry relationships salinity invertebrate tolerances to salinity and what birds eat may make it difficult to quantify the provision of some future ecosystem services large lake restoration can take many forms including partial to complete restoration of historical conditions or chart a new future path many people want to return large lakes to their pre desiccation condition without any structural intervention while others argue that full restoration to pre impact conditions is not feasible instead they seek a partial rehabilitation goal roberts et al 2000 some people also suggest to partition or dike a lake to support different ecosystem services at various sections of the lake would be more feasible and require less water examples of diking include the bear river wetlands in the state of utah in the u s alminagorta et al 2016 emerson 2014 and the aral sea between kazakhstan and uzbekistan micklin 2016 diking has also been criticized that interventions will have unpredicted environmental consequences that in the long run are larger than the short term benefits another issue that should be considered in setting restoration objectives for a large lake is spatiality large lakes vary spatially and it may not be possible to set a uniform biotic and abiotic condition for the entire lake for example meeting a lake averaged water quality metric may not guarantee that dependent biota would be recovered consequently it may be necessary to define objectives for different parts of the lake based on physical and limnological characteristics thus manage different lake services at different locations e g estuaries versus deeper parts of the lake here we discuss the lake urmia restoration program its background data assumptions and shortcomings we provide insights to improve lake management through considering a diverse range of ecosystem services while considering limitations and uncertainties we synthesized 40 years of available experimental field satellite and model data for lake urmia see the appendix a we used the data to define eight restoration objectives to lower salinity sustain artemia and greater flamingo populations keep islands separated from each other and the mainland reduce lakebed dust maintain valuable ionic compositions and improve recreational access from resort beaches we related each metric to lake level quantified tradeoffs and described measurement errors variations through time and uncertainties in the provision of ecosystem services finally we identified gaps in data knowledge and policies that should be filled to proceed with lake restoration our approach is applicable to other saline lakes 2 lake urmia restoration following two decades of intense agricultural development reservoir construction and reduced stream flows the water level of lake urmia in northwest iran declined from a historical maximum of 1278 m by 6 5 m 1271 5 m in july 2020 during this time the lake lost almost 45 by area and 85 by volume fig 1 a the decline caused salinities to increase to saturation more than 300 g l and caused a catastrophic decline in brine shrimp artemia spp and the birds that depend on them schulz et al 2020 the declining lake level increased airborne dust from the exposed lakebed and allowed mainland predators to reach kabudan and ashk islands where endangered mammals including armenian sheep ovis orientalis gmilini and persian fallow deer dama dama mesopotamica live fig 1a islands 2 and 3 asem et al 2014 the lake decline caused losses of more than 1 6 million us 2019 to eco tourism recreation boating sunbathing therapeutic baths cultural heritage and educational activities bagherzadeh 2012 unep 2012 in response the iranian government approved the urmia lake restoration program ulrp in 2013 with an estimated cost of 7 billion us ulrp 2018 the iranian government set a uniform target restoration lake level of 1274 1 m and called this level the ecological level water volume of 14 5 km3 the ecological level was intended to reduce the salinity to 263 g l 1 240 g l 1 nacl that was believed would allow brine shrimp artemia spp to thrive abbaspour and nazaridoust 2007 artemia are an important food source for millions of birds that once inhabited lake urmia including 40 000 80 000 pairs of breeding greater flamingos phoenicopterus roseus hereafter flamingo ramsar 2011 since 2013 the urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc is attempting to reach the ecological level in three phases over 10 years through an inter basin water transfer and reducing agricultural water consumption by 40 fig 1b a health level of 1271 75 m to suppress dust has been discussed but not formally implemented the ulrp is using the full restoration approach and has set a single restoration target for the entire lake here we suggest that by considering multiple objectives managers may be able to successfully recover more ecosystem services with the limited supply of additional water that can be made available many prior researchers have suggested how to raise lake urmia s level to the ecological target of 1274 1 m bakhshianlamouki et al 2020 farokhnia et al 2018 hamidi razi et al 2019 hassani et al 2020 pouladi et al 2019 shadkam et al 2016 torabi haghighi and kløve 2017 each study assumed that the ecological level would attain a salinity that would recover bird populations however thorough studies have not yet been done to evaluate what lake levels are needed to recover artemia and bird populations and procure other ecosystem services like dust mitigation island conservation and recreation there are also needs to describe how lake level variations over time and uncertainties in natural and human processes effect provision of ecosystem services managers want to know what they can do now to procure more restoration objectives despite variations and uncertainties these issues are faced by saline lake managers world wide e g micklin 2016 national research council 1987 swca 2013 3 materials and methods we used experimental field satellite and model data available from peer reviewed governmental and non governmental sources to identify eight restoration metrics and objectives that quantify aspects of water quality ecology human health economy and recreation table 1 we related each metric to different lake levels sima 2021 lake level data was available since 1970 and measured daily by the west azerbaijan water bureau at a precision of 10 cm at a single point in the lake table 1 note that lake level fluctuates annually by 0 5 1 2 m below we describe each restoration metric why the service is important how we measured the service uncertainties in provision of the service and how we synthesized across services and metrics see appendix a for further description 1 salinity regulates the growth and survival of invertebrates that are food for migratory birds salinity was measured as monthly total dissolved solids g l 1 tds from the top 0 5 m of the lake data are available from 1977 to 2018 see section 1 in the appendix future tds concentrations will be affected not only by the lake level but by the rates that salts dissolve into and precipitate in the lake 2 artemia are believed to provide an important food source for birds eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 and have high potential economic value in the aquaculture industry sorgeloos et al 2001 seasonal adult artemia urmiana densities number m 3 were developed from horizontal tows of zooplankton nets and pumping at specific depths conducted over a range of lake salinities section 2 in the appendix artemia tolerances of lake salinity ion concentrations and nutrient loads will affect future artemia density measurements 3 flamingos are a prominent bird species that feed extensively on artemia and use the lake islands to breed asem et al 2014 although 212 bird species use lake urmia doe 2010 and the lake supports internationally important numbers of wintering water birds data were only available for annual winter counts of nesting and migratory flamingos in both lake urmia and its bordering gharahgheshlagh wetland section 3 in the appendix bird nesting and migratory behavior by season and bird movement will affect future flamingo counts 4 islands connect to each other when the lake level drops islands provide critical habitat for two threatened mammal species persian fallow deer and armenian wild sheep eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 when the lake level drops islands connect together and wild sheep may compete with deer for available freshwater and food resources drought exacerbates this competition ulrp 2017 we used gis analysis a lake bathymetric map karimi et al 2016 visual inspection of modis satellite images and land use maps of lake area extracted from landsat satellite images in different studies to estimate the range of lake levels where islands connect to each other m above msl errors in these identified lake levels derive from the 0 27 m error in bathymetric water depth measurements karimi et al 2016 methodological errors in measurement and applied land use classification methods section 4 in the appendix 5 islands connect to lake shore when the lake level drops further lake desiccation opens land bridges between the four islands and the lakeshore mainland predators access the islands and threaten the persian fallow deer and armenian wild sheep we used the same gis bathymetric map modis and landsat images to estimate lake elevations where islands connect to the shore m above msl errors in the estimated lake levels are the same as for islands connecting to each other section 5 in the appendix 6 lakebed dust poses a respiratory health risk to the 5 million people who live near the lake 2016 census like many dried lakes worldwide lake urmia generates wind blown dust from the dried lakebed gholampour et al 2015 saline lake dust can also degrade agricultural land a metric of exposed dust area km2 was estimated by intersecting satellite derived and downscaled dust polygons with lake bathymetry data for three periods between 2010 and 2016 section 6 in the appendix movement and change of dust across the landscape precision in the satellite sensors that detect dust areas and the errors in the bathymetry water depth measurements karimi et al 2016 will affect future dust area estimates 7 magnesium mg2 is a high value dissolved ion that can be mined from lake brine and used in agriculture chemical automotive and aircraft industries similar to salinity key cation and anion compositions meq l 1 were measured from the top 0 5 m of the lake since 1977 section 7 in the appendix potassium k is also a high value ion but potassium concentration data were very noisy consequently we could not develop a meaningful relationship for k with lake level lake ionic composition and the order that salts precipitate will affect future magnesium concentrations 8 ecotourism is popular at several lake resorts and beaches unesco 2015 recreation includes bathing swimming and boating in pedal and motor boats during spring and summer at low lake levels tractors must pull boats long distances from the resorts across the dried lakebed to access water here we used lake bathymetric data to quantify the distance km between two tourist beaches on the west shore golmankhaneh and bari see fig 1a and the nearest water that is at least 1 m deep section 8 in the appendix estimates of future distances will be affected by changes in lake bathymetry e g from salt precipitation and the criteria used for water that is sufficiently deep for boating we also considered an important socioeconomic management objective to increase agricultural revenue agriculture is a large consumer of water in the lake urmia basin that provides livelihoods for many people diverting water for agriculture negatively effects most other lake services because diversions reduce water that flows to the lake fig a1 in the appendix we used annual agricultural water management and farm economic data from 1995 to 2015 for five dominant basin crops of wheat barley corn sugar beet and alfalfa table 2 and section 9 in the appendix sima 2021 to calculate a unit water value us m 3 and irrigation water use m3 for each crop and year then we multiplied the unit water value and irrigation water use values for each crop to obtain agricultural revenues us crop prices the exchange rate cropping patterns crop types reservoir operations and weather will affect future agricultural revenues appendix a further describes each lake restoration objective and the agricultural revenue objective 4 results 4 1 the ecological level may be insufficient to reach the salinity target and recover artemia and flamingos salinity concentrations artemia densities and flamingo counts show that the ecological level of 1274 m may be insufficient to maintain salinities below 263 g l and support artemia figs 2 3 in turn the ecological level is unlikely to support flamingos figs 4 and a2 in the appendix 4 1 1 lake level and total dissolved solids measured tds from 1977 to 2016 shows large variations at different lake levels fig 2 and 3a the observed median salinity was 263 g l 1 at lake levels near the ecological target but the 75th percentile estimate was still well above the 263 g l 1 salinity target asem et al 2007 hafezieh 2016a the time series of tds show an expected quasi inverse relationship where salinity increased as lake level declined fig 3a we developed a sigmoid relationship r2 0 96 rmse 16 g l 1 between tds and lake level fig 2 we used the relationship to estimate salinities and provide context for lake level on later plots 4 1 2 brine shrimp survival at different salinities artemia densities in lake urmia declined significantly p 0 001 from approximately 600 to 200 adults m 3 as salinities increased from 160 g l 1 in 1994 95 to over 350 g l 1 in 2007 fig 3b artemia densities for lake urmia have not been measured for salinities between 170 235 g l 1 limiting our interpretation for the threshold for high population densities great salt lake offers insights where densities of a related species a franciscana decrease with increasing salinity although the trend was not statistically significant p 0 097 belovsky et al 2011 at salinities ranging from 90 to 200 g l 1 artemia densities were much higher in great salt lake mean 1500 m 3 than in lake urmia mean 400 m 3 fig 3b we note however that the bioassay experiments of larti et al 2012 indicate that a urmiana is more resistant to high salinities than is the great salt lake species a franciscana although artemia in lake urmia can survive at near saturated salt levels their densities are very low and unlikely to support flamingos or other birds an important unanswered question is what densities of artemia and other invertebrates are necessary to sustain birds at lake urmia in great salt lake usa artemia densities of 100 m 3 caused eared grebes podiceps nigricollis to forage longer caudell 2006 if the target tds of 263 g l 1 for lake urmia can be reached the limited available data suggests that artemia densities might be around 200 m 3 that low density might support diving birds like eared grebes bioassay experiments on artemia survival have yielded lc50 i e 50 survival salinity concentrations ranging from 110 to 255 g l 1 depending on the methodologies used fig a2 agh et al 2008 larti et al 2012 mohammadi et al 2009 however survival is just one aspect of the effects of salinity on the life history of artemia for example agh et al 2008 showed that physiological stress caused offspring production of artemia to fall 69 as salinities increased from 75 to 175 g l 1 the field and laboratory results demonstrate that the target ecological salinity of 263 g l 1 places considerable strain on artemia and higher salinities are even more stressful barnes and wurtsbaugh 2015 these laboratory assays however do not account for the possibility of rapid evolutionary responses or selection for existing strains with higher salinity tolerances as was described by günther 1899 4 1 3 flamingo population the number of flamingos at lake urmia has declined dramatically with decreasing lake levels fig 4 at water levels below 1272 5 m and salinity near 360 g l 1 few flamingos were observed in the lake or the neighboring gharahgheshlagh bird refuge at the southern end of the lake at the ecological lake level of 1274 m and salinities near 280 g l 1 the observed flamingo population was less than half its number at higher water levels in the better studied camargue saline wetlands of france artemia abundance remained high up to a salinity of 215 g l 1 but abundances of most other invertebrates declined markedly at salinities 140 g l 1 the threshold found for american flamingos phoenicopterus ruber britton and johnson 1987 this decline suggests that flamingos forage on a range of invertebrates and many of these invertebrates disappear at salinities well below the salinity target of 263 g l 1 consequently managers must characterize the habitat and growth needs of invertebrates flamingos and particularly other birds in lake urmia and nearby wetlands together the salinity artemia and flamingo results show that a lake level of 1274 m may not attain a salinity previously thought to support high populations of artemia additionally the 263 g l 1 salinity target may not allow most other invertebrates to grow to sufficient densities to support flamingos and other birds consequently a higher lake level may be needed to decrease salinity and sustain artemia and flamingos 4 2 relationships between lake level and other restoration metrics 4 2 1 islands connect to each other and shore the existing bathymetric map indicates that the four largest southern islands in lake urmia merge together at water levels between 1271 3 and 1271 7 m fig 5 however satellite imagery indicates that the current bathymetric map overestimates the corresponding lake level where islands merge even though the map accurately shows the lake shape the overestimation is due to few bathymetric depth measurements near the islands karimi et al 2016 lake levels between 1270 6 and 1271 7 m would result in a land bridge forming from kabudan island see fig 1a to the southeast shore of the lake fig 5 part b 4 2 2 lakebed dust the lake s flat topography means the greatest increase in exposed lakebed dust area occurs as water levels decline from 1272 to 1270 m figs 6 a and a 2 in the appendix maintaining the lake level above 1272 m is important to minimize dust and public health risk as the lake further desiccates the inner parts are exposed fig 6b these inner parts are closer to ecologically sensitive areas such as islands so dust mitigation approaches such as gravel blankets mulching or planting may not be permitted moreover as the lake further desiccates the distance between the exposed dust prone areas and rivers that feed the lake increases this increase will complicate water delivery to reduce dust at lake levels greater than 1272 m most dust prone areas are inundated 4 2 3 valuable ions since mid 2007 as the lake has desiccated different precipitation rates have caused the concentrations of na and cl ions to decrease while concentrations of mg 2 and so4 2 ions have increased in the water column of lake urmia fig a 3 in the appendix in 2019 there were roughly equal concentrations of na and mg 2 since september 2011 lake water changed from a na mg cl so4 to an mg na cl so4 solute sharifi et al 2018 as economically important potassium and magnesium salts concentrate in the brine there could be a future opportunity to extract magnesium chloride magnesium oxide and potash kcl kso4 and others such as is now done at the dead sea and great salt lake swca 2013 recent studies revealed that it is technically feasible and highly beneficial to extract mg2 and k minerals at several locations along the lake shore gsi 2017 novopro 2019 at high lake levels precipitated halite nacl dissolves warren 2006 decreases mgcl2 and mgso4 concentrations and makes magnesium mining less desirable see section 6 in the appendix nonetheless salt mining is not currently allowed because lake urmia is a national park 4 2 4 recreation as lake level drops distance increases from the bari and golmankhaneh resorts to locations with sufficient water depth for boating 1 m fig 7 at water levels higher than 1271 m the distance from the shore to boatable water is less than 300 m and the error in these distance estimates is also small as lake level declines to 1269 m and the shoreline recedes distance increases to more than 1 km bari and about 3 km golmankhaneh with rising estimation errors due to the shallow lakebed slope fig a 2 in the appendix from september 2011 2018 when lake level was low both resorts closed and beaches are no longer used for boating sunbathing and mud baths in spring 2019 and 2020 some boating and recreation activities returned when the lake level rose above 1271 5 m at 1271 5 m we estimate the distance to deep water is less than 300 m at both resorts fig 7 4 3 restoration objectives do not converge to a single lake level 4 3 1 tradeoffs among restoration objectives we synthesize tradeoffs among restoration objectives by comparing undesirable lake levels dark blue and desirable lake levels white for each metric fig 8 a restoration objectives with more certainty in the desirable lake level such as when islands merge together near 1271 5 m have more abrupt color changes these abrupt changes also appear in the box and whiskers and scatter plots in figs 2 3b 4 5 and 7 all restoration objectives improve with increasing water level except for magnesium concentration at high lake levels most ecosystem services of lake urmia are lost or significantly decline at lake levels below 1270 m between 1272 m and 1274 5 m which spans the ecological target water will inundate many dust prone areas keep islands separated and provide lake access for recreation however these levels do not adequately lower salinity maintain artemia or support flamingos the ecological restoration level of 1274 m could provide salinities between 237 and 285 g l 1 asem et al 2007 hafezieh 2016a 2016b and artemia densities of 200 400 per m 3 figs 2 and 3b which may be insufficient to support populations of flamingos and other water birds in contrast high lake levels like the pre desiccation lake levels above 1275 m can minimize airborne dust sustain artemia and bird populations preserve island habitats maintain recreation and further permit recovery of other ecological components of the urmia food web and biological diversity e g ephydra urmiana and mollusks in other words seven out of the eight objectives fig 8a can be fulfilled by lake levels between 1275 and 1278 m apart from inter annual variations of lake level whether natural or anthropogenic lake services can vary seasonally our analysis of lake level data since 1995 showed that lake urmia level has a seasonal variation from 0 5 to 1 2 m for example in 2010 a 0 7 m seasonal variation was observed around the mean annual lake level of 1271 3 m this intra annual variation would decrease increase dust prone areas by 30 and affects islands merging and land bridge formation 4 4 agriculture and lake level trade offs plotting annual agricultural revenues vs lake levels shows two trade offs fig 8b observations from 1995 to 2012 defined a downward sloping win lose trade off between lake level and agricultural revenues light green squares the lake and agriculture competed for water observations from 2012 onward instead suggested an outward pushing win win trade off fig 8b dark green circles here agricultural revenues increased with the same lake level and similar reservoir releases to agriculture this counterintuitive result for this recent period occurred because crop yields water productivity unit values of water and agricultural revenues all increased while irrigated area and agricultural water deliveries remained similar fig 9 dark green circles orange box highlights increasing crop yields a sharp rise in crop prices started in 2012 in response to iran s currency devaluation fig a 4 in the appendix the iranian government raised crop prices to make internal markets competitive and promote food security in other words agricultural revenue before 2012 was strongly tied to the expansion of agricultural area and irrigation water releases from reservoirs fig 9 the bottom row plots while after 2012 banning agricultural area expansion improving environmental flow releases for lake urmia increasing crop yields and crop pricing increased agricultural revenue and stabilized lake level around 1271 m fig 8b however further increasing lake level to meet more lake services will require more lake inflow barhagh et al 2021 interpretation of both trade offs in fig 8b is complicated by variable lake levels within year lake level variations are 0 5 1 2 m green error bars the variations mean that the ecological level of 1274 m may procure a wide range of basin agricultural revenues e g us 60 150 million year likewise other lake levels such as 1272 m may procure a similar wide range of agricultural revenues these results highlight crop pricing and crop yield improvements as important tools to encourage local people to improve their crop patterns land and irrigation management practices if adopted at a wide scale these practices can change tradeoffs between agricultural revenue lake level and provision of lake ecosystem services 5 discussion we related eight lake urmia restoration metrics to lake level to show how different lake levels influence restoration however measurement errors in all the metrics make it difficult to precisely show how these metrics will respond to management decisions we also faced challenges from uncertain knowledge about salt precipitation and dissolution uncertainty about artemia and other invertebrate densities needed to support birds national currency devaluation crop pricing and other factors for example up to 1 m of salts may have precipitated on urmia s lakebed between 2013 and 2015 karimi et al 2016 changing the bathymetry making lake urmia shallower increasing evaporative losses and affecting relationships between lake elevation and each of our eight restoration metrics however this precipitation and many other limnological metrics have yet to be carefully quantified in the lake these variations and uncertainties prevent setting a precise target restoration level such as the ecological target of 1274 1 m in the face of these variations and uncertainties a uniform lake target such as 1274 m cannot also simultaneously achieve multiple desired ecosystem services such as reducing the salinity to 263 g l 1 increasing artemia densities and increasing flamingo abundance in fact no single lake level can simultaneously satisfy all management objectives instead of a uniform target restoration level we recommend that managers 1 evaluate many ecosystem services such as those identified in this study and identify the lake levels that support impair them 2 quantify tradeoffs among ecosystem services 3 track ecosystem service provision as lake levels vary over time 4 raise lake levels to a critical level such as near 1272 m that will reduce public health risk and 5 set annual crop prices to encourage agricultural water use efficiency and to increase agricultural revenues our suggestions change the current lake urmia restoration narrative from i managers should restore lake urmia to a precise uniform ecological lake level alborzi et al 2018 unep 2012 to ii managers should include additional restoration objectives that can be accomplished with different lake levels by focusing on these additional objectives managers can still adapt their restoration strategies over time as they learn more about salinity salt precipitation salt dissolution illegal water withdrawals agricultural return flows climate induced runoff flooding evapotranspiration the lake s food web and other processes that effect procurement of ecosystem services loucks and van beek 2003 these suggestions allow managers to move forward now without having to wait to better understand lake variations or resolve uncertainties moving forward now is critical for large lake restoration efforts that may require decades to reach restoration goals these suggestions can also help managers consider more of the benefits and drawbacks of lake restoration actions for example current lake restoration efforts include dredging and channelizing streams and wetlands to improve water delivery to the lake to help reach the 1274 m target ulrp 2018 however this practice impairs the ecological function of rivers dries up wetlands and shrinks lake deltas that birds depend on galatowitsch 2012 mitsch and gosselink 2015 another example is the proposed breach in the automobile causeway to reduce evaporative losses although this may provide a slight increase in lake level it will increase mixing of salts between the north and south basin and reduce the probability that artemia recover to desired densities abatzopoulos et al 2006 our suggestions to evaluate more restoration objectives and the lake levels that support them quantify tradeoffs and track ecosystem service provision can help the ulrnc achieve its three period restoration plan fig 1b the ulrp is now in the second restoration phase to increase lake level from the current 1271 8 m to 1273 m by 2021 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 our results show that lake levels up to 1273 m will reduce dust protect threatened and endangered sheep and deer on islands and promote recreation our analyses show that phase three efforts to raise the lake level another 1 m to reach the ecological level of 1274 m by 2023 may not sufficiently reduce salinity to recover high densities of artemia flamingos and other birds a higher lake level is likely needed however there is currently limited monitoring of the lake ecosystem a monthly monitoring program at 10 15 lake stations could help measure artemia abundances and many other limnological parameters in the absence of a good monitoring program it will be impossible to understand how water management is influencing the lake ecosystem the ulrnc should also re examine major restoration projects such as inter basin water transfers safari et al 2014 ulrp 2018 upstream reservoir water release policies torabi haghighi et al 2018 yasi and ashori 2017 land management alizade govarchin ghale et al 2019 diking and environmental flows for their ability to regulate lake level over time the ulrnc should re examine to see which projects can flexibly deliver different volumes of water seasonally and year to year and contribute to different lake levels and ecosystem services during our outreach work between march and july 2019 the ulrnc technical team iranian department of environment and iranian ministry of energy each voiced support for our suggestions from this outreach we understand that considering more restoration objectives can help these organizations negotiate more environmentally friendly water allocations and improve livelihoods there are several limitations of our approach first we tied each restoration metric to a single system variable lake level in other environmental systems a unifying variable such as lake level may not exist at the same time an integrating system variable like lake level allows hydrology climate agricultural governance and other researchers to quantify the ecosystem impacts of the lake stressors they study second our analysis does not consider dependencies between restoration objectives for example increasing mg2 and k concentrations may improve mineral extraction opportunities but the new ionic composition may be toxic for artemia bowen et al 1985 third we do not provide lower or upper bounds for the suitable lake levels because there is considerable uncertainty in the processes that affect restoration objectives fig 8b also the bounds will change over time as managers learn more about the lake system fourth we did not weight prioritize or monetize the ecosystem services although it could be very beneficial weighting or prioritizing the objectives will require managers and local stakeholders to express their preferences and will be difficult when different stakeholders champion different objectives monetizing may make it easier to justify expenditures for lake restoration and compare the value obtained per unit of water required to procure each ecosystem service however several ecosystem services like salinity birds and islands connecting to each other and the shore may be difficult to monetize fifth we assume the lake system is reversible reversibility means that historical observations at medium and high water levels for salinity artemia flamingos and other restoration metrics will again hold when the lake returns to those levels in reality there may be time lags hysteresis or alternative stable states that produce different ecosystem services than what was historically observed at the same water level for example seed organisms are likely available to recolonize the lake from the fresher estuaries but this is an untested assumption a sixth limitation is common to many multi objective analyses complexity increases by adding more restoration objectives problem dimensions we sidestep this challenge by relating eight ecosystem service metrics to a single variable lake level seventh we used lake averaged salinity and ionic composition and due to lack of data did not consider spatial variation of salinity and ions through the lake however a recent study showed that there is a significant salinity difference between the lake urmia s northern and southern parts during high flows bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 and eighth we did not include climate or wetland objectives large lakes moderate local climate e g zhu et al 2018 but the relationship is not yet quantified for lake urmia climate change has influenced and will continue to influence the lake urmia watershed schulz et al 2020 although flamingos and other birds used the wetlands to feed breed and rest there were insufficient data to define a wetland objective 6 conclusions we used 40 years of available experimental field satellite and model data to quantify eight ecosystem services for iran s lake urmia at different lake levels in the areas of water quality ecology human health economy and recreation we also quantified an objective to increase basin wide agricultural revenues we found numerous variations and uncertainties in lake data and processes that contribute to restoration objectives variability and uncertainties in the data and a poor understanding of many of the watershed and lake processes currently limit an effective restoration program for lake urmia these limitations 1 prevent setting a precise target restoration level 2 question whether the ecological target of 1274 m will reduce salinity enough to recover artemia and flamingo populations to pre desiccation densities 3 highlight that restoration objectives do not converge to single lake level 4 show tradeoffs among objectives are murky 5 suggest that managers should focus on multiple ecosystem services and document how they are met as lake levels vary over time researchers and managers can apply our findings in multiple ways they should consider scenarios of different lake levels in their new analyses modelling studies and other work rather than use a uniform ecological level of 1274 m new research is urgently needed to describe and quantify i salt precipitation dissolution and its effects on bathymetry ii lake evaporation iii lake wetland connections iv bird distribution v the lake food web of birds and their dependence on lake level salinity and ionic compositions vi illegal water use vii agricultural return flows viii reservoir management ix effects of past mismanagement of basin land and water resources xi climate change impact and drought intensification on the lake food web xii spatial and vertical distribution of salinity and minerals and xiii farm decision making in response to crop pricing and water allocation strategies a more comprehensive approach will allow managers of lake urmia and other saline lakes to adapt their water allocation agricultural development and restoration strategies over time as they learn more about their lake systems this work is a product of an ongoing

8229,study region lake urmia iran study focus there is widespread interest in restoring drying saline lakes at iran s hypersaline lake urmia managers have sought a uniform target lake level of 1274 1 m above sea level to lower salinity below 263 g l 1 and recover artemia to sufficient densities to support flamingos we suggest that addressing a broader range of objectives will allow more flexibility for managing the lake we define eight restoration objectives to lower salinity sustain artemia and flamingo populations separate islands from each other and the mainland reduce lakebed dust maintain commercially valuable ions and improve recreational access from resort beaches we use 40 years of experimental field satellite and model data to relate each objective to lake level we describe variations through time and associated uncertainties for meeting each objective new hydrological insights we show that 1 lake variations prevent setting a precise target restoration level 2 the current target may not sufficiently lower salinity to recover artemia to sufficient densities to support flamingos 3 restoration objectives do not converge to a single lake level tradeoffs are murky 4 lake urmia managers should focus on multiple ecosystem services and track how they are met as lake level varies over time and 5 as information about the lake improves managers should adapt their management strategies to meet the most attainable objectives keywords water management lake level uncertainty multiple objectives tradeoffs saline lake 1 introduction saline lakes of climatic conditions and are desiccating worldwide wurtsbaugh et al 2017 this desiccation poses major scientific economic and political challenges to restore and manage lakes and their contributing watersheds

inter basin transfers water conservation diking and dust mitigation can cost billions of dollars edwards and null 2019 great salt lake advisory council s l c 2019 white et al 2015 successful lake restoration must define objectives quantify metrics to indicate when objectives are reached and integrate across connected natural and human components from the contributing basin fig a 1 in the appendix integration often occurs with limited data that varies over time and uncertainties in the processes that cause variations malkawi and tsur 2016 welsh et al 2013 for example uncertainties in a lake s bathymetry relationships salinity invertebrate tolerances to salinity and what birds eat may make it difficult to quantify the provision of some future ecosystem services large lake restoration can take many forms including partial to complete restoration of historical conditions or chart a new future path many people want to return large lakes to their pre desiccation condition without any structural intervention while others argue that full restoration to pre impact conditions is not feasible instead they seek a partial rehabilitation goal roberts et al 2000 some people also suggest to partition or dike a lake to support different ecosystem services at various sections of the lake would be more feasible and require less water examples of diking include the bear river wetlands in the state of utah in the u s alminagorta et al 2016 emerson 2014 and the aral sea between kazakhstan and uzbekistan micklin 2016 diking has also been criticized that interventions will have unpredicted environmental consequences that in the long run are larger than the short term benefits another issue that should be considered in setting restoration objectives for a large lake is spatiality large lakes vary spatially and it may not be possible to set a uniform biotic and abiotic condition for the entire lake for example meeting a lake averaged water quality metric may not guarantee that dependent biota would be recovered consequently it may be necessary to define objectives for different parts of the lake based on physical and limnological characteristics thus manage different lake services at different locations e g estuaries versus deeper parts of the lake here we discuss the lake urmia restoration program its background data assumptions and shortcomings we provide insights to improve lake management through considering a diverse range of ecosystem services while considering limitations and uncertainties we synthesized 40 years of available experimental field satellite and model data for lake urmia see the appendix a we used the data to define eight restoration objectives to lower salinity sustain artemia and greater flamingo populations keep islands separated from each other and the mainland reduce lakebed dust maintain valuable ionic compositions and improve recreational access from resort beaches we related each metric to lake level quantified tradeoffs and described measurement errors variations through time and uncertainties in the provision of ecosystem services finally we identified gaps in data knowledge and policies that should be filled to proceed with lake restoration our approach is applicable to other saline lakes 2 lake urmia restoration following two decades of intense agricultural development reservoir construction and reduced stream flows the water level of lake urmia in northwest iran declined from a historical maximum of 1278 m by 6 5 m 1271 5 m in july 2020 during this time the lake lost almost 45 by area and 85 by volume fig 1 a the decline caused salinities to increase to saturation more than 300 g l and caused a catastrophic decline in brine shrimp artemia spp and the birds that depend on them schulz et al 2020 the declining lake level increased airborne dust from the exposed lakebed and allowed mainland predators to reach kabudan and ashk islands where endangered mammals including armenian sheep ovis orientalis gmilini and persian fallow deer dama dama mesopotamica live fig 1a islands 2 and 3 asem et al 2014 the lake decline caused losses of more than 1 6 million us 2019 to eco tourism recreation boating sunbathing therapeutic baths cultural heritage and educational activities bagherzadeh 2012 unep 2012 in response the iranian government approved the urmia lake restoration program ulrp in 2013 with an estimated cost of 7 billion us ulrp 2018 the iranian government set a uniform target restoration lake level of 1274 1 m and called this level the ecological level water volume of 14 5 km3 the ecological level was intended to reduce the salinity to 263 g l 1 240 g l 1 nacl that was believed would allow brine shrimp artemia spp to thrive abbaspour and nazaridoust 2007 artemia are an important food source for millions of birds that once inhabited lake urmia including 40 000 80 000 pairs of breeding greater flamingos phoenicopterus roseus hereafter flamingo ramsar 2011 since 2013 the urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc is attempting to reach the ecological level in three phases over 10 years through an inter basin water transfer and reducing agricultural water consumption by 40 fig 1b a health level of 1271 75 m to suppress dust has been discussed but not formally implemented the ulrp is using the full restoration approach and has set a single restoration target for the entire lake here we suggest that by considering multiple objectives managers may be able to successfully recover more ecosystem services with the limited supply of additional water that can be made available many prior researchers have suggested how to raise lake urmia s level to the ecological target of 1274 1 m bakhshianlamouki et al 2020 farokhnia et al 2018 hamidi razi et al 2019 hassani et al 2020 pouladi et al 2019 shadkam et al 2016 torabi haghighi and kløve 2017 each study assumed that the ecological level would attain a salinity that would recover bird populations however thorough studies have not yet been done to evaluate what lake levels are needed to recover artemia and bird populations and procure other ecosystem services like dust mitigation island conservation and recreation there are also needs to describe how lake level variations over time and uncertainties in natural and human processes effect provision of ecosystem services managers want to know what they can do now to procure more restoration objectives despite variations and uncertainties these issues are faced by saline lake managers world wide e g micklin 2016 national research council 1987 swca 2013 3 materials and methods we used experimental field satellite and model data available from peer reviewed governmental and non governmental sources to identify eight restoration metrics and objectives that quantify aspects of water quality ecology human health economy and recreation table 1 we related each metric to different lake levels sima 2021 lake level data was available since 1970 and measured daily by the west azerbaijan water bureau at a precision of 10 cm at a single point in the lake table 1 note that lake level fluctuates annually by 0 5 1 2 m below we describe each restoration metric why the service is important how we measured the service uncertainties in provision of the service and how we synthesized across services and metrics see appendix a for further description 1 salinity regulates the growth and survival of invertebrates that are food for migratory birds salinity was measured as monthly total dissolved solids g l 1 tds from the top 0 5 m of the lake data are available from 1977 to 2018 see section 1 in the appendix future tds concentrations will be affected not only by the lake level but by the rates that salts dissolve into and precipitate in the lake 2 artemia are believed to provide an important food source for birds eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 and have high potential economic value in the aquaculture industry sorgeloos et al 2001 seasonal adult artemia urmiana densities number m 3 were developed from horizontal tows of zooplankton nets and pumping at specific depths conducted over a range of lake salinities section 2 in the appendix artemia tolerances of lake salinity ion concentrations and nutrient loads will affect future artemia density measurements 3 flamingos are a prominent bird species that feed extensively on artemia and use the lake islands to breed asem et al 2014 although 212 bird species use lake urmia doe 2010 and the lake supports internationally important numbers of wintering water birds data were only available for annual winter counts of nesting and migratory flamingos in both lake urmia and its bordering gharahgheshlagh wetland section 3 in the appendix bird nesting and migratory behavior by season and bird movement will affect future flamingo counts 4 islands connect to each other when the lake level drops islands provide critical habitat for two threatened mammal species persian fallow deer and armenian wild sheep eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 when the lake level drops islands connect together and wild sheep may compete with deer for available freshwater and food resources drought exacerbates this competition ulrp 2017 we used gis analysis a lake bathymetric map karimi et al 2016 visual inspection of modis satellite images and land use maps of lake area extracted from landsat satellite images in different studies to estimate the range of lake levels where islands connect to each other m above msl errors in these identified lake levels derive from the 0 27 m error in bathymetric water depth measurements karimi et al 2016 methodological errors in measurement and applied land use classification methods section 4 in the appendix 5 islands connect to lake shore when the lake level drops further lake desiccation opens land bridges between the four islands and the lakeshore mainland predators access the islands and threaten the persian fallow deer and armenian wild sheep we used the same gis bathymetric map modis and landsat images to estimate lake elevations where islands connect to the shore m above msl errors in the estimated lake levels are the same as for islands connecting to each other section 5 in the appendix 6 lakebed dust poses a respiratory health risk to the 5 million people who live near the lake 2016 census like many dried lakes worldwide lake urmia generates wind blown dust from the dried lakebed gholampour et al 2015 saline lake dust can also degrade agricultural land a metric of exposed dust area km2 was estimated by intersecting satellite derived and downscaled dust polygons with lake bathymetry data for three periods between 2010 and 2016 section 6 in the appendix movement and change of dust across the landscape precision in the satellite sensors that detect dust areas and the errors in the bathymetry water depth measurements karimi et al 2016 will affect future dust area estimates 7 magnesium mg2 is a high value dissolved ion that can be mined from lake brine and used in agriculture chemical automotive and aircraft industries similar to salinity key cation and anion compositions meq l 1 were measured from the top 0 5 m of the lake since 1977 section 7 in the appendix potassium k is also a high value ion but potassium concentration data were very noisy consequently we could not develop a meaningful relationship for k with lake level lake ionic composition and the order that salts precipitate will affect future magnesium concentrations 8 ecotourism is popular at several lake resorts and beaches unesco 2015 recreation includes bathing swimming and boating in pedal and motor boats during spring and summer at low lake levels tractors must pull boats long distances from the resorts across the dried lakebed to access water here we used lake bathymetric data to quantify the distance km between two tourist beaches on the west shore golmankhaneh and bari see fig 1a and the nearest water that is at least 1 m deep section 8 in the appendix estimates of future distances will be affected by changes in lake bathymetry e g from salt precipitation and the criteria used for water that is sufficiently deep for boating we also considered an important socioeconomic management objective to increase agricultural revenue agriculture is a large consumer of water in the lake urmia basin that provides livelihoods for many people diverting water for agriculture negatively effects most other lake services because diversions reduce water that flows to the lake fig a1 in the appendix we used annual agricultural water management and farm economic data from 1995 to 2015 for five dominant basin crops of wheat barley corn sugar beet and alfalfa table 2 and section 9 in the appendix sima 2021 to calculate a unit water value us m 3 and irrigation water use m3 for each crop and year then we multiplied the unit water value and irrigation water use values for each crop to obtain agricultural revenues us crop prices the exchange rate cropping patterns crop types reservoir operations and weather will affect future agricultural revenues appendix a further describes each lake restoration objective and the agricultural revenue objective 4 results 4 1 the ecological level may be insufficient to reach the salinity target and recover artemia and flamingos salinity concentrations artemia densities and flamingo counts show that the ecological level of 1274 m may be insufficient to maintain salinities below 263 g l and support artemia figs 2 3 in turn the ecological level is unlikely to support flamingos figs 4 and a2 in the appendix 4 1 1 lake level and total dissolved solids measured tds from 1977 to 2016 shows large variations at different lake levels fig 2 and 3a the observed median salinity was 263 g l 1 at lake levels near the ecological target but the 75th percentile estimate was still well above the 263 g l 1 salinity target asem et al 2007 hafezieh 2016a the time series of tds show an expected quasi inverse relationship where salinity increased as lake level declined fig 3a we developed a sigmoid relationship r2 0 96 rmse 16 g l 1 between tds and lake level fig 2 we used the relationship to estimate salinities and provide context for lake level on later plots 4 1 2 brine shrimp survival at different salinities artemia densities in lake urmia declined significantly p 0 001 from approximately 600 to 200 adults m 3 as salinities increased from 160 g l 1 in 1994 95 to over 350 g l 1 in 2007 fig 3b artemia densities for lake urmia have not been measured for salinities between 170 235 g l 1 limiting our interpretation for the threshold for high population densities great salt lake offers insights where densities of a related species a franciscana decrease with increasing salinity although the trend was not statistically significant p 0 097 belovsky et al 2011 at salinities ranging from 90 to 200 g l 1 artemia densities were much higher in great salt lake mean 1500 m 3 than in lake urmia mean 400 m 3 fig 3b we note however that the bioassay experiments of larti et al 2012 indicate that a urmiana is more resistant to high salinities than is the great salt lake species a franciscana although artemia in lake urmia can survive at near saturated salt levels their densities are very low and unlikely to support flamingos or other birds an important unanswered question is what densities of artemia and other invertebrates are necessary to sustain birds at lake urmia in great salt lake usa artemia densities of 100 m 3 caused eared grebes podiceps nigricollis to forage longer caudell 2006 if the target tds of 263 g l 1 for lake urmia can be reached the limited available data suggests that artemia densities might be around 200 m 3 that low density might support diving birds like eared grebes bioassay experiments on artemia survival have yielded lc50 i e 50 survival salinity concentrations ranging from 110 to 255 g l 1 depending on the methodologies used fig a2 agh et al 2008 larti et al 2012 mohammadi et al 2009 however survival is just one aspect of the effects of salinity on the life history of artemia for example agh et al 2008 showed that physiological stress caused offspring production of artemia to fall 69 as salinities increased from 75 to 175 g l 1 the field and laboratory results demonstrate that the target ecological salinity of 263 g l 1 places considerable strain on artemia and higher salinities are even more stressful barnes and wurtsbaugh 2015 these laboratory assays however do not account for the possibility of rapid evolutionary responses or selection for existing strains with higher salinity tolerances as was described by günther 1899 4 1 3 flamingo population the number of flamingos at lake urmia has declined dramatically with decreasing lake levels fig 4 at water levels below 1272 5 m and salinity near 360 g l 1 few flamingos were observed in the lake or the neighboring gharahgheshlagh bird refuge at the southern end of the lake at the ecological lake level of 1274 m and salinities near 280 g l 1 the observed flamingo population was less than half its number at higher water levels in the better studied camargue saline wetlands of france artemia abundance remained high up to a salinity of 215 g l 1 but abundances of most other invertebrates declined markedly at salinities 140 g l 1 the threshold found for american flamingos phoenicopterus ruber britton and johnson 1987 this decline suggests that flamingos forage on a range of invertebrates and many of these invertebrates disappear at salinities well below the salinity target of 263 g l 1 consequently managers must characterize the habitat and growth needs of invertebrates flamingos and particularly other birds in lake urmia and nearby wetlands together the salinity artemia and flamingo results show that a lake level of 1274 m may not attain a salinity previously thought to support high populations of artemia additionally the 263 g l 1 salinity target may not allow most other invertebrates to grow to sufficient densities to support flamingos and other birds consequently a higher lake level may be needed to decrease salinity and sustain artemia and flamingos 4 2 relationships between lake level and other restoration metrics 4 2 1 islands connect to each other and shore the existing bathymetric map indicates that the four largest southern islands in lake urmia merge together at water levels between 1271 3 and 1271 7 m fig 5 however satellite imagery indicates that the current bathymetric map overestimates the corresponding lake level where islands merge even though the map accurately shows the lake shape the overestimation is due to few bathymetric depth measurements near the islands karimi et al 2016 lake levels between 1270 6 and 1271 7 m would result in a land bridge forming from kabudan island see fig 1a to the southeast shore of the lake fig 5 part b 4 2 2 lakebed dust the lake s flat topography means the greatest increase in exposed lakebed dust area occurs as water levels decline from 1272 to 1270 m figs 6 a and a 2 in the appendix maintaining the lake level above 1272 m is important to minimize dust and public health risk as the lake further desiccates the inner parts are exposed fig 6b these inner parts are closer to ecologically sensitive areas such as islands so dust mitigation approaches such as gravel blankets mulching or planting may not be permitted moreover as the lake further desiccates the distance between the exposed dust prone areas and rivers that feed the lake increases this increase will complicate water delivery to reduce dust at lake levels greater than 1272 m most dust prone areas are inundated 4 2 3 valuable ions since mid 2007 as the lake has desiccated different precipitation rates have caused the concentrations of na and cl ions to decrease while concentrations of mg 2 and so4 2 ions have increased in the water column of lake urmia fig a 3 in the appendix in 2019 there were roughly equal concentrations of na and mg 2 since september 2011 lake water changed from a na mg cl so4 to an mg na cl so4 solute sharifi et al 2018 as economically important potassium and magnesium salts concentrate in the brine there could be a future opportunity to extract magnesium chloride magnesium oxide and potash kcl kso4 and others such as is now done at the dead sea and great salt lake swca 2013 recent studies revealed that it is technically feasible and highly beneficial to extract mg2 and k minerals at several locations along the lake shore gsi 2017 novopro 2019 at high lake levels precipitated halite nacl dissolves warren 2006 decreases mgcl2 and mgso4 concentrations and makes magnesium mining less desirable see section 6 in the appendix nonetheless salt mining is not currently allowed because lake urmia is a national park 4 2 4 recreation as lake level drops distance increases from the bari and golmankhaneh resorts to locations with sufficient water depth for boating 1 m fig 7 at water levels higher than 1271 m the distance from the shore to boatable water is less than 300 m and the error in these distance estimates is also small as lake level declines to 1269 m and the shoreline recedes distance increases to more than 1 km bari and about 3 km golmankhaneh with rising estimation errors due to the shallow lakebed slope fig a 2 in the appendix from september 2011 2018 when lake level was low both resorts closed and beaches are no longer used for boating sunbathing and mud baths in spring 2019 and 2020 some boating and recreation activities returned when the lake level rose above 1271 5 m at 1271 5 m we estimate the distance to deep water is less than 300 m at both resorts fig 7 4 3 restoration objectives do not converge to a single lake level 4 3 1 tradeoffs among restoration objectives we synthesize tradeoffs among restoration objectives by comparing undesirable lake levels dark blue and desirable lake levels white for each metric fig 8 a restoration objectives with more certainty in the desirable lake level such as when islands merge together near 1271 5 m have more abrupt color changes these abrupt changes also appear in the box and whiskers and scatter plots in figs 2 3b 4 5 and 7 all restoration objectives improve with increasing water level except for magnesium concentration at high lake levels most ecosystem services of lake urmia are lost or significantly decline at lake levels below 1270 m between 1272 m and 1274 5 m which spans the ecological target water will inundate many dust prone areas keep islands separated and provide lake access for recreation however these levels do not adequately lower salinity maintain artemia or support flamingos the ecological restoration level of 1274 m could provide salinities between 237 and 285 g l 1 asem et al 2007 hafezieh 2016a 2016b and artemia densities of 200 400 per m 3 figs 2 and 3b which may be insufficient to support populations of flamingos and other water birds in contrast high lake levels like the pre desiccation lake levels above 1275 m can minimize airborne dust sustain artemia and bird populations preserve island habitats maintain recreation and further permit recovery of other ecological components of the urmia food web and biological diversity e g ephydra urmiana and mollusks in other words seven out of the eight objectives fig 8a can be fulfilled by lake levels between 1275 and 1278 m apart from inter annual variations of lake level whether natural or anthropogenic lake services can vary seasonally our analysis of lake level data since 1995 showed that lake urmia level has a seasonal variation from 0 5 to 1 2 m for example in 2010 a 0 7 m seasonal variation was observed around the mean annual lake level of 1271 3 m this intra annual variation would decrease increase dust prone areas by 30 and affects islands merging and land bridge formation 4 4 agriculture and lake level trade offs plotting annual agricultural revenues vs lake levels shows two trade offs fig 8b observations from 1995 to 2012 defined a downward sloping win lose trade off between lake level and agricultural revenues light green squares the lake and agriculture competed for water observations from 2012 onward instead suggested an outward pushing win win trade off fig 8b dark green circles here agricultural revenues increased with the same lake level and similar reservoir releases to agriculture this counterintuitive result for this recent period occurred because crop yields water productivity unit values of water and agricultural revenues all increased while irrigated area and agricultural water deliveries remained similar fig 9 dark green circles orange box highlights increasing crop yields a sharp rise in crop prices started in 2012 in response to iran s currency devaluation fig a 4 in the appendix the iranian government raised crop prices to make internal markets competitive and promote food security in other words agricultural revenue before 2012 was strongly tied to the expansion of agricultural area and irrigation water releases from reservoirs fig 9 the bottom row plots while after 2012 banning agricultural area expansion improving environmental flow releases for lake urmia increasing crop yields and crop pricing increased agricultural revenue and stabilized lake level around 1271 m fig 8b however further increasing lake level to meet more lake services will require more lake inflow barhagh et al 2021 interpretation of both trade offs in fig 8b is complicated by variable lake levels within year lake level variations are 0 5 1 2 m green error bars the variations mean that the ecological level of 1274 m may procure a wide range of basin agricultural revenues e g us 60 150 million year likewise other lake levels such as 1272 m may procure a similar wide range of agricultural revenues these results highlight crop pricing and crop yield improvements as important tools to encourage local people to improve their crop patterns land and irrigation management practices if adopted at a wide scale these practices can change tradeoffs between agricultural revenue lake level and provision of lake ecosystem services 5 discussion we related eight lake urmia restoration metrics to lake level to show how different lake levels influence restoration however measurement errors in all the metrics make it difficult to precisely show how these metrics will respond to management decisions we also faced challenges from uncertain knowledge about salt precipitation and dissolution uncertainty about artemia and other invertebrate densities needed to support birds national currency devaluation crop pricing and other factors for example up to 1 m of salts may have precipitated on urmia s lakebed between 2013 and 2015 karimi et al 2016 changing the bathymetry making lake urmia shallower increasing evaporative losses and affecting relationships between lake elevation and each of our eight restoration metrics however this precipitation and many other limnological metrics have yet to be carefully quantified in the lake these variations and uncertainties prevent setting a precise target restoration level such as the ecological target of 1274 1 m in the face of these variations and uncertainties a uniform lake target such as 1274 m cannot also simultaneously achieve multiple desired ecosystem services such as reducing the salinity to 263 g l 1 increasing artemia densities and increasing flamingo abundance in fact no single lake level can simultaneously satisfy all management objectives instead of a uniform target restoration level we recommend that managers 1 evaluate many ecosystem services such as those identified in this study and identify the lake levels that support impair them 2 quantify tradeoffs among ecosystem services 3 track ecosystem service provision as lake levels vary over time 4 raise lake levels to a critical level such as near 1272 m that will reduce public health risk and 5 set annual crop prices to encourage agricultural water use efficiency and to increase agricultural revenues our suggestions change the current lake urmia restoration narrative from i managers should restore lake urmia to a precise uniform ecological lake level alborzi et al 2018 unep 2012 to ii managers should include additional restoration objectives that can be accomplished with different lake levels by focusing on these additional objectives managers can still adapt their restoration strategies over time as they learn more about salinity salt precipitation salt dissolution illegal water withdrawals agricultural return flows climate induced runoff flooding evapotranspiration the lake s food web and other processes that effect procurement of ecosystem services loucks and van beek 2003 these suggestions allow managers to move forward now without having to wait to better understand lake variations or resolve uncertainties moving forward now is critical for large lake restoration efforts that may require decades to reach restoration goals these suggestions can also help managers consider more of the benefits and drawbacks of lake restoration actions for example current lake restoration efforts include dredging and channelizing streams and wetlands to improve water delivery to the lake to help reach the 1274 m target ulrp 2018 however this practice impairs the ecological function of rivers dries up wetlands and shrinks lake deltas that birds depend on galatowitsch 2012 mitsch and gosselink 2015 another example is the proposed breach in the automobile causeway to reduce evaporative losses although this may provide a slight increase in lake level it will increase mixing of salts between the north and south basin and reduce the probability that artemia recover to desired densities abatzopoulos et al 2006 our suggestions to evaluate more restoration objectives and the lake levels that support them quantify tradeoffs and track ecosystem service provision can help the ulrnc achieve its three period restoration plan fig 1b the ulrp is now in the second restoration phase to increase lake level from the current 1271 8 m to 1273 m by 2021 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 our results show that lake levels up to 1273 m will reduce dust protect threatened and endangered sheep and deer on islands and promote recreation our analyses show that phase three efforts to raise the lake level another 1 m to reach the ecological level of 1274 m by 2023 may not sufficiently reduce salinity to recover high densities of artemia flamingos and other birds a higher lake level is likely needed however there is currently limited monitoring of the lake ecosystem a monthly monitoring program at 10 15 lake stations could help measure artemia abundances and many other limnological parameters in the absence of a good monitoring program it will be impossible to understand how water management is influencing the lake ecosystem the ulrnc should also re examine major restoration projects such as inter basin water transfers safari et al 2014 ulrp 2018 upstream reservoir water release policies torabi haghighi et al 2018 yasi and ashori 2017 land management alizade govarchin ghale et al 2019 diking and environmental flows for their ability to regulate lake level over time the ulrnc should re examine to see which projects can flexibly deliver different volumes of water seasonally and year to year and contribute to different lake levels and ecosystem services during our outreach work between march and july 2019 the ulrnc technical team iranian department of environment and iranian ministry of energy each voiced support for our suggestions from this outreach we understand that considering more restoration objectives can help these organizations negotiate more environmentally friendly water allocations and improve livelihoods there are several limitations of our approach first we tied each restoration metric to a single system variable lake level in other environmental systems a unifying variable such as lake level may not exist at the same time an integrating system variable like lake level allows hydrology climate agricultural governance and other researchers to quantify the ecosystem impacts of the lake stressors they study second our analysis does not consider dependencies between restoration objectives for example increasing mg2 and k concentrations may improve mineral extraction opportunities but the new ionic composition may be toxic for artemia bowen et al 1985 third we do not provide lower or upper bounds for the suitable lake levels because there is considerable uncertainty in the processes that affect restoration objectives fig 8b also the bounds will change over time as managers learn more about the lake system fourth we did not weight prioritize or monetize the ecosystem services although it could be very beneficial weighting or prioritizing the objectives will require managers and local stakeholders to express their preferences and will be difficult when different stakeholders champion different objectives monetizing may make it easier to justify expenditures for lake restoration and compare the value obtained per unit of water required to procure each ecosystem service however several ecosystem services like salinity birds and islands connecting to each other and the shore may be difficult to monetize fifth we assume the lake system is reversible reversibility means that historical observations at medium and high water levels for salinity artemia flamingos and other restoration metrics will again hold when the lake returns to those levels in reality there may be time lags hysteresis or alternative stable states that produce different ecosystem services than what was historically observed at the same water level for example seed organisms are likely available to recolonize the lake from the fresher estuaries but this is an untested assumption a sixth limitation is common to many multi objective analyses complexity increases by adding more restoration objectives problem dimensions we sidestep this challenge by relating eight ecosystem service metrics to a single variable lake level seventh we used lake averaged salinity and ionic composition and due to lack of data did not consider spatial variation of salinity and ions through the lake however a recent study showed that there is a significant salinity difference between the lake urmia s northern and southern parts during high flows bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 and eighth we did not include climate or wetland objectives large lakes moderate local climate e g zhu et al 2018 but the relationship is not yet quantified for lake urmia climate change has influenced and will continue to influence the lake urmia watershed schulz et al 2020 although flamingos and other birds used the wetlands to feed breed and rest there were insufficient data to define a wetland objective 6 conclusions we used 40 years of available experimental field satellite and model data to quantify eight ecosystem services for iran s lake urmia at different lake levels in the areas of water quality ecology human health economy and recreation we also quantified an objective to increase basin wide agricultural revenues we found numerous variations and uncertainties in lake data and processes that contribute to restoration objectives variability and uncertainties in the data and a poor understanding of many of the watershed and lake processes currently limit an effective restoration program for lake urmia these limitations 1 prevent setting a precise target restoration level 2 question whether the ecological target of 1274 m will reduce salinity enough to recover artemia and flamingo populations to pre desiccation densities 3 highlight that restoration objectives do not converge to single lake level 4 show tradeoffs among objectives are murky 5 suggest that managers should focus on multiple ecosystem services and document how they are met as lake levels vary over time researchers and managers can apply our findings in multiple ways they should consider scenarios of different lake levels in their new analyses modelling studies and other work rather than use a uniform ecological level of 1274 m new research is urgently needed to describe and quantify i salt precipitation dissolution and its effects on bathymetry ii lake evaporation iii lake wetland connections iv bird distribution v the lake food web of birds and their dependence on lake level salinity and ionic compositions vi illegal water use vii agricultural return flows viii reservoir management ix effects of past mismanagement of basin land and water resources xi climate change impact and drought intensification on the lake food web xii spatial and vertical distribution of salinity and minerals and xiii farm decision making in response to crop pricing and water allocation strategies a more comprehensive approach will allow managers of lake urmia and other saline lakes to adapt their water allocation agricultural development and restoration strategies over time as they learn more about their lake systems this work is a product of an ongoing
