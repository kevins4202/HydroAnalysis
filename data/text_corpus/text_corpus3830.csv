19150,sulfonamide antibiotics sas are increasingly detected as aquatic contaminants and exist as different dissociated species depending on the ph of the water their removal in sunlit surface waters is governed by photochemical transformation here we report a detailed examination of the hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 mediated photooxidation of nine sas sulfamethoxazole sulfisoxazole sulfamethizole sulfathiazole sulfamethazine sulfamerazine sulfadiazine sulfachloropyridazine and sulfadimethoxine both oh and 1o2 oxidation kinetics varied depending on the dominant protonated states of the sa in question h2sas hsas0 and sas as a function of ph based on competition kinetic experiments and matrix deconvolution calculations hsas0 or sas ph 5 8 were observed to be more highly reactive towards oh while sas ph 8 react the fastest with 1o2 for most of the sas tested using the empirically derived rates of reaction for the speciated forms at different phs the environmental half lives were determined using typical 1o2 and oh concentrations observed in the environment this approach suggests that photochemical 1o2 oxidation contributes more than oh oxidation and direct photolysis to the overall phototransformation of sas in sunlit waters based on the identification of key photointermediates using tandem mass spectrometry 1o2 oxidation generally occurred at the amino moiety on the molecule whereas oh reaction experienced multi site hydroxylation both these reactions preserve the basic parent structure of the compounds and raise concerns that the routes of phototransformation give rise to intermediates with similar antimicrobial potency as the parent sas we therefore recommend that these phototransformation pathways are included in risk assessments concerning the presence and fate of sas in waste and surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfonamides dissociated forms photodegradation oxidation kinetics transformation products 1 introduction the occurrence transformation and risks of antibiotics in aquatic systems are well acknowledged environmental issues and have raised particular concerns baena nogueras et al 2017 luo et al 2011 sulfonamides sas are a large class of antibiotics that are widely used in human treatments animal husbandry and aquaculture managaki et al 2007 due to their incomplete elimination by metabolism campagnolo et al 2002 and wastewater treatment chen et al 2013 sas enter the environment continually and are regularly detected as aqueous micropollutants their presence in surface waters has been reported in many countries including the united states kolpin et al 2002 europe loos et al 2009 vietnam managaki et al 2007 and china luo et al 2011 concentrations in surface waters can vary quite widely with mean concentrations observed to range from 0 1 to 150 8 ng l 1 in the coastal waters of china through a variety of recent monitoring studies see fig s1 and associated references there is evidence of ecotoxicological effects of sas on freshwater biota with sas also promoting bacterial resistance białk bielińska et al 2011 2017 zhang et al 2015 interestingly exposure to sunlight appears to enhance the toxicities of sas towards several aquatic organisms such as d magna jung et al 2008 trovó et al 2009b and vibrio fischeri xu et al 2014 and this reflects the toxicity exhibited by other photo transformed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones ge et al 2010 2018 sas may undergo different transformation processes including photodegradation and biodegradation however in sunlit surface waters photodegradation has been identified as the major transformation pathway carstens et al 2013 specifically sas can undergo direct photodegradation as well as sensitized indirect photoprocesses such as oxidation reactions with hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and other reactive oxygen species ros boreen et al 2004 2005 li et al 2018 in sunlit surface waters oh and 1o2 are ubiquitous in waters and serve as the most important transient photooxidants leading to the oxidative degradation of aqueous organic micropollutants cooper et al 1989 vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 they are generated from sunlight induced reactions involving common water constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom nitrate ions and fe iii furthermore the environmental photochemical processes of sas can also be affected by the presence of other water constituents such as halide ions hco3 and cu2 ions guerard et al 2009 li et al 2016 2018 niu et al 2013a as the molecular structures of sas contain two ionisable groups i e nh2 and nh their various dissociated forms are expected to influence their photochemical behavior boreen et al 2004 wei et al 2013 although the behavior of the various dissociated forms is not well understood previous studies have demonstrated separate phototransformation kinetics of different dissociated species for specific compounds in various classes of antibiotics such as tetracyclines niu et al 2013b werner et al 2006 fluoroquinolones ge et al 2015 wei et al 2013 and sas boreen et al 2004 2005 willach et al 2018 although for sas direct photodegradation rather than ros photooxidation has been the focus to date for direct photodegradation the anionic neutral and cationic species of sas have different quantum yields φ and rate constants k and the most photoreactive component varies depending on the sa under investigation bonvin et al 2013 boreen et al 2004 2005 niu et al 2013a xu et al 2014 without considering the protonation state sas react with oh at a mean rate k of 5 3 109 m 1 s 1 and their 1o2 oxidation k ranges over 4 orders of magnitude 104 108 boreen et al 2004 2005 the different protonation states are expected to react with ros at different reactivities however the ros photooxidation kinetics of the different dissociation species has received little attention in the literature furthermore to apportion the relative contributions of the photooxidation to the fate of sas the corresponding environmental half lives in surface waters need to be assessed based on the distribution of the speciated forms and the ambient water conditions a thorough understanding of the transformation routes via ros photooxidation of sas is important for the overall assessment of their aquatic fate and to understand the relative importance of this phototransfromation pathway compared to direct photodegradation to date only several intermediates have been identified for selected sas for the oxidation reaction with oh in advanced oxidation processes batista et al 2014 du et al 2018 hu et al 2007 trovó et al 2009a the oh can induce multihydroxylation of the aniline moiety and cleavage of heterocyclic rings batista et al 2014 hu et al 2007 shah and hao 2017 as for 1o2 oxidation some relevant mechanisms have been proposed for example a 2 2 cycloaddition of 1o2 on isoxazole rings was speculated for sas containing five membered heterocyclic groups boreen et al 2004 furthermore 1o2 tends to oxidate electron rich compounds such as anilines dialkyl sulfides pyrroles and phenolate anions mill 1999 these previous studies provide a useful rationale to further investigate ros photooxidation of sas in an environmental context the purpose of this study was to investigate the ros i e oh and 1o2 oxidation kinetics of sas and compare the oxidation products and kinetics with those formed from direct photodegradation the nine sas selected in the study are widely used and commonly reported in aquatic environments chen et al 2013 kolpin et al 2002 luo et al 2011 managaki et al 2007 importantly the oxidation kinetics and reactivities were examined for the various dissociated forms which in turn are dependent on the ambient ph ros induced transformation pathways are currently under represented in the literature and yet may account for a signficant proportion of phototransformation of sas in surface waters this has important implications for how we assess their fate and undertake environmental risk assessments for this group of chemicals 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials four sas containing the five membered heterocyclic groups and five sas containing the six membered heterocyclic groups were selected as model compounds for the study fig 1 including sulfamethoxazole smx sulfisoxazole six sulfamethizole smt sulfathiazole st sulfamethazine smz sulfamerazine sm sulfadiazine sd sulfachloropyridazine scp and sulfadimethoxine sdm as described in table s1 the nine sas were purchased from different suppliers all the compounds as received were at least 98 purity furfuryl alcohol ffa 98 and perinaphthenone 97 were obtained from j k technology co ltd and sigma aldrich respectively hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 was purchased from acros organics methanol trifluoroacetic acid and acetophenone ap were of hplc grade and other reagents such as phosphates were of guaranteed grade and used as received all solutions were prepared in ultrapure water obtained from a millipore milli q system 2 2 photochemical experiments a merry go round reactor with quartz tubes 50 ml volume and 20 mm diameter containing reaction solutions was used to perform photochemical experiments under irradiation of a water refrigerated 500 w high pressure mercury lamp the light intensities at the solutions were 1 95 mw cm 2 at 365 nm and 1 83 mw cm 2 at 420 nm measured by a uv spectral irradiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university the experimental setup and spectral irradiance are illustrated in figs s2 and s3 respectively competition kinetics were employed to determine the bimolecular rate constants k ros i e k oh and k 1o2 for the reactions between sas and oh according to eq 1 1 k r o s s i n s t s 0 i n r t r 0 k r o s r where s is the substrate sas r is a reference compound and the square brackets represent the concentrations the method has been used successfully to examine the oh 1o2 reactivifties of pharmaceuticals and other environmental organic contaminants boreen et al 2004 edhlund et al 2006 wei et al 2015 xie et al 2013 the initial concentration of individual sas was set at 10 μm hydroxyl radicals oh were generated through the addition of h2o2 100 mm with a 340 nm cut off filter surrounding the hg lamp light source acetophenone 10 μm was spiked into the reaction solution as the reference compound with k oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 edhlund et al 2006 for the 1o2 reaction experiments 380 nm cut off filters were used for the light source with perinaphthenone 20 μm and furfuryl alcohol 20 μm as the photosensitizer and reference compound k 1o2 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 respectively perinaphthenone is often used to photogenerate 1o2 with a quantum yield close to unity boreen et al 2008 han et al 2008 latch et al 2003 oliveros et al 1991 schmidt et al 1994 the 1o2 reaction solutions were pre aerated to be saturated with dissolved oxygen the ph of the reaction solutions ph 2 5 and 8 was adjusted to the desired value using phosphate buffers all the competition kinetic experiments with controls were conducted in triplicate 2 3 matrix deconvolution calculation the ros oxidation rate constants k ros i for sa protonation states i were calculated using matrix deconvolution methods based on previous studies boreen et al 2004 2005 werner et al 2006 and used successfully by our group in a previous study on ionisable fluoroquinolones ge et al 2018 for each sa the individual k oh i or k 1o2 i of the fully protonated h2sas neutral hsas0 and anionic forms sas were fitted according to the following matrix 1 2 δ h 2 s a s δ h s a s 0 δ s a s k r o s h 2 s a s k r o s h s a s 0 k r o s s a s k r o s p h 8 p h 2 where δ i represents the fraction of each dissociated form and the values are referred to in fig s4 k ros is k oh or k 1o2 of sas at different ph and k ros h2sas k ros sas are the k oh i or k 1o2 i of the three sa forms to be fitted 2 4 analytical determination a waters uplc with pda detector fitted with a beh c18 column was employed for the separation and quantification of sas acetophenone and furfuryl alcohol in the irradiated samples which were collected from the reactor and spiked with methanol oh quencher or nan3 1o2 quencher to identify intermediates irradiated solutions 2 l for each sample was purified by solid phase extraction and then analyzed by an agilent hplc coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in both positive and negative modes the analytical details are provided in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 ros oxidation kinetics under different ph in the control experiments the losses of sas and reference compounds either under dark or in the absence of the ros photosensitizer were 2 thus degradation by direct photolytic thermal and hydrolytic processes was considered negligible during the duration of the photochemical experiments 2 h however when exposed to light irradiation in the competition kinetic experiments the sas disappeared quickly indicating that the sas were photooxidised efficiently by ros the oxidative degradation curve of smz as an example is provided in fig s5 the values for the bimolecular reaction rate constants of the nine sas with oh k oh and 1o2 k 1o2 in pure water are listed in tables s2 and s3 the k oh ranged from 5 00 0 77 109 m 1 s 1 for sm to 9 16 1 66 109 m 1 s 1 for smt while the k 1o2 ranged from 2 31 0 06 107 m 1 s 1 for smx to 1 34 0 15 109 m 1 s 1 for scp the k oh values were larger than k 1o2 indictive of the higher reactivity of oh with the various sa compounds however considering that the steady state concentrations of 1o2 can be three orders of magnitude higher than that of oh cooper et al 1989 mill 1999 1o2 may be more important than oh in the attenuation of sas in sunlit waters in comparison with other antibiotics the k oh values of sas fall in the same order of magnitude as the fluoroquinolones ge et al 2015 santoke et al 2009 tetracyclines jeong et al 2010 and nitrofurans edhlund et al 2006 however the k 1o2 of sas are 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than those observed for the other antibiotics castillo et al 2007 edhlund et al 2006 wei et al 2015 this notable difference of k 1o2 among antibiotics can be attributed to the higher selectivity of 1o2 than that of oh to oxidize organic chemicals keen and linden 2013 larson and weber 1996 mill 1999 yao et al 2013 oh can oxidize almost all classes of organic chemicals keen and linden 2013 li et al 2014 mill 1999 whereas 1o2 is more sensitive to electron rich chemicals such as sulfides and phenols larson and weber 1996 mill 1999 since aqueous sas can undergo two acid base dissociation processes fig s4 the ros oxidation reactivity of each sa is expected to depend on its speciation at a given ph value to quantify the reactivity of each protonation state towards oh and 1o2 the k oh and k 1o2 were determined for three different phs the results are illustrated in fig 2 and the corresponding values are provided in tables s2 and s3 it is found that both k oh and k 1o2 are dependent on ph p 0 05 with generally higher values of k oh at ph 5 and ph 8 than at ph 2 although six was the exception to this displaying the fastest reactivity at ph 2 similarly the reactivity of 1o2 oxidation was fastest for seven of the sas at ph 8 while only two sas six and scp had the fastest kinetics at ph 2 and ph 5 respectively the higher reactivity of six at ph 2 suggests that the reactive site might be the dimethylisoxazole moiety towards oh and 1o2 at the lower ph for smx with its monomethylisoxazole moiety dimethylation of the isoxazole ring significantly increases the electron density of this ring dogan et al 1990 making six more susceptible to ros attack particularly to 1o2 oxidation fig 2 the effect of ph on the 1o2 oxidation kinetics was more significant than the reaction with oh for example the k 1o2 values showed a 1 3 to 11 2 fold variation mean 4 5 over the ph range while k oh showed a 1 5 to 4 3 fold variation mean 2 2 the k oh and k 1o2 values reported here compare favourably to an earlier study examining the photochemical fate of sas boreen et al 2004 2005 in this case k 1o2 was only measured at ph 10 2 carbonate buffered solution and k oh at ph 3 fenton system with k 1o2 for smt reported as 5 5 0 4 107 m 1 s 1 and k oh as 6 6 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 boreen et al 2004 2005 for other chemicals the ph effect resulting in different protonation states and their corresponding ros reactivities has been reported for fluoroquinolone antibiotics ge et al 2015 wei et al 2013 and hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers xie et al 2013 3 2 ros reactivities of different dissociated species as shown in fig 3 ros reactivities of sa dissociated species i are represented with the calculated bimolecular reaction rate constants k oh i and k 1o2 i their corresponding values are listed in tables s4 and s5 each sa showed variable ros reactivities for the different dissociated forms h2sas to sas with the exception of six the other eight sas in their neutral hsas0 or anionic sas forms were more highly reactive towards oh whereas most of the sas other than six and scp showed the fastest reaction with 1o2 in their anionic form sas compared with oh oxidation the 1o2 reaction activities varied by several orders of magnitude across the various speciated forms of the different sas e g h2sas to sas the proportion of each form is dependent on the ph e g 2 to 8 increasing ph enhances the deprotonation and electron density of the reactive aniline moiety which in turn increases the electron donating ability and decreases the steric hindrance thus making the aniline more vulnerable toward ros oxidant radical attack dodd et al 2006 jiao et al 2008 wei et al 2013 for example the aniline moiety in smx makes this compound more susceptible to electrophilic o3 attack particularly following deprotonation experienced at higher phs dodd et al 2006 for emerging micropollutants including antibiotics a database of k ros i values was constructed to describe the reactivities of their different protonated states towards oh and 1o2 table s6 this table includes the k oh i and k 1o2 i for sas from this study as well as values for a selection of ionisable antibiotics flame retardants and other relevant chemicals of environmental concern similar to the sas investigated here anionic forms of all other chemicals react faster with 1o2 than neutral or cationic forms tetracyclines in their neutral or anionic forms were more highly reactive towards oh however fluoroquinolones in their neutral form showed higher reactivities of oh than in their protonated cationic and anionic forms ge et al 2015 2018 while anionic ho pbdes were oxidised faster by oh than the neutral forms xie et al 2013 these ros reactive patterns coupled to the dominant speciated form of the chemical are of importance for the fate assessment of the ionisable pollutants that usually coexist with oh and 1o2 in surface waters 3 3 photooxidation half lives in surface waters in sunlit surface waters the photoinduced oh and 1o2 radicals are the most important transient oxidants cooper et al 1989 vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 their concentrations ros range from 10 17 to 10 15 m and from 10 15 to 10 12 m respectively cooper et al 1989 mill 1999 based on ros reactivities of dissociated sa species the corresponding environmental half lives t 1 2 ros e i e t 1 2 oh e and t 1 2 1o2 e at a specific ph can be calculated according to eq 2 3 3 k r o s e r o s δ i k r o s i 4 t 1 2 r o s e i n 2 k r o s e where k ros e is the environmental rate constant of sas towards oh or 1o2 k ros i represents k oh i or k 1o2 i and δ i values i e the fraction of each dissociated form are taken from fig s4 the calculation method takes into account the acid base dissociation of sas and the ph dependent kinetics of ros oxidation and is also applicable for the calculation of the t 1 2 ros e of other dissolved ionisable organic pollutants previous studies have tended to assess the t 1 2 ros e without considering the ph difference between laboratory solutions and surface waters boreen et al 2004 2005 as shown in table 1 the calculated values of t 1 2 oh e and t 1 2 1o2 e for the nine sas range from 14 62 h to 39 23 h and from 0 06 h to 2 22 h respectively to assess the importance of the photooxidation on the fate of sas t 1 2 ros e values were compared with direct photolytic half lives t 1 2 d e of sas in near surface waters boreen et al 2004 2005 for individual sas t 1 2 1o2 e are considerably shorter than t 1 2 oh e and t 1 2 d e indicating that oxidation of sas towards 1o2 can be a central factor in their environmental phototransformation even though oh is an unselective highly reactive species the environmental fate of sas is likely not controlled by the reaction with oh which can be attributed to such low concentrations of oh in surface waters however since the t 1 2 oh e are comparable to t 1 2 d e in midsummer and less than t 1 2 d e in midwinter suggesting oh oxidation is also appreciable compared to direct photolysis furthermore the oh is expected to be more effective at degrading sas due to its non selectivity ge et al 2015 keen and linden 2013 li et al 2014 mill 1999 the values in table 1 represent the minimum expected half lives as these were calculated based on the highest ros levels and continual light irradiation although the phototransformation may be hindered by light scattering or limited photic zone depth apart from the photooxidation and direct photolysis sas may undergo solar photosensitized degradation via 3dom which is of significance in most waters boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 in addition concomitant metal ions can also influence the photochemical behavior of sas by complexation effects shah et al 2015 wei et al 2015 thus to better understand the environmental photochemical fate of sas further studies are needed to study specific water bodies and examine the effects of non continuous solar exposure water depth and other aqueous constituents that may attenuate or absorb sunlight bodrato and vione 2014 3 4 ros oxidation intermediates and pathways four sas comprising of six st smz and scp were selected to investigate their phototransformation byproducts and deduce their main transformation pathways based on the three different reactions including 1o2 and oh oxidation as well as direct photolysis we identified 21 significant intermediates generated from their photooxidation all details on the identification of these photoproducts are shown in table s7 including chromatographic retention times molecular weight m w as well as mass spectral parent and fragment ions m z the corresponding ms and ms2 mass spectra in positive ionisation mode are displayed in fig s6 referring to the nitrogen rule and the analytical approaches in previous studies baena nogueras et al 2017 sági et al 2015 chemical structures were proposed and tentative phototransformation pathways for the four sas are presented in fig 4 there are three types of transformation pathways paths 1 3 corresponding to the three different reactions of each sa fig 4 among the 1o2 oxidation reactions path 1 complexes occur through r group addition at the sulfonyl n n1 site for sas containing five membered heterocyclic substituents whereas sas with six membered heterocyclic groups experience an oxidation at the amino n n11 site as for transformation products with molecular weight of 352 tp352a tp352b the r groups involve one nitrogen atom tp292 of smz generated from the addition of 1o2 to amino n and other moieties of smz were not transformed due to the detection of main fragment ions with m z 186 and 124 fig s6 sági et al 2015 a 1o2 oxidative product similar to tp292 was also reported for sulfapyridine xu et al 2014 besides li et al 2015 revealed that n1 and n11 are also the reaction sites for the reactions of sd with excited triplet state of dom proxies boreen et al 2004 speculated that the electron rich alkene in the isoxazole ring would be susceptible to singlet oxygenation for six however the corresponding products were not detected in path 2 fig 4 the reaction of oh radicals to each sa generated diverse hydroxylated products which involved multiple photooxidation pathways phenyl hydroxylation heterocyclic hydroxylation and cleavage as well as amino n oxidation and removal these multi pathways can be prioritized based on the by product abundance in the total ion chromatograms tp283 tp271 tp294a and tp300b showed optimal responses respectively for the four sas suggesting that phenyl hydroxylation is the most prevalent pathway this can be attributed to the electron rich aniline moiety that favors the hydroxylation which in turn promotes further oh addition i e multihydroxylation batista et al 2014 shah and hao 2017 in comparison hydroxylated heterocyclic reactions can be considered as minor or secondary pathways which generated products with small responses tp255 tp289 tp294b and tp310 hu et al also detected similar hydroxy intermediates for uva tio2 photocatalyzed smx degradation hu et al 2007 though some intermediates were not identified oh could induce the cleavage of c s and n s bonds thereby generating low molecular mass photo byproducts and leading ultimately to the full mineralisation of these pollutants into co2 h2o and other inorganic compounds batista et al 2014 hu et al 2007 in path 3 fig 4 direct photodegradation occurs through a cleavage at various positions for sas containing five membered heterocyclic groups with sulfanilic acid tp173 being observed as a common byproduct boreen et al 2004 however sas containing six membered heterocyclic substituents are primarily transformed to desulfonation products tp214 and tp220 with the loss of so2 boreen et al 2005 the so2 extrusion can be attributed to aromatic nucleophilic substitution of an aniline radical cation and subsequent smiles rearrangement tentscher et al 2013 except for the primary pathways more direct photolytic intermediates and processes have also been reported for several sas including st niu et al 2017 smx baena nogueras et al 2017 smz and sulfapyridine garcía galán et al 2012 as well as their human metabolites bonvin et al 2013 garcía galán et al 2012 finally the knowledge aquired through deducing the reaction pathways provides fundamental insights into the photochemical fate of sas in turn this will allow the evaluation of the phototransformation of sas during wastewater treatment and the wider aquatic environment as part of a detailed risk assessment process the distinct pathways of sas during reaction with oh would support the understanding of relevant mechanisms in advanced oxidation processes where oh is dominant such as uv fenton trovó et al 2009a tio2 photocatalysis yang et al 2010 and fe0 bisulfite o2 systerms du et al 2018 interestingly compared to direct photolysis that generally leads to photoproducts of low antimicrobial potency niu et al 2017 ros photooxidation of the sas does not initially destroy the core backbone structure of the molecule indicating that the antibacterial activity may persist in these initial intermediates therefore further studies are required to screen or examine the antimicrobial activities of ros oxidation products see ge et al 2018 4 conclusion this study provides a detailed examination of the aqueous photooxidation of nine widely detected sulfonamide antibiotics sas and shows that photochemical behavior can be greatly influenced by the prevailing major dissociated forms of the sas in question the oxidation kinetics of sas towards oh and 1o2 were found to be dependent on ph which was attributable to the disparate reactivities of individual sa protonated states among the three dissociated forms hsas0 or sas were more highly reactive towards oh in most cases while sas reacted the fastest with 1o2 for the majority of the sas the expected environmental half lives in sunlit surface waters suggested that 1o2 oxidation can be a central factor in determining the fate of sas especially in waters with a ph 7 with oh oxidation also contributing appreciably to phototransformation relative to direct photolysis moreover the three reactions involved different primary transformation pathways and the creation of multiple intermediates unlike direct photodegradation 1o2 oxidation preferred to occur at the sites of the amino moiety whereas oh reaction experienced multi site oxidation with phenyl hydroxylation prevailing as the major pathway many of these primary photo byproducts still retained the core chemical structure of the parent sa which suggests that these compounds may present similar ecotoxicity and antibacterial activity as the parent chemicals acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21577029 and 41476084 and china scholarship council scholarship 201704180014 and

19150,sulfonamide antibiotics sas are increasingly detected as aquatic contaminants and exist as different dissociated species depending on the ph of the water their removal in sunlit surface waters is governed by photochemical transformation here we report a detailed examination of the hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 mediated photooxidation of nine sas sulfamethoxazole sulfisoxazole sulfamethizole sulfathiazole sulfamethazine sulfamerazine sulfadiazine sulfachloropyridazine and sulfadimethoxine both oh and 1o2 oxidation kinetics varied depending on the dominant protonated states of the sa in question h2sas hsas0 and sas as a function of ph based on competition kinetic experiments and matrix deconvolution calculations hsas0 or sas ph 5 8 were observed to be more highly reactive towards oh while sas ph 8 react the fastest with 1o2 for most of the sas tested using the empirically derived rates of reaction for the speciated forms at different phs the environmental half lives were determined using typical 1o2 and oh concentrations observed in the environment this approach suggests that photochemical 1o2 oxidation contributes more than oh oxidation and direct photolysis to the overall phototransformation of sas in sunlit waters based on the identification of key photointermediates using tandem mass spectrometry 1o2 oxidation generally occurred at the amino moiety on the molecule whereas oh reaction experienced multi site hydroxylation both these reactions preserve the basic parent structure of the compounds and raise concerns that the routes of phototransformation give rise to intermediates with similar antimicrobial potency as the parent sas we therefore recommend that these phototransformation pathways are included in risk assessments concerning the presence and fate of sas in waste and surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfonamides dissociated forms photodegradation oxidation kinetics transformation products 1 introduction the occurrence transformation and risks of antibiotics in aquatic systems are well acknowledged environmental issues and have raised particular concerns baena nogueras et al 2017 luo et al 2011 sulfonamides sas are a large class of antibiotics that are widely used in human treatments animal husbandry and aquaculture managaki et al 2007 due to their incomplete elimination by metabolism campagnolo et al 2002 and wastewater treatment chen et al 2013 sas enter the environment continually and are regularly detected as aqueous micropollutants their presence in surface waters has been reported in many countries including the united states kolpin et al 2002 europe loos et al 2009 vietnam managaki et al 2007 and china luo et al 2011 concentrations in surface waters can vary quite widely with mean concentrations observed to range from 0 1 to 150 8 ng l 1 in the coastal waters of china through a variety of recent monitoring studies see fig s1 and associated references there is evidence of ecotoxicological effects of sas on freshwater biota with sas also promoting bacterial resistance białk bielińska et al 2011 2017 zhang et al 2015 interestingly exposure to sunlight appears to enhance the toxicities of sas towards several aquatic organisms such as d magna jung et al 2008 trovó et al 2009b and vibrio fischeri xu et al 2014 and this reflects the toxicity exhibited by other photo transformed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones ge et al 2010 2018 sas may undergo different transformation processes including photodegradation and biodegradation however in sunlit surface waters photodegradation has been identified as the major transformation pathway carstens et al 2013 specifically sas can undergo direct photodegradation as well as sensitized indirect photoprocesses such as oxidation reactions with hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen 1o2 and other reactive oxygen species ros boreen et al 2004 2005 li et al 2018 in sunlit surface waters oh and 1o2 are ubiquitous in waters and serve as the most important transient photooxidants leading to the oxidative degradation of aqueous organic micropollutants cooper et al 1989 vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 they are generated from sunlight induced reactions involving common water constituents such as dissolved organic matter dom nitrate ions and fe iii furthermore the environmental photochemical processes of sas can also be affected by the presence of other water constituents such as halide ions hco3 and cu2 ions guerard et al 2009 li et al 2016 2018 niu et al 2013a as the molecular structures of sas contain two ionisable groups i e nh2 and nh their various dissociated forms are expected to influence their photochemical behavior boreen et al 2004 wei et al 2013 although the behavior of the various dissociated forms is not well understood previous studies have demonstrated separate phototransformation kinetics of different dissociated species for specific compounds in various classes of antibiotics such as tetracyclines niu et al 2013b werner et al 2006 fluoroquinolones ge et al 2015 wei et al 2013 and sas boreen et al 2004 2005 willach et al 2018 although for sas direct photodegradation rather than ros photooxidation has been the focus to date for direct photodegradation the anionic neutral and cationic species of sas have different quantum yields φ and rate constants k and the most photoreactive component varies depending on the sa under investigation bonvin et al 2013 boreen et al 2004 2005 niu et al 2013a xu et al 2014 without considering the protonation state sas react with oh at a mean rate k of 5 3 109 m 1 s 1 and their 1o2 oxidation k ranges over 4 orders of magnitude 104 108 boreen et al 2004 2005 the different protonation states are expected to react with ros at different reactivities however the ros photooxidation kinetics of the different dissociation species has received little attention in the literature furthermore to apportion the relative contributions of the photooxidation to the fate of sas the corresponding environmental half lives in surface waters need to be assessed based on the distribution of the speciated forms and the ambient water conditions a thorough understanding of the transformation routes via ros photooxidation of sas is important for the overall assessment of their aquatic fate and to understand the relative importance of this phototransfromation pathway compared to direct photodegradation to date only several intermediates have been identified for selected sas for the oxidation reaction with oh in advanced oxidation processes batista et al 2014 du et al 2018 hu et al 2007 trovó et al 2009a the oh can induce multihydroxylation of the aniline moiety and cleavage of heterocyclic rings batista et al 2014 hu et al 2007 shah and hao 2017 as for 1o2 oxidation some relevant mechanisms have been proposed for example a 2 2 cycloaddition of 1o2 on isoxazole rings was speculated for sas containing five membered heterocyclic groups boreen et al 2004 furthermore 1o2 tends to oxidate electron rich compounds such as anilines dialkyl sulfides pyrroles and phenolate anions mill 1999 these previous studies provide a useful rationale to further investigate ros photooxidation of sas in an environmental context the purpose of this study was to investigate the ros i e oh and 1o2 oxidation kinetics of sas and compare the oxidation products and kinetics with those formed from direct photodegradation the nine sas selected in the study are widely used and commonly reported in aquatic environments chen et al 2013 kolpin et al 2002 luo et al 2011 managaki et al 2007 importantly the oxidation kinetics and reactivities were examined for the various dissociated forms which in turn are dependent on the ambient ph ros induced transformation pathways are currently under represented in the literature and yet may account for a signficant proportion of phototransformation of sas in surface waters this has important implications for how we assess their fate and undertake environmental risk assessments for this group of chemicals 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials four sas containing the five membered heterocyclic groups and five sas containing the six membered heterocyclic groups were selected as model compounds for the study fig 1 including sulfamethoxazole smx sulfisoxazole six sulfamethizole smt sulfathiazole st sulfamethazine smz sulfamerazine sm sulfadiazine sd sulfachloropyridazine scp and sulfadimethoxine sdm as described in table s1 the nine sas were purchased from different suppliers all the compounds as received were at least 98 purity furfuryl alcohol ffa 98 and perinaphthenone 97 were obtained from j k technology co ltd and sigma aldrich respectively hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 was purchased from acros organics methanol trifluoroacetic acid and acetophenone ap were of hplc grade and other reagents such as phosphates were of guaranteed grade and used as received all solutions were prepared in ultrapure water obtained from a millipore milli q system 2 2 photochemical experiments a merry go round reactor with quartz tubes 50 ml volume and 20 mm diameter containing reaction solutions was used to perform photochemical experiments under irradiation of a water refrigerated 500 w high pressure mercury lamp the light intensities at the solutions were 1 95 mw cm 2 at 365 nm and 1 83 mw cm 2 at 420 nm measured by a uv spectral irradiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university the experimental setup and spectral irradiance are illustrated in figs s2 and s3 respectively competition kinetics were employed to determine the bimolecular rate constants k ros i e k oh and k 1o2 for the reactions between sas and oh according to eq 1 1 k r o s s i n s t s 0 i n r t r 0 k r o s r where s is the substrate sas r is a reference compound and the square brackets represent the concentrations the method has been used successfully to examine the oh 1o2 reactivifties of pharmaceuticals and other environmental organic contaminants boreen et al 2004 edhlund et al 2006 wei et al 2015 xie et al 2013 the initial concentration of individual sas was set at 10 μm hydroxyl radicals oh were generated through the addition of h2o2 100 mm with a 340 nm cut off filter surrounding the hg lamp light source acetophenone 10 μm was spiked into the reaction solution as the reference compound with k oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 edhlund et al 2006 for the 1o2 reaction experiments 380 nm cut off filters were used for the light source with perinaphthenone 20 μm and furfuryl alcohol 20 μm as the photosensitizer and reference compound k 1o2 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 respectively perinaphthenone is often used to photogenerate 1o2 with a quantum yield close to unity boreen et al 2008 han et al 2008 latch et al 2003 oliveros et al 1991 schmidt et al 1994 the 1o2 reaction solutions were pre aerated to be saturated with dissolved oxygen the ph of the reaction solutions ph 2 5 and 8 was adjusted to the desired value using phosphate buffers all the competition kinetic experiments with controls were conducted in triplicate 2 3 matrix deconvolution calculation the ros oxidation rate constants k ros i for sa protonation states i were calculated using matrix deconvolution methods based on previous studies boreen et al 2004 2005 werner et al 2006 and used successfully by our group in a previous study on ionisable fluoroquinolones ge et al 2018 for each sa the individual k oh i or k 1o2 i of the fully protonated h2sas neutral hsas0 and anionic forms sas were fitted according to the following matrix 1 2 δ h 2 s a s δ h s a s 0 δ s a s k r o s h 2 s a s k r o s h s a s 0 k r o s s a s k r o s p h 8 p h 2 where δ i represents the fraction of each dissociated form and the values are referred to in fig s4 k ros is k oh or k 1o2 of sas at different ph and k ros h2sas k ros sas are the k oh i or k 1o2 i of the three sa forms to be fitted 2 4 analytical determination a waters uplc with pda detector fitted with a beh c18 column was employed for the separation and quantification of sas acetophenone and furfuryl alcohol in the irradiated samples which were collected from the reactor and spiked with methanol oh quencher or nan3 1o2 quencher to identify intermediates irradiated solutions 2 l for each sample was purified by solid phase extraction and then analyzed by an agilent hplc coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in both positive and negative modes the analytical details are provided in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 ros oxidation kinetics under different ph in the control experiments the losses of sas and reference compounds either under dark or in the absence of the ros photosensitizer were 2 thus degradation by direct photolytic thermal and hydrolytic processes was considered negligible during the duration of the photochemical experiments 2 h however when exposed to light irradiation in the competition kinetic experiments the sas disappeared quickly indicating that the sas were photooxidised efficiently by ros the oxidative degradation curve of smz as an example is provided in fig s5 the values for the bimolecular reaction rate constants of the nine sas with oh k oh and 1o2 k 1o2 in pure water are listed in tables s2 and s3 the k oh ranged from 5 00 0 77 109 m 1 s 1 for sm to 9 16 1 66 109 m 1 s 1 for smt while the k 1o2 ranged from 2 31 0 06 107 m 1 s 1 for smx to 1 34 0 15 109 m 1 s 1 for scp the k oh values were larger than k 1o2 indictive of the higher reactivity of oh with the various sa compounds however considering that the steady state concentrations of 1o2 can be three orders of magnitude higher than that of oh cooper et al 1989 mill 1999 1o2 may be more important than oh in the attenuation of sas in sunlit waters in comparison with other antibiotics the k oh values of sas fall in the same order of magnitude as the fluoroquinolones ge et al 2015 santoke et al 2009 tetracyclines jeong et al 2010 and nitrofurans edhlund et al 2006 however the k 1o2 of sas are 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than those observed for the other antibiotics castillo et al 2007 edhlund et al 2006 wei et al 2015 this notable difference of k 1o2 among antibiotics can be attributed to the higher selectivity of 1o2 than that of oh to oxidize organic chemicals keen and linden 2013 larson and weber 1996 mill 1999 yao et al 2013 oh can oxidize almost all classes of organic chemicals keen and linden 2013 li et al 2014 mill 1999 whereas 1o2 is more sensitive to electron rich chemicals such as sulfides and phenols larson and weber 1996 mill 1999 since aqueous sas can undergo two acid base dissociation processes fig s4 the ros oxidation reactivity of each sa is expected to depend on its speciation at a given ph value to quantify the reactivity of each protonation state towards oh and 1o2 the k oh and k 1o2 were determined for three different phs the results are illustrated in fig 2 and the corresponding values are provided in tables s2 and s3 it is found that both k oh and k 1o2 are dependent on ph p 0 05 with generally higher values of k oh at ph 5 and ph 8 than at ph 2 although six was the exception to this displaying the fastest reactivity at ph 2 similarly the reactivity of 1o2 oxidation was fastest for seven of the sas at ph 8 while only two sas six and scp had the fastest kinetics at ph 2 and ph 5 respectively the higher reactivity of six at ph 2 suggests that the reactive site might be the dimethylisoxazole moiety towards oh and 1o2 at the lower ph for smx with its monomethylisoxazole moiety dimethylation of the isoxazole ring significantly increases the electron density of this ring dogan et al 1990 making six more susceptible to ros attack particularly to 1o2 oxidation fig 2 the effect of ph on the 1o2 oxidation kinetics was more significant than the reaction with oh for example the k 1o2 values showed a 1 3 to 11 2 fold variation mean 4 5 over the ph range while k oh showed a 1 5 to 4 3 fold variation mean 2 2 the k oh and k 1o2 values reported here compare favourably to an earlier study examining the photochemical fate of sas boreen et al 2004 2005 in this case k 1o2 was only measured at ph 10 2 carbonate buffered solution and k oh at ph 3 fenton system with k 1o2 for smt reported as 5 5 0 4 107 m 1 s 1 and k oh as 6 6 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 boreen et al 2004 2005 for other chemicals the ph effect resulting in different protonation states and their corresponding ros reactivities has been reported for fluoroquinolone antibiotics ge et al 2015 wei et al 2013 and hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers xie et al 2013 3 2 ros reactivities of different dissociated species as shown in fig 3 ros reactivities of sa dissociated species i are represented with the calculated bimolecular reaction rate constants k oh i and k 1o2 i their corresponding values are listed in tables s4 and s5 each sa showed variable ros reactivities for the different dissociated forms h2sas to sas with the exception of six the other eight sas in their neutral hsas0 or anionic sas forms were more highly reactive towards oh whereas most of the sas other than six and scp showed the fastest reaction with 1o2 in their anionic form sas compared with oh oxidation the 1o2 reaction activities varied by several orders of magnitude across the various speciated forms of the different sas e g h2sas to sas the proportion of each form is dependent on the ph e g 2 to 8 increasing ph enhances the deprotonation and electron density of the reactive aniline moiety which in turn increases the electron donating ability and decreases the steric hindrance thus making the aniline more vulnerable toward ros oxidant radical attack dodd et al 2006 jiao et al 2008 wei et al 2013 for example the aniline moiety in smx makes this compound more susceptible to electrophilic o3 attack particularly following deprotonation experienced at higher phs dodd et al 2006 for emerging micropollutants including antibiotics a database of k ros i values was constructed to describe the reactivities of their different protonated states towards oh and 1o2 table s6 this table includes the k oh i and k 1o2 i for sas from this study as well as values for a selection of ionisable antibiotics flame retardants and other relevant chemicals of environmental concern similar to the sas investigated here anionic forms of all other chemicals react faster with 1o2 than neutral or cationic forms tetracyclines in their neutral or anionic forms were more highly reactive towards oh however fluoroquinolones in their neutral form showed higher reactivities of oh than in their protonated cationic and anionic forms ge et al 2015 2018 while anionic ho pbdes were oxidised faster by oh than the neutral forms xie et al 2013 these ros reactive patterns coupled to the dominant speciated form of the chemical are of importance for the fate assessment of the ionisable pollutants that usually coexist with oh and 1o2 in surface waters 3 3 photooxidation half lives in surface waters in sunlit surface waters the photoinduced oh and 1o2 radicals are the most important transient oxidants cooper et al 1989 vione et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 their concentrations ros range from 10 17 to 10 15 m and from 10 15 to 10 12 m respectively cooper et al 1989 mill 1999 based on ros reactivities of dissociated sa species the corresponding environmental half lives t 1 2 ros e i e t 1 2 oh e and t 1 2 1o2 e at a specific ph can be calculated according to eq 2 3 3 k r o s e r o s δ i k r o s i 4 t 1 2 r o s e i n 2 k r o s e where k ros e is the environmental rate constant of sas towards oh or 1o2 k ros i represents k oh i or k 1o2 i and δ i values i e the fraction of each dissociated form are taken from fig s4 the calculation method takes into account the acid base dissociation of sas and the ph dependent kinetics of ros oxidation and is also applicable for the calculation of the t 1 2 ros e of other dissolved ionisable organic pollutants previous studies have tended to assess the t 1 2 ros e without considering the ph difference between laboratory solutions and surface waters boreen et al 2004 2005 as shown in table 1 the calculated values of t 1 2 oh e and t 1 2 1o2 e for the nine sas range from 14 62 h to 39 23 h and from 0 06 h to 2 22 h respectively to assess the importance of the photooxidation on the fate of sas t 1 2 ros e values were compared with direct photolytic half lives t 1 2 d e of sas in near surface waters boreen et al 2004 2005 for individual sas t 1 2 1o2 e are considerably shorter than t 1 2 oh e and t 1 2 d e indicating that oxidation of sas towards 1o2 can be a central factor in their environmental phototransformation even though oh is an unselective highly reactive species the environmental fate of sas is likely not controlled by the reaction with oh which can be attributed to such low concentrations of oh in surface waters however since the t 1 2 oh e are comparable to t 1 2 d e in midsummer and less than t 1 2 d e in midwinter suggesting oh oxidation is also appreciable compared to direct photolysis furthermore the oh is expected to be more effective at degrading sas due to its non selectivity ge et al 2015 keen and linden 2013 li et al 2014 mill 1999 the values in table 1 represent the minimum expected half lives as these were calculated based on the highest ros levels and continual light irradiation although the phototransformation may be hindered by light scattering or limited photic zone depth apart from the photooxidation and direct photolysis sas may undergo solar photosensitized degradation via 3dom which is of significance in most waters boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 in addition concomitant metal ions can also influence the photochemical behavior of sas by complexation effects shah et al 2015 wei et al 2015 thus to better understand the environmental photochemical fate of sas further studies are needed to study specific water bodies and examine the effects of non continuous solar exposure water depth and other aqueous constituents that may attenuate or absorb sunlight bodrato and vione 2014 3 4 ros oxidation intermediates and pathways four sas comprising of six st smz and scp were selected to investigate their phototransformation byproducts and deduce their main transformation pathways based on the three different reactions including 1o2 and oh oxidation as well as direct photolysis we identified 21 significant intermediates generated from their photooxidation all details on the identification of these photoproducts are shown in table s7 including chromatographic retention times molecular weight m w as well as mass spectral parent and fragment ions m z the corresponding ms and ms2 mass spectra in positive ionisation mode are displayed in fig s6 referring to the nitrogen rule and the analytical approaches in previous studies baena nogueras et al 2017 sági et al 2015 chemical structures were proposed and tentative phototransformation pathways for the four sas are presented in fig 4 there are three types of transformation pathways paths 1 3 corresponding to the three different reactions of each sa fig 4 among the 1o2 oxidation reactions path 1 complexes occur through r group addition at the sulfonyl n n1 site for sas containing five membered heterocyclic substituents whereas sas with six membered heterocyclic groups experience an oxidation at the amino n n11 site as for transformation products with molecular weight of 352 tp352a tp352b the r groups involve one nitrogen atom tp292 of smz generated from the addition of 1o2 to amino n and other moieties of smz were not transformed due to the detection of main fragment ions with m z 186 and 124 fig s6 sági et al 2015 a 1o2 oxidative product similar to tp292 was also reported for sulfapyridine xu et al 2014 besides li et al 2015 revealed that n1 and n11 are also the reaction sites for the reactions of sd with excited triplet state of dom proxies boreen et al 2004 speculated that the electron rich alkene in the isoxazole ring would be susceptible to singlet oxygenation for six however the corresponding products were not detected in path 2 fig 4 the reaction of oh radicals to each sa generated diverse hydroxylated products which involved multiple photooxidation pathways phenyl hydroxylation heterocyclic hydroxylation and cleavage as well as amino n oxidation and removal these multi pathways can be prioritized based on the by product abundance in the total ion chromatograms tp283 tp271 tp294a and tp300b showed optimal responses respectively for the four sas suggesting that phenyl hydroxylation is the most prevalent pathway this can be attributed to the electron rich aniline moiety that favors the hydroxylation which in turn promotes further oh addition i e multihydroxylation batista et al 2014 shah and hao 2017 in comparison hydroxylated heterocyclic reactions can be considered as minor or secondary pathways which generated products with small responses tp255 tp289 tp294b and tp310 hu et al also detected similar hydroxy intermediates for uva tio2 photocatalyzed smx degradation hu et al 2007 though some intermediates were not identified oh could induce the cleavage of c s and n s bonds thereby generating low molecular mass photo byproducts and leading ultimately to the full mineralisation of these pollutants into co2 h2o and other inorganic compounds batista et al 2014 hu et al 2007 in path 3 fig 4 direct photodegradation occurs through a cleavage at various positions for sas containing five membered heterocyclic groups with sulfanilic acid tp173 being observed as a common byproduct boreen et al 2004 however sas containing six membered heterocyclic substituents are primarily transformed to desulfonation products tp214 and tp220 with the loss of so2 boreen et al 2005 the so2 extrusion can be attributed to aromatic nucleophilic substitution of an aniline radical cation and subsequent smiles rearrangement tentscher et al 2013 except for the primary pathways more direct photolytic intermediates and processes have also been reported for several sas including st niu et al 2017 smx baena nogueras et al 2017 smz and sulfapyridine garcía galán et al 2012 as well as their human metabolites bonvin et al 2013 garcía galán et al 2012 finally the knowledge aquired through deducing the reaction pathways provides fundamental insights into the photochemical fate of sas in turn this will allow the evaluation of the phototransformation of sas during wastewater treatment and the wider aquatic environment as part of a detailed risk assessment process the distinct pathways of sas during reaction with oh would support the understanding of relevant mechanisms in advanced oxidation processes where oh is dominant such as uv fenton trovó et al 2009a tio2 photocatalysis yang et al 2010 and fe0 bisulfite o2 systerms du et al 2018 interestingly compared to direct photolysis that generally leads to photoproducts of low antimicrobial potency niu et al 2017 ros photooxidation of the sas does not initially destroy the core backbone structure of the molecule indicating that the antibacterial activity may persist in these initial intermediates therefore further studies are required to screen or examine the antimicrobial activities of ros oxidation products see ge et al 2018 4 conclusion this study provides a detailed examination of the aqueous photooxidation of nine widely detected sulfonamide antibiotics sas and shows that photochemical behavior can be greatly influenced by the prevailing major dissociated forms of the sas in question the oxidation kinetics of sas towards oh and 1o2 were found to be dependent on ph which was attributable to the disparate reactivities of individual sa protonated states among the three dissociated forms hsas0 or sas were more highly reactive towards oh in most cases while sas reacted the fastest with 1o2 for the majority of the sas the expected environmental half lives in sunlit surface waters suggested that 1o2 oxidation can be a central factor in determining the fate of sas especially in waters with a ph 7 with oh oxidation also contributing appreciably to phototransformation relative to direct photolysis moreover the three reactions involved different primary transformation pathways and the creation of multiple intermediates unlike direct photodegradation 1o2 oxidation preferred to occur at the sites of the amino moiety whereas oh reaction experienced multi site oxidation with phenyl hydroxylation prevailing as the major pathway many of these primary photo byproducts still retained the core chemical structure of the parent sa which suggests that these compounds may present similar ecotoxicity and antibacterial activity as the parent chemicals acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21577029 and 41476084 and china scholarship council scholarship 201704180014 and

19151,the effect of turbulence on phytoplankton growth has been widely studied however its effects with respects to suspended particulate matter spm on the development of phytoplankton communities and the behavioral responses of phytoplankton to turbulence and spm are poorly understood here an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system ahts mainly consisting of an oscillating grid apparatus was established to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying phytoplankton community responses in turbid well mixed waters the results revealed that maintaining the turbulence dissipation rates ɛ of 2 25 10 3 and 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 caused significant reductions in algal density and the effects could be substantially enhanced when 500 mg l of spm were added before day 12 in contrast to the constant decrease of algal density for the ɛ of 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 a dramatic increase in the phytoplankton density occurred after 16 days of incubation for a ɛ of 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 irrespective of spm addition of spm in the ɛ of 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 treatments did not considerably affect the algal density profile compared to that without spm of which unicellular algae decreased and colonial algae dominated the phytoplankton community on the other hand the phytoplankton can regulate the spm properties during the 18 days coincubation extracellular polymeric substances eps released from algal cells induced larger particle sizes and round surfaces of spm which can reduce the damage received to algal cells here we demonstrated that the phytoplankton communities could actively counteract the effects of turbulence spm and adapt the couple stress jointly through the release of eps the modification of spm surface properties and the conversion of their assemblage pattern thereby contributing to rebalance the ecosystem these findings highlight the strategies employed during the reconstruction of phytoplankton under the dual effects of turbulence and spm for the first time consequently enabling the forecasting of the dominant species of phytoplankton in turbulent waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords suspended particulate matter turbulence phytoplankton succession turbulent

2010 it is widely reported that phytoplankton communities can be regulated not only by physical and chemical parameters such as temperature nutrients ph transparency and illumination çelekli et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 but also by hydrodynamic alternations for example flow velocity inflow and turbulence choi et al 2017 machado et al 2014 rao et al 2017 hydrodynamic conditions play an essential role in the growth and motion of algae fouxon and leshansky 2015 sengupta et al 2017 numerous studies concerning the effects of hydrodynamics on the growth and physiological activities of algae have been conducted and have provided useful information turbulence a ubiquitous hydrodynamic feature of all inland waters and a highly variable environmental parameter was generated at the surface or by natural processes moreover turbulence is also a highly variable environmental parameter changing in both time and space over many orders of magnitude it was found that the turbulent energy dissipation rate ɛ m2 s3 which describes the rate at which the turbulent energy decays over time was in the range of 6 01 10 8 2 39 10 4 m2 s3 in taihu zhu et al 2017 and in the large shallow lake balaton in

were thought to be realistic levels when compared to the range of 10 6 m2 s3 to 10 3 m2 s3 reported for a straight lowland river sukhodolov et al 1998 turbulence was discovered to have a controlling influence on the movement and distribution of phytoplankton jumars et al 2009 it was confirmed that small scale turbulence promoted the growth rate of selenastrum capricornutum and increased algal density in the water column warnaars and hondzo 2006 recently it was revealed that turbulence could influence microcystis growth by changing the phosphorus absorption capacity zheng et al 2017 it was also found that hydrodynamic shifts could benefit phytoplankton growth by changing the nutrient environment around algae cells and enhancing nutrient absorption guasto et al 2012 warnaars and hondzo 2006 on the other hand turbulence was often deleterious to motile phytoplankton elisa et al 2007 due to the breakage of the flagella or body wall reduction of lipid production and impairment of organelle function thomas and gibson 1990 many previous studies were performed concerning the responses of several specific algae species to hydrodynamic alternation recently it was found that flow regimes were linked to the reshaping of phytoplankton community compositions qu et al 2018 in the three gorges reservoir tgr of china hydrologic regimes were also demonstrated to be the main driving force in the succession of the phytoplankton community zhu et al 2013 these studies indicated that the hydrodynamic alternations are likely to have a key regulatory role on algal communities nevertheless it should be noted that the existing studies regarding the role of hydrodynamics condition on phytoplankton growth incorporate the consequence of multiple hydrodynamics properties including velocity shear stress as well as turbulence intensity and the three processes coupled with each other simultaneously kundu et al 2016 making it difficult to distinguish the individual effects on phytoplankton aubry et al 2017 macias et al 2013 one of the reasons for these results may be due to the lack of appropriate instrumentation for simulating the turbulence in natural aquatic ecosystems hondzo and warnaars 2015 xue et al 2016 another issue that needs to be addressed is that hydrodynamics often leads to changes in environmental parameters such as promoting the resuspension of sediment matisoff et al 2017 sediment resuspension by wind induced turbulence is a common characteristic in many shallow lakes schallenberg and burns 2004 and rivers he et al 2018 in a shallow lake in denmark the amount of suspended solids increased by 5 10 times in a few days during two events of increasing wind induced turbulence søndergaard et al 2003 the suspended particulate matter spm content was also considerably affected by the hydrodynamics conditions particularly water velocity our recent study confirmed that the spatiotemporal variability of spm content is largely associated with hydrological alternation which can affect the density and distribution of chlorella pyrenoidosa through nutrient adsorption light attenuation and migration of spm algae heteroaggregations he et al 2017 the available studies benefit our understanding on the effect of hydrological properties on algae growth or community succession however to the best of our knowledge how the phytoplankton communities respond particularly associated with the concomitant spm collision in turbulent waters remains to be explored from the perspective of algae spm interactions to address these knowledge gaps an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system ahts was employed in this study to generate the turbulence and examine the response of phytoplankton communities under the dual stressors including spm and turbulence intensity here we emphasize the active tactics of phytoplankton responding to the dual stress and the purpose of this study is to clarify the influence of turbulence associate with spm on phytoplankton community composition and the strategies underlying phytoplankton responses 2 materials and methods 2 1 toxin standards and reagents mcs standards mc rr were

constant weight deionized water was obtained using a milli q filtration system millipore bedford ma the spm was characterized using optical microscope imaging leica dmlb germany particle size distribution psd mastersizer 2000 england and fourier transformation infrared absorption spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 america 2 3 incubation experiment the ɛ value in this study was employed according to our in situ assessment of three dimensional flow velocity of the yulin river using a multi static acoustic doppler velocity profiler vectrino ii nortek as norway the in situ assessment of the flow velocity was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the yulin river monthly from april to september the flood season 2017 during this time the sediment resuspension could be largely enhanced and the average content of spm reached nearly 500 mg l the measured velocity time series were loaded in matlab and filtered then a coordinate rotation forcing the mean values of the vertical and transversal velocity components to zero to account for any misalignments of the probe head the root mean square velocity u which helps define the characteristic speed of the turbulence is estimated from the velocity variance in all three velocity components u v w as follows risse buhl et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 1 u u 2 v 2 w 2 then the ɛ value is deduced from u m s using the following formula lawrence 1997 yokosi 1967 zhou et al 2016 2 ε a u 3 l where a is a dimensional constant of order and l is the depth m of the water column describing the size of the largest vortices the in situ measurement of ε showed that the value ranged from 2 25 10 3 to 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 in the yulin river during the flood season of tgr during which the water flow and velocity were substantially higher than those during other periods therefore the ε value in this study is environmentally relevant therefore the minimum and maximum ε values obtained from the in situ assessment were used in this microcosm study the laboratory simulation test concerning the effect of water turbulence on the phytoplankton community was performed in an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system ahts fig 1 the ahts was constructed by a reactor a transmission component a motor and a controller the reactor is a plexiglass cylinder with height of 31 cm and diameter of 20 cm the reactor has maximal capacities of 9 7 l a grid made from plexiglass bars with a mesh size distance between adjacent bars of about 15 mm was connected to the motor and moved repeatedly in the vertical direction so the water was pushed back and forth inside the reactor in a homogenous fluid a vertical oscillating grid produces vortices which diffuse and decay away from the grid generating a locally turbulent flow at 15 mm mesh size for the oscillating grid the turbulence is purely diffusive almost isotropic and laterally homogenous with a zero mean flow lucas et al 2016 vertically suspended fluorescent lights were used to illuminate the ahts with a light dark ratio of 12 12 h the ε value was acquired though manipulation of the grid oscillation distance and frequency and was estimated following a previous literature michallet and mory 2004 as follows 3 ε 0 45 f 3 s 2 s m where f is the grid oscillation frequency s is the vertical oscillation distance and m is the grid mesh size distance between adjacent bars each reactor was filled with 7 l of water which was filtered through an 80 μm mesh to allow phytoplankton to pass through but exclude zooplankton symons et al 2012 the phytoplankton in the raw water was composed of cyanobacteria chlorophyceae bacillariophyceae and euglenophyceae with an initial algae density of 8 21 109 cells l in each reactor and the intracellular and extracellular mc rr content was 19 50 μg g and 0 59 μg l respectively the 15 ahtss containing the same volume of water including algae were divided into three groups the ε value in three ahtss was set to be zero control static water the ε value in six ahtss was adjusted to 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 lower turbulence dissipation rate l in short among which spm was added to three ahtss l spm in short the ε value in another six ahtss was set at 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 high turbulence dissipation rate h in short and spm was added into three of them h spm in short the spm concentration in the ahtss was maintained at 500 mg l the experimental treatments are described in table 1 the ahtss were operated under controlled laboratory conditions that remained constant throughout the study 25 c under 3300 lx and a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle 2 4 sample collection and preparation phytoplankton was sampled below 11 cm of the water surface middle of the water column and was quantified every 2 days using a light microscope olympus bx 53 at 400 magnification colonies were counted as cells and the total number of algal cells in the colony was determined using the algacount t300 system shineso technology co ltd hangzhou china phytoplankton species were identified according to their morphological traits at the initial and after 18 days of the incubation the algal assemblage patterns unicellular colonial were enumerated in random fields and at least 200 individuals of the most frequent species were counted to calculate the percentage of each size group of each morphospecies li et al 2018 mc rr was determined at the start and end of the experiment as described below 1l water samples were applied to a preconditioned octadecylsilyl ods cartridges after filtration through a gff membrane and then the toxins were eluted with 100 methanol and evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator büch germany the residual were re dissolved with 1 ml of 90 methanol and stored at 20 c until determination with respect to intracellular mc rr the water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm filters to obtain the algal cells which were then freeze dried and extracted using a 5 v v acetic acid with ultrasonication 300w 5 min for three times after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 mins the supernatant was collected and followed by application to an ods cartridge as was described above after 18 days of incubation the spm were collected through centrifuging at 3000 rpm 10 min to separate the particles and algal cells and then the spm were characterized as mentioned in section 2 2 2 5 mcs determination an hplc analysis was performed using a shimadzu lc 10a system with two lc 10a pumps and a uv detector the elution conditions were 60 solution a 100 methanol and 40 solution b 0 05 m kh2po4 ph 3 at a flow rate of 1 ml min using a shimadzu gasketing clo ods 6 0 150 column the column temperature was maintained at 40 c and the injection volume was 10 μl the limit of quantitation is 0 02 g l the detailed information was available in our previous literature he et al 2018 2 6 statistical analysis statistically significant differences between the treatments were compared using the one way and two way analysis of variance anova to test for differences between the means of the control and treatments a comparison with a p value 0 05 was considered significantly different 3 results 3 1 phytoplankton density in the controls there were dramatic decreases of algal density before the 10th day of incubation while abrupt increases occurred after day 12 fig 2 similarly the phytoplankton density in the turbulence and turbulence spm treatments were consistently reduced before day 12 however with the increasing turbulence dissipation rate from 2 25 10 3 to 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 the reduction rate of the phytoplankton density was significantly depressed p 0 05 in the l treatments the reduction of algal density showed a slight decrease when spm was introduced in contrast in the h treatments the addition of spm deteriorated algal growth by 1 36 folds in comparison to the h treatments however the algal density showed an abrupt increase at day 16 in h and h spm and the density reached approximately 5 30 109 cells l insignificant difference between h and h spm treatments in comparison to the l treatment the l spm treatment favored algal growth to some extent however the growth rate declined by the end of the experiment and the maximum algal density remained at 3 49 109 cells l fig 2 3 2 phytoplankton species and assemblage pattern the phytoplankton population in water samples was primarily composed of 4 phyla cyanobacteria chlorophyceae bacillariophyceae and euglenophyceae during the experimental period we identified a total of 20 algae species which belonged to cyanobacteria 5 genera chlorophyceae 9 genera bacillariophyceae 5 genera and euglenophyceae 1 genus after 18 days of incubation the algae species reduced to 13 11 12 and 11 in l l spm h and h spm treatments respectively cyanobacteria microcystis sp and nodularia sp and chlorophyceae chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were the most representative phytoplankton in all treatments during the study period however the community compositions were largely altered with the extending of the incubation times fig 3 a revealed that microcystis sp and chlorella sp dominated in the raw water while on day 18 the abundance of microcystis sp increased by approximately 38 in the control while the dominant algae species turned to scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp in the turbulent treatments the proportion of scenedesmus sp in the l treatment were approximately 1 91 1 1 and 1 87 times higher than that of chlorella sp in the l spm h and h spm treatments respectively increasing the turbulence dissipation rate from 2 25 10 3 to 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 resulted in an increase in the prevalence of scenedesmus sp in the reactor which could be further enhanced once spm was added the proportion of scenedesmus sp in the spm added treatments 52 67 and 62 69 for l spm and h spm respectively significantly exceeded those without spm 17 99 and 42 57 for l and h respectively fig 3a the results indicated that scenedesmus sp could tolerate the harsh environment induced by turbulence and spm the structure of phytoplankton communities was further illustrated by the assemblage patterns in the 5 treatments fig 3b in the raw water the number of cells in colonial algal species mainly microcystis sp fig 3c was nearly equivalent to that of the unicellular mainly chlorella sp fig 3d after 18 days incubation the algal assembly patterns did not show obvious changes in the control however in the turbulence or turbulence spm treatments there was a remarkable impact on the phytoplankton assemblage pattern at the end of the study despite the lower turbulence dissipation rate affecting the proportion of unicellular algae the increase in the turbulence dissipation rate induced changes in the species composition and scenedesmus sp a colonial algae dominated the phytoplankton community fig 3e in contrast the abundance of microcystis sp and chlorella sp which were the main species at the beginning of the experiment were substantially depressed towards the end excluding that in the control fig 3a under the dual impact of turbulence and spm colonial phytoplankton can be largely induced and the effect was most obvious in the l spm treatments 3 3 spm characterization ftir analysis was performed to identify the major functional groups of inorganic and organic compounds of spm in turbulence spm treatments at the start and end of the study the bands in the ftir spectrum were assigned to be various functional groups of organic compounds proteins and polysaccharides and inorganic compounds clay according to the wavenumbers table 2 strong similarities among the ftir spectra were observed in l spm and h spm however large differences in the spectra appeared between the raw spm and that co incubated with algae it can be seen from fig 4 a that in l spm and h spm treatments the ftir spectra at 1 030 1646 and 3419 cm 1 were substantially enhanced in comparison to those without the incubation of algae the spectral region from 1000 to 1200 cm 1 was attributed from the stretching c o c vibrations of polysaccharides the distinct bands at approximately 1030 cm 1 were derived from carbohydrate adsorption and caused by the c o bonds included in polysaccharides the organic compounds mainly bands from 1200 to 1800 cm 1 li et al 2013 and 1646 cm 1 here presented in the spectra of l spm and h spm were attributed to the amide i c o stretching li et al 2013 which was almost absent from spm collected in situ indicating that the excretion of organic matter from algal cells can be considered as a function of turbulence plus spm in the spectral region varying from 3000 to 3700 cm 1 one prominent absorbance peak at approximately 3419 cm 1 could be related to oh or nh fig 4a in summary extracellular polymeric substances eps adhere to the spm surface causing peak shift and peak intensity differences before and after the experiment tang et al 2017 fig 4a the psd analysis revealed that the spm itself with a mean particle diameters of 11 71 μm and a median diameters of d 0 5 of 6 72 μm fig 4b did not adsorb eps and algal cells and that particle diameter belows 22 32 μm accounted for 90 of the total volume of the fraction in the l spm and h spm treatments the mean particle diameter of spm reached 75 64 μm and 72 68 μm after 18 days of incubations respectively which were 6 44 fold and 6 19 fold higher than that before the experiment possibly due to the adsorption of eps or algal cells and formation of aggregations the particle diameter largely increased with the increasing turbulence intensity and there were insignificant differences between the l spm and h spm treatments fig 4b from the optical microscope images we observed the surface reshaping process of spm in different treatments before and after the experiment each column in fig 5 presents the increase of spm size with the extending of the co incubation time moreover spm had a smaller particle sizes and sharper and more angular surfaces before the experiment figs 5a 1 a 2 a 3 after 18 days incubation the spm surfaces in the two treatments were largely altered and tended to be more intense and rounded likely due to the formation of spm eps algae aggregates during the incubation the alternation of spm surface property in l spm figs 5b 1 b 2 b 3 and h spm figs 5c 1 c 2 c 3 treatments clearly demonstrated that turbulence promoted the spm reshaping process fig 5 3 4 mc rr content before co incubation with spm the intracellular mc rr content at a level of 2 16 μg g and extracellular mc rr of 0 65 μg l were observed in the system while after 18 days the intracellular mc rr content were increased by nearly 7 folds in the control indicating the flourish of toxin producing microcystis fig 6 in turbulent treatments extracellular mc rr levels increased significantly with the enhancement of turbulence intensity and reached 1 34 and 2 64 μg l under the turbulence intensities of 2 25 10 3 and 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 respectively when spm was added into the systems the extracellular mc rr concentrations exhibited 3 4 h spm treatments and 2 1 l spm treatments fold increases in comparison to turbulence only suggesting that spm collisions were imperative in the breaking of algal cells this was supported by the significantly reduced p 0 05 intracellular mc rr contents in the spm added system 4 discussion 4 1 prompted changes of phytoplankton communities as functions of turbulence and spm a wide range factors in aquatic environments including turbulence mixing nutrient concentrations and spm content are responsible for controlling the growth and physiological activities of phytoplankton machado et al 2014 marisol et al 2018 marmorino et al 2017 phytoplankton density changes are also not controlled by individual factors but by a series of environmental parameters he et al 2017 heisler et al 2008 several efforts have been made to study the role of turbulence on phytoplankton growth the studied turbulence dissipation rate value and phytoplankton species are listed in table 3 while it is widely accepted that turbulence mixing plays a vital role in influencing the phytoplankton growth rate the evidence of how the phytoplankton reacted is not fully understood in a recent study the response of two algal species diatom and cyanobacteria under turbulent condition were documented and it was found that the turbulence was more beneficial for the growth of cyanobacteria zhou et al 2016 however the impact of turbulence on algae was species specific hondzo and wüest 2009 and the responses of the phytoplankton communities in natural aquatic environments would be more complicated in our study we compared the response of algal density and phytoplankton community structure between turbulent and static water the results showed that the motile algal species gathered at the water surface under static conditions which was responsible for a constant decrease of algal density in the middle of the water column fig 2 moreover the static water favored growth and microcystis dominated the phytoplankton community after 18 days incubation turbulence caused the uniform distribution of algal cells in the simulated system indicating that the vertical distribution of phytoplankton can be considerably affected by turbulence in the present study we emphasized the linkages between phytoplankton density community structure and turbulence as well as turbulence spm the results showed that thr high turbulence dissipation rate 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 associated with spm tended to favor algal community changes and algal growth more than the lower rate 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 fig 2 in turbulent without spm systems it was found that the increased turbulence dissipation rate was responsible for a greater phytoplankton growth rate wang et al 2012 due to the enhancement of the nutrients flux into algal cells zhou et al 2016 or the facilitation of algae cells to find the suitable light intensity and living space fraisse et al 2015 while the addition of spm may impair both the nutrient availability and light intensity thus the role of spm in shaping the growth profile of phytoplankton has not been clearly elucidated yet our recent study found that spm could affect chlorella pyrenoidosa growth through an integrated process including light attenuation nutrient adsorption and algae aggregation he et al 2017 however with respect to phytoplankton communities the requirements of optimal light or nutrients particularly for those impacted by spm may be different between algal species different turbulent dissipation rates spm in this study showed different effects on phytoplankton community structure cyanobacteria were gradually replaced by green algae communities during the experimental periods fig 3a during which the microcystis sp were remarkably depressed under turbulence or turbulence spm treatments the results agreed well with those of a previous study revealing that turbulence mixing can shift the competitive balance in phytoplankton species resulting in the replacement of cyanobacteria by green algae huisman et al 2004 microcystis sp were the most concerning harmful algal blooms habs species and our results demonstrated that turbulence could reduce the their density this occurred possibly because 1 turbulence can effectively reduce the colony size of microcystis sp li et al 2018 and 2 failure of competition with other algae in turbulent waters cyanobacteria with a gas vesicle can facilitate the proliferation of phytoplankton by increasing the nutrient flux and light absorption through migration in the water column however turbulence inhibited cyanobacteria migration and floating cyanobacteria lose their preponderance under turbulent conditions while most non motile green algae are favored by turbulence mixing for optimum nutrient and light conditions and then outcompete cyanobacteria these results suggest that cyanobacteria are relatively more sensitive to turbulence compared to other algal groups thomas and gibson 1990 when the spm was added to turbulent water the change of the phytoplankton community was substantially stimulated of which the abundance of scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp green algae was approximately 1 5 times higher in h spm than that in h only implying that the spm could favor the growth of green algae when the turbulence intensity was high the possible reason is that colonial microcystis sp are more prone to collisions with spm under higher turbulence intensity during which mechanical damage and even mortality of the algal cells may occurred this hypothesis can be supported by the variation of intra and extracellular mc rr levels fig 6 as shown in fig 6a extracellular mc rr concentrations released by toxin producing microcystis sp in turbulence spm treatments significantly exceeded that in the control l and h treatments p 0 05 corresponding to the dramatic decrease of intracellular mc rr content fig 6b this indicated that turbulence induced spm movement played a role in the destruction of algal cells and contributed to the dominance in the phytoplankton community of chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp similar results were also discovered in previous literature that demonstrated that the sensitivity to turbulence intensity varied among phytoplankton species cross et al 2014 4 2 assemblage patterns are helpful in reshaping phytoplankton communities another contributor for reshaping the phytoplankton community in our study is the assemblage pattern in our study the abundance of unicellular and colonial algal cells in the control was nearly the same before and after the incubation but the colonial form was prevalent under the turbulence spm treatments fig 3b our results differ from those found in a recent study that found that the colonies of m aeruginosa and m ichthyoblabe would be more susceptible to disaggregation from turbulent mixing than colonies of m wesenbergi when the turbulence dissipation rates were varied from 0 020 to 0 364 m2 s 3 li et al 2018 this is because unlike microcystis colonies phytoplankton communities are composed of microcystis sp nodularia sp chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp in this study and the composition of phytoplankton communities and the assemblage patterns should be related to each other not decoupled as the change in phytoplankton communities illustrated fig 3a scenedesmus dominated the phytoplankton which hence increased the abundance of colonial cells moreover an increase in the turbulence dissipation rate significantly prompted the proportion of colonial algae 23 66 and 54 at turbulence dissipation rate of 2 25 10 3 and 1 8 10 2 m2 s3 respectively in a previous study that evaluated the distribution of phytoplankton populations in a shallow coastal sea it was found that a reduction in the length of diatom chains occurred as a response of enhanced turbulence mixing cross et al 2014 a previous study found large microcystis colonies can resist severe water turbulence due to their positive buoyancy xiao et al 2018 however in our study the impact of phytoplankton sinking was absent since microcystis colonies and non buoyant phytoplankton were both exposed to identical light conditions due to the fact that they were evenly distributed over the water column however colonial algae had been largely brought about by the combined action of turbulence and spm which may contribute to the rebalance of the phytoplankton community possibly through the following strategies first the larger surface of the colony was helpful for acquiring light especially when the light attenuation was enhanced by spm second the large colony size due to the switching of algae assembly patterns from unicellular to colonials ones enabled microcystis sp to be relatively buoyant and had higher floating velocities than other phytoplankton that hence facilitated their access to the surface of the water column this may partly explain the survival of microcystis sp in turbulence and turbulence spm treatments third the formation and prevalence of colonies may provide algae an advantage in sustaining growth in the poor nutrient condition of the turbulent ecosystems xiao et al 2018 but formation of microcystis colonies were at the cost of decreased specific growth rates compared with a unicellular life xiao et al 2018 fourth during the formation of colonies gelatinous material was released at the surface of algal cells which protects the cells upon spm apart from these explanations microcystis sp colonies and non buoyant phytoplankton were exposed to identical light conditions if they are evenly distributed over the water column in that case green algae chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp in this study which generally have a higher growth rate than microcystis sp will outcompete microcystis the impact of ambient conditions on the seasonal structure of phytoplankton was also recorded recently and it was shown that the temperate variation caused the communities to reorganize species composition and to exhibit bigger cell sizes acevedo trejos et al 2015 4 3 altered surface property of spm favored phytoplankton composition changes early work had identified turbulence in the water column as a key factor contributing to the persistence of phytoplankton populations during which phytoplankton species need to passively or actively counteract the effects of turbulence portalier et al 2016 the previous relevant studies on the responses of phytoplankton to turbulence were mostly focused on the how the phytoplankton responded passively to the stress e g light attenuation and nutrient availability under turbulent mixing drive phytoplankton succession blersch et al 2013 yu et al 2018 however under the impact of turbulent mixing several phytoplankton species can also actively decrease their body density and increase their buoyancy for example it was demonstrated that intermediate turbulence allows sinking phytoplankton species to persist huisman et al 2002 hence it seems reasonable to hypothesis that some other strategies may be involved for non buoyant phytoplankton as external force on algal cells the shear stress induced by water turbulence indirectly causes algal cell damage which can be substantially enhanced with the addition of spm in the present study microscopic images exhibited discrete particles of spm before incubation with algae fig 5a those would damage the algal cells upon collision in turbulent waters characterization of spm clearly revealed that in comparison to the raw spm coincubation with algal cells caused the alternation of spm surface properties this was closely related to the eps which can be released by algae cells under physiological stress previous studies have shown that eps released by cyanobacteria promoted the aggregation of inorganic colloids in eutrophic shallow lakes xu et al 2016 eps can also be adsorbed by spm hence triggering co aggregation he et al 2017 this aggregation prompted spm migration from water column to sediment and favored algal growth it also possibly triggered the reduction of light attenuation if the aggregation was big enough to combat the turbulence mixing in turbulent waters the coaggregation of spm eps algae may impact algae survival through two different manners first resuspensions could be enhanced in turbulent systems then the light attenuation and nutrient adsorption may negatively influence algae survival second the round surface of spm eps algae or spm eps aggregates could reduce the shear stress for algal cells in this study the d 0 5 of the spm showed a nearly 5 fold increase when coincubated with algal cells the d 0 5 of spm under the l spm treatment was slightly higher than that under the h spm treatment fig 4b suggesting the presence of coaggregation in addition it can be seen from fig 4a and table 1 that the amide i group c o stretching at 1646 cm 1 appeared in the spectra of spm in both l spm and h spm treatments suggesting that the functional groups of polysaccharides and proteins in eps interacted with spm increased peaks at 1030 cm 1 indicated that the functional groups of polysaccharides were prompted as a response to turbulence intensity consequently due to the interaction between spm eps and algal cells in turbulent waters there was a significant increase in particle size and surface organic groups of spms hence impairing the negative impact of spm on algal cells with respect to shear stress it should be noted that although the modified spm properties tend to cause less damage on cell integrity the extracellular mc rr in turbulence spm systems significantly exceeded p 0 05 that without spm fig 6a this may be due to the collapse of toxin producing microcystis sp under the dual influence of turbulence and spm fig 3a indicating the microcystis sp may be more sensitive than scenedesmus sp to the shear stress caused by spm collisions recently in the study that explored the microcystis aeruginosa growth characteristics under the influence of hydrodynamic conditions in reservoirs it was found that moderate shear stress can improve the morphology of microcystis aeruginosa however when the shear stress was too high algal cell morphology could be damaged song et al 2018 the hydrodynamic conditions in our study were based on river systems and the turbulence intensity was higher than the literature reported in lake systems table 3 therefore the microcystis sp may be prone to suffer more from intensified shear stress leading to the damage of microcystis sp cells in addition to the modification of the spm surface property the interaction between spm and algal cells in turbulent waters may also trigger an indirect impact on the physical properties of the microenvironment for example the light attenuation may be enhanced by the aggregates on the other hand spm algal cell aggregation was responsible for increased cell size regel et al 2004 as fig 3b illustrated colonial algae flourished in turbulence spm treatments generally this assemblage pattern showed larger cell sizes and improved ability to resist environmental shifts from the results of our experiments we proposed a conceptual model to describe the active strategies that phytoplankton used to survive in spm containing turbulent water fig 7 through the release of eps the spm eps or spm eps algae aggregations were formed which may cause spm migration from the water column to sediment and favor algal growth strategy i in fig 7 the release of eps also contributed to the change the spm surface property hence helpful for impairing the shear stress caused by spm algae collisions strategy ii in fig 7 the phytoplankton community could also modify the structure and its algal composition during which chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp that exhibited a higher growth rate than microcystis sp flourished strategy iii in fig 7 however this comes at the price of one or several algal species dominating the phytoplankton community in terms of the response of phytoplankton in turbulent waters it was found that moderate water turbulence improved the uniform distribution of light energy in algae ding et al 2016 water turbulence was also reported to greatly enhance the circulation of nutrients within the algal cells and enhance material exchange which improved the absorption of nutrients blersch et al 2013 however both the light intensity and nutrients availability can be regulated in the presence of spm through the light attenuation and nutrients adsorption which would jointly affect the algal biomass and community succession in this study in spite light energy and available nutrients were not assessed the light attenuation and nutrients adsorption caused by spm would be similar in the spm added turbulent treatments since the spm contents were equivalent both quantitatively 500 mg l and qualitatively meanwhile the minimum turbulence intensity in our study 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 caused the entire resuspension of spm in the reactor therefore the response of the phytoplankton community assemblage pattern as well as size structure were supposed to be from the combined effects of turbulence and spm whereas in the turbulent water with and without the suspension of spm the available light and nutrients would all contribute to the differentiation of phytoplankton succession critical to the effectiveness of these processes is whether the turbulence is sufficiently strong to embed the nutrients and phytoplankton into its flow field as well as the nutrients adsorption capacity of spm therefore exploring these specific effects involved in phytoplankton succession in turbulent conditions turbulence only and turbulence spm and distinguishing the role of each process requires further study nevertheless the present study proposed several potential strategies during the reconstruction of the phytoplankton community under the coupled stress of turbulence and spm for the first time and provided a new insight to elucidate the role of spm in reshaping the phytoplankton community 5 conclusion the response of phytoplankton communities under the dual stress of turbulence and spm was studied using an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system the turbulence dissipation rate of 2 25 10 3 and 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 caused a significant reduction in algal density and the effects were prompted when spm was added into the system however the phytoplankton communities can adapt to the dual stress actively through the following tactics 1 the release of extracellular polymeric substances eps from algal cells which led to the aggregates of spm eps algae and hence impaired further damage of algae integrity 2 reshaping of the spm surface properties from smaller particle sizes and a sharper angular surface to larger size and rounder surface which would essentially reduce the shear stress caused by the spm collisions and 3 alternation of the algae assemblage pattern from unicellular to colonial under the joint effects of the three strategies the algal density increased in response after 18 days of co incubation the result of this study provided critical information

19151,the effect of turbulence on phytoplankton growth has been widely studied however its effects with respects to suspended particulate matter spm on the development of phytoplankton communities and the behavioral responses of phytoplankton to turbulence and spm are poorly understood here an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system ahts mainly consisting of an oscillating grid apparatus was established to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying phytoplankton community responses in turbid well mixed waters the results revealed that maintaining the turbulence dissipation rates ɛ of 2 25 10 3 and 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 caused significant reductions in algal density and the effects could be substantially enhanced when 500 mg l of spm were added before day 12 in contrast to the constant decrease of algal density for the ɛ of 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 a dramatic increase in the phytoplankton density occurred after 16 days of incubation for a ɛ of 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 irrespective of spm addition of spm in the ɛ of 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 treatments did not considerably affect the algal density profile compared to that without spm of which unicellular algae decreased and colonial algae dominated the phytoplankton community on the other hand the phytoplankton can regulate the spm properties during the 18 days coincubation extracellular polymeric substances eps released from algal cells induced larger particle sizes and round surfaces of spm which can reduce the damage received to algal cells here we demonstrated that the phytoplankton communities could actively counteract the effects of turbulence spm and adapt the couple stress jointly through the release of eps the modification of spm surface properties and the conversion of their assemblage pattern thereby contributing to rebalance the ecosystem these findings highlight the strategies employed during the reconstruction of phytoplankton under the dual effects of turbulence and spm for the first time consequently

2014 zhao et al 2015 but also by hydrodynamic alternations for example flow velocity inflow and turbulence choi et al 2017 machado et al 2014 rao et al 2017 hydrodynamic conditions play an essential role in the growth and motion of algae fouxon and leshansky 2015 sengupta et al 2017 numerous studies concerning the effects of hydrodynamics on the growth and physiological activities of algae have been conducted and have provided useful information turbulence a ubiquitous hydrodynamic feature of all inland waters and a highly variable environmental parameter was generated at the surface or by natural processes moreover turbulence is also a highly variable environmental parameter changing in both time and space over many orders of magnitude it was found that the turbulent energy dissipation rate ɛ m2 s3 which describes the rate at which the turbulent energy decays over time was in the range of 6 01 10 8 2 39 10 4 m2 s3 in taihu zhu et al 2017 and in the large shallow lake balaton in hungary the ɛ rate ranged from 1 07 10 7 to 6 67 10 3 m2 s3 g tóth et al 2011 previously an experiment was conducted at two turbulence intensities 7 9 10 5 and 7 8 10 3 m2 s3 fraisse et al 2015 which were thought to be realistic levels when compared to the range of 10 6 m2 s3 to 10 3 m2 s3 reported for a straight lowland river sukhodolov et al 1998 turbulence was discovered to have a controlling influence on the movement and distribution of phytoplankton jumars et al 2009 it was confirmed that small scale turbulence promoted the growth rate of selenastrum capricornutum and increased algal density in the water column warnaars and hondzo 2006 recently it was revealed that turbulence could influence microcystis growth by changing the phosphorus absorption capacity zheng et al 2017 it was also found that hydrodynamic shifts could benefit phytoplankton growth by changing the nutrient environment around algae cells and enhancing nutrient absorption guasto et al 2012 warnaars and hondzo 2006 on the other hand turbulence was often deleterious to motile phytoplankton elisa et al 2007 due to the breakage of the flagella or body wall reduction of lipid production and impairment of organelle function thomas and gibson 1990 many previous studies were performed concerning the responses of several specific algae species to hydrodynamic alternation recently it was found that flow regimes were linked to the reshaping of phytoplankton community compositions qu et al 2018 in the three gorges reservoir tgr of china hydrologic regimes were also demonstrated to be the main driving force in the succession of the phytoplankton community zhu et al 2013 these studies indicated that the hydrodynamic alternations are likely to have a key regulatory role on algal communities nevertheless it should be noted that the existing studies regarding the role of hydrodynamics condition on phytoplankton growth incorporate the consequence of multiple hydrodynamics properties including velocity shear stress as well as turbulence intensity and the three processes coupled with each other simultaneously kundu et al 2016 making it difficult to distinguish the individual effects on phytoplankton aubry et al 2017 macias et al 2013 one of the reasons for these results may be due to the lack of appropriate instrumentation for simulating the turbulence in natural aquatic ecosystems hondzo and warnaars 2015 xue et al 2016 another issue that needs to be addressed is that hydrodynamics often leads to changes in environmental parameters such as promoting the resuspension of sediment matisoff et al 2017 sediment resuspension by wind induced turbulence is a common characteristic in many shallow lakes schallenberg and burns 2004 and rivers he et al 2018 in a shallow lake in denmark the amount of suspended solids increased by 5 10 times in a few days during two events of increasing wind induced turbulence søndergaard et al 2003 the suspended particulate matter spm content was also considerably affected by the hydrodynamics conditions particularly water velocity our recent study confirmed that the spatiotemporal variability of spm content is largely associated with hydrological alternation which can affect the density and distribution of chlorella pyrenoidosa through nutrient adsorption light attenuation and migration of spm algae heteroaggregations he et al 2017 the available studies benefit our understanding on the effect of hydrological properties on algae growth or community succession however to the best of our knowledge how the phytoplankton communities respond particularly associated with the concomitant spm collision in turbulent waters remains to be explored from the perspective of algae spm interactions to address these knowledge gaps an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system ahts was employed in this study to generate the turbulence and examine the response of phytoplankton communities under the dual stressors including spm and turbulence intensity here we emphasize the active tactics of phytoplankton responding to the dual stress and the purpose of this study is to clarify the influence of turbulence associate with spm on phytoplankton community composition and the strategies underlying phytoplankton responses 2 materials and methods 2 1 toxin standards and reagents mcs standards mc rr were obtained from taiwan algal science inc purity 95 by hplc methanol used for mc rr analysis was of hplc high performance liquid chromatography grade other reagents potassium dihydrogen phosphate potassium bromide potassium iodide and iodine were of analytical grade 2 2 preparation of the algal culture and spm algae containing water was collected from the surface water 0 0 5 m of the yulin river a tributary of the tgr china during the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in august 2017 water samples containing spm were also gathered from the yulin river during the flood seasons spm was obtained by filtering the water samples using a peristaltic pump 80el005 millipore co usa and 0 45 μm glass fiber filters gff the filters were then washed with deionized water and air dried until a constant weight deionized water was obtained using a milli q filtration system millipore bedford ma the spm was characterized using optical microscope imaging leica dmlb germany particle size distribution psd mastersizer 2000 england and fourier transformation infrared absorption spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 america 2 3 incubation experiment the ɛ value in this study was employed according to our in situ assessment of three dimensional flow velocity of the yulin river using a multi static acoustic doppler velocity profiler vectrino ii nortek as norway the in situ assessment of the flow velocity was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the yulin river monthly from april to september the flood season 2017 during this time the sediment resuspension could be largely enhanced and the average content of spm reached nearly 500 mg l the measured velocity time series were loaded in matlab and filtered then a coordinate rotation forcing the mean values of the vertical and transversal velocity components to zero to account for any misalignments of the probe head the root mean square velocity u which helps define the characteristic speed of the turbulence is estimated from the velocity variance in all three velocity components u v w as follows risse buhl et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 1 u u 2 v 2 w 2 then the ɛ value is deduced from u m s using the following formula lawrence 1997 yokosi 1967 zhou et al 2016 2 ε a u 3 l where a is a dimensional constant of order and l is the depth m of the water column describing the size of the largest vortices the in situ measurement of ε showed that the value ranged from 2 25 10 3 to 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 in the yulin river during the flood season of tgr during which the water flow and velocity were substantially higher than those during other periods therefore the ε value in this study is environmentally relevant therefore the minimum and maximum ε values obtained from the in situ assessment were used in this microcosm study the laboratory simulation test concerning the effect of water turbulence on the phytoplankton community was performed in an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system ahts fig 1 the ahts was constructed by a reactor a transmission component a motor and a controller the reactor is a plexiglass cylinder with height of 31 cm and diameter of 20 cm the reactor has maximal capacities of 9 7 l a grid made from plexiglass bars with a mesh size distance between adjacent bars of about 15 mm was connected to the motor and moved repeatedly in the vertical direction so the water was pushed back and forth inside the reactor in a homogenous fluid a vertical oscillating grid produces vortices which diffuse and decay away from the grid generating a locally turbulent flow at 15 mm mesh size for the oscillating grid the turbulence is purely diffusive almost isotropic and laterally homogenous with a zero mean flow lucas et al 2016 vertically suspended fluorescent lights were used to illuminate the ahts with a light dark ratio of 12 12 h the ε value was acquired though manipulation of the grid oscillation distance and frequency and was estimated following a previous literature michallet and mory 2004 as follows 3 ε 0 45 f 3 s 2 s m where f is the grid oscillation frequency s is the vertical oscillation distance and m is the grid mesh size distance between adjacent bars each reactor was filled with 7 l of water which was filtered through an 80 μm mesh to allow phytoplankton to pass through but exclude zooplankton symons et al 2012 the phytoplankton in the raw water was composed of cyanobacteria chlorophyceae bacillariophyceae and euglenophyceae with an initial algae density of 8 21 109 cells l in each reactor and the intracellular and extracellular mc rr content was 19 50 μg g and 0 59 μg l respectively the 15 ahtss containing the same volume of water including algae were divided into three groups the ε value in three ahtss was set to be zero control static water the ε value in six ahtss was adjusted to 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 lower turbulence dissipation rate l in short among which spm was added to three ahtss l spm in short the ε value in another six ahtss was set at 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 high turbulence dissipation rate h in short and spm was added into three of them h spm in short the spm concentration in the ahtss was maintained at 500 mg l the experimental treatments are described in table 1 the ahtss were operated under controlled laboratory conditions that remained constant throughout the study 25 c under 3300 lx and a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle 2 4 sample collection and preparation phytoplankton was sampled below 11 cm of the water surface middle of the water column and was quantified every 2 days using a light microscope olympus bx 53 at 400 magnification colonies were counted as cells and the total number of algal cells in the colony was determined using the algacount t300 system shineso technology co ltd hangzhou china phytoplankton species were identified according to their morphological traits at the initial and after 18 days of the incubation the algal assemblage patterns unicellular colonial were enumerated in random fields and at least 200 individuals of the most frequent species were counted to calculate the percentage of each size group of each morphospecies li et al 2018 mc rr was determined at the start and end of the experiment as described below 1l water samples were applied to a preconditioned octadecylsilyl ods cartridges after filtration through a gff membrane and then the toxins were eluted with 100 methanol and evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator büch germany the residual were re dissolved with 1 ml of 90 methanol and stored at 20 c until determination with respect to intracellular mc rr the water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm filters to obtain the algal cells which were then freeze dried and extracted using a 5 v v acetic acid with ultrasonication 300w 5 min for three times after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 mins the supernatant was collected and followed by application to an ods cartridge as was described above after 18 days of incubation the spm were collected through centrifuging at 3000 rpm 10 min to separate the particles and algal cells and then the spm were characterized as mentioned in section 2 2 2 5 mcs determination an hplc analysis was performed using a shimadzu lc 10a system with two lc 10a pumps and a uv detector the elution conditions were 60 solution a 100 methanol and 40 solution b 0 05 m kh2po4 ph 3 at a flow rate of 1 ml min using a shimadzu gasketing clo ods 6 0 150 column the column temperature was maintained at 40 c and the injection volume was 10 μl the limit of quantitation is 0 02 g l the detailed information was available in our previous literature he et al 2018 2 6 statistical analysis statistically significant differences between the treatments were compared using the one way and two way analysis of variance anova to test for differences between the means of the control and treatments a comparison with a p value 0 05 was considered significantly different 3 results 3 1 phytoplankton density in the controls there were dramatic decreases of algal density before the 10th day of incubation while abrupt increases occurred after day 12 fig 2 similarly the phytoplankton density in the turbulence and turbulence spm treatments were consistently reduced before day 12 however with the increasing turbulence dissipation rate from 2 25 10 3 to 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 the reduction rate of the phytoplankton density was significantly depressed p 0 05 in the l treatments the reduction of algal density showed a slight decrease when spm was introduced in contrast in the h treatments the addition of spm deteriorated algal growth by 1 36 folds in comparison to the h treatments however the algal density showed an abrupt increase at day 16 in h and h spm and the density reached approximately 5 30 109 cells l insignificant difference between h and h spm treatments in comparison to the l treatment the l spm treatment favored algal growth to some extent however the growth rate declined by the end of the experiment and the maximum algal density remained at 3 49 109 cells l fig 2 3 2 phytoplankton species and assemblage pattern the phytoplankton population in water samples was primarily composed of 4 phyla cyanobacteria chlorophyceae bacillariophyceae and euglenophyceae during the experimental period we identified a total of 20 algae species which belonged to cyanobacteria 5 genera chlorophyceae 9 genera bacillariophyceae 5 genera and euglenophyceae 1 genus after 18 days of incubation the algae species reduced to 13 11 12 and 11 in l l spm h and h spm treatments respectively cyanobacteria microcystis sp and nodularia sp and chlorophyceae chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were the most representative phytoplankton in all treatments during the study period however the community compositions were largely altered with the extending of the incubation times fig 3 a revealed that microcystis sp and chlorella sp dominated in the raw water while on day 18 the abundance of microcystis sp increased by approximately 38 in the control while the dominant algae species turned to scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp in the turbulent treatments the proportion of scenedesmus sp in the l treatment were approximately 1 91 1 1 and 1 87 times higher than that of chlorella sp in the l spm h and h spm treatments respectively increasing the turbulence dissipation rate from 2 25 10 3 to 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 resulted in an increase in the prevalence of scenedesmus sp in the reactor which could be further enhanced once spm was added the proportion of scenedesmus sp in the spm added treatments 52 67 and 62 69 for l spm and h spm respectively significantly exceeded those without spm 17 99 and 42 57 for l and h respectively fig 3a the results indicated that scenedesmus sp could tolerate the harsh environment induced by turbulence and spm the structure of phytoplankton communities was further illustrated by the assemblage patterns in the 5 treatments fig 3b in the raw water the number of cells in colonial algal species mainly microcystis sp fig 3c was nearly equivalent to that of the unicellular mainly chlorella sp fig 3d after 18 days incubation the algal assembly patterns did not show obvious changes in the control however in the turbulence or turbulence spm treatments there was a remarkable impact on the phytoplankton assemblage pattern at the end of the study despite the lower turbulence dissipation rate affecting the proportion of unicellular algae the increase in the turbulence dissipation rate induced changes in the species composition and scenedesmus sp a colonial algae dominated the phytoplankton community fig 3e in contrast the abundance of microcystis sp and chlorella sp which were the main species at the beginning of the experiment were substantially depressed towards the end excluding that in the control fig 3a under the dual impact of turbulence and spm colonial phytoplankton can be largely induced and the effect was most obvious in the l spm treatments 3 3 spm characterization ftir analysis was performed to identify the major functional groups of inorganic and organic compounds of spm in turbulence spm treatments at the start and end of the study the bands in the ftir spectrum were assigned to be various functional groups of organic compounds proteins and polysaccharides and inorganic compounds clay according to the wavenumbers table 2 strong similarities among the ftir spectra were observed in l spm and h spm however large differences in the spectra appeared between the raw spm and that co incubated with algae it can be seen from fig 4 a that in l spm and h spm treatments the ftir spectra at 1 030 1646 and 3419 cm 1 were substantially enhanced in comparison to those without the incubation of algae the spectral region from 1000 to 1200 cm 1 was attributed from the stretching c o c vibrations of polysaccharides the distinct bands at approximately 1030 cm 1 were derived from carbohydrate adsorption and caused by the c o bonds included in polysaccharides the organic compounds mainly bands from 1200 to 1800 cm 1 li et al 2013 and 1646 cm 1 here presented in the spectra of l spm and h spm were attributed to the amide i c o stretching li et al 2013 which was almost absent from spm collected in situ indicating that the excretion of organic matter from algal cells can be considered as a function of turbulence plus spm in the spectral region varying from 3000 to 3700 cm 1 one prominent absorbance peak at approximately 3419 cm 1 could be related to oh or nh fig 4a in summary extracellular polymeric substances eps adhere to the spm surface causing peak shift and peak intensity differences before and after the experiment tang et al 2017 fig 4a the psd analysis revealed that the spm itself with a mean particle diameters of 11 71 μm and a median diameters of d 0 5 of 6 72 μm fig 4b did not adsorb eps and algal cells and that particle diameter belows 22 32 μm accounted for 90 of the total volume of the fraction in the l spm and h spm treatments the mean particle diameter of spm reached 75 64 μm and 72 68 μm after 18 days of incubations respectively which were 6 44 fold and 6 19 fold higher than that before the experiment possibly due to the adsorption of eps or algal cells and formation of aggregations the particle diameter largely increased with the increasing turbulence intensity and there were insignificant differences between the l spm and h spm treatments fig 4b from the optical microscope images we observed the surface reshaping process of spm in different treatments before and after the experiment each column in fig 5 presents the increase of spm size with the extending of the co incubation time moreover spm had a smaller particle sizes and sharper and more angular surfaces before the experiment figs 5a 1 a 2 a 3 after 18 days incubation the spm surfaces in the two treatments were largely altered and tended to be more intense and rounded likely due to the formation of spm eps algae aggregates during the incubation the alternation of spm surface property in l spm figs 5b 1 b 2 b 3 and h spm figs 5c 1 c 2 c 3 treatments clearly demonstrated that turbulence promoted the spm reshaping process fig 5 3 4 mc rr content before co incubation with spm the intracellular mc rr content at a level of 2 16 μg g and extracellular mc rr of 0 65 μg l were observed in the system while after 18 days the intracellular mc rr content were increased by nearly 7 folds in the control indicating the flourish of toxin producing microcystis fig 6 in turbulent treatments extracellular mc rr levels increased significantly with the enhancement of turbulence intensity and reached 1 34 and 2 64 μg l under the turbulence intensities of 2 25 10 3 and 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 respectively when spm was added into the systems the extracellular mc rr concentrations exhibited 3 4 h spm treatments and 2 1 l spm treatments fold increases in comparison to turbulence only suggesting that spm collisions were imperative in the breaking of algal cells this was supported by the significantly reduced p 0 05 intracellular mc rr contents in the spm added system 4 discussion 4 1 prompted changes of phytoplankton communities as functions of turbulence and spm a wide range factors in aquatic environments including turbulence mixing nutrient concentrations and spm content are responsible for controlling the growth and physiological activities of phytoplankton machado et al 2014 marisol et al 2018 marmorino et al 2017 phytoplankton density changes are also not controlled by individual factors but by a series of environmental parameters he et al 2017 heisler et al 2008 several efforts have been made to study the role of turbulence on phytoplankton growth the studied turbulence dissipation rate value and phytoplankton species are listed in table 3 while it is widely accepted that turbulence mixing plays a vital role in influencing the phytoplankton growth rate the evidence of how the phytoplankton reacted is not fully understood in a recent study the response of two algal species diatom and cyanobacteria under turbulent condition were documented and it was found that the turbulence was more beneficial for the growth of cyanobacteria zhou et al 2016 however the impact of turbulence on algae was species specific hondzo and wüest 2009 and the responses of the phytoplankton communities in natural aquatic environments would be more complicated in our study we compared the response of algal density and phytoplankton community structure between turbulent and static water the results showed that the motile algal species gathered at the water surface under static conditions which was responsible for a constant decrease of algal density in the middle of the water column fig 2 moreover the static water favored growth and microcystis dominated the phytoplankton community after 18 days incubation turbulence caused the uniform distribution of algal cells in the simulated system indicating that the vertical distribution of phytoplankton can be considerably affected by turbulence in the present study we emphasized the linkages between phytoplankton density community structure and turbulence as well as turbulence spm the results showed that thr high turbulence dissipation rate 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 associated with spm tended to favor algal community changes and algal growth more than the lower rate 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 fig 2 in turbulent without spm systems it was found that the increased turbulence dissipation rate was responsible for a greater phytoplankton growth rate wang et al 2012 due to the enhancement of the nutrients flux into algal cells zhou et al 2016 or the facilitation of algae cells to find the suitable light intensity and living space fraisse et al 2015 while the addition of spm may impair both the nutrient availability and light intensity thus the role of spm in shaping the growth profile of phytoplankton has not been clearly elucidated yet our recent study found that spm could affect chlorella pyrenoidosa growth through an integrated process including light attenuation nutrient adsorption and algae aggregation he et al 2017 however with respect to phytoplankton communities the requirements of optimal light or nutrients particularly for those impacted by spm may be different between algal species different turbulent dissipation rates spm in this study showed different effects on phytoplankton community structure cyanobacteria were gradually replaced by green algae communities during the experimental periods fig 3a during which the microcystis sp were remarkably depressed under turbulence or turbulence spm treatments the results agreed well with those of a previous study revealing that turbulence mixing can shift the competitive balance in phytoplankton species resulting in the replacement of cyanobacteria by green algae huisman et al 2004 microcystis sp were the most concerning harmful algal blooms habs species and our results demonstrated that turbulence could reduce the their density this occurred possibly because 1 turbulence can effectively reduce the colony size of microcystis sp li et al 2018 and 2 failure of competition with other algae in turbulent waters cyanobacteria with a gas vesicle can facilitate the proliferation of phytoplankton by increasing the nutrient flux and light absorption through migration in the water column however turbulence inhibited cyanobacteria migration and floating cyanobacteria lose their preponderance under turbulent conditions while most non motile green algae are favored by turbulence mixing for optimum nutrient and light conditions and then outcompete cyanobacteria these results suggest that cyanobacteria are relatively more sensitive to turbulence compared to other algal groups thomas and gibson 1990 when the spm was added to turbulent water the change of the phytoplankton community was substantially stimulated of which the abundance of scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp green algae was approximately 1 5 times higher in h spm than that in h only implying that the spm could favor the growth of green algae when the turbulence intensity was high the possible reason is that colonial microcystis sp are more prone to collisions with spm under higher turbulence intensity during which mechanical damage and even mortality of the algal cells may occurred this hypothesis can be supported by the variation of intra and extracellular mc rr levels fig 6 as shown in fig 6a extracellular mc rr concentrations released by toxin producing microcystis sp in turbulence spm treatments significantly exceeded that in the control l and h treatments p 0 05 corresponding to the dramatic decrease of intracellular mc rr content fig 6b this indicated that turbulence induced spm movement played a role in the destruction of algal cells and contributed to the dominance in the phytoplankton community of chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp similar results were also discovered in previous literature that demonstrated that the sensitivity to turbulence intensity varied among phytoplankton species cross et al 2014 4 2 assemblage patterns are helpful in reshaping phytoplankton communities another contributor for reshaping the phytoplankton community in our study is the assemblage pattern in our study the abundance of unicellular and colonial algal cells in the control was nearly the same before and after the incubation but the colonial form was prevalent under the turbulence spm treatments fig 3b our results differ from those found in a recent study that found that the colonies of m aeruginosa and m ichthyoblabe would be more susceptible to disaggregation from turbulent mixing than colonies of m wesenbergi when the turbulence dissipation rates were varied from 0 020 to 0 364 m2 s 3 li et al 2018 this is because unlike microcystis colonies phytoplankton communities are composed of microcystis sp nodularia sp chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp in this study and the composition of phytoplankton communities and the assemblage patterns should be related to each other not decoupled as the change in phytoplankton communities illustrated fig 3a scenedesmus dominated the phytoplankton which hence increased the abundance of colonial cells moreover an increase in the turbulence dissipation rate significantly prompted the proportion of colonial algae 23 66 and 54 at turbulence dissipation rate of 2 25 10 3 and 1 8 10 2 m2 s3 respectively in a previous study that evaluated the distribution of phytoplankton populations in a shallow coastal sea it was found that a reduction in the length of diatom chains occurred as a response of enhanced turbulence mixing cross et al 2014 a previous study found large microcystis colonies can resist severe water turbulence due to their positive buoyancy xiao et al 2018 however in our study the impact of phytoplankton sinking was absent since microcystis colonies and non buoyant phytoplankton were both exposed to identical light conditions due to the fact that they were evenly distributed over the water column however colonial algae had been largely brought about by the combined action of turbulence and spm which may contribute to the rebalance of the phytoplankton community possibly through the following strategies first the larger surface of the colony was helpful for acquiring light especially when the light attenuation was enhanced by spm second the large colony size due to the switching of algae assembly patterns from unicellular to colonials ones enabled microcystis sp to be relatively buoyant and had higher floating velocities than other phytoplankton that hence facilitated their access to the surface of the water column this may partly explain the survival of microcystis sp in turbulence and turbulence spm treatments third the formation and prevalence of colonies may provide algae an advantage in sustaining growth in the poor nutrient condition of the turbulent ecosystems xiao et al 2018 but formation of microcystis colonies were at the cost of decreased specific growth rates compared with a unicellular life xiao et al 2018 fourth during the formation of colonies gelatinous material was released at the surface of algal cells which protects the cells upon spm apart from these explanations microcystis sp colonies and non buoyant phytoplankton were exposed to identical light conditions if they are evenly distributed over the water column in that case green algae chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp in this study which generally have a higher growth rate than microcystis sp will outcompete microcystis the impact of ambient conditions on the seasonal structure of phytoplankton was also recorded recently and it was shown that the temperate variation caused the communities to reorganize species composition and to exhibit bigger cell sizes acevedo trejos et al 2015 4 3 altered surface property of spm favored phytoplankton composition changes early work had identified turbulence in the water column as a key factor contributing to the persistence of phytoplankton populations during which phytoplankton species need to passively or actively counteract the effects of turbulence portalier et al 2016 the previous relevant studies on the responses of phytoplankton to turbulence were mostly focused on the how the phytoplankton responded passively to the stress e g light attenuation and nutrient availability under turbulent mixing drive phytoplankton succession blersch et al 2013 yu et al 2018 however under the impact of turbulent mixing several phytoplankton species can also actively decrease their body density and increase their buoyancy for example it was demonstrated that intermediate turbulence allows sinking phytoplankton species to persist huisman et al 2002 hence it seems reasonable to hypothesis that some other strategies may be involved for non buoyant phytoplankton as external force on algal cells the shear stress induced by water turbulence indirectly causes algal cell damage which can be substantially enhanced with the addition of spm in the present study microscopic images exhibited discrete particles of spm before incubation with algae fig 5a those would damage the algal cells upon collision in turbulent waters characterization of spm clearly revealed that in comparison to the raw spm coincubation with algal cells caused the alternation of spm surface properties this was closely related to the eps which can be released by algae cells under physiological stress previous studies have shown that eps released by cyanobacteria promoted the aggregation of inorganic colloids in eutrophic shallow lakes xu et al 2016 eps can also be adsorbed by spm hence triggering co aggregation he et al 2017 this aggregation prompted spm migration from water column to sediment and favored algal growth it also possibly triggered the reduction of light attenuation if the aggregation was big enough to combat the turbulence mixing in turbulent waters the coaggregation of spm eps algae may impact algae survival through two different manners first resuspensions could be enhanced in turbulent systems then the light attenuation and nutrient adsorption may negatively influence algae survival second the round surface of spm eps algae or spm eps aggregates could reduce the shear stress for algal cells in this study the d 0 5 of the spm showed a nearly 5 fold increase when coincubated with algal cells the d 0 5 of spm under the l spm treatment was slightly higher than that under the h spm treatment fig 4b suggesting the presence of coaggregation in addition it can be seen from fig 4a and table 1 that the amide i group c o stretching at 1646 cm 1 appeared in the spectra of spm in both l spm and h spm treatments suggesting that the functional groups of polysaccharides and proteins in eps interacted with spm increased peaks at 1030 cm 1 indicated that the functional groups of polysaccharides were prompted as a response to turbulence intensity consequently due to the interaction between spm eps and algal cells in turbulent waters there was a significant increase in particle size and surface organic groups of spms hence impairing the negative impact of spm on algal cells with respect to shear stress it should be noted that although the modified spm properties tend to cause less damage on cell integrity the extracellular mc rr in turbulence spm systems significantly exceeded p 0 05 that without spm fig 6a this may be due to the collapse of toxin producing microcystis sp under the dual influence of turbulence and spm fig 3a indicating the microcystis sp may be more sensitive than scenedesmus sp to the shear stress caused by spm collisions recently in the study that explored the microcystis aeruginosa growth characteristics under the influence of hydrodynamic conditions in reservoirs it was found that moderate shear stress can improve the morphology of microcystis aeruginosa however when the shear stress was too high algal cell morphology could be damaged song et al 2018 the hydrodynamic conditions in our study were based on river systems and the turbulence intensity was higher than the literature reported in lake systems table 3 therefore the microcystis sp may be prone to suffer more from intensified shear stress leading to the damage of microcystis sp cells in addition to the modification of the spm surface property the interaction between spm and algal cells in turbulent waters may also trigger an indirect impact on the physical properties of the microenvironment for example the light attenuation may be enhanced by the aggregates on the other hand spm algal cell aggregation was responsible for increased cell size regel et al 2004 as fig 3b illustrated colonial algae flourished in turbulence spm treatments generally this assemblage pattern showed larger cell sizes and improved ability to resist environmental shifts from the results of our experiments we proposed a conceptual model to describe the active strategies that phytoplankton used to survive in spm containing turbulent water fig 7 through the release of eps the spm eps or spm eps algae aggregations were formed which may cause spm migration from the water column to sediment and favor algal growth strategy i in fig 7 the release of eps also contributed to the change the spm surface property hence helpful for impairing the shear stress caused by spm algae collisions strategy ii in fig 7 the phytoplankton community could also modify the structure and its algal composition during which chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp that exhibited a higher growth rate than microcystis sp flourished strategy iii in fig 7 however this comes at the price of one or several algal species dominating the phytoplankton community in terms of the response of phytoplankton in turbulent waters it was found that moderate water turbulence improved the uniform distribution of light energy in algae ding et al 2016 water turbulence was also reported to greatly enhance the circulation of nutrients within the algal cells and enhance material exchange which improved the absorption of nutrients blersch et al 2013 however both the light intensity and nutrients availability can be regulated in the presence of spm through the light attenuation and nutrients adsorption which would jointly affect the algal biomass and community succession in this study in spite light energy and available nutrients were not assessed the light attenuation and nutrients adsorption caused by spm would be similar in the spm added turbulent treatments since the spm contents were equivalent both quantitatively 500 mg l and qualitatively meanwhile the minimum turbulence intensity in our study 2 25 10 3 m2 s3 caused the entire resuspension of spm in the reactor therefore the response of the phytoplankton community assemblage pattern as well as size structure were supposed to be from the combined effects of turbulence and spm whereas in the turbulent water with and without the suspension of spm the available light and nutrients would all contribute to the differentiation of phytoplankton succession critical to the effectiveness of these processes is whether the turbulence is sufficiently strong to embed the nutrients and phytoplankton into its flow field as well as the nutrients adsorption capacity of spm therefore exploring these specific effects involved in phytoplankton succession in turbulent conditions turbulence only and turbulence spm and distinguishing the role of each process requires further study nevertheless the present study proposed several potential strategies during the reconstruction of the phytoplankton community under the coupled stress of turbulence and spm for the first time and provided a new insight to elucidate the role of spm in reshaping the phytoplankton community 5 conclusion the response of phytoplankton communities under the dual stress of turbulence and spm was studied using an approximately homogeneous turbulence simulation system the turbulence dissipation rate of 2 25 10 3 and 1 80 10 2 m2 s3 caused a significant reduction in algal density and the effects were prompted when spm was added into the system however the phytoplankton communities can adapt to the dual stress actively through the following tactics 1 the release of extracellular polymeric substances eps from algal cells which led to the aggregates of spm eps algae and hence impaired further damage of algae integrity 2 reshaping of the spm surface properties from smaller particle sizes and a sharper angular surface to larger size and rounder surface which would essentially reduce the shear stress caused by the spm collisions and 3 alternation of the algae assemblage pattern from unicellular to colonial under the joint effects of the three strategies the algal density increased in response after 18 days of co incubation the result of this study provided critical information

19152,biofouling of reverse osmosis ro membrane is a significant issue for the water treatment industry in this study we apply the metagenomic shot gun sequencing technology to characterise the composition and functional potential of the microbial community in a full scale ro plant at different stages of seawater treatment we find proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla the genetic potential of the ro membrane microbial community shows the enrichment of genes involved in biofilm formation representing the selective pressure of the biofilm formation process we recover 31 metagenome assembled genomes mags from intake raw seawater fouled ro membranes leading and middle ro module and brine reject water a total of 25 mags are recovered from the biofilm samples leading and middle ro modules with 9 of them 36 belonging to planctomycetes we investigate all 25 mags for genes pili flagella quorum sensing quorum quenching and nitrate reduction that play an important role in biofilm formation and sustenance of cells we show that planctomycetes contain genes for the formation of flagella and pili and the reduction of nitrate although genes for quorum sensing are not detected quorum quenching genes are identified in the biofilm mags our results show that planctomycetes along with other microbes play an important role in the formation and sustenance of biofilms on seawater ro membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords metagenomics reverse osmosis seawater desalination membrane biofouling membrane based water treatment 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is becoming one of the preferred technologies for the desalination of seawater due to its low energy costs associated with the production of drinking water globally 63 7 of all the desalinated water is produced by membrane processes cost requirements have led many countries to move from thermal based desalination to ro membrane based desalination for the production of drinking water ghaffour et al 2013 to this day the biofouling of ro membranes has remained the most common practical problem that significantly contributes to operational costs the attachment of microbes present in seawater causes the biofouling of the membrane surface which eventually reduces flux and permeate quality fritzmann et al 2007 biofouling or biofilm formation is a dynamic process that involves several steps surface conditioning microbial attachment growth and finally dispersion flemming 1997 khan et al 2013a composition of microbial community of biofilm can change with time depending on functional requirements of the biofilm community flemming et al 2016 since the biofilm microbial community changes over time it is interesting to explore the diversity and functional potential of this microbial community on ro membranes after completion of their operational lifespan nagaraj et al 2017 the purpose of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of microbial communities present at different satges of seawater ro treatment and the functions they perform to thrive in these harsh conditions therefore rational methods guided by the metabolic potential or needs of the microbial community can be employed to mitigate biofouling oh et al 2017 many studies have explored the microbial diversity at various stages of water treatment at ro plants belila et al 2016 khan et al 2013a manes et al 2011 however most of these studies were performed either on lab scale ro systems or on full scale ro plants run for a short period only bereschenko et al 2008 khan et al 2013b kim et al 2014 a good knowledge of the microbial community composition may be used to predict the functional potential of the microbial community based on taxonomic association manes et al 2011 although informative the derived functions may not represent the actual functional role of the ro microbial community because organisms in biofilms undergo differentiation in response to changes in the local environment bereschenko et al 2008 flemming et al 2016 metagenomic analyses provide information about the functional and ecological roles of microbial communities which cannot be obtained from a 16s rrna gene analysis thomas et al 2012 decreasing costs of high throughput sequencing makes metagenomic analysis a method of choice to study microbial communities the assembly of metagenome sequencing reads allow the extraction of the complete microbial genomes otherwise difficult to culture the extracted genomes can be investigated for the presence of genes that play an important role in biofilm formation to our knowledge no metagenomic study has been conducted on microbial communities of seawater ro membranes obtained from a full scale ro plant and used for an extended period 5 7 years in this study we use a whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach to investigate the diversity and genetic potential of microbes found in intake seawater ro membranes and brine we collect ro membrane samples from ro modules of different ages which allows us to study how the age of the biofilm affects the microbial diversity of the membrane furthermore we recover nearly complete metagenome assembled genomes mags from the sequenced data and investigate these mags for their potential ecological role in biofilm formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling all the samples water and membranes were obtained on 17th feb 2016 from a desalination plant 22 299815 n 39 116812 e at king abdullah university of science and technology located on the red sea coast of the kingdom of saudi arabia this plant has a production capacity of 40 000 m3 day to cater the needs of the kaust community and is operated as follows intake water from the red sea is screened using fine screen filters and subsequently chlorinated once a week before being subjected to spruce media filters smf after smf treatment the water enters into a ro treatment train which several treatment steps 1 dosing anti scalant 2 cartridge filtration 10 μm pore size 3 neutralization of the chlorine that can damage the ro membrane using sodium bisulfite sbs 4 addition of caustic soda to the ro permeate to increase the ph which increases the rejection of boron in the second pass ro treatment the first pass ro treatment has four trains and each train has 140 pressure vessels with each vessel containing seven ro membrane modules toray tmc820c 400 for our study samples of intake sweater and brine were collected on the same day using 5l autoclaved glass bottles ro membrane samples were obtained from two different ro modules seven years and five years old a pressure vessel contained 7 ro modules in series the seven years old ro module was harvested from the leading position whereas the five years old module was collected from the middle of the ro module fig 1 samples from the seven years old module were designated as l leading and samples from the five years old module were labelled as m middle the membrane samples from the entry and exit points of the ro module were collected and referred to as la and lb respectively similarly membrane samples from entry and exit of the middle module were designated ma and mb respectively membranes pieces of 1 cm2 were cut at a distance of 5 cm from the entry and exit points of the seawater in the module the leading membrane module was visibly more biofouled compared to the middle module fig s1 2 2 dna extraction three litres of water samples intake and brine were filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filters millipore usa under vacuum the filters were cut into small pieces and stored at 80 c in cryogenic tubes thermofisher scientific usa until dna extraction similarly ro membranes were cut into small pieces before storage at 80 c before extraction filters and membrane samples were vortexed vigorously in 500 μl of 1x te buffer to remove the biomass which was then concentrated by centrifugation at 6000 xg at room temperature a qiaamp dna mini kit qiagen germany was used for the dna extraction using protocol for dna purification from tissues following the manufacturer s instructions the quantity and quality of dna were both measured using the nanodrop thermofisher scientific usa and qubit br dna assay kits from invitrogen usa the concentration of dna obtained for intake and brine was 1 53 ng μl and 1 45 ng μl respectively while for biofilm samples la was 0 86 ng μl lb was 0 492 ng μl ma was 0 1 ng μl and mb was 0 192 ng μl the dna from biofilm samples was concentrated dna clean concentration kit zymo research usa before library preparation as a control for dna extraction kit filtration unit environment and filters 0 5 l of dna free water was subjected to filtration and dna extraction however no dna was detected 2 3 metagenome sequencing a library for shotgun metagenome sequencing was prepared using a truseq nano dna lt kit per manufacturer instructions illumina usa briefly 100 ng of the dna from each sample was fragmented to obtain 350bp insert size the fragments overhangs were repaired to obtain blunt ends after size selection 3 ends of fragments were adenylated followed by adapter ligation and library enrichment by pcr libraries were quantified and normalized to 10 nm the libraries were pooled and sequenced on hiseq 4000 illumina usa 2x150bp paired end platform at kaust s biosciences core labs sequence data obtained in this study were submitted to the genbank bioproject prjna480846 and sra accession srp153197 the mags sequences were submitted to ddbj ena genbank the mag ids and their accession numbers are given in table s3 2 4 quality filtering and assembly of metagenome reads raw reads obtained in the fastq format were processed for quality filtering using a cutadapt package martin 2011 for quality trimming phred quality score q 20 was applied and reads smaller than 130bp were discarded trimmed reads were assembled using spades version 3 11 1 bankevich et al 2012 the reads were mapped back to the assembly using bowtie 2 version 2 3 3 1 to generate coverage files for metagenomic binning langmead and salzberg 2012 the sequence alignment map sam files were converted to binary alignment map bam format using samtools li et al 2009 mags were retrieved from metagenomic assembly by binning the contigs to achieve this we used concoct version 0 4 1 which combines sequence composition coverage information of contigs across samples and read pair linkage to cluster them into individual bins alneberg et al 2014 mags were refined manually if needed by using anvi o interactive graphical interface this interface allows users to visualize the bins and to add or remove contigs based on coverage gc contents and taxonomic assignments in real time a contig was removed from a bin if its coverage gc content or taxonomy was not consistent with the other contigs in that bin completeness and contamination of the mags were also calculated by anvi o by employing a set of 139 bacteria single copy core genes bscgs campbell et al 2013 eren et al 2015 absence or multiple occurrence of these genes determine the completeness and contamination of the bins the mags were annotated using prokka seemann 2014 the gff3 files produced by prokka were analyzed by roary pan genome pipeline page et al 2015 by using roary we calculated the entire gene content of individual mags the resulting csv files were used to search for the presence absence of a particular gene and number of its copies a taxonomic classification of the sequencing reads was performed by kaiju menzel et al 2016 at the protein level by translating reads into amino acids the minimum match score was set to 75 and the minimum match length set to 11 taxonomic information obtained by kaiju transferred to the ampvis2 package albertsen et al 2015 after minor modification as per data requirements mentioned for the ampvis2 package guide the ampvis2 package was used for analysis and visualization of the processed metagenomic reads phylogenetic analysis was performed for the recovered mags and closely related genomes downloaded from ncbi genome repository to achieve this the mags and closely related genomes were imported in anvi o to create a set of concatenated ribosomal proteins the anvi o command anvi get sequences for hmm hits was used with concatenate flag to generate concatenated amino acid sequences the phylogenetic tree was computed by mega7 using the concatenated amino acid sequences by applying neighbor joining statistical method kumar et al 2016 branch node support values were calculated by performing 1000 bootstrap iterations and using the poisson model 2 5 chemical analysis water samples 50 ml from the ro plant were collected just before it enters into ro pressure vessels samples were filtered with 0 4 μm syringe filter transported to the lab at 4 c and processed immediately ammonium and nitrate were measured spectrophotometrically using hach uk kits cat lck304 and cat lck339 respectively per manufacturer instructions 3 results and discussion 3 1 general genome features and metadata total dna was extracted from the intake seawater ro membranes and brine reject and deeply sequenced to obtain a system wide view of the microbial community the statistics of raw and processed sequence reads are given in table s1 the assembled metagenome allowed us to extract 31 near complete genomes of the most abundant microbes three from the intake 13 from the lead membrane modules 12 from the middle membrane modules and three from the brine reject fig 2 these mags exhibited various levels of completeness redundancy gc content number of contigs size and abundance fig 2 all the mags shown here were more than 50 complete and redundancy was less than 10 except for br ptb 2 these mags represent the majority of the population in various samples for example 75 intake 50 membrane biofilm and 28 brine of the total population the assembly of the metagenomic sequences into high quality mags made it possible to investigate the ecological roles and genetic potential of uncultivable bacteria in their respective ecosystems 3 2 phylogenetic identification of mags the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the recovered population genomes based on a set of concatenated ribosomal protein sequences fig 3 the phylogenetic analysis of mags showed that the majority of mags 27 out of 31 belonged to domain bacteria whereas four mags la cra 1 lb cra 1 ma cra 1 mb cra 1 belonged to domain archaea the bacterial mags belonged to phyla acidobacteria 6 actinobacteria 2 bacteroidetes 6 planctomycetes 9 and proteobacteria 4 whereas archeal mags belonged to the phylum crenarchaeota interestingly all the mags were phylogenetically more closely related to each other than to the other members of the specific group fig 3 the differentiation caused by the local conditions for an extended period of five to seven years appeared to have driven these microbes evolutionarily closer to each other flemming et al 2016 this suggests that the ro biofilm does not represent the concentration of microorganisms present in the source water but a specialized community that is actively developing and evolving bereschenko et al 2008 interestingly bins isolated from intake and brine belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes whereas the majority of mags from the membrane s biofilm belonged to planctomycetes mags belonging to planctomycetes acidobacteria actinobacteria and crenarchaeota were found exclusively in biofilm samples previous studies showed that proteobacteria were dominant in the marine environment and also on fouled ro membranes bereschenko et al 2008 manes et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2017 the absence of proteobacterial mags in biofilm samples does not mean that these bacteria were not part of ro biofilm community possible reasons for the absence of proteobacterial bins could be the low coverage or higher intra population diversity of proteobacteria alneberg et al 2014 it is also possible that proteobacterial mags were below the threshold level of 10 contamination and 50 completion so they were excluded 3 3 read based microbial community structure in the full scale ro plant an analysis of the microbial community based on sequencing reads revealed that proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla detected in all samples fig 4 a however there were differences in the relative abundance of different phyla in the membrane biofilm community la lb ma and mb as compared to the brine and intake seawater bacterial community proteobacteria represented the main population in intake seawater 64 and brine 67 bacteroidetes were the second most abundant bacterial phyla detected in intake 16 and brine 10 our results are in agreement with belila et al who reported a similar structure of the microbial community for the intake seawater collected from the same ro plant belila et al 2016 furthermore similar microbial community compositions have been reported by previous studies on ro source waters in different parts of the world manes et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 although the phylum proteobacteria is less abundant 32 in membrane biofilm samples than in intake and brine they were the dominant bacterial phylum on ro membranes the same observation was made in previous studies conducted on fouled ro membranes bereschenko et al 2008 manes et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 it has been suggested that members of the proteobacteria act as primary colonizers during the biofilm formation nagaraj et al 2017 the dominant species of proteobacteria detected in intake seawater was rhodobacteraceae bacterium him11 in the ro biofilm we found woeseia oceani to be the main species and candidatus pelagibacter ubique was dominant in brine fig s2 proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum detected in all samples therefore we investigated the differences in abundance for the various classes of this phylum contained in the samples we found that alphaproteobacteria 49 6 were the dominant in brine followed by intake 38 4 and biofilm samples 13 3 fig 4b gammaproteobacteria were higher in intake seawater 19 8 compared to biofilm 8 8 and brine 11 4 betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were enriched in all the biofilm samples 4 5 compared to intake 2 5 and brine 2 7 fig 4b betaproteobacteria such as burkholderiales are known to migrate as eps embedded aggregates of bacterial cells bereschenko et al 2008 and that the abundance of burkholderiales is directly correlated with the thickness of the biofilm nagaraj et al 2017 a recent study on the biofilm formation in the nutrient limited brine pools of the red sea showed that deltaproteobacteria were enriched in biofilm samples zhang et al 2015 our results support the hypothesis that deltaproteobacteria are enriched in extreme environments because of their ability to withstand and survive in such conditions vigneron et al 2016 fig 4b the lower relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria and higher relative abundance of betaproteobacteria in ro biofilm communities were previously reported by khan et al and nagaraj et al khan et al 2013b nagaraj et al 2017 similar to our findings the abundance of proteobacteria in all samples may be the result of their ubiquitous presence in marine environments stevens et al 2005 certain members of proteobacteria e g sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales produce sticky eps that allow these bacteria to withstand shear forces generated by a high water flow furthermore eps produced by these bacteria condition the membranes so that secondary colonizers can attach eventually leading to a flux decline nagaraj et al 2017 in biofilm samples planctomycetes were the second most abundant 28 phyla followed by bacteroidetes 8 fig 4a however another study reported bacteroidetes as the second most dominant bacterial phyla on fouled ro membranes in operation for seven years nagaraj et al 2017 such differences in composition of the bacterial community present on fouled ro membranes were not unexpected microbial groups on ro membranes can be influenced by pretreatment methods membrane material and the operational parameters iorhemen et al 2016 it should be noted that planctomycetes were found to be 2 for both intake and brine however their abundance increased in the biofilm of la 22 lb 25 ma 33 and mb 32 the dominant species of planctomycetes detected in biofilm samples were blastopirellula marina and pirellula staleyi fig s2 previous studies have reported a higher abundance of planctomycetes on fouled ro membranes however there function in ro biofilm community remained unclear bereschenko et al 2008 khan et al 2013b manes et al 2011 extraction of planctomycetes mags allowed us to study the genetic potential of these microorganisms and their role in ro biofilm community the following bacterial phyla were also detected in our samples actinobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi cyanobacteria verrucomicrobia acidobacteria nitrospirae and chlamydiae fig 4a 3 4 phylogenetic beta diversity the beta diversity was analyzed for all samples taxonomy based pcoa showed that biofilm samples la lb ma and mb clustered together along both the pco1 and pco2 axes suggesting the presence of a very similar microbial community in all these samples fig 5 intake and brine had identical pco1 values whereas pco2 was different indicating that the microbial communities in intake and brine were similar with some differences but differed from the community present in the biofilm samples fig 4 this was expected as the microbes in seawater and brine experienced very different environmental conditions compared to biofilm however biofilms were attached to ro membranes and experience higher shear forces and temperature also the biofilm microbial community evolved over the operation period 5 7 years to withstand the prevailing environmental conditions rendered this community distinct from the source community the location of the ro module and the age of the biofilm did not have a strong impact on microbial community composition however the seven year old microbial community on the leading module la and lb was found more similar compared to the five year old middle module ma and mb figs 4 and 5 beta diversity plot substantiated the results shown in fig 4 indicating that the microbial community composition of intake seawater and brine were similar but differed from the composition of biofilm samples 3 5 flagellar biosynthesis genes are enriched in mags extracted from the ro membrane biofilm the formation of biofilm is a complex process that involves the expression of many genes it also depends on the hydrodynamic conditions and the surface properties such as roughness hydrophobicity and charge kostakioti et al 2013 nguyen et al 2012 ro membranes come with a variety of surface properties and high pressure 55 68 bar is applied on the feed side to push the water across the membrane fritzmann et al 2007 it has been shown that flagellar motility plays an important role in the initial attachment in overcoming the repulsive forces created by surface chemistry and severe hydrodynamic conditions lemon et al 2007 toutain et al 2005 furthermore flagella can reach into crevices and thus enable bacteria to attach to surfaces with variety of topographies friedlander et al 2013 we investigated the presence of flagella encoding genes in the extracted mags interestingly none of the mags isolated from the intake seawater and brine contained genes associated with flagella biogenesis however two mags la plm 1 and la plm 2 extracted from the feed inlet and three lb plm 1 lb plm 2 and lb plm 3 from the outlet of the leading ro element contained flagella biosynthesis genes fig 2 table s2 two mags ma plm 1 and ma plm 2 from the feed inlet and two mb plm 1 and mb plm 2 from the outlet of the middle element contained genes that encoded structural and functional proteins of flagella liu and ochman 2007 out of the total nine mags containing flagellar genes four mags contained the same set of 25 genes three mags contained the same set of 11 genes whereas one mag contained ten genes and another possessed eight table s2 interestingly all these mags belonged to planctomycetes it is important to note that these results do not suggest that bacteria found in seawater and brine lacked flagellar biosynthesis genes these results only indicate that bacteria containing these genes were enriched in the biofilm these results also suggest that planctomycetes were selected because of these specific features which might help in the formation of biofilms under harsh conditions the complete list of flagellar biosynthesis genes that were detected is given in table s2 3 6 type iv pili biosynthesis genes were detected in mags extracted from ro membrane biofilm after overcoming hydrodynamic forces bacteria attach to the surface by using organelles such as flagella and type iv pili type iv pili are also crucial for twitching motility which plays an important role in the biofilm formation klausen et al 2003 similarly to flagella only the mags isolated from the biofilm contained genes for type iv pili fig 2 except for lb plm 3 all the planctomycetes mags also carried type iv pili genes table s2 additionally all the bacteria belonging to acidobacteria also carried type iv pili genes fig 2 table s2 acidobacteria are one of the most diverse bacterial phyla but relatively little is known about their physiology and environmental function due to the difficulty in culturing these bacteria kielak et al 2016 however culture independent approaches such as ours in the present study can provide insights into the ecological function of these bacteria their ability to produce pili and eps and their metabolic capabilities to use different carbon and nitrogen sources kielak et al 2016 might allow these bacteria to survive in harsh ro membrane conditions based on the curated genes we can conclude that acidobacterial mags extracted in this study belong to two different species table s2 3 7 qs related genes were not detected in mags contrary to qq related genes ahl based quorum sensing qs plays an important role in the production of eps and the formation of biofilms tan et al 2014 quorum quenching qq degradation of ahls modulate the levels of ahls hence regulating the formation of biofilms paul et al 2009 we curated the mags for the presence of qs and qq genes unexpectedly except for one mag from the intake sample in ptb 1 none of the mags contained biosynthesis genes lasi for ahls fig 5 the same mag also contained two copies of the homoserine lactone efflux protein rhtb the rhtb gene was also detected in br ptb 1 and br ptb 2 fig 2 the absence of qs genes in mags isolated from ro membrane biofilms was unexpected as different bacteria that produce ahls have been isolated from biofouled ro membranes in the past katebian et al 2016 furthermore previous studies have shown that the application of qq or quorum sensing inhibition on ro membranes can delay the biofouling katebian et al 2016 katebian leda and jiang 2017 paul et al 2009 ponnusamy et al 2013 in these studies a reduction in the production of eps and a reduction in biofilm formation were used as an indirect measure of inhibition of qs a direct evidence of the inhibition or degradation of ahls is still lacking however it is unlikely that qs is altogether absent in ro biofilms noting that our extracted mags do not represent the complete microbial diversity of ro biofilm there might be some bacteria not represented in our mags that harbor qs genes nevertheless the fact that the majority of mags extracted from the ro biofilm lack the genes for qs it is possible that qs does not play a significant role in the biofouling of the ro membrane the harsh conditions due to high salinity and high pressure may not offer favorable conditions for qs to take place as ahl molecules are sensitive to environmental factors such as ph and temperatures yates et al 2002 production of ahls by ro biofilm community needs to be confirmed by extraction directly from the biomass obtained from biofouled ro membranes a total of 21 mags across all samples contained qq genes fifteen mags contained qq acylase 14 quip and one pvdq and six mags contained qq lactonase fig 2 table s2 the widespread detection of qq enzymes in mags was interesting indeed qq enzymes especially acylases are known to confer antimicrobial resistance kusada et al 2017 actinobacteria a major producer of antimicrobials were found to contain both types of qq enzymes the lactonase aiia and the acylase quip barka et al 2016 table s2 the presence of antimicrobial producing actinobacteria and the higher abundance of antimicrobial resistance imparting qq genes suggest a competitive interaction within the ro biofilm community rendueles and ghigo 2015 3 8 nitrate reduction genes are prevalent in mags extracted from ro membrane biofilm several previous studies have suggested that nitrate reducing bacteria played an important ecological role in the formation of biofilms on ro membranes nagaraj et al 2017 pang and liu 2007 we therefore curated the mags to identify genes involved in nitrate reduction and found four mags la plm 2 lb plm 2 ma plm 2 mb plm 2 that contained the whole set of genes involved in nitrate reduction narghijk fig 2 moreno vivian et al 1999 these bins also contained a gene for the nitrate transporter nasa the genes involved in nitrate reduction that we detected in the different mags are given in table s2 the presence of different classes of nitrate reduction genes suggests that the bacteria on ro membranes use nitrate for respiration and the assimilation of nitrogen into biomass kuypers et al 2018 assimilatory nitrate reductase nasc was detected in four bins of which one belonged to planctomycetes lb plm 3 one belonged to proteobacteria in ptb 1 two others belonged to actinobacteria ma anb 1 mb anb 1 fig 2 table s2 the protein products of nasc and narb genes were found located in the cytoplasm where they catalyze the first step of the assimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite subsequently converted into ammonia moreno vivian et al 1999 actinobacteria have been shown to contain a complete set of genes required for nitrate reduction and its incorporation into biomass feng et al 2014 interestingly the nar gene operon was detected only in the planctomycetes these bacteria are known to play an important role in global nitrogen cycling fuerst and sagulenko 2011 nitrate reductases nar are membrane associated and their activity leads to the generation of a proton motive force and synthesis of atp nitrate reduction occurs in anoxic environments and biofilms are known to contain such regions von ohle et al 2010 these anoxic areas may offer suitable niches for nitrate reducing bacteria nitrate reductases belonging to nap were detected only in acidobacteria la acb 1 lb acb 1 these enzymes are located in the periplasm and nitrate reduction in periplasm does not lead to the generation of a proton motive force kuypers et al 2018 moreno vivian et al 1999 these nitrate reductases are mainly responsible for maintaining the oxidation reduction potential in cells sparacino watkins et al 2014 we also curated these mags for the presence of ammonium oxidation genes but did not detect any we therefore concluded that neither of these genes were carried by the mags or that their sequences were very different from common ammonium oxidation genes to confirm whether or not nitrate and ammonium was available to these bacteria we quantified nitrate and ammonium in the ro feed water obtained from the same ro plant in ro feed we detected nitrate at a concentration of 0 126 mg l whereas ammonium was below the detection limit based on these results we suggest the possibility that nitrate gets concentrated at the membrane enough to sustain the denitrifiers and the biofilm community presence of nitrates in ro feed and enrichment of nitrate reduction genes in ro biofilm community strongly suggest that nitrate reduction play an important role in the survival of this community nitrate reducers identified in this study were phylogenetically different from those identified in previous studies fig 2 nagaraj et al 2017 pang and liu 2007 past studies suggested that the universal primers used for amplification of bacterial 16s rrna genes were not effective for planctomycetes guo et al 2014 pang and liu 2007 as a result certain species of this phylum may have been over looked in the 16s rrna based analysis conducted on biofouled ro membranes we found the planctomycetes mags extracted in this study to be closely related to genus pirellula fig 3 the genome of p staleyi has been sequenced its genome size is 6 2mbp and its gc content is 57 5 clum et al 2009 although the size of the genome and the gc content of the planctomycetes mags are different from p staleyi but similar to our mags genomes of p staleyi contain genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis and nitrate reduction planctomycetes are a ubiquitous yet largely unexplored group of bacteria these bacteria have certain unusual features such as intracellular compartments separated by internal membranes which distinguish them from other bacteria fuerst and sagulenko 2011 however recent studies support a planctomycetal cell plan more similar to gram negative bacteria albeit with some differences boedeker et al 2017 a better understanding of the structure and function of these bacteria and their unusual features might provide an opportunity to develop measures for targeted control of these bacteria 4 conclusions we investigated the microbial community composition and functional potential of the ro membrane biofilm harvested from a full scale ro plant we found that proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the dominant bacteria in ro biofilms it is possible that these bacteria are positively selected because of their competitive advantage in the conditions prevailing in the ro membranes the age of the ro module did not seem to be a factor affecting the composition and functional potential of the microbial community the metagenomics and binning used in this study enabled us to extract the genome sequences of the most abundant bacteria found on ro membranes i e planctomycetes acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and archaea some of these bacteria were difficult to culture and hence their role in biofouling on ro membranes remained obscure mags of these bacteria provided insights into the role of these bacteria in the biofouling of ro membranes most of the mags extracted from ro biofilm samples belong to planctomycetes the planctomycetes mags carry genes such as pili and flagella that play an essential role in early stages of biofilm formation the energy generating nitrate reduction genes were exclusively detected in planctomycetes mags suggesting that these bacteria can survive in anaerobic niches of biofilm availability of nitrate in ro feed water lends support to this assumption therefore we argue that the development of pretreatment methods that target planctomycetes could help mitigate biofouling in the ro system to achieve this a better understanding of the physiology of planctomycetes is required furthermore the source water should be treated to remove nitrate so that ro feed is devoid of these substrates to this end the use of compounds such as azide chlorate cyanide and thiocyanide known to inhibit nitrate reductases should be explored moreno vivian et al

19152,biofouling of reverse osmosis ro membrane is a significant issue for the water treatment industry in this study we apply the metagenomic shot gun sequencing technology to characterise the composition and functional potential of the microbial community in a full scale ro plant at different stages of seawater treatment we find proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes to be the most abundant bacterial phyla the genetic potential of the ro membrane microbial community shows the enrichment of genes involved in biofilm formation representing the selective pressure of the biofilm formation process we recover 31 metagenome assembled genomes mags from intake raw seawater fouled ro membranes leading and middle ro module and brine reject water a total of 25 mags are recovered from the biofilm samples leading and middle ro modules with 9 of them 36 belonging to planctomycetes we investigate all 25 mags for genes pili flagella quorum sensing quorum quenching and nitrate reduction that play an important role in biofilm formation and sustenance of cells we show that planctomycetes contain genes for the formation of flagella and pili and the reduction of nitrate although genes for quorum sensing are not detected quorum quenching genes are identified in the biofilm mags our results show that planctomycetes along with other microbes play an important role in the formation and sustenance of biofilms on seawater ro membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords metagenomics reverse osmosis seawater desalination membrane biofouling membrane based water treatment 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is becoming one of the preferred technologies for the desalination of seawater due to its low energy costs associated with the production of drinking water globally 63 7 of all the desalinated water is produced by membrane processes cost requirements have led many countries to move from thermal based desalination to ro membrane based desalination for the production of drinking water ghaffour et al 2013 to this day the biofouling of ro membranes has remained the most common practical problem that significantly contributes to operational costs the attachment of microbes present in seawater causes the biofouling of the membrane surface which eventually reduces flux and permeate quality fritzmann et al 2007 biofouling or biofilm formation is a dynamic process that involves several steps surface conditioning microbial attachment growth and finally dispersion flemming 1997 khan et al 2013a composition of microbial community of biofilm can change with time depending on functional requirements of the biofilm community flemming et al 2016 since the biofilm microbial community changes over time it is interesting to explore the diversity and functional potential of this microbial community on ro membranes after completion of their operational lifespan nagaraj et al 2017 the purpose of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of microbial communities present at different satges of seawater ro treatment and the functions they perform to thrive in these harsh conditions therefore rational methods guided by the metabolic potential or needs of the microbial community can be employed to mitigate biofouling oh et al 2017 many studies have explored the microbial diversity at various stages of water treatment at ro plants belila et al 2016 khan et al 2013a manes et al 2011 however most of these studies were performed either on lab scale ro systems or on full scale ro plants run for a short period only bereschenko et al 2008 khan et al 2013b kim et al 2014 a good knowledge of the microbial community composition may be used to predict the functional potential of the microbial community based on taxonomic association manes et al 2011 although informative the derived functions may not represent the actual functional role of the ro microbial community because organisms in biofilms undergo differentiation in response to changes in the local environment bereschenko et al 2008 flemming et al 2016 metagenomic analyses provide information about the functional and ecological roles of microbial communities which cannot be obtained from a 16s rrna gene analysis thomas et al 2012 decreasing costs of high throughput sequencing makes metagenomic analysis a method of choice to study microbial communities the assembly of metagenome sequencing reads allow the extraction of the complete microbial genomes otherwise difficult to culture the extracted genomes can be investigated for the presence of genes that play an important role in biofilm formation to our knowledge no metagenomic study has been conducted on microbial communities of seawater ro membranes obtained from a full scale ro plant and used for an extended period 5 7 years in this study we use a whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach to investigate the diversity and genetic potential of microbes found in intake seawater ro membranes and brine we collect ro membrane samples from ro modules of different ages which allows us to study how the age of the biofilm affects the microbial diversity of the membrane furthermore we recover nearly complete metagenome assembled genomes mags from the sequenced data and investigate these mags for their potential ecological role in biofilm formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling all the samples water and membranes were obtained on 17th feb 2016 from a desalination plant 22 299815 n 39 116812 e at king abdullah university of science and technology located on the red sea coast of the kingdom of saudi arabia this plant has a production capacity of 40 000 m3 day to cater the needs of the kaust community and is operated as follows intake water from the red sea is screened using fine screen filters and subsequently chlorinated once a week before being subjected to spruce media filters smf after smf treatment the water enters into a ro treatment train which several treatment steps 1 dosing anti scalant 2 cartridge filtration 10 μm pore size 3 neutralization of the chlorine that can damage the ro membrane using sodium bisulfite sbs 4 addition of caustic soda to the ro permeate to increase the ph which increases the rejection of boron in the second pass ro treatment the first pass ro treatment has four trains and each train has 140 pressure vessels with each vessel containing seven ro membrane modules toray tmc820c 400 for our study samples of intake sweater and brine were collected on the same day using 5l autoclaved glass bottles ro membrane samples were obtained from two different ro modules seven years and five years old a pressure vessel contained 7 ro modules in series the seven years old ro module was harvested from the leading position whereas the five years old module was collected from the middle of the ro module fig 1 samples from the seven years old module were designated as l leading and samples from the five years old module were labelled as m middle the membrane samples from the entry and exit points of the ro module were collected and referred to as la and lb respectively similarly membrane samples from entry and exit of the middle module were designated ma and mb respectively membranes pieces of 1 cm2 were cut at a distance of 5 cm from the entry and exit points of the seawater in the module the leading membrane module was visibly more biofouled compared to the middle module fig s1 2 2 dna extraction three litres of water samples intake and brine were filtered through 0 2 μm membrane filters millipore usa under vacuum the filters were cut into small pieces and stored at 80 c in cryogenic tubes thermofisher scientific usa until dna extraction similarly ro membranes were cut into small pieces before storage at 80 c before extraction filters and membrane samples were vortexed vigorously in 500 μl of 1x te buffer to remove the biomass which was then concentrated by centrifugation at 6000 xg at room temperature a qiaamp dna mini kit qiagen germany was used for the dna extraction using protocol for dna purification from tissues following the manufacturer s instructions the quantity and quality of dna were both measured using the nanodrop thermofisher scientific usa and qubit br dna assay kits from invitrogen usa the concentration of dna obtained for intake and brine was 1 53 ng μl and 1 45 ng μl respectively while for biofilm samples la was 0 86 ng μl lb was 0 492 ng μl ma was 0 1 ng μl and mb was 0 192 ng μl the dna from biofilm samples was concentrated dna clean concentration kit zymo research usa before library preparation as a control for dna extraction kit filtration unit environment and filters 0 5 l of dna free water was subjected to filtration and dna extraction however no dna was detected 2 3 metagenome sequencing a library for shotgun metagenome sequencing was prepared using a truseq nano dna lt kit per manufacturer instructions illumina usa briefly 100 ng of the dna from each sample was fragmented to obtain 350bp insert size the fragments overhangs were repaired to obtain blunt ends after size selection 3 ends of fragments were adenylated followed by adapter ligation and library enrichment by pcr libraries were quantified and normalized to 10 nm the libraries were pooled and sequenced on hiseq 4000 illumina usa 2x150bp paired end platform at kaust s biosciences core labs sequence data obtained in this study were submitted to the genbank bioproject prjna480846 and sra accession srp153197 the mags sequences were submitted to ddbj ena genbank the mag ids and their accession numbers are given in table s3 2 4 quality filtering and assembly of metagenome reads raw reads obtained in the fastq format were processed for quality filtering using a cutadapt package martin 2011 for quality trimming phred quality score q 20 was applied and reads smaller than 130bp were discarded trimmed reads were assembled using spades version 3 11 1 bankevich et al 2012 the reads were mapped back to the assembly using bowtie 2 version 2 3 3 1 to generate coverage files for metagenomic binning langmead and salzberg 2012 the sequence alignment map sam files were converted to binary alignment map bam format using samtools li et al 2009 mags were retrieved from metagenomic assembly by binning the contigs to achieve this we used concoct version 0 4 1 which combines sequence composition coverage information of contigs across samples and read pair linkage to cluster them into individual bins alneberg et al 2014 mags were refined manually if needed by using anvi o interactive graphical interface this interface allows users to visualize the bins and to add or remove contigs based on coverage gc contents and taxonomic assignments in real time a contig was removed from a bin if its coverage gc content or taxonomy was not consistent with the other contigs in that bin completeness and contamination of the mags were also calculated by anvi o by employing a set of 139 bacteria single copy core genes bscgs campbell et al 2013 eren et al 2015 absence or multiple occurrence of these genes determine the completeness and contamination of the bins the mags were annotated using prokka seemann 2014 the gff3 files produced by prokka were analyzed by roary pan genome pipeline page et al 2015 by using roary we calculated the entire gene content of individual mags the resulting csv files were used to search for the presence absence of a particular gene and number of its copies a taxonomic classification of the sequencing reads was performed by kaiju menzel et al 2016 at the protein level by translating reads into amino acids the minimum match score was set to 75 and the minimum match length set to 11 taxonomic information obtained by kaiju transferred to the ampvis2 package albertsen et al 2015 after minor modification as per data requirements mentioned for the ampvis2 package guide the ampvis2 package was used for analysis and visualization of the processed metagenomic reads phylogenetic analysis was performed for the recovered mags and closely related genomes downloaded from ncbi genome repository to achieve this the mags and closely related genomes were imported in anvi o to create a set of concatenated ribosomal proteins the anvi o command anvi get sequences for hmm hits was used with concatenate flag to generate concatenated amino acid sequences the phylogenetic tree was computed by mega7 using the concatenated amino acid sequences by applying neighbor joining statistical method kumar et al 2016 branch node support values were calculated by performing 1000 bootstrap iterations and using the poisson model 2 5 chemical analysis water samples 50 ml from the ro plant were collected just before it enters into ro pressure vessels samples were filtered with 0 4 μm syringe filter transported to the lab at 4 c and processed immediately ammonium and nitrate were measured spectrophotometrically using hach uk kits cat lck304 and cat lck339 respectively per manufacturer instructions 3 results and discussion 3 1 general genome features and metadata total dna was extracted from the intake seawater ro membranes and brine reject and deeply sequenced to obtain a system wide view of the microbial community the statistics of raw and processed sequence reads are given in table s1 the assembled metagenome allowed us to extract 31 near complete genomes of the most abundant microbes three from the intake 13 from the lead membrane modules 12 from the middle membrane modules and three from the brine reject fig 2 these mags exhibited various levels of completeness redundancy gc content number of contigs size and abundance fig 2 all the mags shown here were more than 50 complete and redundancy was less than 10 except for br ptb 2 these mags represent the majority of the population in various samples for example 75 intake 50 membrane biofilm and 28 brine of the total population the assembly of the metagenomic sequences into high quality mags made it possible to investigate the ecological roles and genetic potential of uncultivable bacteria in their respective ecosystems 3 2 phylogenetic identification of mags the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the recovered population genomes based on a set of concatenated ribosomal protein sequences fig 3 the phylogenetic analysis of mags showed that the majority of mags 27 out of 31 belonged to domain bacteria whereas four mags la cra 1 lb cra 1 ma cra 1 mb cra 1 belonged to domain archaea the bacterial mags belonged to phyla acidobacteria 6 actinobacteria 2 bacteroidetes 6 planctomycetes 9 and proteobacteria 4 whereas archeal mags belonged to the phylum crenarchaeota interestingly all the mags were phylogenetically more closely related to each other than to the other members of the specific group fig 3 the differentiation caused by the local conditions for an extended period of five to seven years appeared to have driven these microbes evolutionarily closer to each other flemming et al 2016 this suggests that the ro biofilm does not represent the concentration of microorganisms present in the source water but a specialized community that is actively developing and evolving bereschenko et al 2008 interestingly bins isolated from intake and brine belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroidetes whereas the majority of mags from the membrane s biofilm belonged to planctomycetes mags belonging to planctomycetes acidobacteria actinobacteria and crenarchaeota were found exclusively in biofilm samples previous studies showed that proteobacteria were dominant in the marine environment and also on fouled ro membranes bereschenko et al 2008 manes et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2017 the absence of proteobacterial mags in biofilm samples does not mean that these bacteria were not part of ro biofilm community possible reasons for the absence of proteobacterial bins could be the low coverage or higher intra population diversity of proteobacteria alneberg et al 2014 it is also possible that proteobacterial mags were below the threshold level of 10 contamination and 50 completion so they were excluded 3 3 read based microbial community structure in the full scale ro plant an analysis of the microbial community based on sequencing reads revealed that proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla detected in all samples fig 4 a however there were differences in the relative abundance of different phyla in the membrane biofilm community la lb ma and mb as compared to the brine and intake seawater bacterial community proteobacteria represented the main population in intake seawater 64 and brine 67 bacteroidetes were the second most abundant bacterial phyla detected in intake 16 and brine 10 our results are in agreement with belila et al who reported a similar structure of the microbial community for the intake seawater collected from the same ro plant belila et al 2016 furthermore similar microbial community compositions have been reported by previous studies on ro source waters in different parts of the world manes et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 although the phylum proteobacteria is less abundant 32 in membrane biofilm samples than in intake and brine they were the dominant bacterial phylum on ro membranes the same observation was made in previous studies conducted on fouled ro membranes bereschenko et al 2008 manes et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 it has been suggested that members of the proteobacteria act as primary colonizers during the biofilm formation nagaraj et al 2017 the dominant species of proteobacteria detected in intake seawater was rhodobacteraceae bacterium him11 in the ro biofilm we found woeseia oceani to be the main species and candidatus pelagibacter ubique was dominant in brine fig s2 proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum detected in all samples therefore we investigated the differences in abundance for the various classes of this phylum contained in the samples we found that alphaproteobacteria 49 6 were the dominant in brine followed by intake 38 4 and biofilm samples 13 3 fig 4b gammaproteobacteria were higher in intake seawater 19 8 compared to biofilm 8 8 and brine 11 4 betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were enriched in all the biofilm samples 4 5 compared to intake 2 5 and brine 2 7 fig 4b betaproteobacteria such as burkholderiales are known to migrate as eps embedded aggregates of bacterial cells bereschenko et al 2008 and that the abundance of burkholderiales is directly correlated with the thickness of the biofilm nagaraj et al 2017 a recent study on the biofilm formation in the nutrient limited brine pools of the red sea showed that deltaproteobacteria were enriched in biofilm samples zhang et al 2015 our results support the hypothesis that deltaproteobacteria are enriched in extreme environments because of their ability to withstand and survive in such conditions vigneron et al 2016 fig 4b the lower relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria and higher relative abundance of betaproteobacteria in ro biofilm communities were previously reported by khan et al and nagaraj et al khan et al 2013b nagaraj et al 2017 similar to our findings the abundance of proteobacteria in all samples may be the result of their ubiquitous presence in marine environments stevens et al 2005 certain members of proteobacteria e g sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales produce sticky eps that allow these bacteria to withstand shear forces generated by a high water flow furthermore eps produced by these bacteria condition the membranes so that secondary colonizers can attach eventually leading to a flux decline nagaraj et al 2017 in biofilm samples planctomycetes were the second most abundant 28 phyla followed by bacteroidetes 8 fig 4a however another study reported bacteroidetes as the second most dominant bacterial phyla on fouled ro membranes in operation for seven years nagaraj et al 2017 such differences in composition of the bacterial community present on fouled ro membranes were not unexpected microbial groups on ro membranes can be influenced by pretreatment methods membrane material and the operational parameters iorhemen et al 2016 it should be noted that planctomycetes were found to be 2 for both intake and brine however their abundance increased in the biofilm of la 22 lb 25 ma 33 and mb 32 the dominant species of planctomycetes detected in biofilm samples were blastopirellula marina and pirellula staleyi fig s2 previous studies have reported a higher abundance of planctomycetes on fouled ro membranes however there function in ro biofilm community remained unclear bereschenko et al 2008 khan et al 2013b manes et al 2011 extraction of planctomycetes mags allowed us to study the genetic potential of these microorganisms and their role in ro biofilm community the following bacterial phyla were also detected in our samples actinobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi cyanobacteria verrucomicrobia acidobacteria nitrospirae and chlamydiae fig 4a 3 4 phylogenetic beta diversity the beta diversity was analyzed for all samples taxonomy based pcoa showed that biofilm samples la lb ma and mb clustered together along both the pco1 and pco2 axes suggesting the presence of a very similar microbial community in all these samples fig 5 intake and brine had identical pco1 values whereas pco2 was different indicating that the microbial communities in intake and brine were similar with some differences but differed from the community present in the biofilm samples fig 4 this was expected as the microbes in seawater and brine experienced very different environmental conditions compared to biofilm however biofilms were attached to ro membranes and experience higher shear forces and temperature also the biofilm microbial community evolved over the operation period 5 7 years to withstand the prevailing environmental conditions rendered this community distinct from the source community the location of the ro module and the age of the biofilm did not have a strong impact on microbial community composition however the seven year old microbial community on the leading module la and lb was found more similar compared to the five year old middle module ma and mb figs 4 and 5 beta diversity plot substantiated the results shown in fig 4 indicating that the microbial community composition of intake seawater and brine were similar but differed from the composition of biofilm samples 3 5 flagellar biosynthesis genes are enriched in mags extracted from the ro membrane biofilm the formation of biofilm is a complex process that involves the expression of many genes it also depends on the hydrodynamic conditions and the surface properties such as roughness hydrophobicity and charge kostakioti et al 2013 nguyen et al 2012 ro membranes come with a variety of surface properties and high pressure 55 68 bar is applied on the feed side to push the water across the membrane fritzmann et al 2007 it has been shown that flagellar motility plays an important role in the initial attachment in overcoming the repulsive forces created by surface chemistry and severe hydrodynamic conditions lemon et al 2007 toutain et al 2005 furthermore flagella can reach into crevices and thus enable bacteria to attach to surfaces with variety of topographies friedlander et al 2013 we investigated the presence of flagella encoding genes in the extracted mags interestingly none of the mags isolated from the intake seawater and brine contained genes associated with flagella biogenesis however two mags la plm 1 and la plm 2 extracted from the feed inlet and three lb plm 1 lb plm 2 and lb plm 3 from the outlet of the leading ro element contained flagella biosynthesis genes fig 2 table s2 two mags ma plm 1 and ma plm 2 from the feed inlet and two mb plm 1 and mb plm 2 from the outlet of the middle element contained genes that encoded structural and functional proteins of flagella liu and ochman 2007 out of the total nine mags containing flagellar genes four mags contained the same set of 25 genes three mags contained the same set of 11 genes whereas one mag contained ten genes and another possessed eight table s2 interestingly all these mags belonged to planctomycetes it is important to note that these results do not suggest that bacteria found in seawater and brine lacked flagellar biosynthesis genes these results only indicate that bacteria containing these genes were enriched in the biofilm these results also suggest that planctomycetes were selected because of these specific features which might help in the formation of biofilms under harsh conditions the complete list of flagellar biosynthesis genes that were detected is given in table s2 3 6 type iv pili biosynthesis genes were detected in mags extracted from ro membrane biofilm after overcoming hydrodynamic forces bacteria attach to the surface by using organelles such as flagella and type iv pili type iv pili are also crucial for twitching motility which plays an important role in the biofilm formation klausen et al 2003 similarly to flagella only the mags isolated from the biofilm contained genes for type iv pili fig 2 except for lb plm 3 all the planctomycetes mags also carried type iv pili genes table s2 additionally all the bacteria belonging to acidobacteria also carried type iv pili genes fig 2 table s2 acidobacteria are one of the most diverse bacterial phyla but relatively little is known about their physiology and environmental function due to the difficulty in culturing these bacteria kielak et al 2016 however culture independent approaches such as ours in the present study can provide insights into the ecological function of these bacteria their ability to produce pili and eps and their metabolic capabilities to use different carbon and nitrogen sources kielak et al 2016 might allow these bacteria to survive in harsh ro membrane conditions based on the curated genes we can conclude that acidobacterial mags extracted in this study belong to two different species table s2 3 7 qs related genes were not detected in mags contrary to qq related genes ahl based quorum sensing qs plays an important role in the production of eps and the formation of biofilms tan et al 2014 quorum quenching qq degradation of ahls modulate the levels of ahls hence regulating the formation of biofilms paul et al 2009 we curated the mags for the presence of qs and qq genes unexpectedly except for one mag from the intake sample in ptb 1 none of the mags contained biosynthesis genes lasi for ahls fig 5 the same mag also contained two copies of the homoserine lactone efflux protein rhtb the rhtb gene was also detected in br ptb 1 and br ptb 2 fig 2 the absence of qs genes in mags isolated from ro membrane biofilms was unexpected as different bacteria that produce ahls have been isolated from biofouled ro membranes in the past katebian et al 2016 furthermore previous studies have shown that the application of qq or quorum sensing inhibition on ro membranes can delay the biofouling katebian et al 2016 katebian leda and jiang 2017 paul et al 2009 ponnusamy et al 2013 in these studies a reduction in the production of eps and a reduction in biofilm formation were used as an indirect measure of inhibition of qs a direct evidence of the inhibition or degradation of ahls is still lacking however it is unlikely that qs is altogether absent in ro biofilms noting that our extracted mags do not represent the complete microbial diversity of ro biofilm there might be some bacteria not represented in our mags that harbor qs genes nevertheless the fact that the majority of mags extracted from the ro biofilm lack the genes for qs it is possible that qs does not play a significant role in the biofouling of the ro membrane the harsh conditions due to high salinity and high pressure may not offer favorable conditions for qs to take place as ahl molecules are sensitive to environmental factors such as ph and temperatures yates et al 2002 production of ahls by ro biofilm community needs to be confirmed by extraction directly from the biomass obtained from biofouled ro membranes a total of 21 mags across all samples contained qq genes fifteen mags contained qq acylase 14 quip and one pvdq and six mags contained qq lactonase fig 2 table s2 the widespread detection of qq enzymes in mags was interesting indeed qq enzymes especially acylases are known to confer antimicrobial resistance kusada et al 2017 actinobacteria a major producer of antimicrobials were found to contain both types of qq enzymes the lactonase aiia and the acylase quip barka et al 2016 table s2 the presence of antimicrobial producing actinobacteria and the higher abundance of antimicrobial resistance imparting qq genes suggest a competitive interaction within the ro biofilm community rendueles and ghigo 2015 3 8 nitrate reduction genes are prevalent in mags extracted from ro membrane biofilm several previous studies have suggested that nitrate reducing bacteria played an important ecological role in the formation of biofilms on ro membranes nagaraj et al 2017 pang and liu 2007 we therefore curated the mags to identify genes involved in nitrate reduction and found four mags la plm 2 lb plm 2 ma plm 2 mb plm 2 that contained the whole set of genes involved in nitrate reduction narghijk fig 2 moreno vivian et al 1999 these bins also contained a gene for the nitrate transporter nasa the genes involved in nitrate reduction that we detected in the different mags are given in table s2 the presence of different classes of nitrate reduction genes suggests that the bacteria on ro membranes use nitrate for respiration and the assimilation of nitrogen into biomass kuypers et al 2018 assimilatory nitrate reductase nasc was detected in four bins of which one belonged to planctomycetes lb plm 3 one belonged to proteobacteria in ptb 1 two others belonged to actinobacteria ma anb 1 mb anb 1 fig 2 table s2 the protein products of nasc and narb genes were found located in the cytoplasm where they catalyze the first step of the assimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite subsequently converted into ammonia moreno vivian et al 1999 actinobacteria have been shown to contain a complete set of genes required for nitrate reduction and its incorporation into biomass feng et al 2014 interestingly the nar gene operon was detected only in the planctomycetes these bacteria are known to play an important role in global nitrogen cycling fuerst and sagulenko 2011 nitrate reductases nar are membrane associated and their activity leads to the generation of a proton motive force and synthesis of atp nitrate reduction occurs in anoxic environments and biofilms are known to contain such regions von ohle et al 2010 these anoxic areas may offer suitable niches for nitrate reducing bacteria nitrate reductases belonging to nap were detected only in acidobacteria la acb 1 lb acb 1 these enzymes are located in the periplasm and nitrate reduction in periplasm does not lead to the generation of a proton motive force kuypers et al 2018 moreno vivian et al 1999 these nitrate reductases are mainly responsible for maintaining the oxidation reduction potential in cells sparacino watkins et al 2014 we also curated these mags for the presence of ammonium oxidation genes but did not detect any we therefore concluded that neither of these genes were carried by the mags or that their sequences were very different from common ammonium oxidation genes to confirm whether or not nitrate and ammonium was available to these bacteria we quantified nitrate and ammonium in the ro feed water obtained from the same ro plant in ro feed we detected nitrate at a concentration of 0 126 mg l whereas ammonium was below the detection limit based on these results we suggest the possibility that nitrate gets concentrated at the membrane enough to sustain the denitrifiers and the biofilm community presence of nitrates in ro feed and enrichment of nitrate reduction genes in ro biofilm community strongly suggest that nitrate reduction play an important role in the survival of this community nitrate reducers identified in this study were phylogenetically different from those identified in previous studies fig 2 nagaraj et al 2017 pang and liu 2007 past studies suggested that the universal primers used for amplification of bacterial 16s rrna genes were not effective for planctomycetes guo et al 2014 pang and liu 2007 as a result certain species of this phylum may have been over looked in the 16s rrna based analysis conducted on biofouled ro membranes we found the planctomycetes mags extracted in this study to be closely related to genus pirellula fig 3 the genome of p staleyi has been sequenced its genome size is 6 2mbp and its gc content is 57 5 clum et al 2009 although the size of the genome and the gc content of the planctomycetes mags are different from p staleyi but similar to our mags genomes of p staleyi contain genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis and nitrate reduction planctomycetes are a ubiquitous yet largely unexplored group of bacteria these bacteria have certain unusual features such as intracellular compartments separated by internal membranes which distinguish them from other bacteria fuerst and sagulenko 2011 however recent studies support a planctomycetal cell plan more similar to gram negative bacteria albeit with some differences boedeker et al 2017 a better understanding of the structure and function of these bacteria and their unusual features might provide an opportunity to develop measures for targeted control of these bacteria 4 conclusions we investigated the microbial community composition and functional potential of the ro membrane biofilm harvested from a full scale ro plant we found that proteobacteria and planctomycetes were the dominant bacteria in ro biofilms it is possible that these bacteria are positively selected because of their competitive advantage in the conditions prevailing in the ro membranes the age of the ro module did not seem to be a factor affecting the composition and functional potential of the microbial community the metagenomics and binning used in this study enabled us to extract the genome sequences of the most abundant bacteria found on ro membranes i e planctomycetes acidobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and archaea some of these bacteria were difficult to culture and hence their role in biofouling on ro membranes remained obscure mags of these bacteria provided insights into the role of these bacteria in the biofouling of ro membranes most of the mags extracted from ro biofilm samples belong to planctomycetes the planctomycetes mags carry genes such as pili and flagella that play an essential role in early stages of biofilm formation the energy generating nitrate reduction genes were exclusively detected in planctomycetes mags suggesting that these bacteria can survive in anaerobic niches of biofilm availability of nitrate in ro feed water lends support to this assumption therefore we argue that the development of pretreatment methods that target planctomycetes could help mitigate biofouling in the ro system to achieve this a better understanding of the physiology of planctomycetes is required furthermore the source water should be treated to remove nitrate so that ro feed is devoid of these substrates to this end the use of compounds such as azide chlorate cyanide and thiocyanide known to inhibit nitrate reductases should be explored moreno vivian et al

biological approaches zolfaghari et al 2016 jamaly et al 2015 traditional chemical demulsification uses synthesized demulsifiers to assist in o w separation zolfaghari et al 2016 biological demulsification is similar in that it uses demulsifiers biosurfactants produced by bacteria but also the microbial cell surface to achieve effective emulsion breaking hou et al 2014 huang et al 2014 the bacterial cell surface particularly the cell surface associated proteins or lipids has been found to play important roles in the demulsification process huang et al 2014 the produced biosurfactants have also been found with demulsifying power li et al 2012 amirabadi et al 2013 and generally have the advantages of lower toxicity and higher biodegradability and effectiveness over a wider span of ph salinity and temperature conditions when compared with synthetic surfactants muthusamy et al 2008 shekhar et al 2015 when demulsifying bacteria are applied to the emulsions they may produce biosurfactants with demulsifying ability in situ and the cells can be re used das 2001 in view of these intriguing properties biological demulsifiers have been proposed as promising alternatives to chemically synthesized demulsifiers liu et al 2010 microorganisms have many roles when interacting with oil in water such as direct biodegradation and the formation of o w emulsion to enhance biodegradation which have been reported extensively calvo et al 2002 cappello et al 2016 here we focus on another way of utilizing bacteria which has attracted increased research interests in

conducted in duplicate scanning electron microscope sem analysis was conducted to reveal the morphology of the selected isolates following the method used by de sousa and bhosle 2012 briefly bacterial cells were fixed overnight in 2 glutaraldehyde prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer the fixed cells were washed three times with phosphate buffer and dehydrated using an increasing gradient of acetone in distilled water 30 50 70 80 and 90 respectively for 10 min each and finally in 100 acetone for 30 min and air dried the specimens were sputter coated with gold using an auto fine coater and

the concentrations of the surface tension reduction materials bodour and miller maier 1998 the test was conducted following bodour and miller maier 1998 briefly 2 μl of mineral oil was added to each well of a 96 well microtiter plate lid a 5 μl aliquot of bacterial broth was delivered into the center of the well after 1 min the flatness of the water droplet was observed and recorded the droplets

surface of 40 ml of distilled water in a petri dish ø 150 mm to form a thin oil membrane ten μl of bacterial broth was gently added to the center of the oil membrane a clear zone was formed due to the activity of the surfactants the area of the clear zone was used to reflect the concentration of the produced surfactants the results were illustrated as the diameter of the clear zone surface tension measurement st uses du nouy ring method to measures surface interfacial tension harkins and alexander 1959 it was determined in triplicate with a surface tensiometer dunouy tensiometer interfacial csc scientific at 20 3 c following the manufacturer s instruction emulsification index ei reflects the ability of the biosurfactant to form and stabilize emulsions cai et al 2017 ei of the cell free supernatant was determined by adding 5 ml of light mineral oil to the same amount of culture mixing with a vortex for 2 min and letting stand for 24 h the emulsifying activity e24 was calculated using equation 1 1 e24 hel hs 100 where hel is the height of the emulsion layer and hs is the height of the total solution critical micelle dilution measurement cmd of the cell free supernatant was determined following cai et al 2015 cmd can be used to reflect the concentrations of bio surfactant that reduce surface interfacial tension shavandi et al 2011 after centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and discarding the pellet the cell free broth samples were diluted with distilled water while the surface tension of each dilution was measured the cmd was determined as the highest dilution with which the surface tension did not significantly increase as the broth consists of both an aqueous and an oil phase each dilution was conducted with sonication to ensure homogeneity before each measurement the sonicated solution was allowed to stand for 15 20 min to achieve equilibrium cell hydrophobicity ch was evaluated by the method of microbial adhesion to the hydrocarbon math park et al 2000 the cell pellets obtained after centrifuge separation of the whole culture were rinsed with 50 mm phosphorus buffer pbs ph 7 0 twice and then diluted to an initial od580 value of around 0 8 1 0 then 5 ml of this cell suspension was mixed with 1 ml of kerosene in a test tube on a vortex mixer for 2 min the mixture was left undisturbed for 20 min and then the final od580 of the aqueous phase was measured again math was calculated as follows 2 2 m a t h 1 o d 580 f i n a l o d 580 i n i t i a l 100 high math values indicate high affinity of the cells for oils 2 4 oil in water emulsion breaking test span tween kerosene o w emulsion prepared following coutinho et al 2013 was used for this test the emulsion type was confirmed using microscopic visualization after dyeing the oil phase using hydrophobic dye oil red o lee and lee 2000 the fresh emulsion had an emulsion breaking ratio of 15 at 35 c within 48 h for screening test 4 day culture of strains were used for the detailed characterization of the featured isolate halomonas sp n3 2a a 7 day culture was used in which the growth of bacteria in terms of accumulated biomass reached plateau three types of samples were subjected to demulsification assays i e whole culture broth cell free supernatant obtained from centrifuging and cell suspension obtained by dissolving pbs washed cell pellets in the fresh medium the demulsification assay was conducted following wen et al 2010 briefly 1 ml sample or blank were added into a 15 ml vial containing 9 ml of emulsion and sealed with silicone rubber the test tube was agitated in a vortex for 30 s the tube was kept undisturbed in an upright position in an incubator at 35 c the changes in the volume of the oil phase top water phase bottom and emulsion phase in between were recorded at certain time intervals for up to 48 h the tests were duplicated demulsification performance was evaluated by the emulsion breaking ratio according to the following equations 3

equation 4 ebr n ebr sample ebr control 1 ebr control 100 2 5 statistical analysis and quality control analysis of variance anova for multiple linear regression was employed to fit a regression line for a response variable ebrn 24h using explanatory variables odc os cmd st ei and ch values the model was reduced using stepwise regression with α to enter 0 05 and α to exit 0 05 principal component analysis pca of the data matrix were conducted with corrplot package in the r project for statistical computing r core team 2013 the data were first log transferred and then centered and scaled to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 prior to the pca analysis venables and ripley 2013 the graphic display of the dominant patterns in the matrix was made using ggplot 2 wickham 2016 it colors each point according to the bacterial species genera and draws a normal contour line with ellipse covering probability default to 68 for each group the mahalanobis distances i e a measure for the separation of the groups taking into account the spreading of the samples within one group were calculated in the overlap data after pca analysis mahalanobis 1930 using r project randomly selected strains 20 were subjected to duplicate runs of all the 7 tests the relative standard error rse in the duplication has been less than 20 demonstrating the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements for strains reported in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 emulsion breaking performance of the isolates the o w emulsion breaking performance of the isolates is summarized in fig 1 after 24 h the ebr values were found to be in a range of 19 41 97 60 for the tested strains ebrn 12h and ebrn 24h are comparable except for few strains e g n3 8a and n2 3p which exhibited a lag in demulsification fig 1 also shows the result trends of the 6 screening tests sorted by a descending ebrn 24h os showed similar descending trend with that of ebrn 24h interestingly ch served as a supplementary role to os fig 1a for the strains with high ebrn 24h their os were generally high or when os was low it was accompanied by a high ch to achieve a high ebrn in the contrast the trends of the 4 other tests i e odc st cmd and ie seemed irrelevant fig 1b os is an assay based on change of the contact angle at the oil water interface with the quantity of the added bio surfactants morikawa et al 1993 ch demonstrates the affinity of microbial cells to the oil phase the native cell hydrophobicity has been attributed to certain proteins and lipids present in the cell wall huang et al 2014 kaczorek et al 2008 the generation of surface active compounds also likely lead to cell bound components that affect the ch readings kuyukina et al 2001 therefore ch and os correlate to the concentrations of surface interfacial active compounds and the affinity of the microbial cells to the oil phase respectively studies on the biological demulsification of water in oil emulsion have found that microorganisms modify the emulsion properties by employing either their hydrophobic cell surfaces or the extracellular amphiphilic biosurfactants to replace the emulsifier molecules zolfaghari et al 2016 as a result interfacial tension gradient is reduced which leads to the thinning of the interfacial film and eventually phase separation wen et al 2010 in this study both os and ch readings were found to be positively and significantly influencing the ebrn readings this suggests that similar mechanisms are behind the demulsification of o w emulsion with wide variety of bacteria examined in this study the results obtained agreed with the findings of park et al 2000 and coutinho et al 2013 that strains with high demulsification efficiency tend to have high cell hydrophobicity and interfacial activity detailed investigation on how cell surface compositions of the diverse bacterial strains isolated in this study affect the cell hydrophobicity and interfacial activity and thus the demulsification of o w emulsions will be included in the future studies 3 2 identification of the demulsifying bacteria targeting oily wastewater with o w emulsion table 1 provides a summary of the results of bacterial identification emulsion breaking test and the 6 screening tests thirty seven demulsifying bacteria belong to 5 genera namely acinetobacter bacillus halomonas pseudomonas and rhodococcus were isolated fig 2 the sources of these bacteria were harbor seawater sample id cbs offshore crude oil samples sample ids coa and cob raw produced water from offshore oil reservoirs sample ids ma and mb four coastal sediment samples collected at a refinery outlet sample ids n1 n2 n3 and n4 and four treated produced water samples collected from offshore oil reservoirs sample ids p1 p5 p6 and p9 the isolated bacteria belong to 15 species as illustrated in the phylogenetic tree fig 1 the tree also shows three o w emulsion breaking bacteria described in the literature i e pseudomonas aeruginosa msj coutinho et al 2013 bacillus mojavensis xh1 li et al 2012 and streptomyces sp aa8321 park et al 2000 fig 2 these species are in the divisions of firmicutes actinobacteria and proteobacteria fig 2 the 15 new bacteria reported here significantly expands the knowledge of o w emulsion breaking bacteria in this study several strains belonging to halomonas acinetobacter and rhodococcus were reported as o w emulsion breaking agents for the first time moreover although some acinetobacter nadarajah et al 2002 and rhodococcus strains wen et al 2010 were found to demulsify water in oil emulsion halomonas hasn t been reported with destabilizing ability for either types of emulsion until this study in this study halomonas venusta strain n3 2a is reported as an emulsion breaking bacterium with excellent efficiency and was examined in greater detail 3 3 demulsification kinetics and mechanisms of halomonas venusta strain n3 2a when the whole broth of halomonas venusta strain n3 2a was used to treat the model emulsion the ebrn was low in the first 4 h and jumped at the 5th hour subsequently the ebrn was increasing with a steady rate until it reached around 92 5 at 24 h when only supernatant was used no emulsion breaking was observed within the first 5 h and then the ebrn steadily increased to 77 when only cells were used no emulsion breaking was observed within the first 9 h and then ebrn slowing increased with a rate that much lower than with whole broth and supernatant till it reached 25 fig 3 a this indicates that both cellular cell bound and extracellular bio demulsifiers contributed to the demulsification the combined ebrn of supernatant and cells were significantly lower than the whole broth within the first 12 h fig 3b this significantly more rapid increase in ebr of the whole broth could be important it indicates that there may a loss of certain cell soluble components that contributed to the demulsification due to the pellet washing using pbs or a synergetic effect between bacterial cells and extracellular bio demulsifiers similar phenomenon was also observed by nadarajah et al 2002 when using a mixed bacterial culture extracellular bio demulsifiers biosurfactants were found with stronger impact on emulsion breaking halomonas strains have been found with ability to produce glycoprotein type gutierrez et al 2007 or glycolipid type dhasayan et al 2014 pepi et al 2005 of biosurfactants further characterization of the extracellular bio demulsifiers biosurfactants produced by halomonas venusta strain n3 2a will be conducted in future research oily wastewater oil can contain oil that is floating dispersed emulsified and dissolved stable emulsified oil poses a major challenge for o w separation during wastewater treatment stable emulsified oil has droplet diameters 2 μm coca et al 2011 they are immune from some primary treatments such as gravity separation owing to the small droplet size stewart and arnold 2008 microfiltration and ultrafiltration as secondary wastewater treatment techniques can effectively remove o w emulsion however membrane fouling due to surfactant or oil adhere on the pore walls can significantly lower the membrane life and increase the treatment costs ahmad et al 2005 the addition of effective demulsifiers to coalesce the droplets into significantly larger sizes or even separated phases prior to gravity separation and coagulation flocculation is thus a promising approach to treat oily wastewater with emulsified oil coca et al 2011 yang et al 2016 nowadays the dominate players in the o w demulsifier market are iron and alumina sulphates mancini et al 2017 as well as chemically synthesized polyelectrolytes surfactants and polymers coca et al 2011 talingting pabalan et al 2010 bacterial demulsifiers although they may have great potential lag far behind in terms of the maturity of research and development this study assists in their development the results demonstrated the high emulsion breaking efficiency of halomonas venusta strain n3 2a in a batch scale test that are typically used to screen potential demulsifiers nishimaki et al 1999 the emulsion breaking efficiency is comparable with recently reported o w demulsifying bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa msj coutinho et al 2013 and bacillus mojavensis xh1 li et al 2012 the feasibility of the reported biodemulsifier will be further examined in multiple scale treatment tests in future studies 3 4 characterization of a demulsifying bacterium halomonas venusta strain n3 2a the polymerase chain reaction pcr reaction obtained almost full length 1500 bp 16s rdna fragments for the selected isolates the five replicates agreed well with each other genebank accession no mh251262 the demulsifying bacterium halomonas venusta strain n3 2a was found to be closely related to h venusta dsm 4743t h hydrothermalis atcc baa 800t and h axialensis atcc baa 802t with similarities of 99 5 99 3 and 97 9 respectively the phylogenetic tree based on 16s rdna sequences of halomonas sp n3 2a and 6 close related type strains is constructed fig 4 a halomonas belong to the order of oceanospirillales most species of this order are halophilic and halotolerant garrity et al 2005 hitherto none of the strains belonging to this genus have been reported with demulsifying ability the similarity dissimilarity of the halomonas venusta strain n3 2a and the 6 closely related type strains according to their metabolic profile and plfa compositions are illustrated in fig 4b and c metabolic traits of halomonas sp n3 2a were similar with h venusta dsm 4743t h meridiana dsm 5425t and h variabilis dsm 3051t the membrane plfa profiles of h venusta dsm 4743t h hydrothermalis atcc baa 800t h axialensis atcc baa 802t h meridiana dsm 5425t and h sulfidaeris atcc baa 803t were closely resemble each other halomonas sp n3 2a is slightly different from the above 5 strains halomonas venusta strain n3 2a was rod shaped bacterium with a length of 0 5 1 μm and diameter of around 0 5 μm fig 4d and was significantly smaller than the 6 closely related strains 3 5 evaluation of the screening methods for identifying demulsifying bacteria targeting oily wastewater with o w emulsion in this study in order to evaluate the efficacy of the above tests in relation to emulsion breaking ratio multiple linear regression model and non linear models including quadratic and linear with interaction models were employed they were used to fit the experimental data and shed light on the relationship between the results of the six screening methods explanatory variable and ebr the response variable during pre screening the quadratic model and the two factor interaction model both had sequential p values larger than 0 05 data not shown and were excluded the linear models i e a full model and a reduced model were applied to fit the experimental data when all six screening parameters were used to fit the linear model the model f value of 10 18 implied the model was significant table 2 left side the explanatory variables os and ch were significant with a p value prob f less than 0 05 the insignificant explanatory variables i e odc cmd ei and st are supposed to be removed to improve the model the model r2 value was at 0 6706 indicating 67 06 of variability in the response was explained by the explanatory variables the predicted r2 of 0 5273 was in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 6047 difference 0 2 adequate precision is a measure of the signal to noise ratio and the value of 10 43 the desirable value 4 indicated an adequate signal coefficient of variation c v is the error expressed as a percentage of the mean press is a measure of how well a particular model fits each point in the design both c v and press can be used to evaluate the performances of varies models the lower values indicate better structure of the candidate models after the insignificant model terms are removed the model was reduced table 2 right side the new model r2 value was very close to the full model indicating the majority of variability in the response was explained by the two significant explanatory variables i e os and ch the reduced model had improved adjusted r2 predicted r2 and adequate precision indicating better model explainability predictability and signal to noise ratio the reduced model also had lower c v and press indicating it has lower error and better model structure after the reduction the regression model was the following 5 e b r n 24 h 12 83 8 58 o s 0 30 c h according to the results os and ch are significant explanatory factors that are both positively contribute to the emulsion breaking this finding validated the observation in section 3 1 results of os and ch can be used to predict the emulsion breaking using the obtained regression model os coupled with ch are recommended as the strategy for the screening of demulsifying microorganisms both tests are fast requires no specialized equipment and have potential to be automated to further increase the throughputs 3 6 species genus specific patterns of demulsifying bacteria targeting oily wastewater with o w emulsion principal component analysis pca was applied to investigate the structure of the data and infer species genus specific patterns of the demulsifying bacteria in response to the tests varimax rotated principal component matrix of the 7 factors is summarized in table 3 the components 1 and 2 accounting for 72 01 of total variance in the dataset the dominant variables contributing to variance along component 1 were odc 0 40 os 0 46 cmd 0 45 st 0 42 and ebr 0 42 st and ei showed positive loadings while the others show negative loadings indicating an inverse association between these variables variance along component 2 was accounted for primarily by ei 0 91 the circle of correlations and plot of loadings along components 1 and 2 are shown in fig 5 as vectors v1 to v7 the grouping of bacterial species genera based on their pca scores is illustrated in fig 5 to reflect how strains perform differently in the 7 tests certain degree of overlapping between groups was observed thus the mahalanobis distances between groups are calculated fig 5 insert these results illustrated that when evaluating the isolated bacteria using the seven tested parameters some species genera indeed showed distinct patterns after incubated under the same conditions strains belongs to b thuringiensis were the most distinct group which had significant distances mahalanobis distances 5 from acinetobacter the bacillus others b flexus and b licheniformis halomonas r opacus and rhodococcus others r phenolicus r wratislaviensis r zopfii and r yunnanensis b thuringiensis strains had pca scores that grouped tightly to the high odc os cmd and ebr side and low st side indicating they produced high level of surface tension reducing biosurfactant effectively broke o w emulsion r opacus strains were significantly distant from acinetobacter bacillus others and b thuringiensis pca scores of r opacus strains were grouped at the side of vector v6 and opposite side of vectors v1 v2 v3 and v7 indicating that they had lower efficiency in producing biosurfactants and breaking o w emulsion acinetobacter strains were significantly distant from strains belong to b subtilis b thuringiensis and r opacus and they mostly had high ei readings positive v5 with strong ability to form stabilize emulsions b subtilis strains only had significant distance from acinetobacter strains strains closely related to r erythropolis overlapped with most of the other groups and showed low mahalanobis distances the understanding of the performance patterns of the species genera fills the knowledge gap and provides guidance on the selection of strains for certain biotechnological applications for example acinetobacter strains are suitable for emulsification applications which is evident in many studies navon venezia et al 1995 zosim et al 1982 with a commercialized product i e emulsan 4 conclusions

demulsifying bacteria showed species genus specific patterns in their abilities to reduce surface interfacial tension produce biosurfactant stabilize destabilize emulsion and adhere to hydrocarbons

demulsification is similar in that it uses demulsifiers biosurfactants produced by bacteria but also the microbial cell surface to achieve effective emulsion breaking hou et al 2014 huang et al 2014 the bacterial cell surface particularly the cell surface associated proteins or lipids has been found to play important roles in the demulsification process huang et al 2014 the produced biosurfactants have also been found with demulsifying power li et al 2012 amirabadi et al 2013 and generally have the advantages of lower toxicity and higher biodegradability and effectiveness over a wider span of ph salinity and temperature conditions when compared with synthetic surfactants muthusamy et al 2008 shekhar et al 2015 when demulsifying bacteria are applied to the emulsions they may produce biosurfactants with demulsifying ability in situ and the cells can be re used das 2001 in view of these intriguing properties biological demulsifiers have been proposed as promising alternatives to chemically synthesized demulsifiers liu et al 2010 microorganisms have many roles when interacting with oil in water such as direct biodegradation and the formation of o w emulsion to enhance biodegradation which have been reported extensively calvo et al 2002 cappello et al 2016 here we focus on another way of utilizing bacteria which has attracted increased research interests in the recent years that is to destabilize emulsions for the subsequent separation of oil and water phases achieved using processes such as gravity separation coagulation flocculation filtration hou et al 2014 huang et al 2010 2014 amirabadi et al 2013 research on biological demulsification has primarily focused on water in oil emulsions which are commonly present in waste oil sludge zolfaghari et al 2016 biological demulsification of oil in water emulsions is still at a preliminary stage with few bacteria strains reported li et al 2012 das 2001 coutinho et al 2013 park et al 2000 the ones that have been studied belong to the genera of micrococcus pseudomonas streptomyces and bacillus these demulsifying bacteria were isolated from soil sampled from a gas station in india das 2001 contaminated soil of daqing oil field in china li et al 2012 soil contaminated with refined oil products in brazil coutinho et al 2013 and sediment samples from south korea and antarctica park et al 2000 they are mostly of terrestrial origin marine microorganisms have extraordinary metabolic and physiological capabilities that are rarely found in their terrestrial counterparts satpute et al 2010 cai et al 2014 thus further exploration of novel demulsifying bacteria for o w emulsion especially those of marine origins is warranted an effective and high throughput screening approach to quantify the performance of a large number of microbes both natural and metabolically engineered is critical for rapid development of biotechnology dietrich et al 2010 currently no such screening approach has been identified to specifically target o w demulsifying microbes huang et al 2009 screened water in oil emulsion w o demulsifying bacteria using measurements of surface tension oil spreading and blood plate hemolysis whether the results can be extended to o w emulsion is unknown moreover the tested methods may overlook the mechanism of cell surface interactions during the demulsification huang et

conducted in duplicate scanning electron microscope sem analysis was conducted to reveal the morphology of the selected isolates following the method used by de sousa and bhosle 2012 briefly bacterial cells were fixed overnight in 2 glutaraldehyde prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer the fixed cells were washed three times with phosphate buffer and dehydrated using an increasing gradient of acetone in distilled water 30 50 70 80 and 90 respectively for 10 min each and finally in 100 acetone for 30 min and air dried the specimens were sputter coated with gold using an auto fine coater and visualized using sem fei mla 650f 2 3 screening tests for demulsifying bacteria targeting oily wastewater with o w emulsion oil drop collapse test odc has been found to be positively correlated with the concentrations of the surface tension reduction materials bodour and miller maier 1998 the test was conducted following bodour and miller maier 1998 briefly 2 μl of mineral oil was added to each well of a 96 well microtiter plate lid a 5 μl aliquot of bacterial broth was delivered into the center of the well after 1 min the flatness of the water droplet was observed and recorded the droplets had 100 collapsing 50 100 collapsing and 10 50 collapsing were marked as and respectively oil spreading test os was conducted following morikawa et al 2000 ten μl of crude oil was gently added to the surface of 40 ml of distilled water in a petri dish ø 150 mm to form a thin oil membrane ten μl of bacterial broth was gently added to the center of the oil membrane a clear zone was formed due to the activity of the surfactants the area of the clear zone was used to reflect the concentration of the produced surfactants the results were illustrated as the diameter of the clear zone surface tension measurement st uses du nouy ring method to measures surface interfacial tension harkins and alexander 1959 it was determined in triplicate with a surface tensiometer dunouy tensiometer interfacial csc scientific at 20 3 c following the manufacturer s instruction emulsification index ei reflects the ability of the biosurfactant to form and stabilize emulsions cai et al 2017 ei of the cell free supernatant was determined by adding 5 ml of light mineral oil to the same amount of culture mixing with a vortex for 2 min and letting stand for 24 h the emulsifying activity e24 was calculated using equation 1 1 e24 hel hs 100 where hel is the height of the emulsion layer and hs is the height of the total solution critical micelle dilution measurement cmd of the cell free supernatant was determined following cai et al 2015 cmd can be used to reflect the concentrations of bio surfactant that reduce surface interfacial tension shavandi et al 2011 after centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and discarding the pellet the cell free broth samples were diluted with distilled water while the surface tension of each dilution was measured the cmd was determined as the highest dilution with which the surface tension did not significantly increase as the broth consists of both an aqueous and an oil phase each dilution was conducted with sonication to ensure homogeneity before each measurement the sonicated solution was allowed to stand for 15 20 min to achieve equilibrium cell hydrophobicity ch was evaluated by the method of microbial adhesion to the hydrocarbon math park et al 2000 the cell pellets obtained after centrifuge separation of the whole culture were rinsed with 50 mm phosphorus buffer pbs ph 7 0 twice and then diluted to an initial od580 value of around 0 8 1 0 then 5 ml of this cell suspension was mixed with 1 ml of kerosene in a test tube on a vortex mixer for 2 min the mixture was left undisturbed for 20 min and then the final od580 of the aqueous phase was measured again math was calculated as follows 2 2 m a t h 1 o d 580 f i n a l o d 580 i n i t i a l 100 high math values indicate high affinity of the cells for oils 2 4 oil in water emulsion breaking test span tween kerosene o w emulsion prepared following coutinho et al 2013 was used for this test the emulsion type was confirmed using microscopic visualization after dyeing the oil phase using hydrophobic dye oil red o lee and lee 2000 the fresh emulsion had an emulsion breaking ratio of 15 at 35 c within 48 h for screening test 4 day culture of strains were used for the detailed characterization of the featured isolate halomonas sp n3 2a a 7 day culture was used in which the growth of bacteria in terms of accumulated biomass reached plateau three types of samples were subjected to demulsification assays i e whole culture broth cell free supernatant obtained from centrifuging and cell suspension obtained by dissolving pbs washed cell pellets in the fresh medium the demulsification assay was conducted following wen et al 2010 briefly 1 ml sample or blank were added into a 15 ml vial containing 9 ml of emulsion and sealed with silicone rubber the test tube was agitated in a vortex for 30 s the tube was kept undisturbed in an upright position in an incubator at 35 c the changes in the volume of the oil phase top water phase bottom and emulsion phase in between were recorded at certain time intervals for up to 48 h the tests were duplicated demulsification performance was evaluated by the emulsion breaking ratio according to the following equations 3

for a response variable ebrn 24h using explanatory variables odc os cmd st ei and ch values the model was reduced using stepwise regression with α to enter 0 05 and α to exit 0 05 principal component analysis pca of the data matrix were conducted with corrplot package in the r project for statistical computing r core team 2013 the data were first log transferred and then centered and scaled to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 prior to the pca analysis venables and ripley 2013 the graphic display of the dominant patterns in the matrix was made using ggplot 2 wickham 2016 it colors each point according to the bacterial species genera and draws a normal contour line with ellipse covering probability default to 68 for each group the mahalanobis distances i e a measure for the separation of the groups taking into account the spreading of the samples within one group were calculated in the overlap data after pca analysis mahalanobis 1930 using r project randomly selected strains 20 were subjected to duplicate runs of all the 7 tests the relative standard error rse in the duplication has been less than 20 demonstrating the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements for strains reported in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 emulsion breaking performance of the isolates the o w emulsion breaking performance of the isolates is summarized in fig 1 after 24 h the ebr values were found to be in a range of 19 41 97 60 for the tested strains ebrn 12h and ebrn 24h are comparable except for few strains e g n3 8a and n2 3p which exhibited a lag in demulsification fig 1 also shows the result trends of the 6 screening tests sorted by a descending ebrn 24h os showed similar descending trend with that of ebrn 24h interestingly ch served as a supplementary role to os fig 1a for the strains with high ebrn 24h their os were generally high or when os was low it was accompanied by a high ch to achieve a high ebrn in the contrast the trends of the 4 other tests i e odc st cmd and ie seemed irrelevant fig 1b os is an assay based on change of the contact angle at the oil water interface with the quantity of the added bio surfactants morikawa et al 1993 ch demonstrates the affinity of microbial cells to the oil phase the native cell hydrophobicity has been attributed to certain proteins and lipids present in the cell wall huang et al 2014 kaczorek et al 2008 the generation of surface active compounds also likely lead to cell bound components that affect the ch readings kuyukina et al 2001 therefore ch and os correlate to the concentrations of surface interfacial active compounds and the affinity of the microbial cells to the oil phase respectively studies on the biological demulsification of water in oil emulsion have found that microorganisms modify the emulsion properties by employing either their hydrophobic cell surfaces or the extracellular amphiphilic biosurfactants to replace the emulsifier molecules zolfaghari et al 2016 as a result interfacial tension gradient is reduced which leads to the thinning of the interfacial film and eventually phase separation wen et al 2010 in this study both os and ch readings were found to be positively and significantly influencing the ebrn readings this suggests that similar mechanisms are behind the demulsification of o w emulsion with wide variety of bacteria examined in this study the results obtained agreed with the findings of park et al 2000 and coutinho et al 2013 that strains with high demulsification efficiency tend to have high cell hydrophobicity and interfacial activity detailed investigation on how cell surface compositions of the diverse bacterial strains isolated in this study affect the cell hydrophobicity and interfacial activity and thus the demulsification of o w emulsions will be included in the future studies 3 2 identification of the demulsifying bacteria targeting oily wastewater with o w emulsion table 1 provides a summary of the results of bacterial identification emulsion breaking test and the 6 screening tests thirty seven demulsifying bacteria belong to 5 genera namely acinetobacter bacillus halomonas pseudomonas and rhodococcus were isolated fig 2 the sources of these bacteria were harbor seawater sample id cbs offshore crude oil samples sample ids coa and cob raw produced water from offshore oil reservoirs sample ids ma and mb four coastal sediment samples collected at a refinery outlet sample ids n1 n2 n3 and n4 and four treated produced water samples collected from offshore oil reservoirs sample ids p1 p5 p6 and p9 the isolated bacteria belong to 15 species as illustrated in the phylogenetic tree fig 1 the tree also shows three o w emulsion breaking bacteria described in the literature i e pseudomonas aeruginosa msj coutinho et al 2013 bacillus mojavensis xh1 li et al 2012 and streptomyces sp aa8321 park et al 2000 fig 2 these species are in the divisions of firmicutes actinobacteria and proteobacteria fig 2 the 15 new bacteria reported here significantly expands the knowledge of o w emulsion breaking bacteria in this study several strains belonging to halomonas acinetobacter and rhodococcus were reported as o w emulsion breaking agents for the first time moreover although some acinetobacter nadarajah et al 2002 and rhodococcus strains wen et al 2010 were found to demulsify water in oil emulsion halomonas hasn t been reported with destabilizing ability for either types of emulsion until this study in this study halomonas venusta strain n3 2a is reported as an emulsion breaking bacterium with excellent efficiency and was examined in greater detail 3 3 demulsification kinetics and mechanisms of halomonas venusta strain n3 2a when the whole broth of halomonas venusta strain n3 2a was used to treat the model emulsion the ebrn was low in the first 4 h and jumped at the 5th hour subsequently the ebrn was increasing with a steady rate until it reached around 92 5 at 24 h when only supernatant was used no emulsion breaking was observed within the first 5 h and then the ebrn steadily increased to 77 when only cells were used no emulsion breaking was observed within the first 9 h and then ebrn slowing increased with a rate that much lower than with whole broth and supernatant till it reached 25 fig 3 a this indicates that both cellular cell bound and extracellular bio demulsifiers contributed to the demulsification the combined ebrn of supernatant and cells were significantly lower than the whole broth within the first 12 h fig 3b this significantly more rapid increase in ebr of the whole broth could be important it indicates that there may a loss of certain cell soluble components that contributed to the demulsification due to the pellet washing using pbs or a synergetic effect between bacterial cells and extracellular bio demulsifiers similar phenomenon was also observed by nadarajah et al 2002 when using a mixed bacterial culture extracellular bio demulsifiers biosurfactants were found with stronger impact on emulsion breaking halomonas strains have been found with ability to produce glycoprotein type gutierrez et al 2007 or glycolipid type dhasayan et al 2014 pepi et al 2005 of biosurfactants further characterization of the extracellular bio demulsifiers biosurfactants produced by halomonas venusta strain n3 2a will be conducted in future research oily wastewater oil can contain oil that is floating dispersed emulsified and dissolved stable emulsified oil poses a major challenge for o w separation during wastewater treatment stable emulsified oil has droplet diameters 2 μm coca et al 2011 they are immune from some primary treatments such as gravity separation owing to the small droplet size stewart and arnold 2008 microfiltration and ultrafiltration as secondary wastewater treatment techniques can effectively remove o w emulsion however membrane fouling due to surfactant or oil adhere on the pore walls can significantly lower the membrane life and increase the treatment costs ahmad et al 2005 the addition of effective demulsifiers to coalesce the droplets into significantly larger sizes or even separated phases prior to gravity separation and coagulation flocculation is thus a promising approach to treat oily wastewater with emulsified oil coca et al 2011 yang et al 2016 nowadays the dominate players in the o w demulsifier market are iron and alumina sulphates mancini et al 2017 as well as chemically synthesized polyelectrolytes surfactants and polymers coca et al 2011 talingting pabalan et al 2010 bacterial demulsifiers although they may have great potential lag far behind in terms of the maturity of research and development this study assists in their development the results demonstrated the high emulsion breaking efficiency of halomonas venusta strain n3 2a in a batch scale test that are typically used to screen potential demulsifiers nishimaki et al 1999 the emulsion breaking efficiency is comparable with recently reported o w demulsifying bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa msj coutinho et al 2013 and bacillus mojavensis xh1 li et al 2012 the feasibility of the reported biodemulsifier will be further examined in multiple scale treatment tests in future studies 3 4 characterization of a demulsifying bacterium halomonas venusta strain n3 2a the polymerase chain reaction pcr reaction obtained almost full length 1500 bp 16s rdna fragments for the selected isolates the five replicates agreed well with each other genebank accession no mh251262 the demulsifying bacterium halomonas venusta strain n3 2a was found to be closely related to h venusta dsm 4743t h hydrothermalis atcc baa 800t and h axialensis atcc baa 802t with similarities of 99 5 99 3 and 97 9 respectively the phylogenetic tree based on 16s rdna sequences of halomonas sp n3 2a and 6 close related type strains is constructed fig 4 a halomonas belong to the order of oceanospirillales most species of this order are halophilic and halotolerant garrity et al 2005 hitherto none of the strains belonging to this genus have been reported with demulsifying ability the similarity dissimilarity of the halomonas venusta strain n3 2a and the 6 closely related type strains according to their metabolic profile and plfa compositions are illustrated in fig 4b and c metabolic traits of halomonas sp n3 2a were similar with h venusta dsm 4743t h meridiana dsm 5425t and h variabilis dsm 3051t the membrane plfa profiles of h venusta dsm 4743t h hydrothermalis atcc baa 800t h axialensis atcc baa 802t h meridiana dsm 5425t and h sulfidaeris atcc baa 803t were closely resemble each other halomonas sp n3 2a is slightly different from the above 5 strains halomonas venusta strain n3 2a was rod shaped bacterium with a length of 0 5 1 μm and diameter of around 0 5 μm fig 4d and was significantly smaller than the 6 closely related strains 3 5 evaluation of the screening methods for identifying demulsifying bacteria targeting oily wastewater with o w emulsion in this study in order to evaluate the efficacy of the above tests in relation to emulsion breaking ratio multiple linear regression model and non linear models including quadratic and linear with interaction models were employed they were used to fit the experimental data and shed light on the relationship between the results of the six screening methods explanatory variable and ebr the response variable during pre screening the quadratic model and the two factor interaction model both had sequential p values larger than 0 05 data not shown and were excluded the linear models i e a full model and a reduced model were applied to fit the experimental data when all six screening parameters were used to fit the linear model the model f value of 10 18 implied the model was significant table 2 left side the explanatory variables os and ch were significant with a p value prob f less than 0 05 the insignificant explanatory variables i e odc cmd ei and st are supposed to be removed to improve the model the model r2 value was at 0 6706 indicating 67 06 of variability in the response was explained by the explanatory variables the predicted r2 of 0 5273 was in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 6047 difference 0 2 adequate precision is a measure of the signal to noise ratio and the value of 10 43 the desirable value 4 indicated an adequate signal coefficient of variation c v is the error expressed as a percentage of the mean press is a measure of how well a particular model fits each point in the design both c v and press can be used to evaluate the performances of varies models the lower values indicate better structure of the candidate models after the insignificant model terms are removed the model was reduced table 2 right side the new model r2 value was very close to the full model indicating the majority of variability in the response was explained by the two significant explanatory variables i e os and ch the reduced model had improved adjusted r2 predicted r2 and adequate precision indicating better model explainability predictability and signal to noise ratio the reduced model also had lower c v and press indicating it has lower error and better model structure after the reduction the regression model was the following 5 e b r n 24 h 12 83 8 58 o s 0 30 c h according to the results os and ch are significant explanatory factors that are both positively contribute to the emulsion breaking this finding validated the observation in section 3 1 results of os and ch can be used to predict the emulsion breaking using the obtained regression model os coupled with ch are recommended as the strategy for the screening of demulsifying microorganisms both tests are fast requires no specialized equipment and have potential to be automated to further increase the throughputs 3 6 species genus specific patterns of demulsifying bacteria targeting oily wastewater with o w emulsion principal component analysis pca was applied to investigate the structure of the data and infer species genus specific patterns of the demulsifying bacteria in response to the tests varimax rotated principal component matrix of the 7 factors is summarized in table 3 the components 1 and 2 accounting for 72 01 of total variance in the dataset the dominant variables contributing to variance along component 1 were odc 0 40 os 0 46 cmd 0 45 st 0 42 and ebr 0 42 st and ei showed positive loadings while the others show negative loadings indicating an inverse association between these variables variance along component 2 was accounted for primarily by ei 0 91 the circle of correlations and plot of loadings along components 1 and 2 are shown in fig 5 as vectors v1 to v7 the grouping of bacterial species genera based on their pca scores is illustrated in fig 5 to reflect how strains perform differently in the 7 tests certain degree of overlapping between groups was observed thus the mahalanobis distances between groups are calculated fig 5 insert these results illustrated that when evaluating the isolated bacteria using the seven tested parameters some species genera indeed showed distinct patterns after incubated under the same conditions strains belongs to b thuringiensis were the most distinct group which had significant distances mahalanobis distances 5 from acinetobacter the bacillus others b flexus and b licheniformis halomonas r opacus and rhodococcus others r phenolicus r wratislaviensis r zopfii and r yunnanensis b thuringiensis strains had pca scores that grouped tightly to the high odc os cmd and ebr side and low st side indicating they produced high level of surface tension reducing biosurfactant effectively broke o w emulsion r opacus strains were significantly distant from acinetobacter bacillus others and b thuringiensis pca scores of r opacus strains were grouped at the side of vector v6 and opposite side of vectors v1 v2 v3 and v7 indicating that they had lower efficiency in producing biosurfactants and breaking o w emulsion acinetobacter strains were significantly distant from strains belong to b subtilis b thuringiensis and r opacus and they mostly had high ei readings positive v5 with strong ability to form stabilize emulsions b subtilis strains only had significant distance from acinetobacter strains strains closely related to r erythropolis overlapped with most of the other groups and showed low mahalanobis distances the understanding of the performance patterns of the species genera fills the knowledge gap and provides guidance on the selection of strains for certain biotechnological applications for example acinetobacter strains are suitable for emulsification applications which is evident in many studies navon venezia et al 1995 zosim et al 1982 with a commercialized product i e emulsan 4 conclusions

biodemulsifiers biosurfactants and bacterial cell surfaces its 16s rrna and phenotypes were characterized in detail and compared to the closely related type strains in the halomonas genus the 37 demulsifying bacteria showed species genus specific patterns in their abilities to reduce surface interfacial tension produce biosurfactant stabilize destabilize emulsion and adhere to hydrocarbons

19154,catastrophic regime shifts in shallow lakes are hard to predict due to a lack of clear understanding of the associate mechanisms theory of alternative stable states suggests that eutrophication has profound negative effects on the structure function and stability of freshwater ecosystems however it is still unclear how eutrophication destabilizes ecosystems stoichiometrically before a tipping point is reached the stoichiometric homeostasis h which links fine scale process to broad scale patterns is a key parameter in ecological stoichiometry based on investigation of 97 shallow lakes on the yangtze plain china we measured nitrogen n and phosphorus p concentrations of the aboveground tissues of common submerged macrophyte species and their corresponding sediments we found submerged macrophytes showed significant stoichiometric homeostasis for p h p but not for n h n furthermore h p was positively correlated with dominance and stability at the species level and community production and stability at the community level identifying where macrophyte community collapse is a fundamental way to quantify their resilience threshold detection showed that macrophyte community dominated by high h p species had a higher value of tipping point 0 08 vs 0 06 mg p l 1 in lake water indicating their strong resilience to eutrophication in addition macrophytes with high h p were predominant in relative oligotrophic sediments and have higher ability in stabilizing the water environment compared to those low h p ones our results suggested that ecosystem dominated by homeostatic macrophyte communities was more productive stable and resilient to eutrophication eutrophication induced stoichiometric imbalance may destabilize the ecosystem by altering the community structure from high to low h p species efforts should be focused on maintaining and restoration of high homeostatic communities to make ecosystem more resilient which can significantly improve our

larger scale stoichiometric homeostasis has been proved to be correlated with ecosystem stability dominance and production yu et al 2010 2015 however to our knowledge there has been no report attempting to unravel the mechanisms of alternative stable states from a stoichiometric perspective furthermore we note that both stoichiometric homeostasis h and ecological resilience represent the ability to maintain its original state at organism and ecosystem levels respectively both concepts reflect variations in biological functions and hence can be used as indicators of organism ecosystem response to environmental fluctuations elmqvist et al 2003 scheffer et al 2015 yu et al 2015 however it is still unknown whether stoichiometric homeostasis linking fine scale process would be correlated with ecological resilience in broad scale patterns in terms of regime shifts thus it is important to clarify the links between macrophytes ability of regulating stoichiometry and the structure stability and resilience of lake ecosystems in response to eutrophication it is vital for management and conservation to understand the mechanisms of keeping a resilient clear water state elmqvist et al 2003 suding et al 2004 resilience here is the ability of an ecosystem to maintain key functions and processes encountering external perturbations holling 1973 phenomenally the transition of predominant primary producers to phytoplankton is generally associated with collapse in both abundance and coverage of macrophyte community scheffer et al 1993 thresholds for the collapse represent a boundary parameter of the regime shifts and a higher threshold implicates a more flexible ecological space and a larger domain of attraction scheffer et al 2001 andersen et al

communities is a long term process which can serve as a clue to examine the slow responses of ecosystem state hughes et al 2013 as stoichiometric homeostasis is tightly correlated with species production and stability yu et al 2010 2011 it is likely that eutrophication may erode resilience of the ecosystem by depressing high homeostatic macrophyte communities with high ecosystem production and stability here based on an investigation of 97 shallow lakes on the yangtze plain fig 1 we first examined the strength of the stoichiometric homeostasis of submerged macrophytes by measuring n and p concentrations of their aboveground tissues then we determined if stoichiometric homeostasis was correlated with species dominance and stability at the species level as well as with production and stability at the community level we hypothesized that there was a strong linkage of stoichiometric homeostasis in submerged macrophytes with regime shifts of a shallow lake ecosystem from clear to turbid states in the face of eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and field sampling the yangtze plain one of the three largest plains in china contains numerous shallow lakes with different nutrient levels in the present study 97 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river were surveyed in the growing season during 2013 2014 fig 1 as the lakes suffered from severe degeneration submerged macrophytes were absent from 51 lakes in the 46 macrophytic lakes we sampled in macrophytic region using the modified belt transect method vondracek et al 2014 with 418 sampling sites in total the number of sampling sites in each macrophytic lake were determined based on the area of macrophyte distribution in order to establish stoichiometric relationships between submerged plants and its surrounding resources 13 macrophytic lakes with more abundant coverage and species richness were investigated in detail in 2014 the lake area and mean water depth ranged from 16 9 to 2537 2 km2 and 1 4 to 4 1 m respectively table s1 for details in this study we targeted on six common submerged macrophytes widely distributed in the yangtze lakes potamogeton maackianus potamogeton malaianus myriophyllum spicatum ceratophyllum demersum hydrilla verticillata and vallisneria natans as their biomass comprised 98 2 of total submerged macrophytes in the study area submerged macrophytes were sampled using a rotatable reaping hook covering 0 2 m2 with 3 times at each sampling site the plants were washed sorted by species and then weighed to determine the fresh weight the aboveground parts of the six species were collected and placed in cloth bags with waterproof labels corresponding water samples were taken from 0 5 m below the surface placed in a cooler and taken back to the laboratory for further analysis in order to probe the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of submerged macrophytes the upper 0 10 cm of sediments were collected in 2014 with 181 sediment samples in total the sediment samples were collected using a columnar sampling instrument acrylic glass tube 5 cm inner diameter 2 2 laboratory analysis the samples of macrophytes and sediments were oven dried at 80 c for 48 h to constant weights and then ground into fine powder before elemental analyses for total c and n concentration both plant and sediment samples were measured using element analyzer flash ea 1112 series ce instruments italy for total p concentration plant and sediment samples were firstly digested using sulfuric acid hydrogen peroxide and acid perchloric respectively then the total p concentrations were determined using the ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid method for both plant and sediment samples sparks et al 1996 total n and total p in the water column were analyzed according to standard methods huang et al 1999 specifically total n and total p mg l 1 were measured as nitrate and ortho phosphate after digestion with k2s2o8 at 120 c for 30 min the concentration of orthophosphate in the digested samples was determined colorimetrically using molybdenum blue method 2 3 data analysis stoichiometric homeostasis coefficient h can be diagnosed by plotting the logarithms according to the following equation sterner and elser 2002 log y log c 1 h log x where y is the p or n content of plants x is the p or n content of the resources and c is a constant as submerged plants absorb nutrients mainly from sediment via roots rather than water column via leaves best and mantai 1978 carignan and kalff 1980 smith and adams 1986 sediment total nutrient contents n and p were used as the resource to explore the stoichiometric homeostasis species dominance was expressed by the biomass of this species as a proportion of the total biomass in a quadrat species stability was calculated as the ratio of average species biomass to the associated standard deviation community h was calculated by the weighted mean of species h across all submerged species in one quadrat according to the following equation yu et al 2010 community h i 1 n r e l a t i v e b i o m a s s i h i where n is the species number in a quadrat and i takes the value from 1 to n community production was the total biomass of all living submerged species within a quadrat averaged by each lake and community stability was calculated as the ratio of the mean biomass to the associated standard deviation for the 13 lakes investigated in 2014 then linear regression was used to examine the relationships between the regulation ability and species dominance and stability as well as the relationships between community h and community production and stability all data sets analyzed above were obtained in 2014 to explore whether stoichiometric homeostasis is associated with ecological resilience thresholds determined under different stoichiometric community structures high h species vs low h species were used to assess resilience stability and the risk of an upcoming transition boada et al 2017 specifically we examined whether community structures influence where the thresholds occur in response to total p in the water column we combined the data sets of 2013 and 2014 with a total number of 418 quadrats to make the result more robust we performed this analysis of change point detection using the package strucchange in r 3 4 2 r core team 2017 for each community structure the method detects structural change in linear regression models using a moving window minimal segment size setting h 0 15 along the nutrient gradients to generate a sequential f test a function named breakpoints was used to determine the locations of the changes based on residual sum of squares and bayesian information criterion bic because change point detection requires discrete biomass data we used the mean values of macrophyte biomass in every 0 01 mg l 1 portion of water total p 3 results 3 1 n and p homeostasis coefficient h of submerged macrophytes stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients represents the ability of an organism to maintain relatively stable internal concentrations of elements we obtained it by plotting the logarithm of plant n and p contents with sediment nutrient contents respectively in this study the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficients of p h p for the six plant species p maackianus p malaianus v natans m spicatum c demersum and h verticillata ranged from 1 29 to 3 73 fig 2 with an average of 2 40 however no significant homeostasis coefficients of n h n were detected with the exception of significant h n i e 6 82 for h verticillata table s2 at the species level the h p of submerged macrophytes exhibited significant positive relationships with species dominance r 2 0 94 p 0 0015 and stability r 2 0 72 p 0 0324 fig 3 a b at the community level community h p of submerged macrophytes also exhibited significant positive relationships with community production r 2 0 36 p 0 0305 and stability r 2 0 54 p 0 0045 fig 3 c d 3 2 linking the p regulation ability with community succession and ecological resilience as the h p values of p maackianus p malaianus and v natans were higher than those of m spicatum c demersum and h verticillata we classified the former group as high h p species and the latter as low h p species threshold analyses showed that submerged vegetation biomass in the shallow yangtze lakes exhibited two dramatic different states both in high and low h p communities fig 4 results showed collapse of macrophyte community biomass was occurred when the water column total p crossed a tipping point threshold the mean biomass of low h p community collapsed when water column total p crossed 0 06 mg l 1 the biomass sharply decreased from 1149 85 271 87 g m 2 to 192 45 119 27 g m 2 by contrast the high h p community was still present when water total p crossed 0 06 mg l 1 with biomass around 1006 86 g m 2 when water nutrient level beyond 0 08 mg l 1 high h p community also dropped from 1208 32 175 64 g m 2 to 142 95 154 61 g m 2 our results confirmed the existence of regime shifts in both communities thresholds were found at higher levels of the stressor water total p content for the high h p community the results were consistent and robust even when the intervals of water total p were changed to 0 02 mg l 1 fig s1 there were no significant differences of water total n and p between high and low h p species dominated communities while significant differences of sediment total n and p secchi depth and chl a were observed between the two communities fig 5 furthermore sediment total p was negatively correlated r 2 0 80 p 0 0002 with the dominance of high h p species while it was positively correlated r 2 0 70 p 0 0013 with that of low h p species fig s2 4 discussion 4 1 p vs n availability in shaping stoichiometric homeostasis the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficient h has been designed to reflect the ability of stoichiometric regulation in varying nutrient environments sterner and elser 2002 many studies have shown that h is a powerful indicator for this in diverse organisms including microbes fungi plants and animals persson et al 2010 golz et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 li et al 2018 individual stoichiometric traits are also linked to ecosystem production and stability yu et al 2010 previous studies have implied that aquatic vascular plants had a strong ability of stoichiometric regulation demars and edwards 2007 li et al 2013 su et al 2016 however stoichiometric homeostasis is often species and element specific and plant nutrients also respond to external environmental fluctuations to varying degrees in our study significant positive relationships were observed between plant tissue p and sediment total p concentrations fig 2 whereas plants n except for h verticillata showed no significant relationship with sediment n table s2 these results indicated that growth of macrophyte might be more closely correlated with p than n in freshwater ecosystem processes for h verticillata p homeostasis 1 29 was much lower than n homeostasis 6 82 which was consistent with previous studies of terrestrial plants yu et al 2010 2011 this suggests that the structural elements with high concentrations are generally stable and not sensitive to environmental changes han et al 2011 in the present study only homeostatic coefficient of p h p of submerged macrophytes was significantly correlated with ecosystem production and stability fig 3 this was inconsistent with those previous studies in terrestrial environments yu et al 2011 2015 such a difference in the ability of stoichiometric regulation n vs p between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems may arise from different rates of nutrient accumulation terrestrial ecosystems are frequently influenced by atmospheric n deposition while global freshwater ecosystems have accumulated more p than n from increased anthropogenic p inputs in recent decades yan et al 2016 moreover as freshwater ecosystems in pre industrial times were considered to be p limited schindler 1977 sterner 2008 elser et al 2007 the long term selective pressure might has led to the presence of macrophytes with high capacities of acquiring and sequestering p over n and thus leading to a high adaptability to p limited environments güsewell and koerselman 2002 4 2 community structure changes with the progress of eutrophication because the ability to cope with elemental imbalance is species specific phosphorus enrichment eutrophication should favor the growth of species with low p stoichiometric regulation ability in freshwater ecosystems our results showed that species with high h p were predominant when the sediment nutrients were low while species with low h p were predominant when the sediment nutrients were high fig 5d and e the species with high h p values were suppressed by increased sediment p availability ultimately dominated by low h p species during the process of eutrophication fig s2 plants with flexible stoichiometric properties can accumulate and store elements in excess of their immediate needs garbey et al 2004 demars and edwards 2007 this luxury uptake might be an ecological adaptive strategy that benefits the plant later when the elements are no longer available however species with homeostatic stoichiometry are often predominant in relative oligotrophic and stable environments because of their lower growth rates and the higher energetic costs of maintaining a stable stoichiometry in highly variable environments yu et al 2011 li et al 2018 it is suggested that h p can serve as an important stoichiometric indicator for predicting succession of macrophyte communities in the face of global change and anthropogenic activities 4 3 a schematic model underlying regime shifts water total p was generally regarded as the driving factor for regime shifts from clear to turbid water in shallow lakes scheffer and carpenter 2003 wang et al 2014 excessive phosphorus in water column is directly related to many unpleasant phenomena e g increased biomass of phytoplankton dominance of bloom forming algal species changes in macrophyte species composition oxygen depletion and decrease in water transparency smith and schindler 2009 in the present study we documented a shift from clear to turbid states in both high and low h macrophyte communities however the thresholds of water total p concentrations were substantially higher 0 08 vs 0 06 mg l 1 in high homeostasis systems fig 4 our results indicated that stoichiometric homeostasis could strongly determine the buffer capacity of macrophyte communities results from species level stability community level stability and threshold detection all converged to give us a clear understanding of how stoichiometric homeostasis mediated the resilience to eutrophication specifically macrophyte communities with strong stoichiometric homeostasis are more resilient to eutrophication than low homeostatic communities submerged aquatic macrophytes can markedly improve local ecological environment through various positive interactions which in turn benefit themselves these interactions form a positive feedback loop more vegetation results in higher water clarity which is a necessary condition for catastrophic regime shifts scheffer et al 2001 kéfi et al 2016 we found there are no differences of water total n and p between high and low h p species dominated communities however communities dominated by high h p species tend to have lower chl a and higher water clarity indicating their higher capacity of stabilizing the local environment in relative oligotrophic conditions where high h p species dominate the positive feedback loops keep the system far away from the tipping point however in eutrophic conditions the high h p species are replaced by low h p ones which is accompanied by environmental degradation decreases in community production and stability based on our results we presented a schematic model to explain the mechanisms and processes of regime shifts in the yangtze floodplain shallow lakes fig 6 in initial relative oligotrophic conditions the ecosystem was dominated by high h p species with higher production and stability with the progress of eutrophication the high h p species were gradually replaced by the low h p ones homeostatic macrophytes tend to have relative lower growth rate and conservative usage strategy of nutrients yu et al 2011 li et al 2018 in addition restoration of homeostatic macrophytes can be prevented by the enhanced turbidity grazing by herbivorous fish water level fluctuations and lack of seeds or propagules in the sediment o donnell et al 2015 hilt et al 2008 van donk and otte 1996 geest et al 2005 it is expected that macrophytes with high h p values show lower threshold of nutrient level and higher equilibrium biomass in the backward recovery trajectory on the other hand the width of bistable regions indicates the strength of ecological resilience dakos et al 2015 muthukrishnan et al 2016 ecosystem dominated by high h p species has a higher nutrient threshold and thus a wider bistable region f2 f2 than those dominated by low h p species f1 f1 changes in macrophyte communities suggested that the flexible portion of the ecosystem domain decreased when affected by a disturbance thus eutrophication induced stoichiometric imbalances destabilized the ecosystems by changing the community structure from high to low h p species causing more easily transition of a system to an alternative turbid state although physiological mechanisms underlying these changes is still open for further study our study provides a new perspective in analyzing the relationships between nutrient stoichiometry and ecosystem functions 5 conclusion in the present study we put forward from the perspective of stoichiometry a novel mechanism to elucidate the dynamics of structure stability and resilience of lake ecosystems with eutrophication our results showed that regulation ability of p stoichiometry in submerged macrophytes was not only a powerful indicator to predict the structure and stability of the ecosystem but also linked to species succession and ecosystem resilience in the face of external perturbations ecosystems dominated by high h p species tend to have a more stable regime while those dominated by low h p species are more opportunistic and vulnerable to external perturbations that is eutrophication destabilizes freshwater ecosystems by inhibiting homeostatic macrophyte communities collapse of low h p species can be served as an early warning signal for the regime shifts from clear to turbid state also it is expected that low h p species can recover more quickly and thus can be used as pioneer species in restoration ecology our findings contribute to understanding the role of stoichiometric homeostasis in determining ecosystem structure stability and resilience of macrophyte dominated freshwater lakes the present results are practically important for lake management and restoration in the increasingly eutrophic world declaration of

19154,catastrophic regime shifts in shallow lakes are hard to predict due to a lack of clear understanding of the associate mechanisms theory of alternative stable states suggests that eutrophication has profound negative effects on the structure function and stability of freshwater ecosystems however it is still unclear how eutrophication destabilizes ecosystems stoichiometrically before a tipping point is reached the stoichiometric homeostasis h which links fine scale process to broad scale patterns is a key parameter in ecological stoichiometry based on investigation of 97 shallow lakes on the yangtze plain china we measured nitrogen n and phosphorus p concentrations of the aboveground tissues of common submerged macrophyte species and their corresponding sediments we found submerged macrophytes showed significant stoichiometric homeostasis for p h p but not for n h n furthermore h p was positively correlated with dominance and stability at the species level and community production and stability at the community level identifying where macrophyte community collapse is a fundamental way to quantify their resilience threshold detection showed that macrophyte community dominated by high h p species had a higher value of tipping point 0 08 vs 0 06 mg p l 1 in lake water indicating their strong resilience to eutrophication in addition macrophytes with high h p were predominant in relative oligotrophic sediments and have higher ability in stabilizing the water environment compared to those low h p ones our results suggested that ecosystem dominated by homeostatic macrophyte communities was more productive stable and resilient to eutrophication eutrophication induced stoichiometric imbalance may destabilize the ecosystem by altering the community structure from high to low h p species efforts should be focused on maintaining and restoration of high homeostatic communities to make ecosystem more resilient which can significantly improve our

from 1208 32 175 64 g m 2 to 142 95 154 61 g m 2 our results confirmed the existence of regime shifts in both communities thresholds were found at higher levels of the stressor water total p content for the high h p community the results were consistent and robust even when the intervals of water total p were changed to 0 02 mg l 1 fig s1 there were no significant differences of water total n and p between high and low h p species dominated communities while significant differences of sediment total n and p secchi depth and chl a were observed between the two communities fig 5 furthermore sediment total p was negatively correlated r 2 0 80 p 0 0002 with the dominance of high h p species while it was positively correlated r 2 0 70 p 0 0013 with that of low h p species fig s2 4 discussion 4 1 p vs n availability in shaping stoichiometric homeostasis the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficient h has been designed to reflect the ability of stoichiometric regulation in varying nutrient environments sterner and elser 2002 many studies have shown that h is a powerful indicator for this in diverse organisms including microbes fungi plants and animals persson et al 2010 golz et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2016 li et al 2018 individual stoichiometric traits are also linked to ecosystem production and stability yu et al 2010 previous studies have implied that aquatic vascular plants had a strong ability of stoichiometric regulation demars and edwards 2007 li et al 2013 su et al 2016 however stoichiometric homeostasis is often species and element specific and plant nutrients also respond to external environmental fluctuations to varying degrees in our study significant positive relationships were observed between plant tissue p and sediment total p concentrations fig 2 whereas plants n except for h verticillata showed no significant relationship with sediment n table s2 these results indicated that growth of macrophyte might be more closely correlated with p than n in freshwater ecosystem processes for h verticillata p homeostasis 1 29 was much lower than n homeostasis 6 82 which was consistent with previous studies of terrestrial plants yu et al 2010 2011 this suggests that the structural elements with high concentrations are generally stable and not sensitive to environmental changes han et al 2011 in the present study only homeostatic coefficient of p h p of submerged macrophytes was significantly correlated with ecosystem production and stability fig 3 this was inconsistent with those previous studies in terrestrial environments yu et al 2011 2015 such a difference in the ability of stoichiometric regulation n vs p between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems may arise from different rates of nutrient accumulation terrestrial ecosystems are frequently influenced by atmospheric n deposition while global freshwater ecosystems have accumulated more p than n from increased anthropogenic p inputs in recent decades yan et al 2016 moreover as freshwater ecosystems in pre industrial times were considered to be p limited schindler 1977 sterner 2008 elser et al 2007 the long term selective pressure might has led to the presence of macrophytes with high capacities of acquiring and sequestering p over n and thus leading to a high adaptability to p limited environments güsewell and koerselman 2002 4 2 community structure changes with the progress of eutrophication because the ability to cope with elemental imbalance is species specific phosphorus enrichment eutrophication should favor the growth of species with low p stoichiometric regulation ability in freshwater ecosystems our results showed that species with high h p were predominant when the sediment nutrients were low while species with low h p were predominant when the sediment nutrients were high fig 5d and e the species with high h p values were suppressed by increased sediment p availability ultimately dominated by low h p species during the process of eutrophication fig s2 plants with flexible stoichiometric properties can accumulate and store elements in excess of their immediate needs garbey et al 2004 demars and edwards 2007 this luxury uptake might be an ecological adaptive strategy that benefits the plant later when the elements are no longer available however species with homeostatic stoichiometry are often predominant in relative oligotrophic and stable environments because of their lower growth rates and the higher energetic costs of maintaining a stable stoichiometry in highly variable environments yu et al 2011 li et al 2018 it is suggested that h p can serve as an important stoichiometric indicator for predicting succession of macrophyte communities in the face of global change and anthropogenic activities 4 3 a schematic model underlying regime shifts water total p was generally regarded as the driving factor for regime shifts from clear to turbid water in shallow lakes scheffer and carpenter 2003 wang et al 2014 excessive phosphorus in water column is directly related to many unpleasant phenomena e g increased biomass of phytoplankton dominance of bloom forming algal species changes in macrophyte species composition oxygen depletion and decrease in water transparency smith and schindler 2009 in the present study we documented a shift from clear to turbid states in both high and low h macrophyte communities however the thresholds of water total p concentrations were substantially higher 0 08 vs 0 06 mg l 1 in high homeostasis systems fig 4 our results indicated that stoichiometric homeostasis could strongly determine the buffer capacity of macrophyte communities results from species level stability community level stability and threshold detection all converged to give us a clear understanding of how stoichiometric homeostasis mediated the resilience to eutrophication specifically macrophyte communities with strong stoichiometric homeostasis are more resilient to eutrophication than low homeostatic communities submerged aquatic macrophytes can markedly improve local ecological environment through various positive interactions which in turn benefit themselves these interactions form a positive feedback loop more vegetation results in higher water clarity which is a necessary condition for catastrophic regime shifts scheffer et al 2001 kéfi et al 2016 we found there are no differences of water total n and p between high and low h p species dominated communities however communities dominated by high h p species tend to have lower chl a and higher water clarity indicating their higher capacity of stabilizing the local environment in relative oligotrophic conditions where high h p species dominate the positive feedback loops keep the system far away from the tipping point however in eutrophic conditions the high h p species are replaced by low h p ones which is accompanied by environmental degradation decreases in community production and stability based on our results we presented a schematic model to explain the mechanisms and processes of regime shifts in the yangtze floodplain shallow lakes fig 6 in initial relative oligotrophic conditions the ecosystem was dominated by high h p species with higher production and stability with the progress of eutrophication the high h p species were gradually replaced by the low h p ones homeostatic macrophytes tend to have relative lower growth rate and conservative usage strategy of nutrients yu et al 2011 li et al 2018 in addition restoration of homeostatic macrophytes can be prevented by the enhanced turbidity grazing by herbivorous fish water level fluctuations and lack of seeds or propagules in the sediment o donnell et al 2015 hilt et al 2008 van donk and otte 1996 geest et al 2005 it is expected that macrophytes with high h p values show lower threshold of nutrient level and higher equilibrium biomass in the backward recovery trajectory on the other hand the width of bistable regions indicates the strength of ecological resilience dakos et al 2015 muthukrishnan et al 2016 ecosystem dominated by high h p species has a higher nutrient threshold and thus a wider bistable region f2 f2 than those dominated by low h p species f1 f1 changes in macrophyte communities suggested that the flexible portion of the ecosystem domain decreased when affected by a disturbance thus eutrophication induced stoichiometric imbalances destabilized the ecosystems by changing the community structure from high to low h p species causing more easily transition of a system to an alternative turbid state although physiological mechanisms underlying these changes is still open for further study our study provides a new perspective in analyzing the relationships between nutrient stoichiometry and ecosystem functions 5 conclusion in the present study we put forward from the perspective of stoichiometry a novel mechanism to elucidate the dynamics of structure stability and resilience of lake ecosystems with eutrophication our results showed that regulation ability of p stoichiometry in submerged macrophytes was not only a powerful indicator to predict the structure and stability of the ecosystem but also linked to species succession and ecosystem resilience in the face of external perturbations ecosystems dominated by high h p species tend to have a more stable regime while those dominated by low h p species are more opportunistic and vulnerable to external perturbations that is eutrophication destabilizes freshwater ecosystems by inhibiting homeostatic macrophyte communities collapse of low h p species can be served as an early warning signal for the regime shifts from clear to turbid state also it is expected that low h p species can recover more quickly and thus can be used as pioneer species in restoration ecology our findings contribute to understanding the role of stoichiometric homeostasis in determining ecosystem structure stability and resilience of macrophyte dominated freshwater lakes the present results are practically important for lake management and restoration in the increasingly eutrophic world declaration of
