and discussion 3 1 metal concentration in surface water and sediment mean values of metals in surface water in the four months revealed concentrations mg l of a trend of pb 3 252 cu 2 328 cr 1 590 cd 0 146 ni 0 109 table 3 meanwhile metal loid concentrations mg kg in sediments were higher and the trend was in the order pb 140 930 ni 37 481 cr 29 984 cu 21 001 cd 8 910 table 3 arsenic was not detected in either surface water or sediment samples the mean values of pb in the surface water were 3 252 1 240 mg l and in sediment was 140 930 68 656 mg kg nickel in surface water recorded a mean concentration of 0 109 0 293 mg l while cadmium in sediment recorded a mean concentration of 8 910 11 251 mg kg except for as all metals analysed showed a statistically significant difference in anova across the sample locations concentrations of metals analysed in the surface water sampled from woji creek were higher than those measured in rona river in tibet china qiao et al 2020 although sediment collected from one station in rona river recorded a similar mean concentration of cr as those of woji creek the cr concentrations were generally higher in rona river the concentrations of pb and cd in sediment analysed from woji creek are much higher than those of rona river while concentrations of cu in sediment samples from rona river are higher than those of woji creek lv et al 2019 concentrations of cu pb cr and cd in the surface water did not vary greatly from those measured in the three gorges reservoir tgr in china but concentrations in the sediment varied pb concentrations were much higher in woji creek while cr and cu were higher in tgr lin et al 2020 unlike results obtained from woji creek sheyangestuaryrecorded the presence of as in both sediment and surface water zhao et al 2018 this is also similar to surface water and sediment samples collected from korotoa river in bangladesh islam et al 2015 and from wuhan to shanghai of the changjiang river also known as the yangtze river in china li et al 2020 concentrations of surface water and sediment were determined in the soku oil field area of rivers state nigeria results obtained revealed lower concentrations of cd and pb when compared to results obtained in the present study olu et al 2019 3 2 metal concentration in crabs a comparison of the mean concentration of metals in the different tissues of the three crab species and those from other studies is presented in table 4 hepatopancreas of the crabs accumulated higher concentrations of cd and pb with mean concentrations of cd and pb of 0 110 0 008 mg kg and 1 364 0 060 mg kg in callinectes amnicola and 0 112 0 008 mg kg and 0 735 0 026 mg kg in cardisoma armatum respectively this trend was consistent with crabs assessed from the northern bay of bengal india karar et al 2019 metals analysed in the crab tissues revealed that the concentrations of pb and cr were highest in the two crab species pb was consistently highest in the hepatopancreas while cr was highest in the muscles callinectes amnicola tissues recorded slightly higher metal concentrations compared to cardisoma armatum this slightly higher concentration could be due to the medium which could affect the bioavailability of the metals i e metals in surface water tend to be more bioavailable than in sediment zhang et al 2014 metal accumulation in the tissues of callinectes amnicola was in the order muscles cr pb cd cu ni as gill pb cr cu cd ni as hepatopancreas pb cr cu cd ni as fig 5 in cardisoma armatum metal accumulation trend in tissues are in the order of muscles pb cr cu cd ni as gills ni pb cr cd cu as hepatopancreas pb cr cu cd ni as in callinectes amnicola analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference p 0 05 cd in the muscles and hepatopancreas cr in muscles and hepatopancreas and pb in the three crab tissues anova of metal concentrations in tissues of cardisoma armatum also revealed a statistically significant difference 0 05 cd in gills cr in muscles and gills and pb in the three crab tissues a comparison of the concentration of metals in the tissues of crabs in the present study and those from some other parts of the world is presented in table 4 gills are the respiratory organs of the crabs which enable them to breathe underwater their structure generally consists of numerous filamentous branches the numerous branches increase the available surface area which enhances gas exchange vitt and caldwell 2013 gill performs various functions in crabs which gives the crabs the ability to hyperregulate hemolymph osmotic and ionic concentrations hemolymph ph regulation and ammonia excretion mantel and farmer 1983 péqueux 1995 crabs have anterior gills which are characterised by thin epithelia leading to their specialization in gaseous exchange and posterior gill which are characterised by thick ionocytes which enables ion exchange garçon et al 2011 hence the gill of crabs plays important role in the accumulation of essential and non essential metals the hepatopancreas of crabs is vital for food absorption synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes and storage of lipids glycogen and minerals their function doubles as liver and pancreas ramadevi et al 1990 wang et al 2014 regulation of metals in crabs occurs in the hepatopancreas through the aid of the protein metallothionein karar et al 2019 metallothioneins are a group of soluble heat stable cysteine rich and low molecular weight proteins with a strong affinity for essential and non essential metals cai et al 2010 therefore the lipophilic nature of metals will account for the ability of metal ions to bind to the hepatopancreas of crabs therefore nutrients and other non essential elements can get into crabs through the gills by dietary sources into the hepatopancreas and could be stored in the muscles and hepatopancreas thereby leading to bioaccumulation of toxins in crabs 3 3 human health risk assessment assessing the health risk of consuming crab species collected from this creek revealed that callinectes amnicola recorded hazard index hi values of 0 039 and 0 040 for adult males and females respectively and 0 049 and 0 056 for children males and females respectively table 5 similarly consumption of cardisoma armatum recorded hi values of 0 038 and 0 039 for adult males and females respectively and 0 048 and 0 054 for children males and females respectively hi values below 1 indicate that there is no risk to health islam et al 2014 javed and usmani 2016 similarly the thq for individual metals were all 1 indicating minimal risk by individual metals when consumed by adults and children these results were unlike those obtained from the health risk assessment of crabs sampled from the south east coast of india which indicated risk in the consumption of the crabs barath kumar et al 2019 the results of the present study were unlike initial studies which detected high concentrations of nickel cadmium chromium lead and copper in the tissues gills livers and muscles of grey mullet mugil cephalus collected from the creek resulting in hi for male and female adults of 7 612 and 7 840 respectively and male and female children of 9 567 and 10 842 respectively ihunwo et al 2020 the ingestion of cd through dietary means is the main source of human intake of cd a considerable amount of cd accumulates in tissues of marine fishery products such as molluscs and crustaceans including organ meat of marine mammals storelli 2011 in human beings the highest accumulation of cd is in the renal cortex cd also accumulates in the liver and kidney due to the long half time continued chronic exposure to cd leads to a continuous accumulation in the renal cortex as a result of the transfer of cd by metallothionein from other tissues to the kidney åkesson 2011 the absorption of cd by the gastrointestinal tract is inefficient cd mimicks fe by binding to proteins and red blood cells cd is transported to the tissues and organs of the body mendez armenta and rios 2011 acute exposure to cd causes damage to the kidney lungs bones placenta testes and brain in human beings mendez armenta and rios 2011 williams and jaeschke 2011 ni is taken up as nickel subsulfide crystalline nickel monosulfide nickel oxides and nickel ions by cells and intracellularly released leading to cytotoxicity chromosomal aberrations and genomic instability nordberg and fowler 2019 the main environmental release of ni is from fuel combustion and nickel industries although soluble forms of ni are absorbed directly by the internal organs and easily excreted insoluble ni compounds persist for a long in the body ellen and costa 2010 the human health effects due to the consumption of metal via crabs identified could pose a serious public health crisis in the area it is therefore necessary that environmental monitoring in the coastal regions of nigeria be more stringent it should go beyond the monitoring of the effect of oil and gas activities to the effect of day to day anthropogenic activities environmental regulatory agencies and policymakers should expand on monitoring protocols and policies 4 conclusion the evaluation of concentrations of cr ni cu as cd and pb retained in samples of surface water sediment and crabs tissues and the health risk involved in consuming these crabs was conducted under quality controlled conditions the mean concentrations of metals in surface water samples were in the order of pb cu cr cd ni while in sediment samples was pb ni cr cu cd while as was not detected in both the water and sediment samples in tissue samples of the three crab species pb was highest in the hepatopancreas and exceeded the permissible limit of metals in foods hazard index hi values below 0 056 indicate that there is no risk to health from the consumption of crabs collected from woji creek due to the metals assessed as was not detected in surface water or sediment the gills and hepatopancreas recorded higher values apparently due to the functions of gills in respiration and hepatopancreas in food digestion and toxin destruction which facilitated the accumulation of metal loid s in tissues as compared to the limbs that applied externally for locomotion compared to an initial study which identified higher concentrations of metals in tissues of grey mullet this study shows that the crabs sampled are poor accumulators of metal ions from this creek this study is the first in this creek to assess human health risks due to the ingestion of crabs with metal accumulated in their tissues therefore this study stands as a baseline study and can be used as a reference document following further investigations into this creek there is a need for environmental regulatory agencies to brace up in ensuring strict compliance with required standards for wastes and effluent management by industrialists and urbanites to prevent fatalities on the

and discussion 3 1 metal concentration in surface water and sediment mean values of metals in surface water in the four months revealed concentrations mg l of a trend of pb 3 252 cu 2 328 cr 1 590 cd 0 146 ni 0 109 table 3 meanwhile metal loid concentrations mg kg in sediments were higher and the trend was in the order pb 140 930 ni 37 481 cr 29 984 cu 21 001 cd 8 910 table 3 arsenic was not detected in either surface water or sediment samples the mean values of pb in the surface water were 3 252 1 240 mg l and in sediment was 140 930 68 656 mg kg nickel in surface water recorded a mean concentration of 0 109 0 293 mg l while cadmium in sediment recorded a mean concentration of 8 910 11 251 mg kg except for as all metals analysed showed a statistically significant difference in anova across the sample locations concentrations of metals analysed in the surface water sampled from woji creek were higher than those measured in rona river in tibet china qiao et al 2020 although sediment collected from one station in rona river recorded a similar mean concentration of cr as those of woji creek the cr concentrations were generally higher in rona river the concentrations of pb and cd in sediment analysed from woji creek are much higher than those of rona river while concentrations of cu in sediment samples from rona river are higher than those of woji creek lv et al 2019 concentrations of cu pb cr and cd in the surface water did not vary greatly from those measured in the three gorges reservoir tgr in china but concentrations in the sediment varied pb concentrations were much higher in woji creek while cr and cu were higher in tgr lin et al 2020 unlike results obtained from woji creek sheyangestuaryrecorded the presence of as in both sediment and surface water zhao et al 2018 this is also similar to surface water and sediment samples collected from korotoa river in bangladesh islam et al 2015 and from wuhan to shanghai of the changjiang river also known as the yangtze river in china li et al 2020 concentrations of surface water and sediment were determined in the soku oil field area of rivers state nigeria results obtained revealed lower concentrations of cd and pb when compared to results obtained in the present study olu et al 2019 3 2 metal concentration in crabs a comparison of the mean concentration of metals in the different tissues of the three crab species and those from other studies is presented in table 4 hepatopancreas of the crabs accumulated higher concentrations of cd and pb with mean concentrations of cd and pb of 0 110 0 008 mg kg and 1 364 0 060 mg kg in callinectes amnicola and 0 112 0 008 mg kg and 0 735 0 026 mg kg in cardisoma armatum respectively this trend was consistent with crabs assessed from the northern bay of bengal india karar et al 2019 metals analysed in the crab tissues revealed that the concentrations of pb and cr were highest in the two crab species pb was consistently highest in the hepatopancreas while cr was highest in the muscles callinectes amnicola tissues recorded slightly higher metal concentrations compared to cardisoma armatum this slightly higher concentration could be due to the medium which could affect the bioavailability of the metals i e metals in surface water tend to be more bioavailable than in sediment zhang et al 2014 metal accumulation in the tissues of callinectes amnicola was in the order muscles cr pb cd cu ni as gill pb cr cu cd ni as hepatopancreas pb cr cu cd ni as fig 5 in cardisoma armatum metal accumulation trend in tissues are in the order of muscles pb cr cu cd ni as gills ni pb cr cd cu as hepatopancreas pb cr cu cd ni as in callinectes amnicola analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference p 0 05 cd in the muscles and hepatopancreas cr in muscles and hepatopancreas and pb in the three crab tissues anova of metal concentrations in tissues of cardisoma armatum also revealed a statistically significant difference 0 05 cd in gills cr in muscles and gills and pb in the three crab tissues a comparison of the concentration of metals in the tissues of crabs in the present study and those from some other parts of the world is presented in table 4 gills are the respiratory organs of the crabs which enable them to breathe underwater their structure generally consists of numerous filamentous branches the numerous branches increase the available surface area which enhances gas exchange vitt and caldwell 2013 gill performs various functions in crabs which gives the crabs the ability to hyperregulate hemolymph osmotic and ionic concentrations hemolymph ph regulation and ammonia excretion mantel and farmer 1983 péqueux 1995 crabs have anterior gills which are characterised by thin epithelia leading to their specialization in gaseous exchange and posterior gill which are characterised by thick ionocytes which enables ion exchange garçon et al 2011 hence the gill of crabs plays important role in the accumulation of essential and non essential metals the hepatopancreas of crabs is vital for food absorption synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes and storage of lipids glycogen and minerals their function doubles as liver and pancreas ramadevi et al 1990 wang et al 2014 regulation of metals in crabs occurs in the hepatopancreas through the aid of the protein metallothionein karar et al 2019 metallothioneins are a group of soluble heat stable cysteine rich and low molecular weight proteins with a strong affinity for essential and non essential metals cai et al 2010 therefore the lipophilic nature of metals will account for the ability of metal ions to bind to the hepatopancreas of crabs therefore nutrients and other non essential elements can get into crabs through the gills by dietary sources into the hepatopancreas and could be stored in the muscles and hepatopancreas thereby leading to bioaccumulation of toxins in crabs 3 3 human health risk assessment assessing the health risk of consuming crab species collected from this creek revealed that callinectes amnicola recorded hazard index hi values of 0 039 and 0 040 for adult males and females respectively and 0 049 and 0 056 for children males and females respectively table 5 similarly consumption of cardisoma armatum recorded hi values of 0 038 and 0 039 for adult males and females respectively and 0 048 and 0 054 for children males and females respectively hi values below 1 indicate that there is no risk to health islam et al 2014 javed and usmani 2016 similarly the thq for individual metals were all 1 indicating minimal risk by individual metals when consumed by adults and children these results were unlike those obtained from the health risk assessment of crabs sampled from the south east coast of india which indicated risk in the consumption of the crabs barath kumar et al 2019 the results of the present study were unlike initial studies which detected high concentrations of nickel cadmium chromium lead and copper in the tissues gills livers and muscles of grey mullet mugil cephalus collected from the creek resulting in hi for male and female adults of 7 612 and 7 840 respectively and male and female children of 9 567 and 10 842 respectively ihunwo et al 2020 the ingestion of cd through dietary means is the main source of human intake of cd a considerable amount of cd accumulates in tissues of marine fishery products such as molluscs and crustaceans including organ meat of marine mammals storelli 2011 in human beings the highest accumulation of cd is in the renal cortex cd also accumulates in the liver and kidney due to the long half time continued chronic exposure to cd leads to a continuous accumulation in the renal cortex as a result of the transfer of cd by metallothionein from other tissues to the kidney åkesson 2011 the absorption of cd by the gastrointestinal tract is inefficient cd mimicks fe by binding to proteins and red blood cells cd is transported to the tissues and organs of the body mendez armenta and rios 2011 acute exposure to cd causes damage to the kidney lungs bones placenta testes and brain in human beings mendez armenta and rios 2011 williams and jaeschke 2011 ni is taken up as nickel subsulfide crystalline nickel monosulfide nickel oxides and nickel ions by cells and intracellularly released leading to cytotoxicity chromosomal aberrations and genomic instability nordberg and fowler 2019 the main environmental release of ni is from fuel combustion and nickel industries although soluble forms of ni are absorbed directly by the internal organs and easily excreted insoluble ni compounds persist for a long in the body ellen and costa 2010 the human health effects due to the consumption of metal via crabs identified could pose a serious public health crisis in the area it is therefore necessary that environmental monitoring in the coastal regions of nigeria be more stringent it should go beyond the monitoring of the effect of oil and gas activities to the effect of day to day anthropogenic activities environmental regulatory agencies and policymakers should expand on monitoring protocols and policies 4 conclusion the evaluation of concentrations of cr ni cu as cd and pb retained in samples of surface water sediment and crabs tissues and the health risk involved in consuming these crabs was conducted under quality controlled conditions the mean concentrations of metals in surface water samples were in the order of pb cu cr cd ni while in sediment samples was pb ni cr cu cd while as was not detected in both the water and sediment samples in tissue samples of the three crab species pb was highest in the hepatopancreas and exceeded the permissible limit of metals in foods hazard index hi values below 0 056 indicate that there is no risk to health from the consumption of crabs collected from woji creek due to the metals assessed as was not detected in surface water or sediment the gills and hepatopancreas recorded higher values apparently due to the functions of gills in respiration and hepatopancreas in food digestion and toxin destruction which facilitated the accumulation of metal loid s in tissues as compared to the limbs that applied externally for locomotion compared to an initial study which identified higher concentrations of metals in tissues of grey mullet this study shows that the crabs sampled are poor accumulators of metal ions from this creek this study is the first in this creek to assess human health risks due to the ingestion of crabs with metal accumulated in their tissues therefore this study stands as a baseline study and can be used as a reference document following further investigations into this creek there is a need for environmental regulatory agencies to brace up in ensuring strict compliance with required standards for wastes and effluent management by industrialists and urbanites to prevent fatalities on the

techniques of coastal wetland restoration nationwide and improve the overall level of ecological restoration in coastal wetland keywords coastal wetland ecological restoration biological process chemical process hydrological process greater bay areas 1 introduction the bay area is an area composed of a bay or several connected bays and adjacent islands greater bay areas are representative of many estuary areas where various natural evolution processes are relatively active and human production activities are also frequent xu et al 2022 as an important growth and technological innovation area for global economic development it has an important strategic position in economic construction and social development with the rapid economic development the economic construction of greater bay areas has made great progress but it has also paid a heavy price especially the estuary waters shallow waters tidal flats intertidal mangrove wetlands salt marshes and other coastal areas bearing the interference from high intensity of human activities pollution and occupation which lead to the degradation of coastal wetland resources xu et al 2022 li et al 2021 the changeable ecological and hydrological processes and complex topographic and geomorphological conditions in greater bay areas have formed a large area of estuarine wetlands intertidal mudflat wetlands and shallow waters within 6 m below the low tide line forming typical estuarine coastal wetland characteristics white et al 2019 wetlands play a key role in the ecological environment construction of greater bay areas however the dual coercion of high intensity human activities and climate change has also led to tremendous changes in the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas ecosystem functions are weakened and the overall service function of the ecosystem is severely reduced xu et al 2022 schulz et al 2020 monitoring by china s state forestry administration the academy of sciences and other departments and institutions shows that in the past half century china has lost 53 of temperate coastal wetlands 73 mangroves and 80 of coral reefs yu et al 2017 and seagrass beds in many places are or are about to become extinct according to the 2020 bulletin on the state of china s marine ecological environment severe eutrophication and water pollution have occurred in the coastal waters of major chinese bay areas such as liaodong bay yellow river estuary yangtze estuary hangzhou bay and pearl river estuary coastal wetlands are surrounded by reclamation terrestrial pollutant discharge and alien species invasion are threatened and problems such as area reduction habitat degradation and ecological function damage have appeared yan et al 2015 yu et al 2017 the decline of coastal wetland ecosystem functions in greater bay areas highlights the contradiction and conflict between regional ecological environment optimization and social and economic development yan et al 2015 yu et al 2017 based on web of science this study retrieved a total of 4369 articles related to the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas search conditions coast or coastal or tidal or salt marsh or delta or estuary or beach or mangrove or coral or seagrass or nearshore and restoration or recovery or rehabilitation or repair and bay from 1970 to 2021 among which the number of papers published in marine ecology progress series is the largest 198 in total the related research on the restoration of the damaged coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas is not deep enough summarizing the current research progress and development trend of the restoration of the coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas can help improve the theory of wetland restoration and clarify a series of difficulties in solving ecological and environmental problems it is of great significance and provides scientific and technical support for the research and practice of coastal wetland restoration in greater bay areas as shown in fig 1 the related research on the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas has been carried out in the 1970s and has developed rapidly since 1995 showing an increasing trend year by year among them studies related to biological process restoration and chemical process restoration account for a large proportion taking the basic principles and types of coastal wetland ecosystem restoration in greater bay areas as the breakthrough point this study focuses on the impact and degradation of human activities and climate change on the functional process of coastal wetlands as well as the corresponding restoration methods and approaches on the one hand we will systematically understand the importance and research progress of the restoration of the damaged coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas on the other hand we will put forward the future development trend of the restoration of damaged coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas and provide guidance for the development of wetland science and wetland restoration research 2 basic principles types and indicators of coastal wetland ecosystem restoration in greater bay areas 2 1 basic principles of coastal wetland ecosystem restoration in greater bay areas restoration of coastal wetland ecosystem refers to the restoration or reconstruction of degraded or occupied wetlands through physical chemical and biological ecological technologies and methods so as to restore the original structure function and process of coastal wetland and make it play its due ecosystem service value mitsch and gosselink 2015 water organisms and soil are the three basic elements of wetlands and the restoration or reconstruction of coastal wetlands mainly revolves around these three elements among which the restoration of hydrological processes is considered as the basic goal of restoration projects in addition greater emphasis is placed on the interaction between the three elements to restore the key processes of degradation through the coupling of spatiotemporal heterogeneity structural coordination and functional integrity different restoration scenarios are established restoration thresholds are determined and restoration mechanisms of coastal wetlands are revealed changes in the structure and function of wetland ecosystems can be analyzed through multi scenario simulations turner et al 2000 so as to determine key processes indicators and thresholds for restoration the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas are located in the transitional zone of interaction between sea and land and have rich ecosystem types mainly including estuarine waters delta wetlands coastal salty freshwater lakes mangroves salt marshes intertidal mud beaches rocky coasts shallow waters and subtidal aquatic layers they play important ecosystem functions such as maintaining biodiversity and conserving fishery resources trapping and absorbing nutrients to purify water controlling soil erosion and protecting coastlines storing water and flooding replenishing groundwater regulating regional climate providing cultural entertainment and scientific research places at present the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas have been or are being affected by climate change and human activities the main problems they face can be summarized as follows 1 changes in the pattern of coastal wetlands mainly including changes in the location of the coastline reduction in the width of the intertidal zone obstruction of river channels entering the sea and aggravation of wetland patching and artificialization 2 destruction of coastal wetland resources mainly including the occupation of the original living space the deterioration of fishery resources the destruction of biological populations and biological chains and the reduction of biodiversity 3 the decline of water exchange capacity mainly including changes in the characteristics of regional tidal currents resulting in the changes of sediment transport laws affecting the migration and transformation of pollutants and aggravating coastal eutrophication 4 the changes in coastal wetland attributes mainly including the reduction of natural biological productivity the reduction of ecological service function the threat of economic lifeline and the cause of regional social conflicts different restoration methods are selected to restore and rebuild the elements functions and processes of damaged wetlands the key is to identify the critical factors leading to wetland ecological degradation the degree of loss and the corresponding impact intensity and then use the principle of limiting factor to diagnose the key process of wetland ecosystem degradation and analyse the controllability and repairability of eco hydrological processes and ecological environment functions according to the relationship of hydrological connectivity and biological connectivity the damaged coastal wetlands are repaired and adjusted with wetland reconstruction coastline protection and restoration plant planting invasive species removal hydrological restoration isolation island reconstruction and restoration restoration of coastal wetland plants and benthic animals and the addition of nutrients to enhance the ecological process and ecosystem service value yu et al 2017 2 2 coastal wetland restoration types of greater bay areas according to the damage degree of coastal wetland ecosystem the coastal restoration in greater bay areas can be divided into three types natural restoration human intervention restoration and ecological reconstruction natural restoration means that when the coastal wetland ecosystem is slightly degraded by removing or weakening the interference behavior of human activities the coastal wetland ecosystem can recover its normal ecological process and ecological function through its resilience and adaptability thom 2000 for example the construction of breakwaters can protect mangroves from wave action slow down the sedimentation rate and promote the natural recovery of mangroves kamali and hashim 2011 engineering measures can also be taken to protect coastal wetlands outside the embankment and promote the colonization of salt marsh plants chen et al 2020a at the same time the restoration of the salt marsh ecosystem by promoting the restoration of hydrological connectivity in the degraded salt marsh area through dike removal is also natural restoration janousek et al 2021 restoration by human intervention means that when the ecosystem is damaged to a higher degree which the biological community structure habitat and functional process of the wetland ecosystem are irreversibly degraded and the ecosystem cannot be restored naturally however the wetland structure and ecosystem function can be restored or improved through regular human control and intervention zhang et al 2009 the commonly used methods include biological restoration and abiotic restoration biological restoration mainly includes removing invasive species and restoring wetland vegetation through transplantation and seedling raising abiotic restoration methods mainly include restoration of tidal exchange processes hydrological conditions sediment characteristics soil heavy metals and organic pollutants soil level sediment through dredging and management adjustment table 1 for example in the mangrove restoration project mangroves are replanted in the degraded or damaged mangrove wetland therefore the restoration of degraded mangroves belongs to artificial intervention xu et al 2022 ecological reconstruction refers to the ecological process of coastal wetland was completely degrade or loss of ecosystem structure and function which requires ecological engineering or technology to transform previously non existent wetland areas upland or subtidal habitats into wetlands hardy and wu 2021 schulz et al 2020 the reconstruction of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas needs suitable ecological conditions especially hydrological conditions for example in order to reduce the loss of salt marshes new salt marshes are often rebuilt to establish corresponding hydrological soil and vegetation conditions fitzsimmons et al 2012 some tidal flats and salt marsh are reconstructed by building new lagoons as well table 1 2 3 indicators for successful restoration of coastal wetland in greater bay areas the selection of indicators is crucial to assessing the success of coastal wetland restoration early studies focused on vegetation structure hydrological conditions and surface elevation and gradually evolved into functional indicators such as carbon sink and biomass estimation to assess the success of coastal wetland restoration billah et al 2022 at present the combination of composition structure and functional attributes of coastal wetland ecosystem is mainly used to evaluate the success of restoration the main ecological attributes include structural diversity ecosystem function species composition physical conditions and external exchange poppe and rybczyk 2021 table 2 the main ecological attributes can be further classified for example ecosystem functional attributes include primary productivity secondary productivity food web carbon dynamics sediment dynamics and nutrient dynamics table 2 a large number of studies have selected corresponding indicators for different ecological attributes table 2 and most of them are indicators that are relatively easy to measure and evaluate and are the key factors that constitute the corresponding ecological attributes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas carbon dynamics plant biomass and density surface water salinity and temperature fish structure nekton composition and density etc are often used as important indicators to measure the successful restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas billah et al 2022 in recent years the time lag in the selection of different evaluation indicators for the successful restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems has attracted the attention of many scholars relevant studies have shown that some indicators can be restored immediately for example after hydrological connectivity is restored hydrological indicators such as water level and water salinity can quickly recover to the level of healthy wetland ecosystems craft et al 2003 however it may take several years for plant structural characteristics such as biomass density of salt marshes to reach the equivalent state of natural salt marshes after coastal wetland restoration craft et al 2003 it will 5 25 years for macrobenthic density and about 100 years for carbon sinks to return to natural levels craft et al 2003 therefore the time lag should also be taken into account when measuring the success of restoration of the coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas and the assessment should be conducted effectively and efficiently so as to maintain and improve the value of the coastal wetland ecosystem with minimum resources time and work input 3 methods for restoration of coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas in view of the ecological restoration of degraded coastal wetlands in the world the united states europe asia africa australia and other coastal countries have carried out relevant studies since 1990 especially after 2000 they have entered a rapid growth stage compared with the coastal countries in greater bay areas which started earlier in terms of methods the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas can be divided into hydrological chemical and biological restoration according to different restoration objects 3 1 restoration method for hydrological process of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas some studies have shown that the main reason for the shrinking of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas is the blocking of hydrological processes between coastal wetland ecosystems and rivers or oceans caused by large scale human activities including the impact on water flow and velocity changes which directly changes the hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions between oceans or rivers and coastal wetlands xu et al 2018 these changes directly affect the external environmental conditions of aquatic organisms due to changes in water depth qin et al 2014 and coastline migration griffiths et al 2019 the temporal and spatial changes in hydrological regimes and material fluxes directly changed the living conditions of downstream phytoplankton fish and other organisms it results in a decline in the hydrological connectivity of coastal wetlands which directly affected the breeding dispersal and migration of species reduction or loss of habitat and biodiversity yan et al 2015 and decreased biological connectivity of coastal wetlands coastal wetland hydrological processes recovery is an important means for the restoration of ecosystem functions and plays a crucial role in the hydrodynamic process material exchange distribution and biomass of the flora and fauna in wetlands kelly and condeso 2017 the restoration method is usually described as restoring the hydrological pattern and hydrological conditions of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas and restoring the hydrological processes and hydrological connectivity of coastal wetlands table 1 the restoration of the hydrological pattern of the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas especially the removal of dike construction and improvement methods have been widely studied because the dykes have changed the hydrological and ecological characteristics of the coastal wetlands which is the main reason for the massive loss of coastal wetlands in the bay areas weinstein et al 2021 li et al 2021 among the four major bay areas san francisco bay restores natural tidal processes by repairing tidal trenches and at the same time stacks dredged mud at reasonable locations to make full use of natural processes and create diverse habitats for wildlife tokyo bay of japan has adopted a series of measures including controlling the water quality and quantity of upstream rivers to restore coastal habitat conditions and hydrological conditions wetland restoration requires scientific hydrological objectives with the deepening of research hydrological restoration in greater bay areas has been gradually extended to different hydrological model technologies for example marshall et al 2009 established a model to simulate hydrological and salinity conditions before anthropogenic changes so as to determine the baseline of hydrological restoration model methods mostly combine long term ecological data with observed seasonal and annual meteorological and hydrological data macvean et al 2018 restoration of hydrological connectivity refers to the restoration reconstruction and enhancement of the degree of hydrological connectivity between various types of wetland patches which is urgent in the ecological restoration and ecological protection of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas milbrandt et al 2015 macvean et al 2018 however it is not that higher hydrological connectivity is more beneficial to wetland ecosystem function especially when native species have adapted to fragmented habitat environments with low hydrological connectivity jackson pringle 2010 which was called functional connectivity many studies have shown that there is an optimal flow range to provide suitable physical conditions for the growth and dispersal process of individual aquatic organisms seenath et al 2016 water flow below the lower limit of the range results in a lower probability of encountering suspended food particles resulting in reduced growth rates of aquatic species water flow above the upper limit of the range results in inefficient capture of suspended food particles ackerman and nishizaki 2004 as in the danube river estuary the flow velocity of the aquatic plant community at its peak is about 0 3 m s as a phytoplankton with low biomass the optimum flow velocity is greater than 0 7 m s janauer et al 2010 the spatial distribution of water velocity and shellfish density significantly related olli and trunov 2010 biotoxicological studies have shown that under optimal hydrodynamic conditions the optimal growth of goby is determined by optimal temperature 25 c 0 02 and available nutrients liu et al 2011 3 2 restoration method for chemical processes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas are important sites for biogeochemical processes human activities such as agriculture dam building and engineering construction are having an important impact on their material migration processes and the migration transformation and spatial distribution of conventional nutrients such as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and nitrates are the main contents jickells et al 2014 for example by reducing the migration and transformation capacity of coastal wetlands for nutrient elements and trace metals the global element cycle is further affected jickells et al 2016 with the development of social economy and the increase of large scale human activities organic pollutants metal ions different forms of nitrogen phosphorus and other toxic organic pollutants entering the coastal wetlands of greater bay areas are also increasing the complex pollutants produced by human activities have seriously threatened the water environment function of coastal wetlands the complex pollution of nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants has become a typical feature of water pollution in coastal wetlands in china the water environmental effects of toxic organic pollutants under the coupling conditions of physical chemical and biological processes are gradually attracting attention zhang et al 2017 chemical process restoration methods and approaches are critical to maintaining the health of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas with the main goal of removing pollutants from influx or controlling pollution sources and restoring the quality of coastal waters and sediments yan et al 2022 organic pollution is one of the main pollutants currently threatening the coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas mainly including petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides at present microbial remediation and phytoremediation methods are widely used in restoration coastal wetlands are rich in microorganisms and plant that can degrade organic pollutants but the natural degradation efficiency is low therefore the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides and other organic pollutants by microorganisms and vegetation can be promoted by artificial inoculation of highly degrading strains highly enriched coastal wetland vegetation and addition of active substances cagle et al 2020 in addition bivalve mollusks have the ability to filter particles play a role in improving water transparency and quality in both saltwater and freshwater and can be used to solve pollution problems in a variety of habitats along rivers to estuaries kreeger et al 2018 with the concentration of population and industry in the coastal areas of tokyo bay japan a large number of pollutants such as chemicals organic matter and nutrients flow into the ocean causing health hazards and harmful algal blooms destroying fisheries and living environments in response japan has promoted the construction of sewage treatment systems and sewage treatment facilities total pollutant control systems tplcs have been implemented in the inland sea of tokyo bay to reduce the total pollutant load cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus into the closed ocean tomita et al 2015 in recent years the influx of tributyltin tbt pollutants in the marine environment has attracted attention which can cause adverse effects such as bioaccumulation abnormal proliferation of shells and hypoplasia although asian countries are major marine aquaculture producers but relatively few initiatives have been incorporated into national policies to combat the use of tbt and the current main recovery method is the extraction of eco friendly alternative compounds from marine natural products shin et al 2019 due to the influence of industrialization and urbanization the content of heavy metals in coastal wetlands surface sediments and sediments in greater bay areas as well as various forms of nitrogen phosphorus and other substances are excessive which exceeds the self purification ability of the ecosystem and causes inorganic pollution some microorganisms have strong tolerance to heavy metals in the environment and can reduce their harm to coastal wetland ecosystems through adsorption enrichment and transformation relevant studies have shown that some bacterial groups can enrich zn cd and hg in the environment through the adsorption desorption resorption cycle and the enrichment capacity increases with the increase of heavy metal content sprocati et al 2006 the use of wetland plants with enrichment function to remediate inorganic pollution such as heavy metals in coastal wetlands has the characteristics of simple method and low cost studies have found that phragmites australis typha orientalis presl and spartina alterniflora in the yellow river delta wetland can enrich and transfer heavy metals and nutrients in wetland water and soil and then harvesting plants can effectively remove pollutants in coastal wetlands yan et al 2022 at present there are many applications of heavy metal removal technology and the application of heavy metal composite repair materials the pearl river delta region is the main economic zone of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area where there are a large number of industrial and mining enterprises and heavy metal pollution is serious mainly caused by lead and cadmium liu et al 2019 developed a safe and efficient goethite fulvic acid composite material which can be effectively used for the remediation of lead and cadmium contaminated soil studies have shown that filter feeding bivalve molluscs can help increase the potential for nitrogen removal in the bay areas because their soft tissues and shells have a strong nitrogen uptake potential sebastiano et al 2015 3 3 restoration method for biological processes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas the most direct impact of human activities on coastal wetlands is the loss of biological habitats and the decline of biodiversity the fundamental reason is the change of biological function process of coastal wetlands the impact on biological function processes is mainly reflected in different local and regional differences the influence of local scale is mainly the impact of human activities on the population dynamics biological chain and trophic cascade of major taxa yan et al 2019 the impact of regional and cross regional scales is reflected in the long term human activities caused by the habitat of coastal areas the decline of the connectivity of the land network and the impact of coastal wetland development activities such as coastal cross regional human activities on large scale coastal wetland biological migration and dispersal processes xie et al 2017 wang et al 2018a at present biological process restoration methods are mainly aimed at the restoration of the biological composition and diversity of wetlands such as microorganisms vegetation and animals as well as the restoration of biological processes such as biological migration diffusion and trophic cascades restoration methods of biological composition mainly include replanting of target species and control of invasive species plant replanting refers to the restoration of local vegetation constructs by seed sowing or plant transplantation the establishment of a self sustaining plant population will provide an excellent living environment for invertebrates water birds microorganisms and other animals and plants dontis et al 2020 milbrandt et al 2015 the plant species replanted in the ecological restoration of coastal salt marshes in greater bay areas mainly include suaeda salsa phragmites australis tamarix chinensis scirpus mariqueter and mangrove etc dontis et al 2020 milbrandt et al 2015 liu et al 2017 on the other hand the structure and composition of the local coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas were also restored by removing invasive species for example the main methods of controlling the invasive species spartina alterniflora include mowing shading burning root breaking cofferdams freshwater inundation herbicide application and biological replacement by local plants liu et al 2016 in addition in terms of plant composition restoration methods based on the analysis of the interaction between vegetation and seed banks the restoration approach of soil seed banks in degraded wetlands was explored bossuyt and honnay 2008 the restoration of the species composition of benthic animals and macroinvertebrates can be achieved by constructing artificial reefs some studies have found that there are no significant differences in the composition and characteristics of benthic fish and macroinvertebrates between artificial reefs and corresponding natural habitats indicating that artificial reefs are beneficial to the recovery of coastal organisms carle et al 2020 wu et al 2019 in recent years many scholars have conducted in depth research on how to improve the biological function process of coastal wetlands for wetland restoration and have clarified the relationship between the nutrient cycling process among wetland patches and the ecosystem function lamers et al 2015 chen et al 2017 and the impact of wetland hydrological connectivity process restoration on biological communities krueger et al 2017 by establishing the key biological processes of coastal wetland ecosystems and their relationship with functions some scholars evaluated the response and recovery ability of coastal wetland ecosystems to external disturbances which provided a scientific basis for the restoration and comprehensive regulation of coastal wetland ecosystem functions krueger et al 2017 for example xie et al 2019a and wang et al 2018b studied the process of promoting the migration diffusion and colonization of salt marsh plants through micro topography restoration so as to improve the biodiversity of coastal wetland ecosystem relevant studies have shown that the resilience of coastal wetland ecosystems can be affected by regulating the connectivity process of trophic cascades such as algae removal which can promote coral growth and recruitment enhanced connectivity of mangroves can affect herbivore populations and benthic succession and can increase herbivore biomass and richness olds et al 2012 therefore enhancing the biological connectivity of coastal wetlands plays an important role in improving the biomass and promoting the restoration and maintenance of biodiversity to sum up the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas mainly focused on the restoration of hydrological processes chemical processes and biological processes the basic principles are mostly based on biological adaptability and the mechanism of the effects of biological adaptability characteristics and functional characteristics on ecological communities and ecosystem processes through biological adaptability processes is discussed however the response characteristics and functional characteristics of coastal wetland ecosystems mainly affect ecosystem processes through functional processes which in turn feedback ecological communities fig 2 and there are relatively few related studies at present 4 future research trends of coastal wetland restoration in greater bay areas ecological restoration is one of the important development directions of wetland restoration in the future in recent years researchers have made a lot of achievements in the theoretical research of wetland restoration and accumulated a lot of practical experience the key to the restoration of damaged coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas is the adjustment and restoration of functional processes the restoration of damaged functional processes needs to reveal the restoration threshold of functional process of coastal wetland he et al 2017 xie et al 2019b that is to explore how biological chemical and hydrological functional processes affect wetland ecosystem function and to reveal what kind of functional process condition can better maintain ecosystem function larsen et al 2017 to evaluate how to optimize biological chemical and hydrological functional processes to improve the connectivity model of ecological functions and give full play to the regulatory role of the functional process network on the restoration and reconstruction of wetland functions due to the complexity of the ecosystem itself and the abruptness of some environmental elements coupled with the limited understanding of the ecological functional process and its internal operating mechanism it is often impossible to accurately determine the consequences of coastal wetland restoration and the final direction of ecological succession in particular there is a lack of a deep understanding of the biological physical and chemical internal functional processes of wetlands and their responses to global changes a lack of effective methods to define the criteria for the restoration of wetland functional processes and a lack of effective methods to predict the future evolution of restored wetlands at present how to restore the functional processes of damaged coastal wetlands in greater bay areas and establish a comprehensive regulation model for damaged coastal wetlands has become an important strategy to deal with the impact of human activities and climate change on coastal wetlands which faces great challenges the functional processes of coastal wetlands play an important role in the maintenance of wetland ecosystem functions and the ecological integrity and functional sustainability of the ecosystem can be guaranteed by adjusting the biological and abiotic functional processes of coastal wetlands it is foreseeable that with the deepening of the understanding of the relationship between human activities climate change and wetland ecosystems the functional processes of coastal wetland ecosystems will be adjusted the restoration mechanism of ecosystem functions will be revealed and a comprehensive regulation model of ecological network based on key functional processes will be constructed it would be the key to realize the ecological protection and restoration of estuaries and coastal wetlands the key research directions mainly include the following aspects fig 3 1 diagnosis of impaired functional processes diagnose and analyze impaired critical functional processes that support specific ecosystem functions and their primary drivers under the dual effects of climate change and human activities the structure process and function of wetlands are affected resulting in changes in wetland attributes and ecological patterns and a decline in wetland ecological environment functions in view of the damage to the unique material cycle energy flow and information transfer functions of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas the ecosystem functions and spatial distribution characteristics of different types of coastal wetlands that were damaged need to be identified the damage analysis of the functional characteristics functional groups and functional structures of the key functional processes should be carried out and the damage diagnosis method of the key functional processes of the ecosystem should be developed to reveal the damage characteristics damage type damage degree and damage key areas to identify the key thresholds and scale ranges the key influencing factors and limiting factors of damage should be find out and establish the response relationship of key functional characteristics functional groups and functional structures of coastal wetland ecosystems to human activities and climate change 2 enhancement of biological functional processes the enhancement of key biological processes that support specific ecosystem functions such as diversity functions mainly includes the analysis of the key biological functional processes that are damaged in different types of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas such as biological growth and biological connectivity biological migration and dispersal processes the key species or complex populations that are decisive for key biological processes should be identified the changing rules of suitable habitat conditions ecological niches and biological relationships in different life cycle stages should be clarified and key links and limiting factors in the growth and connectivity of key species should be identified and multi spatiotemporal scale response models of key species functional characteristics to key links and limiting factors would be constructed so as to simulate the effects of key link recovery and limiting factor adjustment on biological functional processes 3 simulation of the functional processes of biogenic elements the processes of key biogenic elements that support specific ecosystem functions should be simulated such as carbon storage based on the damage analysis of key functional processes of coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas we should identify the functional processes of key source factors such as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur that need to be adjusted from the source transfer sink process the influence mechanism of exogenous input human activities and environmental conditions on the transformation occurrence and accumulation of biogenic elements need be clarified and the key links and spatio temporal response rules should be identified a dynamic model of key biogenic elements should be constructed to analyze the balance of income and expenditure and source sink relationship and to simulate the ecological effects and cumulative impacts caused by increasing or decreasing source terms transfer routes and sink terms with the goal of improving water self purification capacity and biological suitability adjust the source transfer and sink terms of different biogenic elements 4 restoration of hydrological functional processes key hydrological functional processes that support specific ecosystem functions such as hydrological connectivity need to be restored the ecological effects of changes in key hydrological functional processes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas should be explored and the characteristics of horizontal longitudinal and vertical hydrological connectivity structure and the transport and diffusion processes of sediment nutrients pollutants and organisms in the connectivity process should be identified the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of flow load frequency and extreme values of key hydrological processes under the influence of human activities and climate change need to be revealed and the relationship between these characteristics and hydrological connectivity structure need be identified the restriction mechanism of horizontal longitudinal and vertical hydrological connectivity on the survival functional characteristics distribution migration and diffusion of typical wetland plants and animals need to be revealed and the mutual feedback relationship between different hydrological connectivity intensity and biological connectivity should be simulated a hydrologic ecological response model based on the core hydrological connectivity structure and functional characteristics need to be constructed and restore key hydrological functional processes by adjusting rebuilding or replacing the core hydrological connectivity structure 5 construction of a multi objective multi scenario and multi scale network comprehensive regulation model with different types of wetland patches as nodes biological function processes biogenic element functional processes and hydrological functional processes as connecting paths or flow paths a multi level and multi function ecological network model from large bay estuarine and coastal zone coastal wetland patches to ecosystem could be built through the coastal wetland network processing the key nodes flow paths functional attributes functional structures and key areas connected by different functional processes should be systematically analyzed and the redundant and potential connectivity paths nodes functional characteristics and multifunctional processes could be identified for the biological functional processes network the key links and limiting factors of the growth and connection process of key species need to be regulated and the connection of the biological function process needs to be strengthened as for the functional processes network of biogenic elements the connection of pollution factors should be reduced or blocked and the connection of scarce factors should be enhanced or reconstructed for the hydrological functional processes network the core structure of hydrological connectivity should be adjusted reconstructed or replaced to restore the hydrological functional process connectivity the restoration model of hydrological connectivity and biological connectivity based on the analysis of key nodes flow paths functional attributes and key areas and the restoration offsetting model should be constructed combined with the attribute adjustment potential of different connectivity paths and nodes various combination modes of connectivity of different functional processes under different scenarios can be simulated then by integrating social economic and ecological factors and weighing the multifunctional objectives of wetland ecological network a multi scale integrated regulation model of coastal wetland network in greater bay areas from a single node to a local ecosystem could be

20066,we explored the potential for functional processes maintenance principles to be applied in coastal restoration greater bay areas are located in the transition zone between land and sea coastal wetlands play a key role in the ecological environment construction of greater bay areas due to the dual effects of high intensity human activities and climate change coastal wetlands in greater bay areas have suffered varying degrees of damage including reduced area habitat degradation and impaired ecological functions however the research progress and development trend of restoration of damaged coastal wetland ecosystems has not yet been revealed and the application theory of functional processes in coastal restoration is still unclear based on extensive literature research our study

techniques of coastal wetland restoration nationwide and improve the overall level of ecological restoration in coastal wetland keywords coastal wetland ecological restoration biological process chemical process hydrological process greater bay areas 1 introduction the bay area is an area composed of a bay or several connected bays and adjacent islands greater bay areas are representative of many estuary areas where various natural evolution processes are relatively active and human production activities are also frequent xu et al 2022 as an important growth and technological innovation area for global economic development it has an important strategic position in economic construction and social development with the rapid economic development the economic construction of greater bay areas has made great progress but it has also paid a heavy price especially the estuary waters shallow waters tidal flats intertidal mangrove wetlands salt marshes and other coastal areas bearing the interference from high intensity of human activities pollution and occupation which lead to the degradation of coastal wetland resources xu et al 2022 li et al 2021 the changeable ecological and hydrological processes and complex topographic and geomorphological conditions in greater bay areas have formed a large area of estuarine wetlands intertidal mudflat wetlands and shallow waters within 6 m below the low tide line forming typical estuarine coastal wetland characteristics white et al 2019 wetlands play a key role in the ecological environment construction of greater bay areas however the dual coercion of high intensity human activities and climate change has also led to tremendous changes in the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas ecosystem functions are weakened and the overall service function of the ecosystem is severely reduced xu et al 2022 schulz et al 2020 monitoring by china s state forestry administration the academy of sciences and other departments and institutions shows that in the past half century china has lost 53 of temperate coastal wetlands 73 mangroves and 80 of coral reefs yu et al 2017 and seagrass beds in many places are or are about to become extinct according to the 2020 bulletin on the state of china s marine ecological environment severe eutrophication and water pollution have occurred in the coastal waters of major chinese bay areas such as liaodong bay yellow river estuary yangtze estuary hangzhou bay and pearl river estuary coastal wetlands are surrounded by reclamation terrestrial pollutant discharge and alien species invasion are threatened and problems such as area reduction habitat degradation and ecological function damage have appeared yan et al 2015 yu et al 2017 the decline of coastal wetland ecosystem functions in greater bay areas highlights the contradiction and conflict between regional ecological environment optimization and social and economic development yan et al 2015 yu et al 2017 based on web of science this study retrieved a total of 4369 articles related to the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas search conditions coast or coastal or tidal or salt marsh or delta or estuary or beach or mangrove or coral or seagrass or nearshore and restoration or recovery or rehabilitation or repair and bay from 1970 to 2021 among which the number of papers published in marine ecology progress series is the largest 198 in total the related research on the restoration of the damaged coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas is not deep enough summarizing the current research progress and development trend of the restoration of the coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas can help improve the theory of wetland restoration and clarify a series of difficulties in solving ecological and environmental problems it is of great significance and provides scientific and technical support for the research and practice of coastal wetland restoration in greater bay areas as shown in fig 1 the related research on the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas has been carried out in the 1970s and has developed rapidly since 1995 showing an increasing trend year by year among them studies related to biological process restoration and chemical process restoration account for a large proportion taking the basic principles and types of coastal wetland ecosystem restoration in greater bay areas as the breakthrough point this study focuses on the impact and degradation of human activities and climate change on the functional process of coastal wetlands as well as the corresponding restoration methods and approaches on the one hand we will systematically understand the importance and research progress of the restoration of the damaged coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas on the other hand we will put forward the future development trend of the restoration of damaged coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas and provide guidance for the development of wetland science and wetland restoration research 2 basic principles types and indicators of coastal wetland ecosystem restoration in greater bay areas 2 1 basic principles of coastal wetland ecosystem restoration in greater bay areas restoration of coastal wetland ecosystem refers to the restoration or reconstruction of degraded or occupied wetlands through physical chemical and biological ecological technologies and methods so as to restore the original structure function and process of coastal wetland and make it play its due ecosystem service value mitsch and gosselink 2015 water organisms and soil are the three basic elements of wetlands and the restoration or reconstruction of coastal wetlands mainly revolves around these three elements among which the restoration of hydrological processes is considered as the basic goal of restoration projects in addition greater emphasis is placed on the interaction between the three elements to restore the key processes of degradation through the coupling of spatiotemporal heterogeneity structural coordination and functional integrity different restoration scenarios are established restoration thresholds are determined and restoration mechanisms of coastal wetlands are revealed changes in the structure and function of wetland ecosystems can be analyzed through multi scenario simulations turner et al 2000 so as to determine key processes indicators and thresholds for restoration the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas are located in the transitional zone of interaction between sea and land and have rich ecosystem types mainly including estuarine waters delta wetlands coastal salty freshwater lakes mangroves salt marshes intertidal mud beaches rocky coasts shallow waters and subtidal aquatic layers they play important ecosystem functions such as maintaining biodiversity and conserving fishery resources trapping and absorbing nutrients to purify water controlling soil erosion and protecting coastlines storing water and flooding replenishing groundwater regulating regional climate providing cultural entertainment and scientific research places at present the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas have been or are being affected by climate change and human activities the main problems they face can be summarized as follows 1 changes in the pattern of coastal wetlands mainly including changes in the location of the coastline reduction in the width of the intertidal zone obstruction of river channels entering the sea and aggravation of wetland patching and artificialization 2 destruction of coastal wetland resources mainly including the occupation of the original living space the deterioration of fishery resources the destruction of biological populations and biological chains and the reduction of biodiversity 3 the decline of water exchange capacity mainly including changes in the characteristics of regional tidal currents resulting in the changes of sediment transport laws affecting the migration and transformation of pollutants and aggravating coastal eutrophication 4 the changes in coastal wetland attributes mainly including the reduction of natural biological productivity the reduction of ecological service function the threat of economic lifeline and the cause of regional social conflicts different restoration methods are selected to restore and rebuild the elements functions and processes of damaged wetlands the key is to identify the critical factors leading to wetland ecological degradation the degree of loss and the corresponding impact intensity and then use the principle of limiting factor to diagnose the key process of wetland ecosystem degradation and analyse the controllability and repairability of eco hydrological processes and ecological environment functions according to the relationship of hydrological connectivity and biological connectivity the damaged coastal wetlands are repaired and adjusted with wetland reconstruction coastline protection and restoration plant planting invasive species removal hydrological restoration isolation island reconstruction and restoration restoration of coastal wetland plants and benthic animals and the addition of nutrients to enhance the ecological process and ecosystem service value yu et al 2017 2 2 coastal wetland restoration types of greater bay areas according to the damage degree of coastal wetland ecosystem the coastal restoration in greater bay areas can be divided into three types natural restoration human intervention restoration and ecological reconstruction natural restoration means that when the coastal wetland ecosystem is slightly degraded by removing or weakening the interference behavior of human activities the coastal wetland ecosystem can recover its normal ecological process and ecological function through its resilience and adaptability thom 2000 for example the construction of breakwaters can protect mangroves from wave action slow down the sedimentation rate and promote the natural recovery of mangroves kamali and hashim 2011 engineering measures can also be taken to protect coastal wetlands outside the embankment and promote the colonization of salt marsh plants chen et al 2020a at the same time the restoration of the salt marsh ecosystem by promoting the restoration of hydrological connectivity in the degraded salt marsh area through dike removal is also natural restoration janousek et al 2021 restoration by human intervention means that when the ecosystem is damaged to a higher degree which the biological community structure habitat and functional process of the wetland ecosystem are irreversibly degraded and the ecosystem cannot be restored naturally however the wetland structure and ecosystem function can be restored or improved through regular human control and intervention zhang et al 2009 the commonly used methods include biological restoration and abiotic restoration biological restoration mainly includes removing invasive species and restoring wetland vegetation through transplantation and seedling raising abiotic restoration methods mainly include restoration of tidal exchange processes hydrological conditions sediment characteristics soil heavy metals and organic pollutants soil level sediment through dredging and management adjustment table 1 for example in the mangrove restoration project mangroves are replanted in the degraded or damaged mangrove wetland therefore the restoration of degraded mangroves belongs to artificial intervention xu et al 2022 ecological reconstruction refers to the ecological process of coastal wetland was completely degrade or loss of ecosystem structure and function which requires ecological engineering or technology to transform previously non existent wetland areas upland or subtidal habitats into wetlands hardy and wu 2021 schulz et al 2020 the reconstruction of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas needs suitable ecological conditions especially hydrological conditions for example in order to reduce the loss of salt marshes new salt marshes are often rebuilt to establish corresponding hydrological soil and vegetation conditions fitzsimmons et al 2012 some tidal flats and salt marsh are reconstructed by building new lagoons as well table 1 2 3 indicators for successful restoration of coastal wetland in greater bay areas the selection of indicators is crucial to assessing the success of coastal wetland restoration early studies focused on vegetation structure hydrological conditions and surface elevation and gradually evolved into functional indicators such as carbon sink and biomass estimation to assess the success of coastal wetland restoration billah et al 2022 at present the combination of composition structure and functional attributes of coastal wetland ecosystem is mainly used to evaluate the success of restoration the main ecological attributes include structural diversity ecosystem function species composition physical conditions and external exchange poppe and rybczyk 2021 table 2 the main ecological attributes can be further classified for example ecosystem functional attributes include primary productivity secondary productivity food web carbon dynamics sediment dynamics and nutrient dynamics table 2 a large number of studies have selected corresponding indicators for different ecological attributes table 2 and most of them are indicators that are relatively easy to measure and evaluate and are the key factors that constitute the corresponding ecological attributes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas carbon dynamics plant biomass and density surface water salinity and temperature fish structure nekton composition and density etc are often used as important indicators to measure the successful restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas billah et al 2022 in recent years the time lag in the selection of different evaluation indicators for the successful restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems has attracted the attention of many scholars relevant studies have shown that some indicators can be restored immediately for example after hydrological connectivity is restored hydrological indicators such as water level and water salinity can quickly recover to the level of healthy wetland ecosystems craft et al 2003 however it may take several years for plant structural characteristics such as biomass density of salt marshes to reach the equivalent state of natural salt marshes after coastal wetland restoration craft et al 2003 it will 5 25 years for macrobenthic density and about 100 years for carbon sinks to return to natural levels craft et al 2003 therefore the time lag should also be taken into account when measuring the success of restoration of the coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas and the assessment should be conducted effectively and efficiently so as to maintain and improve the value of the coastal wetland ecosystem with minimum resources time and work input 3 methods for restoration of coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas in view of the ecological restoration of degraded coastal wetlands in the world the united states europe asia africa australia and other coastal countries have carried out relevant studies since 1990 especially after 2000 they have entered a rapid growth stage compared with the coastal countries in greater bay areas which started earlier in terms of methods the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas can be divided into hydrological chemical and biological restoration according to different restoration objects 3 1 restoration method for hydrological process of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas some studies have shown that the main reason for the shrinking of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas is the blocking of hydrological processes between coastal wetland ecosystems and rivers or oceans caused by large scale human activities including the impact on water flow and velocity changes which directly changes the hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions between oceans or rivers and coastal wetlands xu et al 2018 these changes directly affect the external environmental conditions of aquatic organisms due to changes in water depth qin et al 2014 and coastline migration griffiths et al 2019 the temporal and spatial changes in hydrological regimes and material fluxes directly changed the living conditions of downstream phytoplankton fish and other organisms it results in a decline in the hydrological connectivity of coastal wetlands which directly affected the breeding dispersal and migration of species reduction or loss of habitat and biodiversity yan et al 2015 and decreased biological connectivity of coastal wetlands coastal wetland hydrological processes recovery is an important means for the restoration of ecosystem functions and plays a crucial role in the hydrodynamic process material exchange distribution and biomass of the flora and fauna in wetlands kelly and condeso 2017 the restoration method is usually described as restoring the hydrological pattern and hydrological conditions of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas and restoring the hydrological processes and hydrological connectivity of coastal wetlands table 1 the restoration of the hydrological pattern of the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas especially the removal of dike construction and improvement methods have been widely studied because the dykes have changed the hydrological and ecological characteristics of the coastal wetlands which is the main reason for the massive loss of coastal wetlands in the bay areas weinstein et al 2021 li et al 2021 among the four major bay areas san francisco bay restores natural tidal processes by repairing tidal trenches and at the same time stacks dredged mud at reasonable locations to make full use of natural processes and create diverse habitats for wildlife tokyo bay of japan has adopted a series of measures including controlling the water quality and quantity of upstream rivers to restore coastal habitat conditions and hydrological conditions wetland restoration requires scientific hydrological objectives with the deepening of research hydrological restoration in greater bay areas has been gradually extended to different hydrological model technologies for example marshall et al 2009 established a model to simulate hydrological and salinity conditions before anthropogenic changes so as to determine the baseline of hydrological restoration model methods mostly combine long term ecological data with observed seasonal and annual meteorological and hydrological data macvean et al 2018 restoration of hydrological connectivity refers to the restoration reconstruction and enhancement of the degree of hydrological connectivity between various types of wetland patches which is urgent in the ecological restoration and ecological protection of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas milbrandt et al 2015 macvean et al 2018 however it is not that higher hydrological connectivity is more beneficial to wetland ecosystem function especially when native species have adapted to fragmented habitat environments with low hydrological connectivity jackson pringle 2010 which was called functional connectivity many studies have shown that there is an optimal flow range to provide suitable physical conditions for the growth and dispersal process of individual aquatic organisms seenath et al 2016 water flow below the lower limit of the range results in a lower probability of encountering suspended food particles resulting in reduced growth rates of aquatic species water flow above the upper limit of the range results in inefficient capture of suspended food particles ackerman and nishizaki 2004 as in the danube river estuary the flow velocity of the aquatic plant community at its peak is about 0 3 m s as a phytoplankton with low biomass the optimum flow velocity is greater than 0 7 m s janauer et al 2010 the spatial distribution of water velocity and shellfish density significantly related olli and trunov 2010 biotoxicological studies have shown that under optimal hydrodynamic conditions the optimal growth of goby is determined by optimal temperature 25 c 0 02 and available nutrients liu et al 2011 3 2 restoration method for chemical processes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas the coastal wetlands in greater bay areas are important sites for biogeochemical processes human activities such as agriculture dam building and engineering construction are having an important impact on their material migration processes and the migration transformation and spatial distribution of conventional nutrients such as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and nitrates are the main contents jickells et al 2014 for example by reducing the migration and transformation capacity of coastal wetlands for nutrient elements and trace metals the global element cycle is further affected jickells et al 2016 with the development of social economy and the increase of large scale human activities organic pollutants metal ions different forms of nitrogen phosphorus and other toxic organic pollutants entering the coastal wetlands of greater bay areas are also increasing the complex pollutants produced by human activities have seriously threatened the water environment function of coastal wetlands the complex pollution of nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants has become a typical feature of water pollution in coastal wetlands in china the water environmental effects of toxic organic pollutants under the coupling conditions of physical chemical and biological processes are gradually attracting attention zhang et al 2017 chemical process restoration methods and approaches are critical to maintaining the health of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas with the main goal of removing pollutants from influx or controlling pollution sources and restoring the quality of coastal waters and sediments yan et al 2022 organic pollution is one of the main pollutants currently threatening the coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas mainly including petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides at present microbial remediation and phytoremediation methods are widely used in restoration coastal wetlands are rich in microorganisms and plant that can degrade organic pollutants but the natural degradation efficiency is low therefore the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides and other organic pollutants by microorganisms and vegetation can be promoted by artificial inoculation of highly degrading strains highly enriched coastal wetland vegetation and addition of active substances cagle et al 2020 in addition bivalve mollusks have the ability to filter particles play a role in improving water transparency and quality in both saltwater and freshwater and can be used to solve pollution problems in a variety of habitats along rivers to estuaries kreeger et al 2018 with the concentration of population and industry in the coastal areas of tokyo bay japan a large number of pollutants such as chemicals organic matter and nutrients flow into the ocean causing health hazards and harmful algal blooms destroying fisheries and living environments in response japan has promoted the construction of sewage treatment systems and sewage treatment facilities total pollutant control systems tplcs have been implemented in the inland sea of tokyo bay to reduce the total pollutant load cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus into the closed ocean tomita et al 2015 in recent years the influx of tributyltin tbt pollutants in the marine environment has attracted attention which can cause adverse effects such as bioaccumulation abnormal proliferation of shells and hypoplasia although asian countries are major marine aquaculture producers but relatively few initiatives have been incorporated into national policies to combat the use of tbt and the current main recovery method is the extraction of eco friendly alternative compounds from marine natural products shin et al 2019 due to the influence of industrialization and urbanization the content of heavy metals in coastal wetlands surface sediments and sediments in greater bay areas as well as various forms of nitrogen phosphorus and other substances are excessive which exceeds the self purification ability of the ecosystem and causes inorganic pollution some microorganisms have strong tolerance to heavy metals in the environment and can reduce their harm to coastal wetland ecosystems through adsorption enrichment and transformation relevant studies have shown that some bacterial groups can enrich zn cd and hg in the environment through the adsorption desorption resorption cycle and the enrichment capacity increases with the increase of heavy metal content sprocati et al 2006 the use of wetland plants with enrichment function to remediate inorganic pollution such as heavy metals in coastal wetlands has the characteristics of simple method and low cost studies have found that phragmites australis typha orientalis presl and spartina alterniflora in the yellow river delta wetland can enrich and transfer heavy metals and nutrients in wetland water and soil and then harvesting plants can effectively remove pollutants in coastal wetlands yan et al 2022 at present there are many applications of heavy metal removal technology and the application of heavy metal composite repair materials the pearl river delta region is the main economic zone of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area where there are a large number of industrial and mining enterprises and heavy metal pollution is serious mainly caused by lead and cadmium liu et al 2019 developed a safe and efficient goethite fulvic acid composite material which can be effectively used for the remediation of lead and cadmium contaminated soil studies have shown that filter feeding bivalve molluscs can help increase the potential for nitrogen removal in the bay areas because their soft tissues and shells have a strong nitrogen uptake potential sebastiano et al 2015 3 3 restoration method for biological processes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas the most direct impact of human activities on coastal wetlands is the loss of biological habitats and the decline of biodiversity the fundamental reason is the change of biological function process of coastal wetlands the impact on biological function processes is mainly reflected in different local and regional differences the influence of local scale is mainly the impact of human activities on the population dynamics biological chain and trophic cascade of major taxa yan et al 2019 the impact of regional and cross regional scales is reflected in the long term human activities caused by the habitat of coastal areas the decline of the connectivity of the land network and the impact of coastal wetland development activities such as coastal cross regional human activities on large scale coastal wetland biological migration and dispersal processes xie et al 2017 wang et al 2018a at present biological process restoration methods are mainly aimed at the restoration of the biological composition and diversity of wetlands such as microorganisms vegetation and animals as well as the restoration of biological processes such as biological migration diffusion and trophic cascades restoration methods of biological composition mainly include replanting of target species and control of invasive species plant replanting refers to the restoration of local vegetation constructs by seed sowing or plant transplantation the establishment of a self sustaining plant population will provide an excellent living environment for invertebrates water birds microorganisms and other animals and plants dontis et al 2020 milbrandt et al 2015 the plant species replanted in the ecological restoration of coastal salt marshes in greater bay areas mainly include suaeda salsa phragmites australis tamarix chinensis scirpus mariqueter and mangrove etc dontis et al 2020 milbrandt et al 2015 liu et al 2017 on the other hand the structure and composition of the local coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas were also restored by removing invasive species for example the main methods of controlling the invasive species spartina alterniflora include mowing shading burning root breaking cofferdams freshwater inundation herbicide application and biological replacement by local plants liu et al 2016 in addition in terms of plant composition restoration methods based on the analysis of the interaction between vegetation and seed banks the restoration approach of soil seed banks in degraded wetlands was explored bossuyt and honnay 2008 the restoration of the species composition of benthic animals and macroinvertebrates can be achieved by constructing artificial reefs some studies have found that there are no significant differences in the composition and characteristics of benthic fish and macroinvertebrates between artificial reefs and corresponding natural habitats indicating that artificial reefs are beneficial to the recovery of coastal organisms carle et al 2020 wu et al 2019 in recent years many scholars have conducted in depth research on how to improve the biological function process of coastal wetlands for wetland restoration and have clarified the relationship between the nutrient cycling process among wetland patches and the ecosystem function lamers et al 2015 chen et al 2017 and the impact of wetland hydrological connectivity process restoration on biological communities krueger et al 2017 by establishing the key biological processes of coastal wetland ecosystems and their relationship with functions some scholars evaluated the response and recovery ability of coastal wetland ecosystems to external disturbances which provided a scientific basis for the restoration and comprehensive regulation of coastal wetland ecosystem functions krueger et al 2017 for example xie et al 2019a and wang et al 2018b studied the process of promoting the migration diffusion and colonization of salt marsh plants through micro topography restoration so as to improve the biodiversity of coastal wetland ecosystem relevant studies have shown that the resilience of coastal wetland ecosystems can be affected by regulating the connectivity process of trophic cascades such as algae removal which can promote coral growth and recruitment enhanced connectivity of mangroves can affect herbivore populations and benthic succession and can increase herbivore biomass and richness olds et al 2012 therefore enhancing the biological connectivity of coastal wetlands plays an important role in improving the biomass and promoting the restoration and maintenance of biodiversity to sum up the restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas mainly focused on the restoration of hydrological processes chemical processes and biological processes the basic principles are mostly based on biological adaptability and the mechanism of the effects of biological adaptability characteristics and functional characteristics on ecological communities and ecosystem processes through biological adaptability processes is discussed however the response characteristics and functional characteristics of coastal wetland ecosystems mainly affect ecosystem processes through functional processes which in turn feedback ecological communities fig 2 and there are relatively few related studies at present 4 future research trends of coastal wetland restoration in greater bay areas ecological restoration is one of the important development directions of wetland restoration in the future in recent years researchers have made a lot of achievements in the theoretical research of wetland restoration and accumulated a lot of practical experience the key to the restoration of damaged coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas is the adjustment and restoration of functional processes the restoration of damaged functional processes needs to reveal the restoration threshold of functional process of coastal wetland he et al 2017 xie et al 2019b that is to explore how biological chemical and hydrological functional processes affect wetland ecosystem function and to reveal what kind of functional process condition can better maintain ecosystem function larsen et al 2017 to evaluate how to optimize biological chemical and hydrological functional processes to improve the connectivity model of ecological functions and give full play to the regulatory role of the functional process network on the restoration and reconstruction of wetland functions due to the complexity of the ecosystem itself and the abruptness of some environmental elements coupled with the limited understanding of the ecological functional process and its internal operating mechanism it is often impossible to accurately determine the consequences of coastal wetland restoration and the final direction of ecological succession in particular there is a lack of a deep understanding of the biological physical and chemical internal functional processes of wetlands and their responses to global changes a lack of effective methods to define the criteria for the restoration of wetland functional processes and a lack of effective methods to predict the future evolution of restored wetlands at present how to restore the functional processes of damaged coastal wetlands in greater bay areas and establish a comprehensive regulation model for damaged coastal wetlands has become an important strategy to deal with the impact of human activities and climate change on coastal wetlands which faces great challenges the functional processes of coastal wetlands play an important role in the maintenance of wetland ecosystem functions and the ecological integrity and functional sustainability of the ecosystem can be guaranteed by adjusting the biological and abiotic functional processes of coastal wetlands it is foreseeable that with the deepening of the understanding of the relationship between human activities climate change and wetland ecosystems the functional processes of coastal wetland ecosystems will be adjusted the restoration mechanism of ecosystem functions will be revealed and a comprehensive regulation model of ecological network based on key functional processes will be constructed it would be the key to realize the ecological protection and restoration of estuaries and coastal wetlands the key research directions mainly include the following aspects fig 3 1 diagnosis of impaired functional processes diagnose and analyze impaired critical functional processes that support specific ecosystem functions and their primary drivers under the dual effects of climate change and human activities the structure process and function of wetlands are affected resulting in changes in wetland attributes and ecological patterns and a decline in wetland ecological environment functions in view of the damage to the unique material cycle energy flow and information transfer functions of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas the ecosystem functions and spatial distribution characteristics of different types of coastal wetlands that were damaged need to be identified the damage analysis of the functional characteristics functional groups and functional structures of the key functional processes should be carried out and the damage diagnosis method of the key functional processes of the ecosystem should be developed to reveal the damage characteristics damage type damage degree and damage key areas to identify the key thresholds and scale ranges the key influencing factors and limiting factors of damage should be find out and establish the response relationship of key functional characteristics functional groups and functional structures of coastal wetland ecosystems to human activities and climate change 2 enhancement of biological functional processes the enhancement of key biological processes that support specific ecosystem functions such as diversity functions mainly includes the analysis of the key biological functional processes that are damaged in different types of coastal wetland ecosystems in greater bay areas such as biological growth and biological connectivity biological migration and dispersal processes the key species or complex populations that are decisive for key biological processes should be identified the changing rules of suitable habitat conditions ecological niches and biological relationships in different life cycle stages should be clarified and key links and limiting factors in the growth and connectivity of key species should be identified and multi spatiotemporal scale response models of key species functional characteristics to key links and limiting factors would be constructed so as to simulate the effects of key link recovery and limiting factor adjustment on biological functional processes 3 simulation of the functional processes of biogenic elements the processes of key biogenic elements that support specific ecosystem functions should be simulated such as carbon storage based on the damage analysis of key functional processes of coastal wetland ecosystem in greater bay areas we should identify the functional processes of key source factors such as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur that need to be adjusted from the source transfer sink process the influence mechanism of exogenous input human activities and environmental conditions on the transformation occurrence and accumulation of biogenic elements need be clarified and the key links and spatio temporal response rules should be identified a dynamic model of key biogenic elements should be constructed to analyze the balance of income and expenditure and source sink relationship and to simulate the ecological effects and cumulative impacts caused by increasing or decreasing source terms transfer routes and sink terms with the goal of improving water self purification capacity and biological suitability adjust the source transfer and sink terms of different biogenic elements 4 restoration of hydrological functional processes key hydrological functional processes that support specific ecosystem functions such as hydrological connectivity need to be restored the ecological effects of changes in key hydrological functional processes of coastal wetlands in greater bay areas should be explored and the characteristics of horizontal longitudinal and vertical hydrological connectivity structure and the transport and diffusion processes of sediment nutrients pollutants and organisms in the connectivity process should be identified the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of flow load frequency and extreme values of key hydrological processes under the influence of human activities and climate change need to be revealed and the relationship between these characteristics and hydrological connectivity structure need be identified the restriction mechanism of horizontal longitudinal and vertical hydrological connectivity on the survival functional characteristics distribution migration and diffusion of typical wetland plants and animals need to be revealed and the mutual feedback relationship between different hydrological connectivity intensity and biological connectivity should be simulated a hydrologic ecological response model based on the core hydrological connectivity structure and functional characteristics need to be constructed and restore key hydrological functional processes by adjusting rebuilding or replacing the core hydrological connectivity structure 5 construction of a multi objective multi scenario and multi scale network comprehensive regulation model with different types of wetland patches as nodes biological function processes biogenic element functional processes and hydrological functional processes as connecting paths or flow paths a multi level and multi function ecological network model from large bay estuarine and coastal zone coastal wetland patches to ecosystem could be built through the coastal wetland network processing the key nodes flow paths functional attributes functional structures and key areas connected by different functional processes should be systematically analyzed and the redundant and potential connectivity paths nodes functional characteristics and multifunctional processes could be identified for the biological functional processes network the key links and limiting factors of the growth and connection process of key species need to be regulated and the connection of the biological function process needs to be strengthened as for the functional processes network of biogenic elements the connection of pollution factors should be reduced or blocked and the connection of scarce factors should be enhanced or reconstructed for the hydrological functional processes network the core structure of hydrological connectivity should be adjusted reconstructed or replaced to restore the hydrological functional process connectivity the restoration model of hydrological connectivity and biological connectivity based on the analysis of key nodes flow paths functional attributes and key areas and the restoration offsetting model should be constructed combined with the attribute adjustment potential of different connectivity paths and nodes various combination modes of connectivity of different functional processes under different scenarios can be simulated then by integrating social economic and ecological factors and weighing the

20067,globalization and industrialization lead to the corresponding increase of effluents discharged into the nearest water bodies the persistence of pollution in the ecological system has led to uncertainty about living habitats drinking water safety has become a societal issue attached to great importance as we increasingly become aware of environmental problems and their impacts on human life we realize that current problem solving using contemporary water treatment techniques cannot provide adequate solutions owing to their advantages and disadvantages nature based solutions are required as they are the best alternative for treating polluted water conventional coagulation is not a new technique that has been utilized in ancient times and works as a sustainable solution for water treatment and reduces the costs associated with the other treatment methods even though these techniques have been practised since ancient times there is still a need to explore more plants to identify coagulating properties the current study aims to do the phytochemical and physicochemical screening of the plant based materials to identify them as coagulants and compare their efficiencies with the conventional inorganic and animal based coagulants out of 18 plant based materials moringa oleifera manihot esculenta and pisum sativum removed turbidity up to 100 are subjected to the ftir xrd and sem to analyze the functionalized groups responsible for the polymer formation and identify the interaction between the coagulator s and suspended particles the results showed that plant based materials could be promising solutions for water quality challenges keywords natural coagulants phytochemical physicochemical screening turbidity and sustainability introduction in recent years globalization and industrialization enhanced water extraction from natural resources ugwu et al 2017 saritha et al 2021 this resulted in the more significant discharge of wastewater in larger volumes to the ecological system without proper treatment further this industrial effluent released to the nearest water bodies consists of recalcitrant chemicals solids sludge and turbidity okolo et al 2021 abiyu et al 2018 stated that the unavailability of potable water has been becoming a primary concern for water related diseases and further acting as a source water engineers have become more concerned about reducing the costs associated with advanced treatment technologies and emphasizing solutions for potable water in the current scenario many countries have adopted advanced treatment options like reverse osmosis catalysis membrane filtration water oxidation etc to treat water contaminated with pollutants but each treatment units have its disadvantages and advantages polluted surface water consists of different types of dispersed solid substances called collides this surface consists of a negative charge causing repulsions the repulsions of the particles lead to remain these particles in the suspension siangko et al 2021 the colloidal particles with the charges cannot be separated using traditional and advanced treatment methods the particles clog the membrane s pores leading to the membrane s fouling causing serious concerns to the water industries as the replacement of the membrane is associated with high costs tran et al 2022 karnena and saritha 2022 further from the literature it was understood that releasing wastewater with high turbidity to the nearest water bodies and the ecological system will undoubtedly affect the aquatic environment disturb biological activities interferes with the penetration of light alharbi et al 2018 and alter the water quality of the streams antov et al 2018 saritha et al 2017 the turbidity in the water owing to the colloidal particles provides adsorption sites to the chemicals causing large orders and taste antov et al 2018 turbidity is considered one of the most significant problems causing haziness to the water caused by the organic inorganic and biological pollutants in water treatment units antov et al 2018 thus the new cost effective technologies need to meet the standards set by the local authorities before discharging okolo et al 2021 karnena et al 2022a coagulation has proven to be a cost effective and greener technology for surface water treatment compared to the other available treatment options hoong and ismail 2018 the coagulation and flocculation process used in the pre or post treatment units depends on the affluent and plant design this process can be operated in three steps firstly the coagulation in which the colloidal suspension consisting of colloids is destabilized and flocculation the destabilized particles are agglomerated and later in the sedimentation separated using the settling gravity narmatha et al 2017 the coagulation occurs within seconds but the formation of the flocs might take minutes to hours and result in the particles destabilization and settling for the following treatment coagulation techniques were used in many treatment industries like pharmaceutical paper and pulp food cosmetics etc conventionally inorganic coagulants like ferric chloride aluminium sulphate calcium hydroxide lime poly aluminium etc have been utilized by water industries to treat the water even though these coagulants remove many pollutants from the source they still have shortcomings inorganic coagulants are costly cause environmental toxicity and produce large amounts wang et al 2015 karnena and saritha 2021 further a few researchers tomljenovic 2011 bongiovani et al 2016 stated that using alum and poly aluminium chloride for treating water via coagulation might lead to alzheimer s the treated water consists of chemical ionic residues that cause damage to health in addition these inorganic chemical coagulants showed a more remarkable performance for destabilizing suspended particles however there is still a need for the research for alternative research which is eco friendly and acts as a substitute seghosime et al 2017 the broad spectrum of biodiversity enabled the researchers to find alternatives for water treatment and greener technologies are among them to solve this problem many researchers have taken drinking water treatment options globally and presented promising results patchaiyappan devipriya 2022 developing nations widely use natural coagulants as water treatment technologies due to their lower costs and raw material availability than conventional inorganic coagulants leone et al 2015 many researchers have recently used and studied plant based coagulants to treat water however the widely used and known coagulants are tannins acorn ocimum etc tawakkoly et al 2019 oladoja et al 2017 karnena and saritha 2020 there is still a gap in the literature for an in depth understanding of plant based coagulants and constituents responsible for coagulation thus we have attempted to understand and identify the plant based materials in treating the water primarily by considering the phytochemical parameters relating to the presence of the functionalized groups in turbidity removal to date no studies have been made and attempted to link the phytochemical parameters of the plants to turbidity removal the objective of the present research is to conduct a phytochemical screening of plant based materials 18 and compare it with conventional inorganic coagulants 2 and animal based coagulants 1 to remove turbidity materials and methods coagulants preparations plant based resources were procured from the resident markets the essential parts of the coagulants were sun dried and made into powder using a domestic blender the powder obtained by blending was sieved using a 0 25µ sieve the inorganic chemicals aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were purchased from the analytical grade s merck chemical and used without any purification the chitin of laboratory grade was procured from the himedia chemical and used for the current experiment synthetic turbid water 10 g of bentonite procured from sigma aldrich was dissolved in 1 litre deionized water to prepare the stock solution the stock solution was agitated for 24 h at 20 rpm using the jar test device to identify even dispersion the prepared suspension solution was 100 ntu indicating 10 ml of the stock solution is equivalent to 1 ntu in 1000 ml dilution the 70 ntu and 150 ntu turbidity solutions were prepared by dissolving 70 ml and 150 ml of the stock solution into the 1000 ml volumetric flasks and making them up with deionized water jar test apparatus experiment the coagulants efficiencies were evaluated using a conventional flocculator and the experiments were carried out in sets the flocculator used for the investigation is centex brand and the experiments were conducted in triplicates and presented as average the coagulant powders were weighed using the weighing balance with an accuracy of 10 6 the concentrations designed for the experiment are added to the 2000 ml beakers consisting of 1 litre synthetic turbid waters these solutions are agitated for 120 s at 100 rpm and 20 min at 20 rpm they can settle under laboratory conditions by a gravitational pull for half an hour analytical procedures the supernatant solution of the coagulated samples after the coagulation was used to measure the turbidity and the following parameters turbidity the pre and post analysis coagulation samples were determined using the turbidity meter the instrument calibration was done using the standard 40 ntu solutions after which the samples were tested colour a wavelength of 456 nm was selected to measure the colour the spectrophotometer should be warmup accordingly the pt co absorbance has a maximum absorbance in this wavelength one spectrophotometer cell was filled with water to set the instrument to zero rinse the other cell of the device later read the colour of the samples and plot the curve against the standard curve r e m o v a l o f t h e c o l o u r rws t w s tws 100 rws raw water sample absorbance tws treated water sample absorbance ph the samples were tested using a ph meter and electrodes were calibrated using standard ph buffers 4 and 9 2 the electrode after the measurement was washed with the deionized water wiped with the tissue and dipped into the sample for the analysis of the following sample the values of the samples were taken only at the constant reading conductivity the conductivity cells were calibrated using a standard potassium chloride solution of 0 1 n with 14 12 mhos after reading the values the electrode was washed wiped with the tissue and dipped into another sample for analysis the constant values of the samples were noted down for the examination preparation of plant materials for photochemical screening the disease free materials of the plants required for the analysis are weighed to 30 g cleaned with deionized water and desiccated at room temperature the plant materials obtained are grounded with mortar and pestle the powder obtained is soaked in the solvent required for the analysis like hexane chloroform and methane the soaked material is filtered after 96 h and the extract is dried at 40 0c the dried crude extracts are further used for the analysis using proper solvents this screening helps identify the secondary metabolites responsible for the enhancement of coagulation activity the current study used standard protocols for analyzing the constituents present in the coagulants alkaloids a few drops of mayer s reagent were added to the 1 ml of the plant extracts in the test tube a white coloured creamy precipitate was formed indicating the alkaloids presence phenols one ml of the copper sulphate 2 and two drops of hydrochloric acid were added to the one ml of the plant extract they formed the red violet precipitate indicating the phenols presence this test is also called as wieffereing test flavonoids sodium hydroxide one ml was added to the extract of one ml the yellow colour precipitate formed and a few drops of hydrochloride acid decreased the intensity indicating the colour s intensity and the presence of the flavonoids terpenoids two ml of chloroform and hydrogen sulphide acid were added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in brownish red colour indicating the presence of terpenoids saponins this test is also called a foam froth test two ml of deionized liquid are added to the one ml of the extract and shaken for 15 min the formation of stable foam up to two centimetres for ten minutes indicates the presence of saponins tannins this test is also called as ferric chloride test two ml of fecl2 is added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in green colour indicating the tannin s presence glycosides three ml of ammonia and chloroform were added to the one ml of the plant extract forming a pink colour and indicating the glycosides presence quinones one ml of hydrochloric acid is added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in the formation of the red colour precipitate indicating the presence of quinones coumarins the sodium hydroxide one ml was added to the plant extract one ml resulting in the formation of red colour intense precipitate indicating the presence of coumarins steroids two ml of chloroform and hydrochloric acid were added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in the yellow colour precipitate indicating the presence of steroids characterization the samples morphology was analyzed using the ftir and powdered xrd using the philips cm 200 and xpertpro powder xrd machines further the microscope examination of the samples to observe the pollutant adsorption was studied using jsm 7600 fei quanta results phytochemical screening the plant based materials were screened using the polar and nonpolar solvents and tested for the alkaloids steroids coumarin flavonoid phenol glycoside quinone tannins terpenoid and saponins as these substances have a direct relationship with coagulants coagulating properties the detailed presentation of the photochemical compounds is represented in tables 1a and 1b physicochemical parameters to understand the efficiencies of the plant based materials compared to the conventional coagulants in removing the collides the synthetic turbid water of 70 ntu and 150 ntu was prepared using kaolin clay colour figs 1 and 2 depicts the colour removal by various plant based materials using different dosages at 70 and 150 ntu in the 70 ntu solution the colour removal efficiencies are found to be high with the conventional inorganic coagulant alum i e 87 5 with 0 05 mg l and the most negligible colour exclusion was achieved at 16 2 enhanced the colour of the solution reported by the citrus x sinensis peel powder with a dosage of 0 1 mg l fig 1 in contrast in the 150 ntu synthetic solution the alum achieved the highest colour removal 88 8 with 0 15 the citrus x sinensis peel powder was observed with the least colour removal with 0 2 mg l i e 15 5 fig 2 all the remaining plant based coagulants more or less showed equal colour removal ph figs 3 and 4 show the ph reduction trends of the plant based materials compared to the conventional coagulants the ferric chloride coagulant with 0 2 mg l altered the basicity of the solution 7 6 to the strong acid ph i e 2 4 in the 70 ntu and all the plant based coagulants changed the ph trends toward basicity fig 3 in the 150 ntu solution the ferric chloride and alum change the ph trends towards acidic solid nature i e 2 6 and 4 with a dose of 0 2 mg l fig 4 turbidity figs 5 and 6 depict the removal efficiencies of plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu the highest removal efficiencies i e 100 were achieved by the ferric chloride zea mays cicer arietinum manihot esculenta macrotyloma uniflorum and carica papaya with 70 ntu solution with a low dosage of 0 05 mg l and further it was observed that all the coagulants showed removal efficiencies greater than ninety per cent except citrullus lanatus and citrus x sinensis which are 14 1 and 49 1 with a dosage of 0 15 and 0 2 mg l fig 5 even in 150 ntu turbid solutions the removal efficiencies are 100 by the manihot esculenta panicum miliaceum macrotyloma uniflorum carica papaya and ferric chloride with a 0 05 mg l further remaining achieved an efficiency above 90 with the lowest concentrations fig 6 electrical conductivity ec figs 7 and 8 show the electrical conductivity removal by the plant based materials by coagulation treatment with 70 and 150 ntu the ec removal was highest with an alum of 80 followed by moringa of 74 and pisum sativum of 64 with 70 ntu turbidity solution the least was observed with oryza sativa of 16 with 0 05 mg l in contrast in 150 ntu the highest removal efficiencies were observed with the alum 87 5 with 0 15 mg l and the least was observed with solanum tuberosum and ferric chloride i e 25 with 0 2 mg l total dissolved solids tds figs 9 and 10 showed total dissolved solids removal by the 70 and 150 ntu the highest removal efficiencies were 100 with alum vigna unguiculata solanum tuberosum pisum sativum and chitin with 0 05 mg l fig 9 the lowest removal efficiencies were observed with ferric chloride i e 75 2 with 0 2 mg l in contrast the removal efficiencies in 150 ntu turbid solutions are 100 with a dosage of 0 05 mg l with alum vigna unguiculata and chitin the remaining coagulants showed effectiveness similar to the alum the least removal efficiencies are observed with ferric chloride with 0 2 mg l i e 82 2 fig 10 sludge dewaterability figs 11 and 12 depict the sludge dewaterability of the plant based materials after the coagulation experiment using 70 and 150 ntu solutions the sludge dewaterability with the 70 ntu turbidity solutions is highest in cicer arietinum i e 4 g l with 0 2 mg l the least was observed with the least carica papaya i e 0 9 mg l with the exact dosage fig 11 in contrast with 150 ntu solutions the highest sludge dewaterability was marked with trigonella foenum graecum i e 5 32 g l with 0 2 mg l the lowest sludge dewaterability was observed with tamarindus indica i e 1 33 mg l with 0 2 mg l fig 12 discussion turbidity removal by plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu the results indicated that all the materials used are performed with advanced efficiencies except citrullus lanatus citrus x sinensis and arachis hypogea shells powder in both 70 and 100 ntu the lower efficiency of these coagulants in removing the turbidity might be due to the salting out effect in which the protein solubility decreases at lower dosages antov et al 2010 for these coagulants the amount of the coagulant dosage added is directly proportioned to the cec capacities which helps destabilize the collides in the solution however the increase in the coagulant dosage enhances the sludge a problem for the water industries as the sludge disposal adds more cost kavitha et al 2021 the presence of the pectin in citrus x sinensis does not allow the colloidal particles to be removed from the turbid solutions similar studies to remove the turbidity from the palm oil mill effluent reported similar results and further stated that the pectin in the coagulants reduced the binding sites for the adsorption of the collides and reduced the coagulation activities kamaruddin et al 2018 fatehah et al 2013 arachis hypogea shell powder does not show greater efficiencies in removing the collies from the turbid solution which might be attributed to the lesser protein content in the shells dwatrapureddi et al 2021 the remaining plant based coagulants performed well in removing the turbidity and achieved high removal efficiency ranging from 88 to 100 as these coagulants consist of coagulating compounds karnena and saritha 2022 sludge dewaterability of plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu sludge dewatering is the most significant problem associated with sludge management jin et al 2004 it is conventionally influenced by flocs chemical and physical configuration like volume strength and size fakhru l razi and molla 2007 a positive correlation was observed between the coagulants sludge dewaterability and turbidity removal it was understood that the settling sludge increased with the increase in removing the turbidity of the colloidal suspension the sludge dewaterability of the colloidal suspension with the 150 ntu is better than 70 ntu similar reports obtained by karnena et al 2022b affirmed that the formation of the harder flocs is due to enhanced coagulation with good settleability faust and aly 1983 the neutrally charged coagulants form denser and larger flocs than the positively charged coagulants saleem and bachmann 2019 sludge dewaterability with inorganic chemical coagulants is high compared to natural ones to support these statements in their review saleem and bachmann 2019 stated that conventional inorganic coagulants perform better coagulation than natural coagulants and produce more sludge the flocs produced by the natural coagulants quickly get settled with the help of the gravitational pull owing to their cationic nature and molar masses which helps with charge neutralization saritha et al 2017 kavitha et al 2021 stated that sludge obtained after coagulation should be considered a parameter for selecting the coagulation for the screening as sludge disposal is complex for the water industries the alum ferric chloride zea mays cicer artinum and tamarindus indica seed powder coagulants made more sludge after the treatment the production of larger sludge volumes increases the removal and tertiary treatment costs thus the coagulant for the water treatment after screening should be selected based on the turbidity removal efficiencies and sludge produced physico chemical parameters removal efficiencies by the plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu ph the ph is critical for the comportment and removal efficiencies of the coagulation alterations in the ph of the water impact the nature of the organic colloidal particles present in the water the ph is essential for the precipitation and formation of the flocs further the change in the ph might be problematic as it might result in the formation of hydroxy compounds by dissociating the protons causing a reduction of ph moving towards acidic nature and vice versa dayarathne et al 2021 the turbidity removal efficiencies of the plant based materials moringa oleiferia manihot esculenta pisum sativum panicum miliaceum sinapis alba macrotyloma uniflorum zea mays and animal based coagulant chitin showed better performance in the aspects of the turbidity removal and sludge dewaterability these coagulants did not alter the ph of the colloidal solutions and favoured the charge neutralization phenomenon the charge neutralization mechanisms are the primary mechanism for forming the flocs during coagulation karnena and saritha 2022 the decrease in the ph of the solutions by the other coagulants owing to the higher molar masses of the coagulants favours the bridging mechanisms electrical conductivity ec the inorganic conventional chemical coagulants showed higher performance in removing the electrical conductivity from the water with a turbidity of 150 ntu and least performed in 70 ntu which might be attributed to the lower association of the ions with the coagulants in contrast plant based coagulants enhanced the ec in the colloidal solution due to the dissociation of the ions produced by coagulants similar studies were reported by marobhe et al 2007 in his studies they compared the conventional inorganic alum coagulant with opuntia and moringa the electrical conductivity of the colloidal suspension and removal efficiencies purely depends on the association and dissociation of the coagulant used for the coagulation saritha et al 2019 total dissolved solids tds all the coagulants showed more or less similar removal efficiencies in removing the total dissolved solids from the 70 and 150 ntu the current study showed the highest removal of the tds with the adopted dosages by not considering the turbidity reductions in the filtrate and supernatant solutions owing to the empirical relationships between the suspended solids and the turbidity as they can be analyzed only when there is no infer of other parameters with the tds it is owing to the properties of the colloidal particles causing turbidities like structure dimensions and surface morphology which can t be related to the suspended solid concentrations further saritha et al 2019 studies revealed that smaller colloidal atoms influence the solutions turbidity compared to the larger particles colour alum and pisum sativium showed similar removal of the colour from the colloidal solution of 70 ntu which might be attributed to the interaction of ph with the coagulant in the colloidal solution hoong and ismail 2018 the colour removal is enhanced with the increase in ph during the coagulation if the condition of the solution is acidic then the density of the hydrogen ions increases around the coagulants and leads to an increase in colour removal hoong and ismail 2018 cao et al 2010 the charge neutralization mechanism of the coagulant proteins dissociates the organic compounds causing colour when the colloidal solution is acidic saritha et al 2019 conducted similar studies for treating the surface water treatment using alum compared with sago and chitin and achieved colour removal by reducing the ph of the surface water to 6 further cao et al 2010 stated that at the isoelectric point the colloidal particles are neutral and bridging and charge neutralization favour removing the colour from the source thus the colour removal reached maximum only at ph 2 3 which is impossible to apply and adapt in real time phytochemical screening of the plant based materials the phytochemical screening of the plant based materials reveals whether the plant consists of anticoagulant or coagulating properties parvathiraj et al 2015 alkaloids tannins and flavonoids indicate coagulating proteins in plant materials bagheri et al 2020 based on the cumulative characteristics of the coagulants saad et al 2014 the moringa oleiferia manihot esculenta pisum sativum panicum miliaceum sinapis alba macrotyloma uniflorum and zea mays are selected as the best performed coagulants in eliminating the colloids and organic constituents from the colloidal suspension zilani et al 2017 al qudah et al 2011 further the phytochemical screening confirms the presence of alkaloids tannins and the absence of flavonoids in the above started compounds in all the efficient plant coagulants kanife et al 2012 ahmed 2018 even though the above said coagulants are efficient in removing the colloids from the water owing to their availability in the geographical locations a cost benefit analysis of the plant based coagulants moringa olieferia manihot esculents and pisum sativum is selected as the best coagulant for treating water in the andhra province where the research was conducted and implemented further these coagulants are subjected to the ftir analysis to identify the functionalized groups responsible for the coagulation xrd patterns and sem images of the post coagulation of the sludge were shown which acted as vibrant proof for the current study ft ir analysis ft ir is used to identify the functionalized groups in the ir region the coagulants are strained by using the sieve and mixed with the kbr for palletization the pellets are further used for the analysis of the ftir the adsorption peaks of the moringa oleifera were found at 1374 cm 1c o stretch indicating the presence of amino acids 1658 cm 1c h stretching showing the presence of the hydroxyl groups 1703 cm 1 showing the co stretch indicating the presence of the carboxylic groups and 2921 cm 1 showing ch stretching indicating alkene groups fig 13 in manihot esculenta stretching is observed at 1242 cm 1c o indicating amines 1645 cm 1 indicating amine with nh and 3389 cm 1 shoed secondary amine at 3389 cm 1 fig 14 in pisum sativum showed stretching oh at 1339 cm 1 indicating alcohols 1645 cm 1 nh showing amine 1740 cm 1 stretching co signifying the aldehyde groups and 3726 cm 1 o h stretching leading the alcohol groups fig 15 the impurities in the turbid waters are adsorbed onto the coagulant surface by the charge s interaction with the hydrogen bonding of the alkali amine and carboxylic groups saritha et al 2019 the adsorbed polymers are altered or stabilized after the interactions which might be attributed to the colloidal and polymers affinities towards the adsorption of the water to polymers karnena et al 2022a xrd patterns xrd patterns help identify the properties like amorphous or crystallinity of the compounds the formulation of compounds was assessed using the instrument equipped with the cuka radiation as a source with a voltage of 40 kv all the samples are placed on the holders and measured for the diffraction patterns with a range of 5 100 2θ the moringa oleifera showed high diffraction peaks at 21 62 with high scattering the increased diffusion at the 2θ is due to the presence of the proteins and further it is evident that the poorly resolved peaks showed a predominance amorphous nature fig 16 the manihot esculents showed sharp peaks at 15 19 17 04 17 98 and 22 98 fig 17 and in pisum sativum fig 18 intense peaks were found at 23 11 18 25 and 15 42 indicating the less crystalline nature of the compounds from the results it is understood that all the samples tested are highly amorphic which led to increased interactions between the coagulants and pollutants resulting in more significant adsorption and showing high efficiencies in the coagulation similar studies were conducted by karnena et al 2022b using moringa oleifera for aquaculture wastewater treatment and showed similar 2θ values naduparambath and purushothaman 2016 studied sago using the xrd and reported similar results and further stated that the amorphous nature of the compounds leads to the collides adsorption sem images sem analysis of the moringa oleifera manihot esculents and pisum sativum pre and post coagulation analysis were shown in figs 19 21 from the images it is evident that dense and firm microscopic structures are formed with various porous matrices after coagulation revealing that the colloids are adsorbed onto the surface of the coagulants due to proteins in these materials which are already confirmed by the ftir and xrd patterns in the previous sections thus from the results of the sem analysis it is understood that all the coagulants analyzed have enough morphological profiles for removing the colloidal particles by adsorption onto the coagulants similar studies were conducted by karnena et al 2022b for aquaculture wastewater and showed identical patterns of colloidal adsorption with the impurities conclusions the present work mainly focuses on challenges rural and remote populations face regarding

plant based material as a coagulant for water purification is an unprecedented approach according to the available literature the presence of tannins alkaloids and absence of flavonoids in the plant materials shows coagulating properties and enhances the performance of the coagulation these plant materials removed all the pollutant parameters in 70 and 150 ntu turbid water with more or less efficacy of 95 ftir spectrum of the coagulants revealed the existence of functional groups like carboxyl amine and hydroxyl groups responsible for the coagulation xrd patterns showed that all the

20067,globalization and industrialization lead to the corresponding increase of effluents discharged into the nearest water bodies the persistence of pollution in the ecological system has led to uncertainty about living habitats drinking water safety has become a societal issue attached to great importance as we increasingly become aware of environmental problems and their impacts on human life we realize that current problem solving using contemporary water treatment techniques cannot provide adequate solutions owing to their advantages and disadvantages nature based solutions are required as they are the best alternative for treating polluted water conventional coagulation is not a new technique that has been utilized in ancient times and works as a sustainable solution for water treatment and reduces the costs associated with the other treatment methods even though these techniques have been practised since ancient times there is still a need to explore more plants to identify coagulating properties the current study aims to do the phytochemical and physicochemical screening of the plant based materials to identify them as coagulants and compare their efficiencies with the conventional inorganic and animal based coagulants out of 18 plant based materials moringa oleifera manihot esculenta and pisum sativum removed turbidity up to 100 are subjected to the ftir xrd and sem to analyze the functionalized groups responsible for the polymer formation and identify the interaction between the coagulator s and suspended particles the results showed that plant based materials could be promising solutions for water quality challenges keywords natural coagulants phytochemical physicochemical screening turbidity and sustainability introduction in recent years globalization and industrialization enhanced water extraction from natural resources ugwu et al 2017 saritha et al 2021 this resulted in the more significant discharge of wastewater in larger volumes to the ecological system without proper treatment further this industrial effluent released to the nearest water bodies consists of recalcitrant chemicals solids sludge and turbidity okolo et al 2021 abiyu et al 2018 stated that the unavailability of potable water has been becoming a primary concern for water related diseases and further acting as a source water engineers have become more concerned about reducing the costs associated with advanced treatment technologies and emphasizing solutions for potable water in the current scenario many countries have adopted advanced treatment options like reverse osmosis catalysis membrane filtration water oxidation etc to treat water contaminated with pollutants but each treatment units have its disadvantages and advantages polluted surface water consists of different types of dispersed solid substances called collides this surface consists of a negative charge causing repulsions the repulsions of the particles lead to remain these particles in the suspension siangko et al 2021 the colloidal particles with the charges cannot be separated using traditional and advanced treatment methods the particles clog the membrane s pores leading to the membrane s fouling causing serious concerns to the water industries as the replacement of the membrane is associated with high costs tran et al 2022 karnena and saritha 2022 further from the literature it was understood that releasing wastewater with high turbidity to the nearest water bodies and the ecological system will undoubtedly affect the aquatic environment disturb biological activities interferes with the penetration of light alharbi et al 2018 and alter the water quality of the streams antov et al 2018 saritha et al 2017 the turbidity in the water owing to the colloidal particles provides adsorption sites to the chemicals causing large orders and taste antov et al 2018 turbidity is considered one of the most significant problems causing haziness to the water caused by the organic inorganic and biological pollutants in water treatment units antov et al 2018 thus the new cost effective technologies need to meet the standards set by the local authorities before discharging okolo et al 2021 karnena et al 2022a coagulation has proven to be a cost effective and greener technology for surface water treatment compared to the other available treatment options hoong and ismail 2018 the coagulation and flocculation process used in the pre or post treatment units depends on the affluent and plant design this process can be operated in three steps firstly the coagulation in which the colloidal suspension consisting of colloids is destabilized and flocculation the destabilized particles are agglomerated and later in the sedimentation separated using the settling gravity narmatha et al 2017 the coagulation occurs within seconds but the formation of the flocs might take minutes to hours and result in the particles destabilization and settling for the following treatment coagulation techniques were used in many treatment industries like pharmaceutical paper and pulp food cosmetics etc conventionally inorganic coagulants like ferric chloride aluminium sulphate calcium hydroxide lime poly aluminium etc have been utilized by water industries to treat the water even though these coagulants remove many pollutants from the source they still have shortcomings inorganic coagulants are costly cause environmental toxicity and produce large amounts wang et al 2015 karnena and saritha 2021 further a few researchers tomljenovic 2011 bongiovani et al 2016 stated that using alum and poly aluminium chloride for treating water via coagulation might lead to alzheimer s the treated water consists of chemical ionic residues that cause damage to health in addition these inorganic chemical coagulants showed a more remarkable performance for destabilizing suspended particles however there is still a need for the research for alternative research which is eco friendly and acts as a substitute seghosime et al 2017 the broad spectrum of biodiversity enabled the researchers to find alternatives for water treatment and greener technologies are among them to solve this problem many researchers have taken drinking water treatment options globally and presented promising results patchaiyappan devipriya 2022 developing nations widely use natural coagulants as water treatment technologies due to their lower costs and raw material availability than conventional inorganic coagulants leone et al 2015 many researchers have recently used and studied plant based coagulants to treat water however the widely used and known coagulants are tannins acorn ocimum etc tawakkoly et al 2019 oladoja et al 2017 karnena and saritha 2020 there is still a gap in the literature for an in depth understanding of plant based coagulants and constituents responsible for coagulation thus we have attempted to understand and identify the plant based materials in treating the water primarily by considering the phytochemical parameters relating to the presence of the functionalized groups in turbidity removal to date no studies have been made and attempted to link the phytochemical parameters of the plants to turbidity removal the objective of the present research is to conduct a phytochemical screening of plant based materials 18 and compare it with conventional inorganic coagulants 2 and animal based coagulants 1 to remove turbidity materials and methods coagulants preparations plant based resources were procured from the resident markets the essential parts of the coagulants were sun dried and made into powder using a domestic blender the powder obtained by blending was sieved using a 0 25µ sieve the inorganic chemicals aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were purchased from the analytical grade s merck chemical and used without any purification the chitin of laboratory grade was procured from the himedia chemical and used for the current experiment synthetic turbid water 10 g of bentonite procured from sigma aldrich was dissolved in 1 litre deionized water to prepare the stock solution the stock solution was agitated for 24 h at 20 rpm using the jar test device to identify even dispersion the prepared suspension solution was 100 ntu indicating 10 ml of the stock solution is equivalent to 1 ntu in 1000 ml dilution the 70 ntu and 150 ntu turbidity solutions were prepared by dissolving 70 ml and 150 ml of the stock solution into the 1000 ml volumetric flasks and making them up with deionized water jar test apparatus experiment the coagulants efficiencies were evaluated using a conventional flocculator and the experiments were carried out in sets the flocculator used for the investigation is centex brand and the experiments were conducted in triplicates and presented as average the coagulant powders were weighed using the weighing balance with an accuracy of 10 6 the concentrations designed for the experiment are added to the 2000 ml beakers consisting of 1 litre synthetic turbid waters these solutions are agitated for 120 s at 100 rpm and 20 min at 20 rpm they can settle under laboratory conditions by a gravitational pull for half an hour analytical procedures the supernatant solution of the coagulated samples after the coagulation was used to measure the turbidity and the following parameters turbidity the pre and post analysis coagulation samples were determined using the turbidity meter the instrument calibration was done using the standard 40 ntu solutions after which the samples were tested colour a wavelength of 456 nm was selected to measure the colour the spectrophotometer should be warmup accordingly the pt co absorbance has a maximum absorbance in this wavelength one spectrophotometer cell was filled with water to set the instrument to zero rinse the other cell of the device later read the colour of the samples and plot the curve against the standard curve r e m o v a l o f t h e c o l o u r rws t w s tws 100 rws raw water sample absorbance tws treated water sample absorbance ph the samples were tested using a ph meter and electrodes were calibrated using standard ph buffers 4 and 9 2 the electrode after the measurement was washed with the deionized water wiped with the tissue and dipped into the sample for the analysis of the following sample the values of the samples were taken only at the constant reading conductivity the conductivity cells were calibrated using a standard potassium chloride solution of 0 1 n with 14 12 mhos after reading the values the electrode was washed wiped with the tissue and dipped into another sample for analysis the constant values of the samples were noted down for the examination preparation of plant materials for photochemical screening the disease free materials of the plants required for the analysis are weighed to 30 g cleaned with deionized water and desiccated at room temperature the plant materials obtained are grounded with mortar and pestle the powder obtained is soaked in the solvent required for the analysis like hexane chloroform and methane the soaked material is filtered after 96 h and the extract is dried at 40 0c the dried crude extracts are further used for the analysis using proper solvents this screening helps identify the secondary metabolites responsible for the enhancement of coagulation activity the current study used standard protocols for analyzing the constituents present in the coagulants alkaloids a few drops of mayer s reagent were added to the 1 ml of the plant extracts in the test tube a white coloured creamy precipitate was formed indicating the alkaloids presence phenols one ml of the copper sulphate 2 and two drops of hydrochloric acid were added to the one ml of the plant extract they formed the red violet precipitate indicating the phenols presence this test is also called as wieffereing test flavonoids sodium hydroxide one ml was added to the extract of one ml the yellow colour precipitate formed and a few drops of hydrochloride acid decreased the intensity indicating the colour s intensity and the presence of the flavonoids terpenoids two ml of chloroform and hydrogen sulphide acid were added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in brownish red colour indicating the presence of terpenoids saponins this test is also called a foam froth test two ml of deionized liquid are added to the one ml of the extract and shaken for 15 min the formation of stable foam up to two centimetres for ten minutes indicates the presence of saponins tannins this test is also called as ferric chloride test two ml of fecl2 is added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in green colour indicating the tannin s presence glycosides three ml of ammonia and chloroform were added to the one ml of the plant extract forming a pink colour and indicating the glycosides presence quinones one ml of hydrochloric acid is added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in the formation of the red colour precipitate indicating the presence of quinones coumarins the sodium hydroxide one ml was added to the plant extract one ml resulting in the formation of red colour intense precipitate indicating the presence of coumarins steroids two ml of chloroform and hydrochloric acid were added to the one ml of the plant extract resulting in the yellow colour precipitate indicating the presence of steroids characterization the samples morphology was analyzed using the ftir and powdered xrd using the philips cm 200 and xpertpro powder xrd machines further the microscope examination of the samples to observe the pollutant adsorption was studied using jsm 7600 fei quanta results phytochemical screening the plant based materials were screened using the polar and nonpolar solvents and tested for the alkaloids steroids coumarin flavonoid phenol glycoside quinone tannins terpenoid and saponins as these substances have a direct relationship with coagulants coagulating properties the detailed presentation of the photochemical compounds is represented in tables 1a and 1b physicochemical parameters to understand the efficiencies of the plant based materials compared to the conventional coagulants in removing the collides the synthetic turbid water of 70 ntu and 150 ntu was prepared using kaolin clay colour figs 1 and 2 depicts the colour removal by various plant based materials using different dosages at 70 and 150 ntu in the 70 ntu solution the colour removal efficiencies are found to be high with the conventional inorganic coagulant alum i e 87 5 with 0 05 mg l and the most negligible colour exclusion was achieved at 16 2 enhanced the colour of the solution reported by the citrus x sinensis peel powder with a dosage of 0 1 mg l fig 1 in contrast in the 150 ntu synthetic solution the alum achieved the highest colour removal 88 8 with 0 15 the citrus x sinensis peel powder was observed with the least colour removal with 0 2 mg l i e 15 5 fig 2 all the remaining plant based coagulants more or less showed equal colour removal ph figs 3 and 4 show the ph reduction trends of the plant based materials compared to the conventional coagulants the ferric chloride coagulant with 0 2 mg l altered the basicity of the solution 7 6 to the strong acid ph i e 2 4 in the 70 ntu and all the plant based coagulants changed the ph trends toward basicity fig 3 in the 150 ntu solution the ferric chloride and alum change the ph trends towards acidic solid nature i e 2 6 and 4 with a dose of 0 2 mg l fig 4 turbidity figs 5 and 6 depict the removal efficiencies of plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu the highest removal efficiencies i e 100 were achieved by the ferric chloride zea mays cicer arietinum manihot esculenta macrotyloma uniflorum and carica papaya with 70 ntu solution with a low dosage of 0 05 mg l and further it was observed that all the coagulants showed removal efficiencies greater than ninety per cent except citrullus lanatus and citrus x sinensis which are 14 1 and 49 1 with a dosage of 0 15 and 0 2 mg l fig 5 even in 150 ntu turbid solutions the removal efficiencies are 100 by the manihot esculenta panicum miliaceum macrotyloma uniflorum carica papaya and ferric chloride with a 0 05 mg l further remaining achieved an efficiency above 90 with the lowest concentrations fig 6 electrical conductivity ec figs 7 and 8 show the electrical conductivity removal by the plant based materials by coagulation treatment with 70 and 150 ntu the ec removal was highest with an alum of 80 followed by moringa of 74 and pisum sativum of 64 with 70 ntu turbidity solution the least was observed with oryza sativa of 16 with 0 05 mg l in contrast in 150 ntu the highest removal efficiencies were observed with the alum 87 5 with 0 15 mg l and the least was observed with solanum tuberosum and ferric chloride i e 25 with 0 2 mg l total dissolved solids tds figs 9 and 10 showed total dissolved solids removal by the 70 and 150 ntu the highest removal efficiencies were 100 with alum vigna unguiculata solanum tuberosum pisum sativum and chitin with 0 05 mg l fig 9 the lowest removal efficiencies were observed with ferric chloride i e 75 2 with 0 2 mg l in contrast the removal efficiencies in 150 ntu turbid solutions are 100 with a dosage of 0 05 mg l with alum vigna unguiculata and chitin the remaining coagulants showed effectiveness similar to the alum the least removal efficiencies are observed with ferric chloride with 0 2 mg l i e 82 2 fig 10 sludge dewaterability figs 11 and 12 depict the sludge dewaterability of the plant based materials after the coagulation experiment using 70 and 150 ntu solutions the sludge dewaterability with the 70 ntu turbidity solutions is highest in cicer arietinum i e 4 g l with 0 2 mg l the least was observed with the least carica papaya i e 0 9 mg l with the exact dosage fig 11 in contrast with 150 ntu solutions the highest sludge dewaterability was marked with trigonella foenum graecum i e 5 32 g l with 0 2 mg l the lowest sludge dewaterability was observed with tamarindus indica i e 1 33 mg l with 0 2 mg l fig 12 discussion turbidity removal by plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu the results indicated that all the materials used are performed with advanced efficiencies except citrullus lanatus citrus x sinensis and arachis hypogea shells powder in both 70 and 100 ntu the lower efficiency of these coagulants in removing the turbidity might be due to the salting out effect in which the protein solubility decreases at lower dosages antov et al 2010 for these coagulants the amount of the coagulant dosage added is directly proportioned to the cec capacities which helps destabilize the collides in the solution however the increase in the coagulant dosage enhances the sludge a problem for the water industries as the sludge disposal adds more cost kavitha et al 2021 the presence of the pectin in citrus x sinensis does not allow the colloidal particles to be removed from the turbid solutions similar studies to remove the turbidity from the palm oil mill effluent reported similar results and further stated that the pectin in the coagulants reduced the binding sites for the adsorption of the collides and reduced the coagulation activities kamaruddin et al 2018 fatehah et al 2013 arachis hypogea shell powder does not show greater efficiencies in removing the collies from the turbid solution which might be attributed to the lesser protein content in the shells dwatrapureddi et al 2021 the remaining plant based coagulants performed well in removing the turbidity and achieved high removal efficiency ranging from 88 to 100 as these coagulants consist of coagulating compounds karnena and saritha 2022 sludge dewaterability of plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu sludge dewatering is the most significant problem associated with sludge management jin et al 2004 it is conventionally influenced by flocs chemical and physical configuration like volume strength and size fakhru l razi and molla 2007 a positive correlation was observed between the coagulants sludge dewaterability and turbidity removal it was understood that the settling sludge increased with the increase in removing the turbidity of the colloidal suspension the sludge dewaterability of the colloidal suspension with the 150 ntu is better than 70 ntu similar reports obtained by karnena et al 2022b affirmed that the formation of the harder flocs is due to enhanced coagulation with good settleability faust and aly 1983 the neutrally charged coagulants form denser and larger flocs than the positively charged coagulants saleem and bachmann 2019 sludge dewaterability with inorganic chemical coagulants is high compared to natural ones to support these statements in their review saleem and bachmann 2019 stated that conventional inorganic coagulants perform better coagulation than natural coagulants and produce more sludge the flocs produced by the natural coagulants quickly get settled with the help of the gravitational pull owing to their cationic nature and molar masses which helps with charge neutralization saritha et al 2017 kavitha et al 2021 stated that sludge obtained after coagulation should be considered a parameter for selecting the coagulation for the screening as sludge disposal is complex for the water industries the alum ferric chloride zea mays cicer artinum and tamarindus indica seed powder coagulants made more sludge after the treatment the production of larger sludge volumes increases the removal and tertiary treatment costs thus the coagulant for the water treatment after screening should be selected based on the turbidity removal efficiencies and sludge produced physico chemical parameters removal efficiencies by the plant based materials with 70 and 150 ntu ph the ph is critical for the comportment and removal efficiencies of the coagulation alterations in the ph of the water impact the nature of the organic colloidal particles present in the water the ph is essential for the precipitation and formation of the flocs further the change in the ph might be problematic as it might result in the formation of hydroxy compounds by dissociating the protons causing a reduction of ph moving towards acidic nature and vice versa dayarathne et al 2021 the turbidity removal efficiencies of the plant based materials moringa oleiferia manihot esculenta pisum sativum panicum miliaceum sinapis alba macrotyloma uniflorum zea mays and animal based coagulant chitin showed better performance in the aspects of the turbidity removal and sludge dewaterability these coagulants did not alter the ph of the colloidal solutions and favoured the charge neutralization phenomenon the charge neutralization mechanisms are the primary mechanism for forming the flocs during coagulation karnena and saritha 2022 the decrease in the ph of the solutions by the other coagulants owing to the higher molar masses of the coagulants favours the bridging mechanisms electrical conductivity ec the inorganic conventional chemical coagulants showed higher performance in removing the electrical conductivity from the water with a turbidity of 150 ntu and least performed in 70 ntu which might be attributed to the lower association of the ions with the coagulants in contrast plant based coagulants enhanced the ec in the colloidal solution due to the dissociation of the ions produced by coagulants similar studies were reported by marobhe et al 2007 in his studies they compared the conventional inorganic alum coagulant with opuntia and moringa the electrical conductivity of the colloidal suspension and removal efficiencies purely depends on the association and dissociation of the coagulant used for the coagulation saritha et al 2019 total dissolved solids tds all the coagulants showed more or less similar removal efficiencies in removing the total dissolved solids from the 70 and 150 ntu the current study showed the highest removal of the tds with the adopted dosages by not considering the turbidity reductions in the filtrate and supernatant solutions owing to the empirical relationships between the suspended solids and the turbidity as they can be analyzed only when there is no infer of other parameters with the tds it is owing to the properties of the colloidal particles causing turbidities like structure dimensions and surface morphology which can t be related to the suspended solid concentrations further saritha et al 2019 studies revealed that smaller colloidal atoms influence the solutions turbidity compared to the larger particles colour alum and pisum sativium showed similar removal of the colour from the colloidal solution of 70 ntu which might be attributed to the interaction of ph with the coagulant in the colloidal solution hoong and ismail 2018 the colour removal is enhanced with the increase in ph during the coagulation if the condition of the solution is acidic then the density of the hydrogen ions increases around the coagulants and leads to an increase in colour removal hoong and ismail 2018 cao et al 2010 the charge neutralization mechanism of the coagulant proteins dissociates the organic compounds causing colour when the colloidal solution is acidic saritha et al 2019 conducted similar studies for treating the surface water treatment using alum compared with sago and chitin and achieved colour removal by reducing the ph of the surface water to 6 further cao et al 2010 stated that at the isoelectric point the colloidal particles are neutral and bridging and charge neutralization favour removing the colour from the source thus the colour removal reached maximum only at ph 2 3 which is impossible to apply and adapt in real time phytochemical screening of the plant based materials the phytochemical screening of the plant based materials reveals whether the plant consists of anticoagulant or coagulating properties parvathiraj et al 2015 alkaloids tannins and flavonoids indicate coagulating proteins in plant materials bagheri et al 2020 based on the cumulative characteristics of the coagulants saad et al 2014 the moringa oleiferia manihot esculenta pisum sativum panicum miliaceum sinapis alba macrotyloma uniflorum and zea mays are selected as the best performed coagulants in eliminating the colloids and organic constituents from the colloidal suspension zilani et al 2017 al qudah et al 2011 further the phytochemical screening confirms the presence of alkaloids tannins and the absence of flavonoids in the above started compounds in all the efficient plant coagulants kanife et al 2012 ahmed 2018 even though the above said coagulants are efficient in removing the colloids from the water owing to their availability in the geographical locations a cost benefit analysis of the plant based coagulants moringa olieferia manihot esculents and pisum sativum is selected as the best coagulant for treating water in the andhra province where the research was conducted and implemented further these coagulants are subjected to the ftir analysis to identify the functionalized groups responsible for the coagulation xrd patterns and sem images of the post coagulation of the sludge were shown which acted as vibrant proof for the current study ft ir analysis ft ir is used to identify the functionalized groups in the ir region the coagulants are strained by using the sieve and mixed with the kbr for palletization the pellets are further used for the analysis of the ftir the adsorption peaks of the moringa oleifera were found at 1374 cm 1c o stretch indicating the presence of amino acids 1658 cm 1c h stretching showing the presence of the hydroxyl groups 1703 cm 1 showing the co stretch indicating the presence of the carboxylic groups and 2921 cm 1 showing ch stretching indicating alkene groups fig 13 in manihot esculenta stretching is observed at 1242 cm 1c o indicating amines 1645 cm 1 indicating amine with nh and 3389 cm 1 shoed secondary amine at 3389 cm 1 fig 14 in pisum sativum showed stretching oh at 1339 cm 1 indicating alcohols 1645 cm 1 nh showing amine 1740 cm 1 stretching co signifying the aldehyde groups and 3726 cm 1 o h stretching leading the alcohol groups fig 15 the impurities in the turbid waters are adsorbed onto the coagulant surface by the charge s interaction with the hydrogen bonding of the alkali amine and carboxylic groups saritha et al 2019 the adsorbed polymers are altered or stabilized after the interactions which might be attributed to the colloidal and polymers affinities towards the adsorption of the water to polymers karnena et al 2022a xrd patterns xrd patterns help identify the properties like amorphous or crystallinity of the compounds the formulation of compounds was assessed using the instrument equipped with the cuka radiation as a source with a voltage of 40 kv all the samples are placed on the holders and measured for the diffraction patterns with a range of 5 100 2θ the moringa oleifera showed high diffraction peaks at 21 62 with high scattering the increased diffusion at the 2θ is due to the presence of the proteins and further it is evident that the poorly resolved peaks showed a predominance amorphous nature fig 16 the manihot esculents showed sharp peaks at 15 19 17 04 17 98 and 22 98 fig 17 and in pisum sativum fig 18 intense peaks were found at 23 11 18 25 and 15 42 indicating the less crystalline nature of the compounds from the results it is understood that all the samples tested are highly amorphic which led to increased interactions between the coagulants and pollutants resulting in more significant adsorption and showing high efficiencies in the coagulation similar studies were conducted by karnena et al 2022b using moringa oleifera for aquaculture wastewater treatment and showed similar 2θ values naduparambath and purushothaman 2016 studied sago using the xrd and reported similar results and further stated that the amorphous nature of the compounds leads to the collides adsorption sem images sem analysis of the moringa oleifera manihot esculents and pisum sativum pre and post coagulation analysis were shown in figs 19 21 from the images it is evident that dense and firm microscopic structures are formed with various porous matrices after coagulation revealing that the colloids are adsorbed onto the surface of the coagulants due to proteins in these materials which are already confirmed by the ftir and xrd patterns in the previous sections thus from the results of the sem analysis it is understood that all the coagulants analyzed have enough morphological profiles for removing the colloidal particles by adsorption onto the coagulants similar studies were conducted by karnena et al 2022b for aquaculture wastewater and showed identical patterns of colloidal adsorption with the impurities conclusions the present work mainly focuses on challenges rural and remote populations face regarding accessibility to potable water the technology evaluated is adaptable by these populations for the purification of water further this study contributes to one of the goals of sustainable development the phytochemical and physicochemical screening of 22 materials i e nineteen plant based materials 18 compared with two chemical inorganic 2 and animal based coagulants 1 revealed that moringa oleifera manihot esculenta and pisum sativum are efficient in treating the water the phytochemical screening performed in the current study and relating it with the selection and screening of the plant based material as a coagulant for water purification is an unprecedented approach according to the available literature the presence of tannins alkaloids and absence of flavonoids in the plant materials shows coagulating properties and enhances the performance of the coagulation these plant materials removed all the pollutant parameters in 70 and 150 ntu turbid water with more or less

20068,grasslands are among one of the largest terrestrial biomes in the world suffering severe threat from ongoing degradation grassland degradation not only alter terrestrial biogeochemical processes but also have strong potentials to affect nutrient stoichiometry and limitation in aquatic ecosystems moreover the impacts of grassland degradation are likely to differentially affect the cycling of carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p in the linked terrestrial aquatic ecosystems in watersheds leading to multiple possible scenarios of nutrient stoichiometry and limitation in soil stream and lake ecosystems however we lack of integrated studies to consider biogeochemical consequences of grassland degradation transferring from soil to stream and finally to the lake ecosystems an integrated case study was conducted in the qinghai lake watershed on the qinghai tibet plateau to reveal the influences of grassland degradation on soil stream and lake ecosystems from the perspectives of c n p stoichiometry nutrient limitation and bacterial communities this case study demonstrated a clear cascading influence from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystem that grassland degradation differentially influenced n and p in soil with soil n decreased but p did not change n p decreased in soil influencing the nutrients delivered to streams with streamwater n decreased but p increased n p decreased in stream alleviating p limitation of stream biofilms which are sensitive to p variation and ultimately stimulating phytoplankton growth in the p limited qinghai lake this case study supported one scenario of biogeochemical consequences of grassland degradation and other scenarios might be also possible in watersheds that have different geochemistry background different landcover and or different lake trophic status integrated studies considering the coupled terrestrial aquatic ecosystems can provide insights for protection and management of grassland watersheds in the rapidly

as declines in soil moisture soil nutrients perturbation of microbial communities as well as increases in soil erosion viragh et al 2011 dlamini et al 2014 wang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 due to intimate linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems williamson et al 2008 aquatic ecosystems are strongly influenced by surrounding landscapes and are particularly sensitive to terrestrial changes including impacts on multiple nutrient elements and ecosystem structure and function landcover changes lead to modifications of terrestrial biogeochemistry and as a consequence alter aquatic biogeochemistry figueiredo et al 2010 nielsen et al 2012 ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020a as the primary receiver of nutrients and organic matter inputs from terrestrial ecosystems and the main channel linking upland watersheds with downstream aquatic ecosystems vannote et al 1980 cronan 2012 streams play a critical role in biogeochemical processes and are particularly sensitive to terrestrial change williamson et al 2008 holmes et al 2012 ren et al 2020a ren et al 2020b finally lakes have an intimate relationship with catchment characteristics through material transport in surface water runoff canham et al 2012 sadro et al 2012 ren et al 2019 grassland degradation has long been of considerable research interest in terrestrial ecology bardgett et al 2021 many of the research efforts have focused on quantifying and modeling grassland status as well as its influences on terrestrial ecosystem processes wu and tiessen 2002 dlamini et al 2014 in such studies impacts on aquatic ecosystems are not often considered ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020a thus an integrated understanding of the consequences of grassland degradation on nutrient dynamics and stoichiometry as well as microbial communities in coupled soil stream and lake ecosystems can provide a more complete picture of the effects of grassland degradation on biogeochemical cycles in watersheds providing knowledge for a comprehensive stratagem of grassland management or watershed management influences on terrestrial ecosystems changes in landcover significantly affect the structure function and chemical element balances of terrestrial ecosystems tischer et al 2014 gomes et al 2021 potentially shifting the combined carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p stoichiometry in soil as well as affecting microbial activities community composition and stoichiometry ng et al 2014 tischer et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 in grassland soil large proportions of organic carbon and nutrient stocks are concentrated in the top layers gill et al 1999 thus any external disturbance is likely to cause dramatic soil nutrient depletion which in turn affects vegetation properties steffens et al 2008 dong et al 2012 dlamini et al 2014 hata et al 2019 indeed nitrogen and phosphorus losses are higher in degraded grassland than in non degraded grassland fig 2 a wu and tiessen 2002 steffens et al 2008 wang et al 2020 the large losses of nutrients in degraded grassland systems are primarily due to erosion loss of vegetation cover and soil texture changes dong et al 2012 su et al 2015 guo et al 2019 soil erosion is highly correlated with vegetation properties such as vegetation density and coverage degraded grassland has higher soil erosion than non degraded grassland and topsoil erosion causes substantial loss of soil organic matter zhao et al 2011 su et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 moreover soil properties influence the retention and transfer of soil nutrients swift et al 2004 de long et al 2019 degraded grassland has higher soil bulk density but lower values of porosity infiltration and soil moisture than non degraded grassland leading to heavy scour from surface flow that amplifies the loss of soil organic matter and nutrients zhao et al 2011 hiltbrunner et al 2012 su et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the decline of vegetation coverage biomass and density can influence the dynamic nature of the plant soil interactions through the modification of the water cycle and the fluxes of other elements potentiating depletion of soil organic carbon and organic nitrogen by soil erosion mchunu and chaplot 2012 dlamini et al 2014 han et al 2020 the overall reduction of soil organic matter and nutrients in degraded grassland have been consistently demonstrated fig 2a however the relative losses of nitrogen and phosphorus during grassland degradation are still unclear wen et al 2013 wang et al 2014 likely because many studies focus on one element at a time while it has been suggested that soil c n p ratios change with variations in land use zhao et al 2015 variations in c n p stoichiometry in soil are highly complex zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2020 in general the major sources of total soil c and n are biological primary production nitrogen fixation while weathering of primary rock minerals provides the dominant source of total p walker and syers 1976 chadwick et al 1999 thus shifts in vegetation cover plant community composition geomorphology as well as soil texture and geology all potentially affect nutrient stoichiometry in soil aponte et al 2010 li et al 2012 wang et al 2020 since grassland degradation affects all of these primary factors we might also expect degradation to differentially affect the accumulation or losses of n and p in soils and thus soil c n p ratios fig 2a c this is important because soils with different c n p ratios as well as plants with different foliar c n p ratios undergo different litter decomposition processes and rates leading to differential cycling of n and p in soil zhang et al 2013 schleuss et al 2019 we might also expect that these differential losses of n and p from soil to be manifested in the concentrations and ratios of n and p in streamwater in affected catchments potentially affecting nutrient limitation in the stream and in downstream lakes moreover as argued above impacts of grassland degradation are likely to differentially affect the cycling of n and p study of such multi element disruptions is facilitated by application of the theory of ecological stoichiometry which involves the study of balance of multiple chemical elements in ecological systems sterner and elser 2002 organism growth can be limited by supplies of key nutrients while biota can reciprocally affect the availability of nutrients in the environment sterner and elser 2002 for example microbial demand and use of resources are driven by the elemental stoichiometry of their own biomass and the efficiency of growth but are also regulated by the availability and stoichiometry of soil nutrients cleveland and liptzin 2007 griffiths et al 2012 manzoni et al 2012 yang et al 2022 a large proportion of soil microorganisms is heterotrophic and assumed to exhibit stronger homeostasis at the organismal level than photoautotrophic organisms cleveland and liptzin 2007 heuck et al 2015 fanin et al 2017 since different taxa of microbes can have different homeostatically regulated c n p ratios in their biomass as well as different abilities to acquire c n and p changing soil environmental conditions likely shift microbial community composition and thus alter the stoichiometry of microbial biomass fig 2d and e harris 2009 hall et al 2011 fanin et al 2013 tischer et al 2014 heuck et al 2015 as argued above impacts of grassland degradation are likely to differentially affect the cycling of n and p with grassland degradation changes in soil texture and depletion of soil organic matter and nutrients also affect microbial activities and communities abril and bucher 1999 mekuria et al 2007 ren et al 2021 for example ammonifiers nitrifiers and cellulolytic groups all decline in abundance and activity with the intensity of grassland degradation abril and bucher 1999 moreover soil microorganisms control the fluxes of c n and p through respiration mineralization and immobilization leading to feedbacks on their own biomass stoichiometry van der heijden et al 2008 mooshammer et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 thus in order to better understand biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems in the face of landcover transformation and climate change it is essential to understand the stoichiometric interactions between soil nutrients and soil microbes philippot et al 2013 handa et al 2014 wang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 according to the foregoing review and rationale two possible scenarios are expected in terms of n and p concentrations and stoichiometry in soil and soil microbial biomass fig 2a e ren 2019 in scenario 1 soil nitrogen declines more quickly than soil phosphorus with grassland degradation as a result soil n p and soil microbial biomass n p decrease with grassland degradation in scenario 2 soil phosphorus is lost more quickly than soil nitrogen as a result soil n p and soil microbial biomass n p increase with grassland degradation these scenarios are required to be further verified influences on stream ecosystems inland waters are sentinels and integrators of terrestrial processes through the transport and storage of water nutrients and energy williamson et al 2008 ren et al 2019 small streams connect the terrestrial environment with larger rivers and are the primary receivers of nutrients and organic matter exported from terrestrial ecosystems vannote et al 1980 figueiredo et al 2010 deegan et al 2011 raitif et al 2019 on a larger scale rivers play a critical role linking upland watersheds with downstream aquatic ecosystems including lakes and coastal waters cronan 2012 grizzetti et al 2019 both streams and rivers are strongly influenced by the landscapes through which they flow vannote et al 1980 allan 2004 ren et al 2019 and thus are particularly sensitive to terrestrial change bring and destouni 2009 holmes et al 2012 aghsaei et al 2020 aquatic impacts of changing landcover can often be firstly observed via their effects on stream biofilms which include attached algae bacteria and fungi as well as detritus and extracellular materials battin et al 2016 biofilms play a vitally important role in stream ecosystems acting as the dominant source of primary production in streams and thus contributing significantly to secondary production mayer and likens 1987 hall et al 2001 battin et al 2016 brüchner hüttemann et al 2019 moreover biofilms are integral to biogeochemical cycling in stream ecosystems through nutrient uptake transfer of nutrients to higher trophic levels and remineralization schiller et al 2007 battin et al 2016 ren et al 2020a the abundance and condition of biofilms are influenced by many environmental factors such as nutrient availability light intensity water temperature and flow velocity fanta et al 2010 roncoroni et al 2019 in streams flowing through a grassland watershed nutrient availability might have a particularly important role for biofilm growth without the profound impacts of a forest canopy on light temperature and coarse organic matter inputs townsend and riley 1999 riley et al 2003 ren et al 2020b stream biofilms also have a complex stoichiometry in biofilm assemblages various heterotrophic and autotrophic taxa are tightly linked to each other via trophic and competitive interactions fitter and hillebrand 2009 battin et al 2016 via the transfer of different types of nutrients associated with different biological processes peterson et al 2001 burgin and hamilton 2007 ishida et al 2008 mulholland et al 2008 drake et al 2012 the community composition biomass and stoichiometry of biofilms change significantly with available nutrients in streams fanta et al 2010 hill et al 2011 drake et al 2012 ren et al 2020a ren et al 2020b moreover bacteria and algae can compete with each other for inorganic nutrients especially phosphorus danger et al 2007 but may nevertheless show close positive correlations in biomass and productivity because bacteria also rely on algal activity and carbon exudates hepinstall and fuller 1994 carr et al 2005 c n and c p ratios of biofilms generally decrease with increasing nutrient availability frost et al 2005 kohler et al 2011 while purely heterotrophic biofilms have been observed to have higher c p ratios than autotrophic assemblages fitter and hillebrand 2009 stutter et al 2020 ren et al 2020a however altered stream nutrient concentrations can decouple autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in biofilms due to decreased demand for recycled nutrients scott et al 2008 veach and griffiths 2018 ren et al 2020a stream biofilms are potentially linked to watershed conditions because landcover significantly controls the export of c n and p from catchments to aquatic ecosystems abell et al 2011 erol and randhir 2013 umbanhowar et al 2015 ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020b potentially shifting biofilm community structure for example previous research has demonstrated variation of stream diatom composition in relation to landcover change from forest to agriculture to urban catchments walker and pan 2006 smucker et al 2013 teittinen et al 2015 close relationships between longitudinal patterns of stream biofilm biomass and pasture degradation on the qinghai tibet plateau ren et al 2013 and influences of landcover conditions on biofilms stoichiometry o brien and wehr 2010 ren et al 2020a overall these studies indicate that grassland degradation has strong potential to affect the quantity composition and stoichiometry of nutrients exported from the land into streams by changing soil nutrients and microbial communities as the grassland degrades soil nutrient contents decrease significantly wen et al 2013 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 being lost to erosion and runoff small streams may be the most important component in regulating transport and transformation of these nutrients in large drainages because of their high proportion of channel length in the whole river network and their large surface area to volume ratios which favor rapid nutrient uptake and processing alexander et al 2000 peterson et al 2001 marcarelli et al 2019 thus changes in landcover in a watershed affect terrestrial biogeochemical cycles amplifying the export of terrigenous nutrients to streams vannote et al 1980 allan 2004 ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020a according to the foregoing review and rationale in terms of n and p concentrations and stoichiometry in streamwater and stream biofilms as well as nutrient limitation of stream biofilms two possible scenarios fig 2f l are expected in accordance to the two scenarios expected in soil ecosystems fig 2a e ren 2019 in scenario 1 streamwater n concentration decreases more quickly than p concentration with grassland degradation as a result streamwater n p ratio decreases with grassland degradation furthermore n p of stream biofilms decreases with grassland degradation and stream biofilms shift from p limitation to n limitation in scenario 2 streamwater p concentrations decreases more quickly than n concentrations leading to increases of n p ratio furthermore n p of stream biofilms increases with grassland degradation and stream biofilms shift from n limitation to p limitation these scenarios are required to be further verified influences on lake ecosystems aquatic ecosystems face increasing pressures and threats from disturbances of upland watersheds associated with landcover change li et al 2009 cronan 2012 ren et al 2019 this is of interest because lakes have an intimate relationship with catchment characteristics through material transport by surface runoff cronan 2012 sadro et al 2012 mooney et al 2020 streams and rivers receive nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter exported from terrestrial ecosystems vannote et al 1980 figueiredo et al 2010 deegan et al 2011 ren et al 2020a and connect upland watershed with downstream lakes and coastal waters figueiredo et al 2010 cronan 2012 thus catchment landcover substantially controls the export of carbon and nutrients to lake ecosystems abell et al 2011 erol and randhir 2013 umbanhowar et al 2015 ren et al 2019 and thus indirectly affects the biomass and community structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton dodson et al 2005 vanni et al 2011 paquette et al 2022 ultimately impacting the suitability of water resources for fisheries and water supplies in lakes both nitrogen and phosphorus can be growth limiting nutrients for many organisms including bacteria algae and zooplankton elser et al 2001 sterner and elser 2002 elser et al 2007 lake ecosystems respond rapidly to nutrient alterations particularly oligotrophic lakes where a small change in absolute concentration can mean a large change in relative availability brahney et al 2015 ren et al 2019 in lakes phytoplankton form the base of food webs supporting higher trophic levels the growth reproduction elemental composition and even community structure of these primary producers strongly depends on the supplies of n and p sterner and elser 2002 klausmeier et al 2004 elser et al 2020 for example relatively subtle changes in the supplies of n and p might shift phytoplankton between n and p limited growth elser et al 2009 or primary producers might be synergistically limited by supplies of n and p elser et al 2007 harpole et al 2011 as a result n p ratios are useful inferring potential nutrient limitation n vs p smith 1983 ptacnik et al 2010 as argued above grassland degradation is likely to differentially affect the n and p pools in soil which potentially differentially affects n and p exported to a downstream lake affecting lake trophic status assessing nutrient stoichiometry and limitation facilitates understanding the responses of lake ecosystems to nutrient input changes as a consequence of grassland degradation according to the foregoing review and rationale in terms of nutrient limitation of lake phytoplankton two possible scenarios are expected for p limited lakes fig 2m and n in accordance to the two scenarios expected in soil ecosystems fig 2a e and stream ecosystems fig 2f l ren 2019 in scenario 1 the p limited phytoplankton are expected to be stimulated by the inflow streams as the increase of grassland degradation while expected to be suppressed in scenario 2 these scenarios are required to be further verified a reliable method to study grassland degradation to study grassland degradation researchers often employ the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi derived from satellite observations as a vegetation index thiam 2003 yengoh et al 2014 it has been consistently demonstrated that ndvi is closely related with above ground vegetation biomass and coverage carlson and ripley 1997 eastwood et al 1997 ren et al 2019 and thus ndvi has been widely used to estimate vegetation status and indicate grassland degradation akiyama and kawamura 2007 li et al 2013 hilker et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the spatial variation of ndvi permits us to use an approach known as space for time substitution to study impacts of grassland degradation according to the contemporary spatial pattern of grassland status fig 3 space for time substitution is an alternative strategy to study long term phenomena in ecology pickett 1989 blois et al 2013 monteiro et al 2021 it has been used widely and successfully especially in systems that experience strong successional dynamics in this approach temporal processes past or future trajectories of ecosystems are studied and inferred via contemporary spatial patterns blois et al 2013 a good example for the application of space for time substitution is in studying the impact of natural disturbance on ecosystems pickett 1989 response to natural disturbance has been recognized as a long term process while systematic long term studies are usually absent sousa 1984 ren et al 2019 thus the spatial distribution of disturbances has been widely used to construct disturbance temporal regimes a variety of studies using the space for time substitution approach indicate that the approach provides consistent estimates of realistic long term variations meurant 2012 blois et al 2013 joshi and jackson 2022 grassland degradation is a natural and anthropogenic disturbance however intensive and systematic long term studies of grassland degradation are lacking thus according to space for time substitution contemporary spatial patterns of grassland status can be used to study the impacts of grassland degradation in a relatively limited geographic region without fig 3 an integrated case study in the qinghai lake watershed overall landcover changes not only alter terrestrial biogeochemical processes but also have strong potential to affect nutrient stoichiometry and limitation in aquatic ecosystems moreover the microbial communities in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems likely also experience strong impacts from grassland degradation potentially influencing biogeochemical processes and microbial stoichiometry an integrated case study was conducted in the qinghai lake watershed on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp to reveal the influences of grassland degradation on soil stream and lake ecosystems from the perspectives of c n p stoichiometry nutrient limitation and bacterial communities ren et al 2019 wang et al 2020 ren et al 2020a ren et al 2020b ren et al 2021 although this study was not built on long term observations of grassland degradation processes the space for time substitution was employed to use the contemporary spatial pattern of ndvi to indicate grassland degradation fig 3 as the third pole of the earth qtp is extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic activities and global climate change jin et al 2005 zhao et al 2006 qiu 2008 yao et al 2012 grassland covers more than 60 of the qtp land area accounting for 44 of china s grasslands and 6 of the world s grasslands tan et al 2010 however due to various driving forces especially climate change and overgrazing the qtp grassland has experienced serious degradation in recent decades harris 2010 yuan et al 2021 with up to 90 of the grasslands are degraded to some extent cao et al 2019 for the qinghai lake watershed area of 29 660 km2 in particular grassland covers 75 and the lake covers 14 4 of the watershed area respectively more than half of the grassland in the qinghai lake watershed was classified as degraded luo et al 2013 thus the qinghai lake watershed is an ideal place to study the influence of grassland degradation on soil stream and lake ecosystems in a watershed this integrated case study was to address the following questions 1 how does soil microbial community and stoichiometry respond to grassland degradation 2 in turn how does stream stoichiometry and nutrient limitation respond to these impacts 3 finally how does nutrient limitation in the lake itself respond to changes in nutrient loading and ratios carried by stream inflows in this case study the influences of grassland status as indexed by ndvi on carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p concentrations and stoichiometry nutrient limitation as well as microbial community structure in soil stream and or lake ecosystems in the qinghai lake watershed were examined ren 2019 for soil ecosystems wang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 the results showed that grassland degradation decreased c and n concentrations as well as c n c p and n p ratios in soil moreover grassland degradation decreased c n and p concentrations and influenced c n and n p ratios in soil microbial biomass soil microorganisms exhibited strong homeostatic behavior while variations of microbial biomass c n and n p ratios suggested changes in microbial activities and community structure the soil became relatively more p rich and thus n limitation is anticipated to be more apparent with grassland degradation in addition grassland degradation also shifted bacterial diversity and communities in soil likely by changing soil moisture soil organic carbon total nitrogen and total phosphorus for stream ecosystems ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020a ren et al 2020b the results provided a picture of potentially differential influences of grassland degradation on doc tn and tp in streamwater with substantial increases in p but decreases in n and n p alleviating p limitation of stream biofilm the imbalances of c n p stoichiometry between streamwater and biofilms and the non isometric relationships between biofilm c and p suggested that stream biofilms might be limited by p and sensitive to p variation in addition the variation of bacterial communities in stream biofilms was closely associated with rate of change in ndvi ph conductivity as well as c n p contents and c n ratio in biofilms per se bacterial alpha diversity was positively correlated with c n and p in biofilms per se for the lake ecosystem ren et al 2019 the results indicated that grassland degradation has the potential to stimulate p limited phytoplankton growth in the lake due to substantially increased p but decreased n and n p in inflow streams caused by grassland degradation in summary this integrated case study supported most of the predictions in scenario 1 fig 2a b f g k m conclusions grassland degradation has long been of considerable research interest in terrestrial ecology many of the research efforts have focused on quantifying and modeling grassland status as well as its influences on terrestrial ecosystem processes in such studies impacts on aquatic ecosystems and linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are not often considered thus it is hard to propose a comprehensive stratagem for grassland management or watershed management it is necessary to fill the gap of lacking consideration of coupled terrestrial aquatic ecosystems in watersheds the integrated case study in qinghai lake watershed well supported most of the previously discussed consequences in scenario 1 fig 2 grassland degradation and concomitant changes in environmental factors influence coupled terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in terms of nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry nutrient limitation as well as microbial community structure however other scenarios might be also possible in other watersheds with different geochemistry background different landcover and or different lake trophic status thus integrated studies are useful and important to provide information of how grassland degradation influences biogeochemical

20068,grasslands are among one of the largest terrestrial biomes in the world suffering severe threat from ongoing degradation grassland degradation not only alter terrestrial biogeochemical processes but also have strong potentials to affect nutrient stoichiometry and limitation in aquatic ecosystems moreover the impacts of grassland degradation are likely to differentially affect the cycling of carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p in the linked terrestrial aquatic ecosystems in watersheds leading to multiple possible scenarios of nutrient stoichiometry and limitation in soil stream and lake ecosystems however we lack of integrated studies to consider biogeochemical consequences of grassland degradation transferring from soil to stream and finally to the lake ecosystems an integrated case study was conducted in the qinghai lake watershed on the qinghai tibet plateau to reveal the influences of grassland degradation on soil stream and lake ecosystems from the perspectives of c n p stoichiometry nutrient limitation and bacterial communities this case study demonstrated a clear cascading influence from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystem that grassland degradation differentially influenced n and p in soil with soil n decreased but p did not change n p decreased in soil influencing the nutrients delivered to streams with streamwater n decreased but p increased n p decreased in stream alleviating p limitation of stream biofilms which are sensitive to p variation and ultimately stimulating phytoplankton growth in the p limited qinghai lake this case study supported one scenario of biogeochemical consequences of grassland degradation and other scenarios might be also possible in watersheds that have different geochemistry background different landcover and or different lake trophic status integrated studies considering the coupled terrestrial aquatic ecosystems can provide insights for protection and management of grassland watersheds in the rapidly

efficiency of growth but are also regulated by the availability and stoichiometry of soil nutrients cleveland and liptzin 2007 griffiths et al 2012 manzoni et al 2012 yang et al 2022 a large proportion of soil microorganisms is heterotrophic and assumed to exhibit stronger homeostasis at the organismal level than photoautotrophic organisms cleveland and liptzin 2007 heuck et al 2015 fanin et al 2017 since different taxa of microbes can have different homeostatically regulated c n p ratios in their biomass as well as different abilities to acquire c n and p changing soil environmental conditions likely shift microbial community composition and thus alter the stoichiometry of microbial biomass fig 2d and e harris 2009 hall et al 2011 fanin et al 2013 tischer et al 2014 heuck et al 2015 as argued above impacts of grassland degradation are likely to differentially affect the cycling of n and p with grassland degradation changes in soil texture and depletion of soil organic matter and nutrients also affect microbial activities and communities abril and bucher 1999 mekuria et al 2007 ren et al 2021 for example ammonifiers nitrifiers and cellulolytic groups all decline in abundance and activity with the intensity of grassland degradation abril and bucher 1999 moreover soil microorganisms control the fluxes of c n and p through respiration mineralization and immobilization leading to feedbacks on their own biomass stoichiometry van der heijden et al 2008 mooshammer et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 thus in order to better understand biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems in the face of landcover transformation and climate change it is essential to understand the stoichiometric interactions between soil nutrients and soil microbes philippot et al 2013 handa et al 2014 wang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 according to the foregoing review and rationale two possible scenarios are expected in terms of n and p concentrations and stoichiometry in soil and soil microbial biomass fig 2a e ren 2019 in scenario 1 soil nitrogen declines more quickly than soil phosphorus with grassland degradation as a result soil n p and soil microbial biomass n p decrease with grassland degradation in scenario 2 soil phosphorus is lost more quickly than soil nitrogen as a result soil n p and soil microbial biomass n p increase with grassland degradation these scenarios are required to be further verified influences on stream ecosystems inland waters are sentinels and integrators of terrestrial processes through the transport and storage of water nutrients and energy williamson et al 2008 ren et al 2019 small streams connect the terrestrial environment with larger rivers and are the primary receivers of nutrients and organic matter exported from terrestrial ecosystems vannote et al 1980 figueiredo et al 2010 deegan et al 2011 raitif et al 2019 on a larger scale rivers play a critical role linking upland watersheds with downstream aquatic ecosystems including lakes and coastal waters cronan 2012 grizzetti et al 2019 both streams and rivers are strongly influenced by the landscapes through which they flow vannote et al 1980 allan 2004 ren et al 2019 and thus are particularly sensitive to terrestrial change bring and destouni 2009 holmes et al 2012 aghsaei et al 2020 aquatic impacts of changing landcover can often be firstly observed via their effects on stream biofilms which include attached algae bacteria and fungi as well as detritus and extracellular materials battin et al 2016 biofilms play a vitally important role in stream ecosystems acting as the dominant source of primary production in streams and thus contributing significantly to secondary production mayer and likens 1987 hall et al 2001 battin et al 2016 brüchner hüttemann et al 2019 moreover biofilms are integral to biogeochemical cycling in stream ecosystems through nutrient uptake transfer of nutrients to higher trophic levels and remineralization schiller et al 2007 battin et al 2016 ren et al 2020a the abundance and condition of biofilms are influenced by many environmental factors such as nutrient availability light intensity water temperature and flow velocity fanta et al 2010 roncoroni et al 2019 in streams flowing through a grassland watershed nutrient availability might have a particularly important role for biofilm growth without the profound impacts of a forest canopy on light temperature and coarse organic matter inputs townsend and riley 1999 riley et al 2003 ren et al 2020b stream biofilms also have a complex stoichiometry in biofilm assemblages various heterotrophic and autotrophic taxa are tightly linked to each other via trophic and competitive interactions fitter and hillebrand 2009 battin et al 2016 via the transfer of different types of nutrients associated with different biological processes peterson et al 2001 burgin and hamilton 2007 ishida et al 2008 mulholland et al 2008 drake et al 2012 the community composition biomass and stoichiometry of biofilms change significantly with available nutrients in streams fanta et al 2010 hill et al 2011 drake et al 2012 ren et al 2020a ren et al 2020b moreover bacteria and algae can compete with each other for inorganic nutrients especially phosphorus danger et al 2007 but may nevertheless show close positive correlations in biomass and productivity because bacteria also rely on algal activity and carbon exudates hepinstall and fuller 1994 carr et al 2005 c n and c p ratios of biofilms generally decrease with increasing nutrient availability frost et al 2005 kohler et al 2011 while purely heterotrophic biofilms have been observed to have higher c p ratios than autotrophic assemblages fitter and hillebrand 2009 stutter et al 2020 ren et al 2020a however altered stream nutrient concentrations can decouple autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in biofilms due to decreased demand for recycled nutrients scott et al 2008 veach and griffiths 2018 ren et al 2020a stream biofilms are potentially linked to watershed conditions because landcover significantly controls the export of c n and p from catchments to aquatic ecosystems abell et al 2011 erol and randhir 2013 umbanhowar et al 2015 ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020b potentially shifting biofilm community structure for example previous research has demonstrated variation of stream diatom composition in relation to landcover change from forest to agriculture to urban catchments walker and pan 2006 smucker et al 2013 teittinen et al 2015 close relationships between longitudinal patterns of stream biofilm biomass and pasture degradation on the qinghai tibet plateau ren et al 2013 and influences of landcover conditions on biofilms stoichiometry o brien and wehr 2010 ren et al 2020a overall these studies indicate that grassland degradation has strong potential to affect the quantity composition and stoichiometry of nutrients exported from the land into streams by changing soil nutrients and microbial communities as the grassland degrades soil nutrient contents decrease significantly wen et al 2013 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 being lost to erosion and runoff small streams may be the most important component in regulating transport and transformation of these nutrients in large drainages because of their high proportion of channel length in the whole river network and their large surface area to volume ratios which favor rapid nutrient uptake and processing alexander et al 2000 peterson et al 2001 marcarelli et al 2019 thus changes in landcover in a watershed affect terrestrial biogeochemical cycles amplifying the export of terrigenous nutrients to streams vannote et al 1980 allan 2004 ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020a according to the foregoing review and rationale in terms of n and p concentrations and stoichiometry in streamwater and stream biofilms as well as nutrient limitation of stream biofilms two possible scenarios fig 2f l are expected in accordance to the two scenarios expected in soil ecosystems fig 2a e ren 2019 in scenario 1 streamwater n concentration decreases more quickly than p concentration with grassland degradation as a result streamwater n p ratio decreases with grassland degradation furthermore n p of stream biofilms decreases with grassland degradation and stream biofilms shift from p limitation to n limitation in scenario 2 streamwater p concentrations decreases more quickly than n concentrations leading to increases of n p ratio furthermore n p of stream biofilms increases with grassland degradation and stream biofilms shift from n limitation to p limitation these scenarios are required to be further verified influences on lake ecosystems aquatic ecosystems face increasing pressures and threats from disturbances of upland watersheds associated with landcover change li et al 2009 cronan 2012 ren et al 2019 this is of interest because lakes have an intimate relationship with catchment characteristics through material transport by surface runoff cronan 2012 sadro et al 2012 mooney et al 2020 streams and rivers receive nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and organic matter exported from terrestrial ecosystems vannote et al 1980 figueiredo et al 2010 deegan et al 2011 ren et al 2020a and connect upland watershed with downstream lakes and coastal waters figueiredo et al 2010 cronan 2012 thus catchment landcover substantially controls the export of carbon and nutrients to lake ecosystems abell et al 2011 erol and randhir 2013 umbanhowar et al 2015 ren et al 2019 and thus indirectly affects the biomass and community structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton dodson et al 2005 vanni et al 2011 paquette et al 2022 ultimately impacting the suitability of water resources for fisheries and water supplies in lakes both nitrogen and phosphorus can be growth limiting nutrients for many organisms including bacteria algae and zooplankton elser et al 2001 sterner and elser 2002 elser et al 2007 lake ecosystems respond rapidly to nutrient alterations particularly oligotrophic lakes where a small change in absolute concentration can mean a large change in relative availability brahney et al 2015 ren et al 2019 in lakes phytoplankton form the base of food webs supporting higher trophic levels the growth reproduction elemental composition and even community structure of these primary producers strongly depends on the supplies of n and p sterner and elser 2002 klausmeier et al 2004 elser et al 2020 for example relatively subtle changes in the supplies of n and p might shift phytoplankton between n and p limited growth elser et al 2009 or primary producers might be synergistically limited by supplies of n and p elser et al 2007 harpole et al 2011 as a result n p ratios are useful inferring potential nutrient limitation n vs p smith 1983 ptacnik et al 2010 as argued above grassland degradation is likely to differentially affect the n and p pools in soil which potentially differentially affects n and p exported to a downstream lake affecting lake trophic status assessing nutrient stoichiometry and limitation facilitates understanding the responses of lake ecosystems to nutrient input changes as a consequence of grassland degradation according to the foregoing review and rationale in terms of nutrient limitation of lake phytoplankton two possible scenarios are expected for p limited lakes fig 2m and n in accordance to the two scenarios expected in soil ecosystems fig 2a e and stream ecosystems fig 2f l ren 2019 in scenario 1 the p limited phytoplankton are expected to be stimulated by the inflow streams as the increase of grassland degradation while expected to be suppressed in scenario 2 these scenarios are required to be further verified a reliable method to study grassland degradation to study grassland degradation researchers often employ the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi derived from satellite observations as a vegetation index thiam 2003 yengoh et al 2014 it has been consistently demonstrated that ndvi is closely related with above ground vegetation biomass and coverage carlson and ripley 1997 eastwood et al 1997 ren et al 2019 and thus ndvi has been widely used to estimate vegetation status and indicate grassland degradation akiyama and kawamura 2007 li et al 2013 hilker et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the spatial variation of ndvi permits us to use an approach known as space for time substitution to study impacts of grassland degradation according to the contemporary spatial pattern of grassland status fig 3 space for time substitution is an alternative strategy to study long term phenomena in ecology pickett 1989 blois et al 2013 monteiro et al 2021 it has been used widely and successfully especially in systems that experience strong successional dynamics in this approach temporal processes past or future trajectories of ecosystems are studied and inferred via contemporary spatial patterns blois et al 2013 a good example for the application of space for time substitution is in studying the impact of natural disturbance on ecosystems pickett 1989 response to natural disturbance has been recognized as a long term process while systematic long term studies are usually absent sousa 1984 ren et al 2019 thus the spatial distribution of disturbances has been widely used to construct disturbance temporal regimes a variety of studies using the space for time substitution approach indicate that the approach provides consistent estimates of realistic long term variations meurant 2012 blois et al 2013 joshi and jackson 2022 grassland degradation is a natural and anthropogenic disturbance however intensive and systematic long term studies of grassland degradation are lacking thus according to space for time substitution contemporary spatial patterns of grassland status can be used to study the impacts of grassland degradation in a relatively limited geographic region without fig 3 an integrated case study in the qinghai lake watershed overall landcover changes not only alter terrestrial biogeochemical processes but also have strong potential to affect nutrient stoichiometry and limitation in aquatic ecosystems moreover the microbial communities in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems likely also experience strong impacts from grassland degradation potentially influencing biogeochemical processes and microbial stoichiometry an integrated case study was conducted in the qinghai lake watershed on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp to reveal the influences of grassland degradation on soil stream and lake ecosystems from the perspectives of c n p stoichiometry nutrient limitation and bacterial communities ren et al 2019 wang et al 2020 ren et al 2020a ren et al 2020b ren et al 2021 although this study was not built on long term observations of grassland degradation processes the space for time substitution was employed to use the contemporary spatial pattern of ndvi to indicate grassland degradation fig 3 as the third pole of the earth qtp is extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic activities and global climate change jin et al 2005 zhao et al 2006 qiu 2008 yao et al 2012 grassland covers more than 60 of the qtp land area accounting for 44 of china s grasslands and 6 of the world s grasslands tan et al 2010 however due to various driving forces especially climate change and overgrazing the qtp grassland has experienced serious degradation in recent decades harris 2010 yuan et al 2021 with up to 90 of the grasslands are degraded to some extent cao et al 2019 for the qinghai lake watershed area of 29 660 km2 in particular grassland covers 75 and the lake covers 14 4 of the watershed area respectively more than half of the grassland in the qinghai lake watershed was classified as degraded luo et al 2013 thus the qinghai lake watershed is an ideal place to study the influence of grassland degradation on soil stream and lake ecosystems in a watershed this integrated case study was to address the following questions 1 how does soil microbial community and stoichiometry respond to grassland degradation 2 in turn how does stream stoichiometry and nutrient limitation respond to these impacts 3 finally how does nutrient limitation in the lake itself respond to changes in nutrient loading and ratios carried by stream inflows in this case study the influences of grassland status as indexed by ndvi on carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p concentrations and stoichiometry nutrient limitation as well as microbial community structure in soil stream and or lake ecosystems in the qinghai lake watershed were examined ren 2019 for soil ecosystems wang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 the results showed that grassland degradation decreased c and n concentrations as well as c n c p and n p ratios in soil moreover grassland degradation decreased c n and p concentrations and influenced c n and n p ratios in soil microbial biomass soil microorganisms exhibited strong homeostatic behavior while variations of microbial biomass c n and n p ratios suggested changes in microbial activities and community structure the soil became relatively more p rich and thus n limitation is anticipated to be more apparent with grassland degradation in addition grassland degradation also shifted bacterial diversity and communities in soil likely by changing soil moisture soil organic carbon total nitrogen and total phosphorus for stream ecosystems ren et al 2019 ren et al 2020a ren et al 2020b the results provided a picture of potentially differential influences of grassland degradation on doc tn and tp in streamwater with substantial increases in p but decreases in n and n p alleviating p limitation of stream biofilm the imbalances of c n p stoichiometry between streamwater and biofilms and the non isometric relationships between biofilm c and p suggested that stream biofilms might be limited by p and sensitive to p variation in addition the variation of bacterial communities in stream biofilms was closely associated with rate of change in ndvi ph conductivity as well as c n p contents and c n ratio in biofilms per se bacterial alpha diversity was positively correlated with c n and p in biofilms per se for the lake ecosystem ren et al 2019 the results indicated that grassland degradation has the potential to stimulate p limited phytoplankton growth in the lake due to substantially increased p but decreased n and n p in inflow streams caused by grassland degradation in summary this integrated case study supported most of the predictions in scenario 1 fig 2a b f g k m conclusions grassland degradation has long been of considerable research interest in terrestrial ecology many of the research efforts have focused on quantifying and modeling grassland status as well as its influences on terrestrial ecosystem processes in such studies impacts on aquatic ecosystems and linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are not often considered thus it is hard to propose a comprehensive stratagem for grassland management or watershed management it is necessary to fill the gap of lacking consideration of coupled terrestrial aquatic ecosystems in watersheds the integrated case study in qinghai lake watershed well supported most of the previously discussed consequences in scenario 1 fig 2 grassland degradation and concomitant changes in environmental factors influence coupled terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in terms of nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry nutrient limitation as well as microbial community structure however other scenarios might be also possible in other watersheds with different geochemistry background different landcover and or different lake trophic status thus integrated studies are useful and important to provide information of how grassland degradation influences biogeochemical processes in a particular watershed from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems contributing to the protection and management of grassland watersheds in a rapidly changing world declaration of competing

20069,the invasion of spartina alterniflora has threatened and damaged coastal wetlands in china therefore control and removal of this severe invasive plant are urgently needed green chemical control is an effective and low cost method that can be used for large scale removal of invasive specie to study the control effect of imazapyr on s alterniflora and evaluate its impact on other species and the wetland environment a control experiment was set up in the yellow river delta reserve in shandong province in may 2021 a total of 9 treatments were set up in the experiment 25 w imazapyr water main agent three treatments with dose gradients of 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 l acre and the main agent at a dose of 6 0 l acre with six treatments of age 809 adjuvant a and age 852 adjuvant b with dose gradients of 1 3 2 6 and 5 2 l acre respectively the results showed that after 60 days of application the control efficiency of spartina alterniflora was over 90 and the residual amount was small in the plots with the main agent additive 6 0 l acre among them the residues on leaves were 0 499 2 822 mg kg the residues in soil ranged from 0 0012 to 0 0714 mg kg and were from not detected in water to 8 8e 4 mg kg during the experiment there were significant differences in soil physicochemical properties among different treatments and imazapyr significantly affected on the availability of soil c n and p at the stage of large chemical residues p 0 05 in addition imazapyr was not toxic to the benthic community and increased from 168 72 m3 to 633 75 m3 in 60 days after spraying this study provides a theoretical basis data support and technical support for applying herbicides to control s alterniflora in coastal wetlands of china keywords chemical control herbicides spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass salt marsh yellow river delta introduction spartina alterniflora hereafter s alterniflora which originates on the west coast of the atlantic ocean and mexico gulf has become one of the most infamous invasive plant species worldwide an et al 2007 ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b this species has extremely high photosynthetic efficiency as well as productivity sexually and asexually which gives them the ability to seize the niche rapidly and is hard to eradicate by physical methods because of its strong rhizome systems xie et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 researchers introduced this species in china for shoreline stabilization in the 1970s while the subsequent invasion was totally out of control chen et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 from 1985 to 2021 the distribution area of this species increased from 2 6 km2 to 615 7 km2 we can find this species from the liao river estuary all the way south to guangxi and even hainan province and it is causing multiple ecological issues li et al 2022 their high fitness causes the competitive exclusion of native species and changes in soil properties and benthos communities xie and gao 2013 the developed rhizome and high tiller rate lower the invertebrate biodiversity by reducing soil aeration and niche space the invasion also changes the blue carbon cycling and coverts carbon sink to carbon sources in the coast wetlands by influencing microbial communities and their metabolism li et al 2021 mueller et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 besides this species also causes economic loss by silting estuarine channels and colonizing aquaculture pools kettenring and adams 2011 xie et al 2019 the invasion of s alterniflora has become a significant concern of the chinese government li et al 2009 ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b zhang et al 2012 in 2020 the national forestry and grassland bureau of the ministry of natural resources of china pointed out in the special action plan for mangrove protection and restoration 2020 2025 that s alterniflora has flooded coastal wetlands in china and it is the main reason for causing extensive degradation of mangroves the main reason is that the control of s alterniflora needs to be solved urgently in addition major coastal provinces and cities in china have issued policy documents on the prevention and control of s alterniflora and invested substantial contributions for example dongying city of shandong province invested 6 2 million us dollars in s alterniflora treatment and its later ecological restoration and shanghai invested 0 18 billion us dollars yuan et al 2011 local governments and managers keep trying to remove or at least control this invasive species with lots of investment several methods have been tried such as removing rhizomes deep turning landfilling burning shading to stop photosynthesis inundation to stop respiration etc while those physic based methods did not get the expected results and even disturbed the ecological process severely europe and the united states also suffered from s alterniflora invasion and tried environmental friendly herbicides the most common one used is glyphosate but forbidden by the chinese government because of side effects including water pollution soil compaction and toxicity to organisms recent studies reported a new herbicide imazapyr table 1 applied on the west coast of the united states which can stop the cell division in rhizomes and consequentially cause massive mortality in the population imazapyr is a broad spectrum post emergence herbicide with prolonged residual activity it is mainly effective in controlling grass weeds broadleaf weeds and sedge weeds and has a long lasting effect its degradation pathway in water is photolysis with a half life of 2 5 to 5 3 days while its main degradation pathway in the soil is microbial metabolism its metabolites are 2 3 pyridinecarboxylic acid cl 9140 22 7 and 7 hydroxy furo 3 4 bjpyridin 5 7h one cl 119060 9 7 olofson et al 2005 the main action mechanism of imazapyr is that it is absorbed by plant leaves and roots rapidly transmitted to the meristem for accumulation through the xylem and phloem subsequently by inhibiting the glycolate synthase als that synthesizes valine leucine and isoleucine in plants it further interrupts protein synthesis blocks dna synthesis and cell growth and ultimately leads to chlorosis of new leaves and necrosis of tissue thus achieving the purpose of dual prevention and control of sexual and asexual reproduction kim 2016 since animals do not synthesize such branched chained aliphatic amino acids but obtain them from eating plants and other animals the toxicity of imazapyr is not generally relevant to birds mammals fish or invertebrates now does imazapyr also work for the s alterniflora invasion in china if it works what would be the cost economically and environmentally thus the aims of the current study are threefold 1 test the effect of imazapyr on the east coast of china 2 analyze its side effects on the environment including water quality soil properties as well as benthons communities and 3 evaluate the cost the results will give guidance to the government and managers if we should take further consideration for its import materials and methods experiment design the study area was in the current yellow river estuary in the southern part of the yellow river delta national nature reserve in shandong province china fig 1 the yellow river delta national nature reserve is the most complete wetland ecosystem in the warm temperate zone of china belonging to the warm temperate zone semi humid continental monsoon climate zone the annual average temperature in this area is 11 7 12 6 c the extreme maximum temperature is 41 9 c and the extreme minimum temperature is 23 3 c the average annual precipitation is 530 630 mm and the average evapotranspiration is 750 2400 mm there are 685 species of plants in the reserve of which suaeda salsa s salsa phragmites australis p australis tamarix tamarix t tamarix and apocynum venetum a venetum are dominant species cui et al 2011 in recent years large areas of native plants in the reserve such as s salsa and p australis have been replaced by s alterniflora resulting in a significant reduction in birds and benthic animals the test agent in the experiment is 25 w imazapyr aqueous solution and its active ingredient is imazapyr table 2 c13h15n3o3 cas number 81334 34 1 which is a new broad spectrum imidazolinone herbicide imazapyr controls plant growth by inhibiting the biological synthetase of three kinds of branched chain fats amino acid valine leucine and isoleucine it has excellent herbicidal activity against sedge weeds annual and perennial monocotyledon weeds and broadleaf weeds in addition the main components of the adjuvant age 809 involved in the experiment are lecithin 50 and the main components of age 852 is established rapeseed oil 45 7 the main function of the adjuvant is to increase the adhesion of the main agent and prolong the contact time of the agent in june 2021 a 1 hectare study area was set up in the reserve where the s alterniflora community was in the growth stage in this area nine large quadrats 120 m2 were set based on the experiment purpose and sufficient spacing is set between the plots each large quadrat was further divided into three parallel quadrats totally 27 parallel quadrats nine large quadrats were treated with nine agents 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 l acre 25 imazapyr nine large quadrats were treated with nine agents three dose gradients of 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 l acre 25 imazapyr mixtures of 6 0 l acre 25 imazapyr with 1 3 2 5 and 5 2 l acre age 809 adjuvant a and mixtures of 6 0 l acre 25 imazapyr with 1 3 2 5 and 5 2 l acre age 852 adjuvant b respectively table 3 the survey frequency was before spraying and on the 15th 30th and 60th days after spraying d15 d30 d60 the frequency of soil and plant sample collection was before spraying d0 and on the 1st 6th 30th and 60th days after spraying d1 d6 d30 d60 and on site measurement of soil moisture content and electrical conductivity was carried out at the same time the collection frequency of pesticide residue samples water soil plants was increased by d3 the third day after drug administration on this basis sample collection the growth of mangrove plants in the quadrat was observed with the observation method and three plot boxes with an area of 50 50 cm2 were randomly set in each parallel quadrat to record the number of s alterniflora the aboveground biomass was investigated by the absolute value method the plant samples were randomly collected from several plant leaves in the quadrat and stored at 20 c for the residual amount of imazapyr to be tested the water samples were directly collected in wide mouth bottles and one part of them was left to stand for the determination of the indicators and the other part was stored in a 20 c environment to be tested for the residual amount of imazapyr soil samples were randomly collected from 0 to 20 cm of soil in each parallel quadrat and the soil collected from the three parallel quadrats for each treatment was finally mixed into one sample after removing impurities such as roots and stones all soil samples were divided into two parts one part was stored at 20 c for the determination of imazapyr residues and the remaining part was used to determine other physicochemical properties for benthic samples one sampling point quantitative point was randomly selected in each parallel quadrat and a 30 cm 30 cm quantitative sample frame was used for collection and the sampling depth was 40 cm 1 3 of the bottom mud collected from each parallel quadrat was mixed into one sample from each quadrat and the collected mud samples were sieved with a 60 mesh copper sieve data analysis imazapyr residues in samples were determined according to gb t 27860 2011 and the high efficiency liquid chromatography

spectrophotosis method referring to hj634 2012 the ammonium nitrogen nh3 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n contents were respectively determined using the kcl dip double wavelength uv color comparison method and kcl dip indigo phenolic color comparison method data analysis the control rate of imazapyr was used to characterize the control efficiency of imazapyr which was characterized by the number of dead plants of s alterniflora per unit area the plant control rate can be expressed as w d n n 0 n n 0 100 in the formula wdn represents the control rate of plants on the no th day after treatment n0 represents the average number of s alterniflora in the control area outside the plot and n represents the average number of s alterniflora in the treatment areas with different doses one way analysis of variance spearman correlation analysis spss software and corrheatmap package r software were used to analyze the significant differences and correlations between plant characteristics imazapyr residues and physicochemical properties under different treatments and to further explore the effect mechanism of different doses of imazapyr on s alterniflora and yellow river delta wetland results effect of imazaypr on s alterniflora as shown in table 3 60 days after spraying only plot ia 3 0 l acre without adjuvant showed relatively lower removal rates while the difference between ib 6 0 l acre without adjuvant and ic 9 0 l acre without adjuvant are insignificant and the removal rates are higher than 90 table 3 besides the effects of age809 and age825 are almost the same and the concentration of adjuvants higher than 2 5 l acer increases the removal rates by about 5 and the difference between 2 5 l acer and 5 0 l acer are insignificant statistically p 0 05 however higher concentration of adjuvants faster the pesticide effect for groups with 5 2 l acer adjuvants iac and ibc over 92 s alterniflora died out in 30 days by which only about 83 of individuals died in other groups with lower concentrations of adjuvants residues of imazapyr as shown in fig 2 in groups without adjuvant the half lives of the imazapyr in plant water as well as soil samples were far 30 days while it was about 30 days in adjuvant groups p 0 05 the residues of imazapyr in soil on days 30 and 60 showed that ia and ib were significantly lower than those in other samples plant leaf residues

can help imazaphyr stay in plants longer and more efficiently table 3 besides imazaphyr degrades rapidly in the habitats and 60 days after spaying the residuals are far below the harmful concentration

was not significant and no significant difference were found in different groups statistically p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 a b and c the water quality was mainly influenced by the tide actions and the water quality in samples were consistent with the sea water for soil environment in different treatments groups fig 3 d to l tc toc tn tp ap have no significant differences p 0 05 which indicated that

arthropods one species of mollusc and the dominant species is shellfish the mean benthos biomass in the sample was 168 72 individuals m3 investigation after spraying revealed lots of crab holes on the surface sediment due to plant dieback vacates ecological niche lots of crabs macrophthalmus japonicus ilyoplax pingi and mudskipper periophthalmus magnuspinnatus were active in the area the number of

spartina alterniflora s alterniflora mainly distributes in mudflats where large machines and equipment such as excavators and vehicles can hardly access besides asexual reproduction capacity makes this invasive species even more resistant to physical treatment such as harvest roots and rhizome underground stems are dense with a high tiller rate thus harvest can only stop their sexual reproduction and slow down the rapid growth and spreading but cannot eradicate them some other studies indicate that shading or flooding is efficient way to remove and eradicate s alterniflora by stopping photosynthesis and respiration but the cost is extremely high because of the sheer magnitude of the distribution area chongming national reserve in shanghai east china started their s alterniflora removal project in 2006 and the building of dams for flooding and supporting works cost more than 185 7 million dollars within a decade for 6000 acre invasive area and they still have a long way to go for eradicating them all xie et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 due to the low cost performance and unsatisfactory effects of physical treatments chemicals especially herbicides have drawn more research attention in recent years however in habitats of s alterniflora tides and current impulses give little time for absorption kim et al 2017 and thus most herbicides can hardly kill 65 of individuals kettenring and adams 2011 the first attempt at imazapyr was on the west coast of the us in 2001 and the removal rate was about 70 kim 2002 in the current study samples in the first six days after spraying gave no feedback indicating a slow effect of imazapyr while the removal rates here in the yellow river delta are much higher than in the us kettenring and adams 2011 different tidal conditions such as frequency tidal ranges and inundation duration are the critical influence of the effect low concentrations with short absorption time due to lack of adjuvants and tides cannot kill seeds and rhizome in the soil thus in those samples the numbers of living individuals on the d60 are even higher than the number on the d30 lacking adhesive agents and low concentration together limited the effect and after 30 days the tiller rate was higher than the death rate for high concentration groups no less than 6 0 l acre the eradicate rates are above 90 after 60 days a concentration of 6 0 l acre with 2 6 l acre of adjuvants can be even higher than 95 another advantage of imazapyr is the low costs costs of the medicament 6 0 l acre is about 4000 4400 us dollars per acre and we can use uav to spray where vehicles can hardly access and the labor cost of spaying and management in the following 3 4 years would not higher than 1000 us dollars per acre zhao et al 2020 while the physical treatment project chongming national reserve as an example the costs is about 185 7 million us dollars for 6000 acre which is about 3 0950 us dollars per acre the imazapyr only costs 1 6 of the physical projects and about 1 3 1 4 time influence of imazapyr on soil and water insecticide residue is a key indicator to evaluate its risk the residual concentration of pharmaceuticals was significantly higher in plant leaves than in water and soil after 60 days imazapyr has a duration of efficacy after being absorbed by plants imazapyr degrades rapidly in fields especially in water and the half life is only 2 3 days thus the residues of imazapyr in water and soil are extremely low and could be undetectable however the addition of adjuvant prolonged the degradation process of imazapyr which suggest the avoidance of high concentration or large dose of adjuvant referring to the united states environmental protection agency usepa table s2 25 imazapyr residual are non toxic to mammals birds fish as well as both freshwater and marine invertebrates epa 2004 and it is also low toxicity to earthworms and other soil biots which indicate the risk of imazapyr residual in our study is acceptable in addition we also found it is harmful for bombyx bombyx mori ld50 c 920 mg a i l with rq 1 49 while the use of imazapyr is narrowed in the coastal wetlands where is not the niche of the speceis besides the results from usepa are based on the chronic reference dose rfd and the dose they used is 2 5 mg kg b w day it is much denser than the 25 imazapyr residue in the soil and water after 60 days in the current study tc toc tn tp and ap were not significantly different among groups which indicates the effect of 25 imazapyr on soil s physical and chemical properties did not changes as concentrations significantly within the application dose range adopted in our current study would not cause any risk or even obvious changes in the soil besides imazapyr nigher affect water quality because of its short degradation time in water bodies however we did observe a decrease of salinity no3 n toc and an increase of tp in soil for several days after spraying the effect of the residual in water was transient and the content of imazapyr was high for a short time after spraying some of the residual diffused into the soil and caused further affection in the soil the imazapyr in the soil directly increases the c n and nitrate nitrogen content longenecker 1960 luo et al 2021 which affects the mineralization of phosphorus by soil microorganisms and increases the content of soil tp as well as ap in addition imazapyr is in the anionic form carboxylic acid ionization in alkaline environments which increases soil ph gianelli et al 2014 wepplo et al 1991 this hinders the mineralization of c n and p by microorganisms and a large amount of soil ammonium nitrogen converted to ammonia meanwhile the increase in ph will promote the uptake of ammonium nitrogen by plants and the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil influence of imazapyr on benthonic animals benthonic animal is an important community of coastal wetland ecosystems and is sensitive to environmental changes its response to changes in water and sediment quality caused by water flow and human activities is considered as indicators of wetland health status borja et al 2000 peng et al 2013 population dynamics are also used to evaluate the environmental impact of herbicides ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b shimeta et al 2016 in our field study no mortality occurred after the application of chemicals and the total number of benthic species increased after two months which was three times greater than before the application kim 2016 the presence of a large number of crab holes and periophthalmus cantonensis in the post tidal survey indicates imazapyr was not toxic to benthic organisms which was consistent with the findings of foreign studies the correlation results showed that both benthonic species and abundance were negatively affected by the density of spartina alterniflora with the increase of time most of the s alterniflora were washed away by the tide after they died the ecological niche on the beach was vacated creating food and ample habitat for crabs and p cantonensis in addition plant litter and root exudes control the condition of the soil environment marschner and rengel 2007 the root exudes of s alterniflora was altered and some plants wilted into the soil during the pharmacological effect this led to changes in soil characteristics which further significantly affected the survival pattern of benthic animals mccary et al 2016 perez castro et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the comparison between before and after spraying illustrates that s alterniflora seriously hinders the survival of benthic animals especially macrobenthos such as crabs and p cantonensis imazapyr was effective in short term control of s alterniflora promoting benthic animals growth for long term impacts the us environment agency epa 2004 kettenring and adams and kim kettenring and adams 2011 kim 2003 kim 2016 have studied the effect of imazapyr on s alterniflora prevention and control and environmental risk assessment for more than ten years in their annual regular monitoring and assessment the environmental risks of imazapyr and the risks to local organisms were far lower than the risk level and no toxic impact has occurred considering that the environmental factors conditions of hydrology topography and climate of the estuarine and coastal wetlands in the united states are different from those in china which may cause different assessment results therefore the long term impact of imazapyr on estuarine and coastal wetland ecosystems in china needs to be further observed imazapyr disperses rapidly when it falls into the water due to the effects of tidal hydrodynamic forces in estuaries and coastal wetlands and its half life is only 1 2 days allowing for rapid photolysis therefore it is predicted that imazapyr is difficult to cause enrichment impact on aquatic organisms in the study area the decomposition rate of imazapyr in soil is lower than that in water the decomposition rate of imazapyr in soil is lower than that in water however in the whole treatment period imazapyr only needs to be sprayed 1 3 times according to the site conditions and its accumulation in the soil will not exceed three times the residual amount of the short term test at three times the residue it is still well below the value of the risk another issue we are facing is that areas where invasive species have been successfully managed face severe re invasion challenges with invasive species spreading much faster than native species kim 2003 kim et al 2017 the ecology of s alterniflora was an extremely fragile ecosystem after vacating and was vulnerable to disturbance by invasive species climate and hydrological changes the restoration of native or desirable vegetation needs to be accelerated artificially therefore measures for revegetation should be implemented after the successful treatment of s alterniflora with imazapyr herbivorous crabs such as sesarmidae and small mammals have been proved to enhance the resistance and resilience of mangroves and salt marshes to the invasion of s alterniflora giddins et al 1986 ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b so as to block the re invasion of s alterniflora and restore the degraded mangrove wetlands therefore appropriate local mangrove plant species should be planted quickly after s alterniflora is removed from mangrove wetlands and an environment suitable for the growth and reproduction of herbivorous crabs and small mammals should be created to increase their number chongming district of shanghai has launched a series of ecological restoration projects based on the creation of the national forest city and wetland city huang et al 2022 by restoring the original vegetation and benthos communities in the yangtze river estuary to further create a good ecological environment so as to provide a relatively stable food source and a suitable habitat environment for migratory birds and attract birds to choose chongming to settle inhabit and breed conclusions in current study the short term environmental risks were consistent with those in the united states both low and more effective in removing s alterniflora than those in the united states after spraying 25 imazapyr on s alterniflora for 60 days the control rate of all the plots with the main agent dose greater than 3 0 l acre reached more than 90 and the highest was 96 98 this method is superior to the physical treatment method in terms of technology cost time consuming and environmental protection the control rate of plant number increased with the increase of adjuvant concentration both imazapyr itself and its residues are of low risk and the soil physicochemical properties change significantly at the stage of relatively large pesticide residues the species of benthos increased after 60 days and the total number of benthic organisms was more than three times that before spraying the herbicide which was significantly related to the plant density and soil physicochemical properties of s alterniflora this study can provide a scientific basis for the relevant departments to formulate policies related to the control of s alterniflor and provide a theoretical basis data support and technical support for the control of s alterniflor by herbicides in coastal

20069,the invasion of spartina alterniflora has threatened and damaged coastal wetlands in china therefore control and removal of this severe invasive plant are urgently needed green chemical control is an effective and low cost method that can be used for large scale removal of invasive specie to study the control effect of imazapyr on s alterniflora and evaluate its impact on other species and the wetland environment a control experiment was set up in the yellow river delta reserve in shandong province in may 2021 a total of 9 treatments were set up in the experiment 25 w imazapyr water main agent three treatments with dose gradients of 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 l acre and the main agent at a dose of 6 0 l acre with six treatments of age 809 adjuvant a and age 852 adjuvant b with dose gradients of 1 3 2 6 and 5 2 l acre respectively the results showed that after 60 days of application the control efficiency of spartina alterniflora was over 90 and the residual amount was small in the plots with the main agent additive 6 0 l acre among them the residues on leaves were 0 499 2 822 mg kg the residues in soil ranged from 0 0012 to 0 0714 mg kg and were from not detected in water to 8 8e 4 mg kg during the experiment there were significant differences in soil physicochemical properties among different treatments and imazapyr significantly affected on the availability of soil c n and p at the stage of large chemical residues p 0 05 in addition imazapyr was not toxic to the benthic community and increased from 168 72 m3 to 633 75 m3 in 60 days after spraying this study provides a theoretical basis data support and technical support for applying herbicides to control s alterniflora in coastal wetlands of china keywords chemical control herbicides spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass salt marsh yellow river delta introduction spartina alterniflora hereafter s alterniflora which originates on the west coast of the atlantic ocean and mexico gulf has become one of the most infamous invasive plant species worldwide an et al 2007 ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b this species has extremely high photosynthetic efficiency as well as productivity sexually and asexually which gives them the ability to seize the niche rapidly and is hard to eradicate by physical methods because of its strong rhizome systems xie et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 researchers introduced this species in china for shoreline stabilization in the 1970s while the subsequent invasion was totally out of control chen et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 from 1985 to 2021 the distribution area of this species increased from 2 6 km2 to 615 7 km2 we can find this species from the liao river estuary all the way south to guangxi and even hainan province and it is causing multiple ecological issues li et al 2022 their high fitness causes the competitive exclusion of native species and changes in soil properties and benthos communities xie and gao 2013 the developed rhizome and high tiller rate lower the invertebrate biodiversity by reducing soil aeration and niche space the invasion also changes the blue carbon cycling and coverts carbon sink to carbon sources in the coast wetlands by influencing microbial communities and their metabolism li et al 2021 mueller et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 besides this species also causes economic loss by silting estuarine channels and colonizing aquaculture pools kettenring and adams 2011 xie et al 2019 the invasion of s alterniflora has become a significant concern of the chinese government li et al 2009 ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b zhang et al 2012 in 2020 the national forestry and grassland bureau of the ministry of natural resources of china pointed out in the special action plan for mangrove protection and restoration 2020 2025 that s alterniflora has flooded coastal wetlands in china and it is the main reason for causing extensive degradation of mangroves the main reason is that the control of s alterniflora needs to be solved urgently in addition major coastal provinces and cities in china have issued policy documents on the prevention and control of s alterniflora and invested substantial contributions for example dongying city of shandong province invested 6 2 million us dollars in s alterniflora treatment and its later ecological restoration and shanghai invested 0 18 billion us dollars yuan et al 2011 local governments and managers keep trying to remove or at least control this invasive species with lots of investment several methods have been tried such as removing rhizomes deep turning landfilling burning shading to stop photosynthesis inundation to stop respiration etc while those physic based methods did not get the expected results and even disturbed the ecological process severely europe and the united states also suffered from s alterniflora invasion and tried environmental friendly herbicides the most common one used is glyphosate but forbidden by the chinese government because of side effects including water pollution soil compaction and toxicity to organisms recent studies reported a new herbicide imazapyr table 1 applied on the west coast of the united states which can stop the cell division in rhizomes and consequentially cause massive mortality in the population imazapyr is a broad spectrum post emergence herbicide with prolonged residual activity it is mainly effective in controlling grass weeds broadleaf weeds and sedge weeds and has a long lasting effect its degradation pathway in water is photolysis with a half life of 2 5 to 5 3 days while its main degradation pathway in the soil is microbial metabolism its metabolites are 2 3 pyridinecarboxylic acid cl 9140 22 7 and 7 hydroxy furo 3 4 bjpyridin 5 7h one cl 119060 9 7 olofson et al 2005 the main action mechanism of imazapyr is that it is absorbed by plant leaves and roots rapidly transmitted to the meristem for accumulation through the xylem and phloem subsequently by inhibiting the glycolate synthase als that synthesizes valine leucine and isoleucine in plants it further interrupts protein synthesis blocks dna synthesis and cell growth and ultimately leads to chlorosis of new leaves and necrosis of tissue thus achieving the purpose of dual prevention and control of sexual and asexual reproduction kim 2016 since animals do not synthesize such branched chained aliphatic amino acids but obtain them from eating plants and other animals the toxicity of imazapyr is not generally relevant to birds mammals fish or invertebrates now does imazapyr also work for the s alterniflora invasion in china if it works what would be the cost economically and environmentally thus the aims of the current study are threefold 1 test the effect of imazapyr on the east coast of china 2 analyze its side effects on the environment including water quality soil properties as well as benthons communities and 3 evaluate the cost the results will give guidance to the government and managers if we should take further consideration for its import materials and methods experiment design the study area was in the current yellow river estuary in the southern part of the yellow river delta national nature reserve in shandong province china fig 1 the yellow river delta national nature reserve is the most complete wetland ecosystem in the warm temperate zone of china belonging to the warm temperate zone semi humid continental monsoon climate zone the annual average temperature in this area is 11 7 12 6 c the extreme maximum temperature is 41 9 c and the extreme minimum temperature is 23 3 c the average annual precipitation is 530 630 mm and the average evapotranspiration is 750 2400 mm there are 685 species of plants in the reserve of which suaeda salsa s salsa phragmites australis p australis tamarix tamarix t tamarix and apocynum venetum a venetum are dominant species cui et al 2011 in recent years large areas of native plants in the reserve such as s salsa and p australis have been replaced by s alterniflora resulting in a significant reduction in birds and benthic animals the test agent in the experiment is 25 w imazapyr aqueous solution and its active ingredient is imazapyr table 2 c13h15n3o3 cas number 81334 34 1 which is a new broad spectrum imidazolinone herbicide imazapyr controls plant growth by inhibiting the biological synthetase of three kinds of branched chain fats amino acid valine leucine and isoleucine it has excellent herbicidal activity against sedge weeds annual and perennial monocotyledon weeds and broadleaf weeds in addition the main components of the adjuvant age 809 involved in the experiment are lecithin 50 and the main components of age 852 is established rapeseed oil 45 7 the main function of the adjuvant is to increase the adhesion of the main agent and prolong the contact time of the agent in june 2021 a 1 hectare study area was set up in the reserve where the s alterniflora community was in the growth stage in this area nine large quadrats 120 m2 were set based on the experiment purpose and sufficient spacing is set between the plots each large quadrat was further divided into three parallel quadrats totally 27 parallel quadrats nine large quadrats were treated with nine agents 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 l acre 25 imazapyr nine large quadrats were treated with nine agents three dose gradients of 3 0 6 0 and 9 0 l acre 25 imazapyr mixtures of 6 0 l acre 25 imazapyr with 1 3 2 5 and 5 2 l acre age 809 adjuvant a and mixtures of 6 0 l acre 25 imazapyr with 1 3 2 5 and 5 2 l acre age 852 adjuvant b respectively table 3 the survey frequency was before spraying and on the 15th 30th and 60th days after spraying d15 d30 d60 the frequency of soil and plant sample collection was before spraying d0 and on the 1st 6th 30th and 60th days after spraying d1 d6 d30 d60 and on site measurement of soil moisture content and electrical conductivity was carried out at the same time the collection frequency of pesticide residue samples water soil plants was increased by d3 the third day after drug administration on this basis sample collection the growth of mangrove plants in the quadrat was observed with the observation method and three plot boxes with an area of 50 50 cm2 were randomly set in each parallel quadrat to record the number of s alterniflora the aboveground biomass was investigated by the absolute value method the plant samples were randomly collected from several plant leaves in the quadrat and stored at 20 c for the residual amount of imazapyr to be tested the water samples were directly collected in wide mouth bottles and one part of them was left to stand for the determination of the indicators and the other part was stored in a 20 c environment to be tested for the residual amount of imazapyr soil samples were randomly collected from 0 to 20 cm of soil in each parallel quadrat and the soil collected from the three parallel quadrats for each treatment was finally mixed into one sample after removing impurities such as roots and stones all soil samples were divided into two parts one part was stored at 20 c for the determination of imazapyr residues and the remaining part was used to determine other physicochemical properties for benthic samples one sampling point quantitative point was randomly selected in each parallel quadrat and a 30 cm 30 cm quantitative sample frame was used for collection and the sampling depth was 40 cm 1 3 of the bottom mud collected from each parallel quadrat was mixed into one sample from each quadrat and the collected mud samples were sieved with a 60 mesh copper sieve data analysis imazapyr residues in samples were determined according to gb t 27860 2011 and the high efficiency liquid chromatography method respectively the soil moisture content vwc and electrical conductivity ec were directly measured by a soil recorder rs trrec n01 1 renke shandong china on site tc was determined using a toc

spectrophotosis method referring to hj634 2012 the ammonium nitrogen nh3 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n contents were respectively determined using the kcl dip double wavelength uv color comparison method and kcl dip indigo phenolic color comparison method data analysis the control rate of imazapyr was used to characterize the control efficiency of imazapyr which was characterized by the number of dead plants of s alterniflora per unit area the plant control rate can be expressed as w d n n 0 n n 0 100 in the formula wdn represents the control rate of plants on the no th day after treatment n0 represents the average number of s alterniflora in the control area outside the plot and n represents the average number of s alterniflora in the treatment areas with different doses one way analysis of variance spearman correlation analysis spss software and corrheatmap package r software were used to analyze the significant differences and correlations between plant characteristics imazapyr residues and physicochemical properties under different treatments and to further explore the effect mechanism of different doses of imazapyr on s alterniflora and yellow river delta wetland results effect of imazaypr on s alterniflora as shown in table 3 60 days after spraying only plot ia 3 0 l acre without adjuvant showed relatively lower removal rates while the difference between ib 6 0 l acre without adjuvant and ic 9 0 l acre without adjuvant are insignificant and the removal rates are higher than 90 table 3 besides the effects of age809 and age825 are almost the same and the concentration of adjuvants higher than 2 5 l acer increases the removal rates by about 5 and the difference between 2 5 l acer and 5 0 l acer are insignificant statistically p 0 05 however higher concentration of adjuvants faster the pesticide effect for groups with 5 2 l acer adjuvants iac and ibc over 92 s alterniflora died out in 30 days by which only about 83 of individuals died in other groups with lower concentrations of adjuvants residues of imazapyr as shown in fig 2 in groups without adjuvant the half lives of the imazapyr in plant water as well as soil samples were far 30 days while it was about 30 days in adjuvant groups p 0 05 the residues of imazapyr in soil on days 30 and 60 showed that ia and ib were significantly lower than those in other samples plant leaf residues

spartina alterniflora s alterniflora mainly distributes in mudflats where large machines and equipment such as excavators and vehicles can hardly access besides asexual reproduction capacity makes this invasive species even more resistant to physical treatment such as harvest roots and rhizome underground stems are dense with a high tiller rate thus harvest can only stop their sexual reproduction and slow down the rapid growth and spreading but cannot eradicate them some other studies indicate that shading or flooding is efficient way to remove and eradicate s alterniflora by stopping photosynthesis and respiration but the cost is extremely high because of the sheer magnitude of the distribution area chongming national reserve in shanghai east china started their s alterniflora removal project in 2006 and the building of dams for flooding and supporting works cost more than 185 7 million dollars within a decade for 6000 acre invasive area and they still have a long way to go for eradicating them all xie et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 due to the low cost performance and unsatisfactory effects of physical treatments chemicals especially herbicides have drawn more research attention in recent years however in habitats of s alterniflora tides and current impulses give little time for absorption kim et al 2017 and thus most herbicides can hardly kill 65 of individuals kettenring and adams 2011 the first attempt at imazapyr was on the west coast of the us in 2001 and the removal rate was about 70 kim 2002 in the current study samples in the first six days after spraying gave no feedback indicating a slow effect of imazapyr while the removal rates here in the yellow river delta are much higher than in the us kettenring and adams 2011 different tidal conditions such as frequency tidal ranges and inundation duration are the critical influence of the effect low concentrations with short absorption time due to lack of adjuvants and tides cannot kill seeds and rhizome in the soil thus in those samples the numbers of living individuals on the d60 are even higher than the number on the d30 lacking adhesive agents and low concentration together limited the effect and after 30 days the tiller rate was higher than the death rate for high concentration groups no less than 6 0 l acre the eradicate rates are above 90 after 60 days a concentration of 6 0 l acre with 2 6 l acre of adjuvants can be even higher than 95 another advantage of imazapyr is the low costs costs of the medicament 6 0 l acre is about 4000 4400 us dollars per acre and we can use uav to spray where vehicles can hardly access and the labor cost of spaying and management in the following 3 4 years would not higher than 1000 us dollars per acre zhao et al 2020 while the physical treatment project chongming national reserve as an example the costs is about 185 7 million us dollars for 6000 acre which is about 3 0950 us dollars per acre the imazapyr only costs 1 6 of the physical projects and about 1 3 1 4 time influence of imazapyr on soil and water insecticide residue is a key indicator to evaluate its risk the residual concentration of pharmaceuticals was significantly higher in plant leaves than in water and soil after 60 days imazapyr has a duration of efficacy after being absorbed by plants imazapyr degrades rapidly in fields especially in water and the half life is only 2 3 days thus the residues of imazapyr in water and soil are extremely low and could be undetectable however the addition of adjuvant prolonged the degradation process of imazapyr which suggest the avoidance of high concentration or large dose of adjuvant referring to the united states environmental protection agency usepa table s2 25 imazapyr residual are non toxic to mammals birds fish as well as both freshwater and marine invertebrates epa 2004 and it is also low toxicity to earthworms and other soil biots which indicate the risk of imazapyr residual in our study is acceptable in addition we also found it is harmful for bombyx bombyx mori ld50 c 920 mg a i l with rq 1 49 while the use of imazapyr is narrowed in the coastal wetlands where is not the niche of the speceis besides the results from usepa are based on the chronic reference dose rfd and the dose they used is 2 5 mg kg b w day it is much denser than the 25 imazapyr residue in the soil and water after 60 days in the current study tc toc tn tp and ap were not significantly different among groups which indicates the effect of 25 imazapyr on soil s physical and chemical properties did not changes as concentrations significantly within the application dose range adopted in our current study would not cause any risk or even obvious changes in the soil besides imazapyr nigher affect water quality because of its short degradation time in water bodies however we did observe a decrease of salinity no3 n toc and an increase of tp in soil for several days after spraying the effect of the residual in water was transient and the content of imazapyr was high for a short time after spraying some of the residual diffused into the soil and caused further affection in the soil the imazapyr in the soil directly increases the c n and nitrate nitrogen content longenecker 1960 luo et al 2021 which affects the mineralization of phosphorus by soil microorganisms and increases the content of soil tp as well as ap in addition imazapyr is in the anionic form carboxylic acid ionization in alkaline environments which increases soil ph gianelli et al 2014 wepplo et al 1991 this hinders the mineralization of c n and p by microorganisms and a large amount of soil ammonium nitrogen converted to ammonia meanwhile the increase in ph will promote the uptake of ammonium nitrogen by plants and the accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the soil influence of imazapyr on benthonic animals benthonic animal is an important community of coastal wetland ecosystems and is sensitive to environmental changes its response to changes in water and sediment quality caused by water flow and human activities is considered as indicators of wetland health status borja et al 2000 peng et al 2013 population dynamics are also used to evaluate the environmental impact of herbicides ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b shimeta et al 2016 in our field study no mortality occurred after the application of chemicals and the total number of benthic species increased after two months which was three times greater than before the application kim 2016 the presence of a large number of crab holes and periophthalmus cantonensis in the post tidal survey indicates imazapyr was not toxic to benthic organisms which was consistent with the findings of foreign studies the correlation results showed that both benthonic species and abundance were negatively affected by the density of spartina alterniflora with the increase of time most of the s alterniflora were washed away by the tide after they died the ecological niche on the beach was vacated creating food and ample habitat for crabs and p cantonensis in addition plant litter and root exudes control the condition of the soil environment marschner and rengel 2007 the root exudes of s alterniflora was altered and some plants wilted into the soil during the pharmacological effect this led to changes in soil characteristics which further significantly affected the survival pattern of benthic animals mccary et al 2016 perez castro et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the comparison between before and after spraying illustrates that s alterniflora seriously hinders the survival of benthic animals especially macrobenthos such as crabs and p cantonensis imazapyr was effective in short term control of s alterniflora promoting benthic animals growth for long term impacts the us environment agency epa 2004 kettenring and adams and kim kettenring and adams 2011 kim 2003 kim 2016 have studied the effect of imazapyr on s alterniflora prevention and control and environmental risk assessment for more than ten years in their annual regular monitoring and assessment the environmental risks of imazapyr and the risks to local organisms were far lower than the risk level and no toxic impact has occurred considering that the environmental factors conditions of hydrology topography and climate of the estuarine and coastal wetlands in the united states are different from those in china which may cause different assessment results therefore the long term impact of imazapyr on estuarine and coastal wetland ecosystems in china needs to be further observed imazapyr disperses rapidly when it falls into the water due to the effects of tidal hydrodynamic forces in estuaries and coastal wetlands and its half life is only 1 2 days allowing for rapid photolysis therefore it is predicted that imazapyr is difficult to cause enrichment impact on aquatic organisms in the study area the decomposition rate of imazapyr in soil is lower than that in water the decomposition rate of imazapyr in soil is lower than that in water however in the whole treatment period imazapyr only needs to be sprayed 1 3 times according to the site conditions and its accumulation in the soil will not exceed three times the residual amount of the short term test at three times the residue it is still well below the value of the risk another issue we are facing is that areas where invasive species have been successfully managed face severe re invasion challenges with invasive species spreading much faster than native species kim 2003 kim et al 2017 the ecology of s alterniflora was an extremely fragile ecosystem after vacating and was vulnerable to disturbance by invasive species climate and hydrological changes the restoration of native or desirable vegetation needs to be accelerated artificially therefore measures for revegetation should be implemented after the successful treatment of s alterniflora with imazapyr herbivorous crabs such as sesarmidae and small mammals have been proved to enhance the resistance and resilience of mangroves and salt marshes to the invasion of s alterniflora giddins et al 1986 ning et al 2021a ning et al 2021b so as to block the re invasion of s alterniflora and restore the degraded mangrove wetlands therefore appropriate local mangrove plant species should be planted quickly after s alterniflora is removed from mangrove wetlands and an environment suitable for the growth and reproduction of herbivorous crabs and small mammals should be created to increase their number chongming district of shanghai has launched a series of ecological restoration projects based on the creation of the national forest city and wetland city huang et al 2022 by restoring the original vegetation and benthos communities in the yangtze river estuary to further create a good ecological environment so as to provide a relatively stable food source and a suitable habitat environment for migratory birds and attract birds to choose chongming to settle inhabit and breed conclusions in current study the short term environmental risks were consistent with those in the united states both low and more effective in removing s alterniflora than those in the united states after spraying 25 imazapyr on s alterniflora for 60 days the control rate of all the plots with the main agent dose greater than 3 0 l acre reached more than 90 and the highest was 96 98 this method is superior to the physical treatment method in terms of technology cost time consuming and environmental protection the control rate of plant number increased with the increase of adjuvant concentration both imazapyr itself and its residues are of low risk and the soil physicochemical properties change significantly at the stage of relatively large pesticide residues the species of benthos increased after 60 days and the total number of benthic organisms was more than three times that before spraying the herbicide which was significantly related to the plant density and soil physicochemical properties of s alterniflora this study can provide a scientific basis for the relevant departments to formulate policies related to the control of s alterniflor and provide a theoretical basis data support and technical support for the control of s alterniflor by herbicides in coastal
