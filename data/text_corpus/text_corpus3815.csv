19075,chloroethenes belong to the most widely distributed groundwater contaminants since 2014 it has been known that trichloroethene tce can be degraded aerobically and metabolically as growth substrate by a mixed bacterial enrichment culture named sf culture in this study the degradation capabilities under a range of field relevant conditions were investigated in fixed bed reactors as well as in batch experiments aerobic metabolic tce degradation was stable over the long term with degradation optima at 22 c and ph 7 degradation of up to 400 μm tce was observed the longest starvation period after which degradation of tce was regained was 112 days the possible co contaminants perchloroethene trans 1 2 dichloroethene and cis 1 2 dichloroethene did not inhibit tce degradation even though they were not degraded themselves the presence of equimolar amounts of 1 1 dichloroethene and vinyl chloride inhibited tce degradation experiments with groundwater from different chloroethene contaminated field sites proved the potential of the sf culture for bioaugmentation thus aerobic metabolic tce degradation should be considered as a promising method for the bioremediation of field sites with tce as the main contaminant graphical abstract image 1 keywords trichloroethene aerobic metabolic biodegradation field conditions bioaugmentation bioremediation 1 introduction chloroethenes belong to the most widely distributed groundwater contaminants conrad et al 2010 because of their toxic and carcinogenic properties perchloroethene pce trichloroethene tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and vinyl chloride vc are on the united states priority list of hazardous substances atsdr 2017 anaerobic and aerobic microbial degradation play an important role in the fate of chloroethenes in the environment mattes et al 2010 bradley 2003 and biodegradation has proved to be a suitable method for the bioremediation of chlorinated ethene contaminated sites tiehm and schmidt 2011 in the last decades field applications have rather focused on anaerobic reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes under favorable site conditions the primary contaminants pce and tce are transformed by specific microorganisms under strictly anaerobic conditions via the metabolites cdce and vc to ethene through halorespiration tiehm and schmidt 2011 stimulation of reductive dechlorination is often achieved by injecting auxiliary organic substrates in excess competing microbial processes i e methanogenesis or sulphate reduction then can lead to detrimental changes in groundwater quality tiehm and schmidt 2011 conrad et al 2010 bennett et al 2007 since higher chlorinated ethenes show a higher tendency to undergo reductive dechlorination accumulation of cdce and vc often occurs at pce or tce contaminated field sites these lower chlorinated ethenes show a higher tendency to be biodegraded under aerobic conditions bradley 2003 in spite of some rare reports about aerobic degradation of pce ryoo et al 2000 only tce and lower chlorinated ethenes are regarded to be degradable under aerobic conditions mattes et al 2010 aerobic biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes can proceed metabolically and co metabolically during co metabolic degradation the chloroethenes are degraded fortuitously by enzymes induced by the bacterial growth substrate also referred to as auxiliary substrate commonly used auxiliary substrates are ammonium methane toluene phenol and ethene le and coleman 2011 sayavedra soto et al 2010 barth et al 2002 saeki et al 1999 mars et al 1998 tiehm et al 2008 have also shown that vc can serve as auxiliary substrate for the degradation of cdce aerobic metabolic degradation has several advantages over reductive dechlorination or aerobic co metabolic degradation no auxiliary substrates are needed and therefore all of the available oxygen can be used directly for biodegradation purposes tiehm and schmidt 2011 schmidt et al 2014 have demonstrated the aerobic metabolic degradation of tce by a mixed bacterial enrichment culture sf culture stoichiometric chloride formation bacterial growth as well as significant stable carbon isotope fractionation were shown after our knowledge our study is the only one so far proving aerobic metabolic degradation of tce gafni et al 2018 weatherill et al 2018 to evaluate the potential of aerobic metabolic tce degradation for in situ application with bioremediation bioaugmentation approaches it is of major interest to know the robustness of the chloroethene degrading bacterial cultures under varying field conditions zhao et al 2011 giddings et al 2010 fathepure et al 2005 this study shows the field applicability of the sf culture for bioremediation and bioaugmentation long term aerobic metabolic degradation of tce is shown in fixed bed reactors for the first time furthermore batch studies were performed to determine the robustness of the degradation process under varying incubation conditions as well as its performance in groundwater samples from different field sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial culture the mixed bacterial sf culture aerobically metabolically degrading tce was enriched from groundwater samples from a chloroethene contaminated field site sf in the south of germany and maintained in mineral salts medium msm free from any known auxiliary substrate as described in schmidt et al 2014 trichloroethene was the sole source of organic carbon the sf culture regularly degrades tce below the detection limit of 1 μg l 2 2 chemicals chloroethenes were used as received pce 99 9 fluka steinheim germany tce 99 9 fluka cdce 97 sigma aldrich st louis usa trans 1 2 dichloroethene tdce 95 fluka 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1dce 99 9 fluka and vc 99 97 linde stuttgart germany 2 3 analytical methods chloroethenes and ethene were measured by gas chromatography with an ecd electron capture detector and an fid flame ionization detector using a 7890a gc system by agilent technologies waldbronn germany with a g1888 network headspace sampler analysis was conducted as previously described tiehm et al 2008 chloroethenes were measured in the aqueous phase and represent the average of duplicate measurements chloride concentrations were measured using a metrohm 761 compact ion chromatograph filderstadt germany with a conductivity detector and a metrosepa supp 5 column as previously reported zhao et al 2010 measurements of the 13c 12c ratios δ 13c values of tce via gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry were performed as previously described tiehm et al 2008 schmidt et al 2010 2 4 degradation studies in batch experiments experiments were conducted in 0 12 0 25 or 1 l laboratory glass bottles equipped with a small opening with teflon coated septa minimizing loss of chloroethenes by sorption after sampling with sterile stainless steel needles and glass syringes the septa were replaced immediately either the msm mentioned above or groundwater samples were used if not stated otherwise inoculation took place using actively degrading sf culture 10 liquid volume table 1 provides an overview of the tested incubation conditions except for the experiment on the culture s specific temperature range batch assays were incubated at room temperature 23 c the batch assays were handled under ambient air allowing oxygen entry into the bottles abiotic controls were inhibited by 1 g l nan3 or 2 g l cuso4 2 5 immobilization in fixed bed reactors a borosilicate column with a length of 22 cm and an inside diameter of 3 5 cm 212 ml volume was filled with sterile silica sand porosity 0 26 subsequently tce degrading organisms were immobilized on the sand by recirculation of the tce degrading sf culture circulating column refer to fig si 1 for a set up scheme oxygen was supplied by a headspace of ambient air in the reservoir containing tce spiked msm spiking of the tce resulted in initial concentrations of 27 127 μm tce degradation of tce and chloride formation were regularly measured allowing tce spiking soon after its degradation the immobilized culture degraded tce continuously over 2 3 years at a flow rate of 3 5 l d fig si 2 a decrease of ph occurred along with tce degradation causing a decrease of the degradation rate thus at ph values below 6 5 the msm in the reservoir was replaced after immobilization was proven by a stop flow experiment on day 164 the sand with immobilized bacteria was removed from the column and mixed with the same amount of new sterile sand refilling the circulating column and establishing a flow of 0 34 l d msm with dissolved tce through the column msm column refer to fig si 3 for a set up scheme inflow concentrations in the msm column were increased to up to 230 μm tce during the second operating phase during the third phase the inflow concentration was maintained between 100 and 150 μm tce at 141 days after the establishment of the msm column sand was again removed from the circulating column to establish a third column which was run as flow through column with tce maximum 100 μm spiked groundwater at a flow rate of 0 33 l d groundwater column refer to fig si 3 for a set up scheme groundwater was sampled from the chloroethene contaminated field site sf in the south of germany the origin of the sf culture schmidt et al 2014 due to a decreased degradation rate after 3 months the flow rate and the tce concentration were reduced to 0 27 l d and values between 33 and 69 μm respectively furthermore inorganic nutrients phosphate stock solution of 2 60 g kh2po4 and 11 85 g k2hpo4 3h2o in 50 ml demineralized water 0 1 ml per liter groundwater dosed and 1 ml l trace element solution after schmidt et al 2014 were added during the second phase in a third phase groundwater from a well of the field site sf containing pce as co contaminant was used supplementation with inorganic nutrients was continued 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerobic metabolic tce degradation under different environmental conditions aerobic tce degradation was observed with up to 400 μm tce 53 mg l fig si 4 while no degradation took place at concentrations of 500 and 1000 μm data not shown in comparison with other aerobic metabolically chloroethene degrading cultures vc up to 7300 μm 460 mg l verce et al 2000 and cdce up to 1100 μm 100 mg l schmidt et al 2010 can be degraded in higher concentrations than tce publications on co metabolic degradation report for example 150 μm 20 mg l tce as not degradable auxiliary substrate phenol chen et al 2007 or concentrations beyond 400 μm 53 mg l as inhibiting the degrading bacteria auxiliary substrate toluene yeager et al 2001 the original groundwater microcosms from field site sf degraded tce cdce and vc schmidt et al 2014 degradation of tce did not occur before vc biodegradation was completed schmidt et al 2014 after more than 4 years of enrichment with msm and tce as sole source of organic carbon the sf culture could only degrade tce all other chloroethenes were not degraded fig si 5 degradation of tce was observed in the presence of equimolar concentrations of pce tdce and cdce whereas the presence of vc and 1 1 dce inhibited tce degradation fig si 5 also for aerobic degradation of 1 4 dioxane 1 1 dce was shown to be a strong inhibitor zhang et al 2016 inhibiting interactions regarding chloroethene degradation within mixed contamination have also been described for the aerobic degradation of cdce equimolar concentrations of tce and 1 1 dce inhibited the degradation of cdce whereas the presence of pce tdce and vc slowed down cdce degradation higher concentrations of vc exerted a higher inhibition of cdce degradation zhao et al 2010 on the other hand vc degradation was hardly affected by equimolar concentrations of the other chloroethenes and increasing cdce concentrations zhao et al 2011 thus this matter has to be taken into account in the field application of aerobic chloroethene biodegradation yoshikawa et al 2017 experiments with incubation temperatures between 4 and 35 c with the sf culture in msm showed tce degradation only at room temperature 23 c data not shown repetition of the experiment with fresh groundwater samples from field site sf again showed degradation only at room temperature 23 c data not shown to prove that aerobic tce degradation is also possible under common groundwater temperatures the incubation temperature was increased and decreased in 2 c steps thereby degradation of tce was observed at temperatures up to 27 c and down to 7 c fig si 6 at these temperatures degradation was slower than at 22 c no degradation was observed at 29 and 5 c even with prolonged incubation periods other authors have also found temperature optima above groundwater temperature for different chloroethene degrading cultures for example schmidt et al 2010 reported aerobic degradation of cdce between 4 und 23 c with an optimum at 23 c no degradation was observed at 35 c similarly coleman et al 2002a reported no degradation at 30 c most studies on metabolic vc degradation were conducted at 20 24 c moran and hickey 1997 showed that co metabolic tce degradation with ammonium or methane was proceeding at groundwater temperature 12 c albeit with a better degradation efficiency at 24 c degradation of tce by the sf culture was active at ph 5 6 and 7 with the highest degradation rate at ph 7 fig si 7 degradation at ph 5 started with no observable lag period but slowed down during the test period this result is in agreement with most available studies on metabolic cdce and vc degradation e g verce et al 2000 coleman et al 2002a and b singh et al 2004 schmidt et al 2010 for the co metabolic tce degrading methanotroph methylocystis sp strain m a ph optimum of 6 7 has been reported saeki et al 1999 degradation of tce could be regained even after starvation periods of up to 16 weeks 112 days but not after longer starvation data not shown for vc degrading bacteria starvation periods of 150 days without loss of degradation capability singh et al 2004 down to 1 day with complete loss of degradation activity have been reported coleman et al 2002b the cdce degrading ft culture withstood starvation periods of up to 250 days schmidt et al 2010 3 2 aerobic tce degradation in fixed bed reactors trichloroethene degradation in fixed bed reactors could be shown for experimental periods of 673 days and 532 days in msm and groundwater respectively in the first operating phase with 50 μm tce the msm column showed a stable tce degradation down to the quantification limit 1 μg l fig 1 a in the second phase tce feed was continuously increased up to 230 μm tce this tce concentration was not degraded completely due to oxygen limitations in the third phase the tce inflow concentration was constantly around 120 μm the measured chloride formation corresponded to tce degradation fig 1 b the fixed bed reactor operated with groundwater also showed long term aerobic tce degradation fig 2 a after the adaptation phase degradation rates were lower than in the system operated with msm table 2 in the first operational phase degradation proceeded well in phase 2 degradation recovered after the volume flow and the tce concentration were reduced and inorganic nutrients were dosed indicating that tce degradation was limited by nutrient availability to a certain extent in phases 1 and 2 the measured chloride release was occasionally below the stoichiometric expected value but with an averaged 12 difference within the measuring error fig 2 b in the third phase data not shown for clarity reasons with pce containing groundwater tce degradation performance was slightly lower than in phase 2 the pce was not degraded during the column experiment in phase 3 no chloride release could be measured because of the high background chloride concentration of the groundwater used degradation rates varied for the different phases of reactor operation thus the mean and maximum degradation rates are listed in table 2 for the different phases due to the mostly closed chloride balance the degradation rates equal the mineralization rates in this study expressed as mg tce degraded mineralized per l of reactor volume and day studies on metabolic tce degradation in fixed bed reactors have not been published before thus rates for co metabolic degradation are used for comparison furthermore the rates published are obtained from very diverse experimental set ups concerning reactor design and operation modes limiting meaningful comparison nevertheless the range of rates obtained in this study corresponds to the values published by sun and wood in 1997 who reported degradation rates between 8 6 and 390 mg l d and mineralization rates between 6 9 and 10 mg l d for a fixed film bioreactor containing a mutant strain of burkholderia cepacia g4 constitutively expressing toluene ortho monooxygenase as tce degrading enzyme overall the fixed bed reactors showed that the tce degrading enrichment culture is stable against varying tce concentrations and pce as co contaminant and shows a good degradation capability in long term experiments 3 3 bioaugmentation potential of aerobic metabolic tce degradation through inoculation with sf culture aerobic degradation of tce was achieved in groundwater samples from field sites a and b which had no intrinsic degradation capability for tce fig 3 bioaugmented groundwater from field site a showed tce degradation within 50 days whereas over 150 days were needed for tce degradation within bioaugmented groundwater from field site b additional bioaugmentation in groundwater from the field site sf where the sf culture was derived from schmidt et al 2014 led to faster degradation than in non inoculated groundwater thus the sf culture is suitable for bioaugmentation approaches stable carbon isotope fractionation was observed during tce degradation with enrichment factors ranging from ε 12 3 1 2 to ε 14 7 0 5 fig 3 in the non degrading assays a and b the stable carbon isotope composition of tce remained unchanged data not shown the extent of isotope fractionation was in the same order of magnitude than during cultivation of the sf culture in msm yielding an enrichment factor of ε 11 4 0 4 schmidt et al 2014 further indicating that the observed biodegradation of tce was caused by the bioaugmented sf culture recently published enrichment factors for aerobic cometabolic tce degradation ranged from 4 2 to 11 5 for different bacterial strains gafni et al 2018 bioaugmentation is a useful remediation approach if microorganisms with the required degradation capabilities are lacking at a specific field site semprini 2013 again due to the novelty of metabolic tce degradation only data for co metabolic degradation of tce is available so far successful field application for co metabolic tce degradation has been reported by steffan et al 1999 for the toluene ortho monooxygenase expressing burkholderia cepacia env435 by duba et al 1996 for methanotrophic bacteria and by nelson et al 1990 for the at that time called pseudomonas cepacia strain g4 co metabolically degrading phenol and toluene furthermore metabolic degradation offers the advantage of higher efficiency since bioremediation does not depend on the availability of auxiliary substrates and thus the entire amount of oxygen is available for the intended pollutant degradation 4 conclusions the results table 3 show that aerobic metabolic tce degradation is stable in the long term and under a wide range of incubation conditions mixed contaminations at field sites have to be taken into account since equimolar concentrations of the possible co contaminants 1 1 dce and vc inhibited tce degradation whereas tce degradation was not affected by the presence of pce tdce and cdce the following conclusions are drawn in view of the field application of aerobic metabolic tce degradation aerobic metabolic degradation of tce is promising for the biological remediation of tce and should be kept in mind when evaluating the fate of chloroethenes at contaminated sites the tce degrading sf culture can be used as bioaugmentation agent stable carbon isotope fractionation can serve as a monitoring tool at field sites to further prove the potential of aerobic metabolic tce degradation for

comparison with other aerobic metabolically chloroethene degrading cultures vc up to 7300 μm 460 mg l verce et al 2000 and cdce up to 1100 μm 100 mg l schmidt et al 2010 can be degraded in higher concentrations than tce publications on co metabolic degradation report for example 150 μm 20 mg l tce as not degradable auxiliary substrate phenol chen et al 2007 or concentrations beyond 400 μm 53 mg l as inhibiting the degrading bacteria auxiliary substrate toluene yeager et al 2001 the original groundwater microcosms from field site sf degraded tce cdce and vc schmidt et al 2014 degradation of tce did not occur before vc biodegradation was completed schmidt et al 2014 after more than 4 years of enrichment with msm and tce as sole source of organic carbon the sf culture could only degrade tce all other chloroethenes were not degraded fig si 5 degradation of tce was observed in the presence of equimolar concentrations of pce tdce and cdce whereas the presence of vc and 1 1 dce inhibited tce degradation fig si 5 also for aerobic degradation of 1 4 dioxane 1 1 dce was shown to be a strong inhibitor zhang et al 2016 inhibiting interactions regarding chloroethene degradation within mixed contamination have also been described for the aerobic degradation of cdce equimolar concentrations of tce and 1 1 dce inhibited the degradation of cdce whereas the presence of pce tdce and vc slowed down cdce degradation higher concentrations of vc exerted a higher inhibition of cdce degradation zhao et al 2010 on the other hand vc degradation was hardly affected by equimolar concentrations of the other chloroethenes and increasing cdce concentrations zhao et al 2011 thus this matter has to be taken into account in the field application of aerobic chloroethene biodegradation yoshikawa et al 2017 experiments with incubation temperatures between 4 and 35 c with the sf culture in msm showed tce degradation only at room temperature 23 c data not shown repetition of the experiment with fresh groundwater samples from field site sf again showed degradation only at room temperature 23 c data not shown to prove that aerobic tce degradation is also possible under common groundwater temperatures the incubation temperature was increased and decreased in 2 c steps thereby degradation of tce was observed at temperatures up to 27 c and down to 7 c fig si 6 at these temperatures degradation was slower than at 22 c no degradation was observed at 29 and 5 c even with prolonged incubation periods other authors have also found temperature optima above groundwater temperature for different chloroethene degrading cultures for example schmidt et al 2010 reported aerobic degradation of cdce between 4 und 23 c with an optimum at 23 c no degradation was observed at 35 c similarly coleman et al 2002a reported no degradation at 30 c most studies on metabolic vc degradation were conducted at 20 24 c moran and hickey 1997 showed that co metabolic tce degradation with ammonium or methane was proceeding at groundwater temperature 12 c albeit with a better degradation efficiency at 24 c degradation of tce by the sf culture was active at ph 5 6 and 7 with the highest degradation rate at ph 7 fig si 7 degradation at ph 5 started with no observable lag period but slowed down during the test period this result is in agreement with most available studies on metabolic cdce and vc degradation e g verce et al 2000 coleman et al 2002a and b singh et al 2004 schmidt et al 2010 for the co metabolic tce degrading methanotroph methylocystis sp strain m a ph optimum of 6 7 has been reported saeki et al 1999 degradation of tce could be regained even after starvation periods of up to 16 weeks 112 days but not after longer starvation data not shown for vc degrading bacteria starvation periods of 150 days without loss of degradation capability singh et al 2004 down to 1 day with complete loss of degradation activity have been reported coleman et al 2002b the cdce degrading ft culture withstood starvation periods of up to 250 days schmidt et al 2010 3 2 aerobic tce degradation in fixed bed reactors trichloroethene degradation in fixed bed reactors could be shown for experimental periods of 673 days and 532 days in msm and groundwater respectively in the first operating phase with 50 μm tce the msm column showed a stable tce degradation down to the quantification limit 1 μg l fig 1 a in the second phase tce feed was continuously increased up to 230 μm tce this tce concentration was not degraded completely due to oxygen limitations in the third phase the tce inflow concentration was constantly around 120 μm the measured chloride formation corresponded to tce degradation fig 1 b the fixed bed reactor operated with groundwater also showed long term aerobic tce degradation fig 2 a after the adaptation phase degradation rates were lower than in the system operated with msm table 2 in the first operational phase degradation proceeded well in phase 2 degradation recovered after the volume flow and the tce concentration were reduced and inorganic nutrients were dosed indicating that tce degradation was limited by nutrient availability to a certain extent in phases 1 and 2 the measured chloride release was occasionally below the stoichiometric expected value but with an averaged 12 difference within the measuring error fig 2 b in the third phase data not shown for clarity reasons with pce containing groundwater tce degradation performance was slightly lower than in phase 2 the pce was not degraded during the column experiment in phase 3 no chloride release could be measured because of the high background chloride concentration of the groundwater used degradation rates varied for the different phases of reactor operation thus the mean and maximum degradation rates are listed in table 2 for the different phases due to the mostly closed chloride balance the degradation rates equal the mineralization rates in this study expressed as mg tce degraded mineralized per l of reactor volume and day studies on metabolic tce degradation in fixed bed reactors have not been published before thus rates for co metabolic degradation are used for comparison furthermore the rates published are obtained from very diverse experimental set ups concerning reactor design and operation modes limiting meaningful comparison nevertheless the range of rates obtained in this study corresponds to the values published by sun and wood in 1997 who reported degradation rates between 8 6 and 390 mg l d and mineralization rates between 6 9 and 10 mg l d for a fixed film bioreactor containing a mutant strain of burkholderia cepacia g4 constitutively expressing toluene ortho monooxygenase as tce degrading enzyme overall the fixed bed reactors showed that the tce degrading enrichment culture is stable against varying tce concentrations and pce as co contaminant and shows a good degradation capability in long term experiments 3 3 bioaugmentation potential of aerobic metabolic tce degradation through inoculation with sf culture aerobic degradation of tce was achieved in groundwater samples from field sites a and b which had no intrinsic degradation capability for tce fig 3 bioaugmented groundwater from field site a showed tce degradation within 50 days whereas over 150 days were needed for tce degradation within bioaugmented groundwater from field site b additional bioaugmentation in groundwater from the field site sf where the sf culture was derived from schmidt et al 2014 led to faster degradation than in non inoculated groundwater thus the sf culture is suitable for bioaugmentation approaches stable carbon isotope fractionation was observed during tce degradation with enrichment factors ranging from ε 12 3 1 2 to ε 14 7 0 5 fig 3 in the non degrading assays a and b the stable carbon isotope composition of tce remained unchanged data not shown the extent of isotope fractionation was in the same order of magnitude than during cultivation of the sf culture in msm yielding an enrichment factor of ε 11 4 0 4 schmidt et al 2014 further indicating that the observed biodegradation of tce was caused by the bioaugmented sf culture recently published enrichment factors for aerobic cometabolic tce degradation ranged from 4 2 to 11 5 for different bacterial strains gafni et al 2018 bioaugmentation is a useful remediation approach if microorganisms with the required degradation capabilities are lacking at a specific field site semprini 2013 again due to the novelty of metabolic tce degradation only data for co metabolic degradation of tce is available so far successful field application for co metabolic tce degradation has been reported by steffan et al 1999 for the toluene ortho monooxygenase expressing burkholderia cepacia env435 by duba et al 1996 for methanotrophic bacteria and by nelson et al 1990 for the at that time called pseudomonas cepacia strain g4 co metabolically degrading phenol and toluene furthermore metabolic degradation offers the advantage of higher efficiency since bioremediation does not depend on the availability of auxiliary substrates and thus the entire amount of oxygen is available for the intended pollutant degradation 4 conclusions the results table 3 show that aerobic metabolic tce degradation is stable in the long term and under a wide range of incubation conditions mixed contaminations at field sites have to be taken into account since equimolar concentrations of the possible co contaminants 1 1 dce and vc inhibited tce degradation whereas tce degradation was not affected by the presence of pce tdce and cdce the following conclusions are drawn in view of the field application of aerobic metabolic tce degradation aerobic metabolic degradation of tce is promising for the biological remediation of tce and should be kept in mind when evaluating the fate of chloroethenes at contaminated sites the tce degrading sf culture can be used as bioaugmentation agent stable carbon isotope fractionation can serve as a monitoring tool at field sites to further prove the potential of aerobic metabolic tce degradation for field remediation field studies e g enhanced natural attenuation with oxygen stimulation should be conducted 5 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

19076,the present study assessed the efficiency of utilizing mixed culture bacteria mcb incorporated with individual nanoparticles nps i e hematite α fe2o3 nickel oxide nio and zinc oxide zno dual nps α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno and nio zno and multi nps α fe2o3 nio zno for hydrogen production hp from industrial wastewater containing mono ethylene glycol meg when mcb was individually supplemented with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l hp improved significantly by 41 30 and 29 respectively further key enzymes associated with meg metabolism such as alcohol dehydrogenase adh aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh and hydrogenase hyd were rapidly and substantially enhanced in the medium nio and zno nps notably promoted adh and aldh activities respectively while α fe2o3 exhibited superior impact on hyd activity maximum hydrogen production rate was concomitant with higher acetic acid production and lower residual acetaldehyde and ethanol hp using mcb supplemented with individual nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l further improved by 8 0 14 when dual and multi nps were used the highest hp was recorded when multi nps were used in addition nps incorporation resulted in substantial increase in the relative abundance of clostridiales belonging to family clostridiaceae 83 overall this study provides significant insights into the impact of nps on hydrogen production from meg contaminated wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords fermentative hydrogen generation metal nanoparticles mono ethylene glycol intermediate metabolites enzymatic activity microbial community structure 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of industrial wastewater containing biodegradable organics is considered a sustainable solution especially in countries with limited conventional fuels resources anaerobes can be used to generate hydrogen ethanol and methane from organic containing wastewater hydrogen is a highly promising biofuel owing to its clean combustion properties and is presently utilized in electric vehicles and power generation fermentative hydrogen can be harvested separately through the two phases ad process of organic wastes this process consists of a dark fermentation df phase producing hydrogen and acetic acid followed by a methane producing phase only from acetic acid biodegradation nonetheless beneficial and affordable hydrogen production hp from df is challenging owing to various limitations such as reactor designs operational conditions competitive bacterial consortia substrate compositions essential macro and micronutrients and low yields mota et al 2018 currently several techniques have been developed to optimize hp however most techniques focus on its harvesting from common organic compounds such as starch glucose sucrose and proteins presently mono ethylene glycol meg a common industrial contaminant is widely used in petrochemical industries to produce aircraft runway deicers ethylene glycol oxide engine coolants and poly ethylene terephthalate pet and for natural gas extraction elreedy et al 2017a mahmoud et al 2017 meg is globally classified as hazardous but is biodegradable and can be used for hp hassani et al 2013 several techniques have been employed for the treatment of meg containing wastewater such as direct and catalytic oxidations vacuum membrane distillation nano filtration phytoremediation biological aerobic treatment and ad process elreedy et al 2017b however maximizing the hydrogen yield hy from df of meg containing wastewater through applying the two phases ad strategy is crucial to become a significant competitor from environmental and economic points of view compared with the common one phase ad producing solely methane recently enhanced hp has been achieved by supplementing fermentative bacteria with metal nanoparticles nps mudhoo et al 2018 however it is likely that hp and enhancement mechanism depend on nps composition dosage substrate degradation pathway and associated enzymes nps have unique physical and chemical characteristics firstly metal nanoparticles such as hematite α fe2o3 nickel oxide nio and zinc oxide zno nps can release bioavailable metal ions via dissolution in water even under anaerobic biotic environments han et al 2011 mu and chen 2011 xu et al 2019 further han et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 identified that nps can gradually supply appropriate amounts of metal ions while assessing the role of trace metals on microorganism growth and activity thus the inhibitory effect of excess metal ions can be avoided the potential toxicity associated with metal ions mainly relies on their speciation and concentration elevated doses of metals can a disrupt the enzymes function and structure when binding with thiol group rsh or other functional groups deforming as well as inactivating the protein and or replace the natural metals in prosthetic groups which are coenzymes chen et al 2008 and b increase the production of reactive oxygen species ros lowering the bacterial cell viability due to the oxidative stress mu and chen 2011 former studies have also confirmed that iron nps achieved higher hp compared to iron sulfate when tested at the same dosages han et al 2011 taherdanak et al 2016 however wang et al 2016 noted considerable increment in hp when 100 mg gtss of iron oxide nps was used although no release of fe2 was observed this mechanism is based on the use of conductive mineral particles as conduits of electrons by microbes which has been described as direct interspecies electron transfer diet tian et al 2017 wang et al 2016 this hypothesis was also proposed by lin et al 2016a who found that iron oxide nps maintained more aggregates of nanowire related proteins which play a crucial role in electron transfer between cells accordingly hp was enhanced using non metallic and high electrical conductive supplements such as graphene tian et al 2017 nickel graphene nanocomposite elreedy et al 2017b magnetite graphene oxide nanocomposite mostafa et al 2016 and granular activated carbon liu et al 2012 thirdly lin et al 2016a and yu et al 2015 reported that small nps such as zno and iron oxide were able to penetrate the microbial cell membrane without causing significant disruption which was supported by transmission and scanning electron microscopy tem and sem images under such conditions potential enhancement in intracellular enzyme synthesis stability and activity is expected owing to functional ion release from nps as well as the physical as attaching surface and chemical as electron conduits uniqueness of nps mcpherson and vincent 2014 eventually the inhibitory mechanism induced by certain doses of nps during ad due to either themselves or released ions is mainly related to cell membrane penetration and disruption as discussed by yang et al 2013 iron nps are widely used as supplements to promote hp as iron constitutes the metal component in active sites and fs clusters of fe fefe and feni hydrogenase enzymes which facilitates the release of hydrogen gas han et al 2011 four common iron based nps namely fe3o4 nps magnetite α fe2o3 nps γ fe2o3 nps maghemite and zvi nps zero valent iron have been successfully applied for hp particularly hematite nps achieved higher enhancement and less toxicity compared to other forms han et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 elreedy et al 2017b reported that reactors exposed to iron based nps achieved 17 63 improvement in hp using glucose based substrates nickel represents the core structure of feni hydrogenase which is widely dispersed among bacteria mullai et al 2013 nickel nps used at lower doses compared to iron nps enhanced hp by 16 23 23 and 24 with substrates such as dairy and distillery wastewater gadhe et al 2014 2015a meg elreedy et al 2017b and glucose mullai et al 2013 respectively similarly cultures supplemented with ni ions enhanced dehydrogenase enzyme activity associated ethanol production and growth of relevant bacterial species saxena and tanner 2011 in contrast to fe and ni based nps existing research on the impact of zno nps on biological treatment processes have focused mainly on its toxicity and its potential positive impact has been less investigated nonetheless chong et al 2009 highlighted that zinc is as one of the most important elements for hp besides magnesium sodium and iron srikanth and mohan 2012 noted that hy increased by 98 when 12 mg l of zn2 was used further sarris and papanikolaou 2016 highlighted the role of zinc as a cofactor for alcohol dehydrogenase adh it acts as a catalyst during the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol by recycling nadh to nad a process that occurs in the meg metabolic pathway particularly zinc dependent adhs are the most common enzymes when thermophilic adhs are orderly classified radianingtyas and wright 2003 saxena and tanner 2011 highlighted that zn2 achieved the highest bacterial growth and ethanol production among the trace metal ions tested co2 cu2 fe2 mn2 mo6 ni2 zn2 seo4 and wo4 while previous studies investigated the impact of nps on fermentative hp to our knowledge impacts of individual and multiple amendment of nps on the hydrogen generation for the treatment of meg contaminated wastewater have not been extensively studied furthermore comprehensive analyses will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism of nps induced hp enhancement therefore this study assessed the use of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps as supplements to promote hp from meg containing wastewater the main objective of the research was to study the efficiency of mixed culture bacteria mcb incorporated with individual α fe2o3 nio and zno dual α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno nio zno and multi nps α fe2o3 nio zno the study emphasized on the influence of supplemented nps on intermediate metabolites activity of key enzymes and microbial community structures furthermore linear regression and principal components analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between relevant intermediates enzyme activities and hp 2 materials and methods 2 1 mixed culture and substrate compositions mixed culture was collected as thickened sludge from the gravity thickener in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant located in kanto area japan the ph total solids ts and volatile solids vs of the collected sludge were 6 8 0 060 26 0 33 gts l and 19 0 42 gvs l respectively resulting in an average vs ts ratio of 0 73 the harvested sludge was initially acclimatized for four months under anaerobic conditions and using meg as the sole carbon source further the sludge was pre heated at a temperature of 105 c for 30 min for three times in this study i e initial stage of acclimatization one month prior to the experiment and just before the experiment this heat pretreatment strategy as well as acclimation temperature of 50 c and ph 5 0 6 0 were recognized to suppress the methanogenesis and harvest spore forming bacteria responsible for hp o thong et al 2008 wimonsong et al 2014 the sludge acclimation was performed based on gradual changes of organic loading rate olr hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt from 4 0

scientific instruments ltd the detailed characteristics of three nanomaterials used in this study were discussed in the supplementary information figs s1 s3 2 3 experimental design two successive batch mode experiments for fermentative hp from synthetic wastewater containing meg were conducted table 1 to assess the efficiency of mcb incorporated with 1 individual nps α fe2o3 nio and zno at different doses 2 dual nps namely α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno nio zno and 3 multi nps which was α fe2o3 nio zno stock suspensions of α fe2o3 nps 0 80 g nio nps 0 20 g and zno nps 0 10 g were separately prepared in 50 ml milli q water and dispersed by ultrasonication for 1 0 h batch experiments were conducted using a series of 250 ml serum bottles with 200 ml working volume and 50 ml headspace all batches were inoculated with mcb with average vs and meg concentrations of 10 0 and 4 0 g l respectively resulting in an average substrate to biomass ratio s x of 0 50 gcod gvs this mixture was attained by centrifugation 4000 g for 5 0 min of 100 ml of concentrated mcb 20 gvs l and subsequent resuspension in substrate 4 gmeg l at a total volume of 200 ml initial ph values were adjusted to 5 5 0 070 which is optimal for hydrogen production when using meg as substrate and mixed culture as inoculum as reported earlier by elreedy et al 2018 2017a 2017b the headspaces of the batch reactors were initially purged with oxygen free nitrogen 90 n2 and 10 co2 and capped with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals to avoid air exchange wei et al 2014 the serum bottles were placed in shakers and subsequently moved to an incubator operated at 50 c duplicate tests were conducted to obtain values that represented mean standard deviation the significance of results was assessed using analysis of variance anova at a confidence level of 95 which is represented by a probability value p 0 050 2 4 data analysis the modified gompertz equation eq 1 taherdanak et al 2016 was used to model the experimental results of biohydrogen production assisted by the addition of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps individually and in combination 1 h p exp exp r m e p λ t 1 where h ml is the cumulative volumetric hydrogen production vhp at time t h p ml l is the hydrogen potential r m ml l h is the maximum hydrogen production rate e 2 7 and λ h is the lag phase period furthermore linear regression analysis and principal components analysis pca were used to describe the relationships between hp intermediate products and activities of key enzymes linear regression analysis and pca were performed using sigmaplot 10 and minitab 18 software respectively 2 5 enzymatic activity assays the activity of hydrogenase hyd alcohol dehydrogenase adh and aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh enzymes were assessed for all batches including the control the hyd activity was estimated based on the associated reduction of methylene blue mb lee et al 2009 the activities of adh and aldh enzymes were colorimetrically measured at the wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate reader spectra fluor tecan uk adh and aldh activity assay kits abnova co catalog number ka3713 and ka3742 respectively were used according to the manufacturer s protocol abnova 2018 full description regarding the three enzyme activity assays is shown in the supplementary information 2 6 analytical techniques mixed liquor and supernatant samples of 1 ml each were collected from the incubated batches at different time intervals for analyses of biomass and metabolites after filtration respectively the samples were withdrawn using needle syringes after collecting the produced gas and then the head space was adjusted to initial conditions using oxygen free nitrogen ts and vs in the sludge were analyzed according to apha 2005 meg acetic acid ethanol and acetaldehyde were measured using gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu japan equipped with stabilwax column restek and flame ionized detector fid the detector was supplied with helium hydrogen and air and operated at flow rates of 4 0 50 and 300 ml min respectively as described by carnegie and ramsay 2009 the temperatures of the injection port and detector were 230 and 250 c respectively the column oven temperature was set at 55 c for 1 0 min subsequently the temperature was increased at the rate of 20 c min with 1 0 min hold until reaching 215 c the volume of hydrogen gas for all batches was measured using the displacement method wherein alkali water 3 0 naoh w v was used to absorb co2 and h2s zhang et al 2015 besides hydrogen gas content using a displacement method was validated using gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu japan equipped with a shincarbon column restek and thermal conductivity detector tcd helium was used as the carrier gas which was provided at a flow rate of 25 ml min the temperatures of the injection port column oven and detector were 100 120 and 150 c respectively the 16s rrna gene region of bacteria and archaea was used for next generation sequencing analysis and description of the procedures is shown in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiency assessment of hydrogen production metabolism and enzyme activity using mcb individually supplemented with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps 3 1 1 α fe2o3 nps addition fig 1 a depicts the efficiency of hp from df of meg rich wastewater using mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 the results revealed that mcb supplemented with 50 mg l of α fe2o3 nps promoted hp by 20 compared to the control test furthermore the cumulative volumetric hydrogen production vhp substantially increased to 150 9 0 ml l when α fe2o3 nps dosage was increased to 200 mg l resulting in hp improvement of 41 during the meg decomposition pathway eqs 2 4 trifunović et al 2016 higher hp is associated with higher availability of protons h which is correlated to acetic acid production consistently acetic acid substantially increased from 18 1 6 to 26 0 57 mmol l when α fe2o3 nps was increased from 0 to 200 mg l fig s4b supplementary moreover low levels of ethanol 3 4 0 19 mmol l and acetaldehyde 2 6 0 18 mmol l were registered for mcb supplemented with 200 mg l of α fe2o3 when maximum hp was achieved fig s4 supplementary thus consistent with eqs 3 5 this finding strongly indicates the sequential conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde to acetic acid and hydrogen similarly lin et al 2016a observed that the addition of 200 mg l maghemite nps γ fe2o3 dominantly shifted the ethanol fermentation type to acetic acid production which was coincided with enhanced hp during the df of glucose comparable results were observed by gadhe et al 2015a han et al 2011 and lin et al 2016b wherein addition of 200 mg l α fe2o3 achieved maximum hp from glucose pretreated cassava starch and sucrose and distillery wastewater however the optimum dose of α fe2o3 was 50 mg l for hp from dairy wastewater highlighting the impact of substrate composition and associated metabolism gadhe et al 2015b the main enzymes responsible for meg metabolism and hp in eqs 2 5 are 1 aldh which catalyzes the reduction of acetaldehyde to its corresponding carboxylic acid e g acetic acid eq 3 trifunović et al 2016 2 adh which catalyzes the reversible conversion between alcohols e g ethanol and aldehydes e g acetaldehyde eq 4 trifunović et al 2016 and 3 hyd which stimulates the potential overall redox reaction that gathers electrons derived from nadh and reduced ferredoxin fdred in the presence of protons to produce hydrogen gas eq 5 schut and adams 2009 2 2 hoch2ch2oh meg 2 ch3cho acetaldehyde 2 h2o 3 ch3cho nad h2o ch3cooh acetic acid nadh h 4 ch3cho nadh h ch3ch2oh ethanol nad 5 nadh 2fdred 3h 2h2 nad 2fdox the results shown in fig 2 a revealed that hyd activity substantially improved following the addition of α fe2o3 nps 50 400 mg l highest activity was achieved at the dosage of 200 mg l 160 3 0 compared to the control this is indeed consistent with the increase in relative abundance of hydrogen producing bacteria fig 4 in the presence of 200 mg l α fe2o3 nps additionally iron that is likely released from α fe2o3 nps contributed to hyd enzyme synthesis and activity as hyd is classified as fefe and feni hydrogenase based on enzyme active site han et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 observed that fe2 concentration of 300 mg l enhanced hyd activity notably further aldh activity was enhanced it peaked at α fe2o3 nps dosage of 200 mg l similarly srikanth and mohan 2012 proved that dehydrogenase enzymes activity was boosted following the addition of 100 mg l fe2 3 1 2 nio nps addition fig 1b shows that mcb supplemented with nio nps exhibited better hp compared to non supplemented cultures however hp fluctuated significantly at different doses of nio nps maximum hp was obtained when the mcb was incorporated with 20 mg l nio nps 130 6 0 ml l and 30 increment compared to the control this enhancement in hp can be elaborated by the prevalence of acetic acid production pathway resulting in higher residual value of 24 1 1 mmol l lower ethanol of 5 9 0 74 mmol l and lower acetaldehyde of 2 3 0 13 mmol l in the reaction medium fig s5 supplementary moreover adh aldh and hyd activities improved when the mcb was amended with 10 100 mg l nio nps fig 2b the highest increments in adh and hyd activities were 150 10 and 140 9 0 respectively at nio nps concentration of 20 mg l these findings can be ascribed to the essential role of ni2 as an active center for several metalloenzymes including feni hydrogenase and acetyl coa synthetase acs boer et al 2014 acs catalyzes the intermediate conversion of acetyl coa i e a crucial metabolite for microbial growth to acetate which is sequentially linked to the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetyl coa assisted by aldh lian et al 2012 trifunović et al 2016 meanwhile substantial increases in relative abundance of clostridiales and bacillales compared to the control were observed fig 4 which were previously known to release adh and aldh radianingtyas and wright 2003 saxena and tanner 2011 moreover saxena and tanner 2011 reported that excess concentration of ni2 when the optimum dose was increased by ten fold resulted in slight decrease in maximum adh activity compared to fe2 based on standard trace element solution however optimum dose of zero valent nickel nps 60 mg l resulted in 23 improvement in hp elreedy et al 2017b 3 1 3 zno nps addition hp was enhanced when mcb was supplemented with zno nps cumulative vhp peaked when 10 mg l zno nps was incorporated resulting in 130 12 ml l and 29 improvement in hp compared to the control fig 1c this was consistent with the maximum production of acetic acid 23 1 8 mmol l and minimum levels of residual ethanol 3 4 0 19 mmol l and acetaldehyde 2 6 0 19 mmol l fig s6 this positive metabolic pathway is most likely assisted by the observed increase in adh 120 6 0 and aldh 170 4 0 compared to control cultures fig 2c the crucial role of zn can be related to the involvement in zn dependent adhs which facilitate the synthesis of coenzyme nad needed for the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde radianingtyas and wright 2003 resulting in higher proton h availability in the medium moreover the highest growth of hydrogen producers and maximum hyd activity 150 7 0 relative to the control were registered when 10 mg l zno nps was used figs 2c and 4 comparable results were obtained by srikanth and mohan 2012 who found that hy increased significantly from 0 27 to 15 mol kg codremoved when zn2 was increased from 0 to 12 mg l however yang et al 2013 reported that the ad process was inhibited by 18 when 30 mg gtss of zno nps was used further increments of α fe2o3 nio or zno nps dosages from 200 to 400 20 to 100 and 10 50 mg l respectively resulted in decrease s in the improved cumulative vhp compared to the control 27 17 and 11 progression respectively this alleviation is likely due to the inhibitory effect of excess α fe2o3 nio and zno nps and their released ions in the fermentation medium which causes cell membrane penetration lin et al 2016a 3 1 4 comparison of mcb individually supplemented with optimum doses of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps fig 2 shows that hp from mcb incorporated with 10 mg l of zno nps was similar to hp from 20 mg l nio nps and lower than hp from 200 mg l α fe2o3 nps meanwhile fig 3 indicates that acetic acid fermentation type was the dominant pathway for meg metabolism in all mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps however meg was found to decrease with time in a similar manner among the tested batches including the control suggesting that the conversion rate of meg was not enhanced by nps treatments note that the dehydration of meg to acetaldehyde eq 2 is associated with activity of non metal based enzyme namely diol dehydratase trifunović et al 2016 diol hydratase was reported as coenzyme b12 dependent and no any positive impacts were observed when was supplemented with metals such as k na and mg schramm and schink 1991 further meg dehydration to acetaldehyde is a non redox reaction which is not likely affected when exposed to electron conduits such as metal nps the concurrent release of sequential metabolites along the meg degradation period of 48 h starting with acetaldehyde also indicates its rate limiting level afterwards for the control the higher residual acetaldehyde implies a slower conversion rate compared with the treatments with nps where the high improvements were observed in aldh activity fig 2 the acetaldehyde concentration had a peak in the control after 6 0 h 10 1 1 mmol l and 24 h incubation 7 5 0 71 mmol l and high meg concentration still remained fig 3 maximum residual ethanol of 8 8 0 30 mmol l was also observed in the control batch in contrast residual ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations at optimum α fe2o3 nio and zno nps doses peaked at fermentation time of 48 h and these concentrations were less than 5 9 0 74 and 3 6 0 21 mmol l respectively which were achieved at optimum α fe2o3 nps the results were corresponded with higher adh and aldh enzymes activities at optimum doses of nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l fig 2 these findings indicated the higher production of acetic acid along with lower residual acetaldehyde and ethanol in the nps treated batches particularly during the first 48 h incubation fig 3 figure s7 supplementary shows that maximum hpr was achieved at fermentation time of 6 h for mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l however α fe2o3 nps achieved higher hpr of 13 0 92 ml l h compared to nio nps 9 8 0 50 ml l h zno nps 10 1 3 ml l h and control cultures 7 3 0 59 ml l h the maximum hpr using α fe2o3 nps was highly correlated with the highest acetic acid ethanol hac etoh ratio 15 confirming higher conversion of ethanol hac etoh ratio gradually dropped until the 48 h incubation along with an increase in acetic acid acetaldehyde hac acet ratio which indicates an increase in the conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol eq 4 the increase in hac etoh and hac acet ratios after 48 h incubation corresponded to an increase in the vhp while insignificant hp was observed for the control these findings indicate that nps had a continuous and positive impact on intermediate reactions similarly elreedy et al 2017b indicated that maximum hp which coincided with the highest hac etoh value of 10 was achieved when a supplement of zero valent nickel nps was used on meg substrate overall the optimum dose of supplemented nps needed to maintain maximum hp depends on its composition this observation can be attributed to the variation in their positive and negative impacts on hydrogen gas release enzyme activity and metabolic response as aforementioned for instance yang et al 2013 reported that iron nps recorded lower ion release rate especially at low ph values as well as higher affinity to aggregate compared to zinc and silver nps which can explain their lower inhibitory effect at higher doses furthermore the potential role of nps on diet as electron conduits can be of interest the electrical conductivity of elements used in this study are different the superior conductor is zinc followed by nickel and iron the electrical conductivity of metal nps are also suggested by wang et al 2016 and they noted substantial improvement in biogas production when iron oxide nps were used though the release of fe2 ions was negligible hence the outperformance of α fe2o3 nps could be ascribed to the iron s superior role to enhance hyd activity as well as their role as electron conduits particularly due to the maintained safe exposure to higher doses compared with nio and zno nps 3 1 5 impacts on microbial community structure the microbial community structures of the culture were investigated using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing for mcb supplied with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l and control mcb after fermentation time of 24 h the relative abundance of dominant microbial order level is shown in fig 4a the relative abundance of clostridiales class clostridia for mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l increased from 10 in the control to 16 18 and 19 respectively clostridia is known to be the main hydrogen producer in the fermentation process under both mesophilic fang et al 2002 gagliano et al 2017 and thermophilic conditions akutsu et al 2008 among others genus clostridium order clostridiales family clostridiaceae is a key hydrogen producing bacteria several studies have investigated its hydrogen productivity li and liu 2012 in the present study 83 92 of clostridiales belonged to clostridiaceae in all tested batches fig 4b meanwhile the addition of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps under thermophilic fermentation conditions improved the hy possibly due to the acceleration of growth and metabolism of clostridiaceae similarly hendriks et al 2018 reported that trace elements significantly influence the growth and metabolism of clostridium particularly under thermophilic anaerobic conditions further order opb95 belonging to candidate phylum op8 was abundant in all tested cultures fig 4a opb related consortium is widespread under thermophilic conditions and plays a significant role in the acidification process ma et al 2017 however the relative abundance of thermoanaerobacterales decreased from 9 0 in the control to 4 0 4 0 and 5 0 when the mcb was supplied with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l respectively fig 4a nonetheless the evidence that thermoanaerobacterales forms ethanol from acetaldehyde using adh enzyme onyenwoke and juergen 2015 is consistent with the high ethanol production and acetaldehyde consumption after 24 h incubation in the control cultures resulting in lower hp compared to other batches supplemented with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps 3 2 efficiency assessment of hydrogen production metabolism and enzyme activity using mcb supplemented with optimum doses of dual and multi nps the results depicted in fig 5 indicate that mcb supplemented with dual α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno nio zno and multi nps significantly enhanced hp by 42 41 46 and 48 respectively compared to the control these increments were higher than increments caused by individual addition of nps maximum cumulative vhp of 150 9 0 ml l was achieved when multi nps were used this can be attributed to higher production of acetic acid 26 1 6 mmol l in the medium fig 5 similarly addition of the dual nps nio zno promoted hp by 12 and 13 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively lower levels of residual ethanol 2 2 3 3 mmol l and acetaldehyde 2 4 2 8 mmol l were maintained when dual and multi nps were used compared to individual nps suggesting the higher conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid with concurrent release of hydrogen eqs 3 and 4 further hpr obtained by the addition of dual and multi nps exhibited trends similar to individual nps fig s8 supplementary maximum hpr of 13 0 80 ml l h was achieved when mcb incorporated with multi nps was used which represented 1 8 fold increase compared to the control dual and multi nps exhibited higher hac etoh and hac acet ratios compared to individuals and control which highlights their impact on the relevant enzymes including enzymes that convert ethanol into acetaldehyde such as adh as shown in fig 6 high conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde after fermentation time of 48 h was particularly evident when multi nps were used this could be assisted by low ph values 4 5 5 0 which render the environment favourable for ethanol metabolism elreedy et al 2017b eskicioglu et al 2017 moreover a cod mass balance based on equivalent cod of meg and associated metabolites as well as produced hydrogen at different fermentation times is shown in table s1 supplementary a comparison of the effects of individual dual and multiple additions of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps on hp and enzymes activity is illustrated in fig 6 significant improvements in adh aldh and hyd enzyme activities were achieved for dual and multi nps firstly dual and multi nps mainly enhanced adh activity that was seen in the single treatment with α fe2o3 nps emphasizing that nio and zno nps played a role in the enhancement of adh activity moreover the maximum increment in adh activity of 140 9 0 was achieved when using single treatment with nio nps secondly mcb incorporated with individual dual and multi nps produced substantial increments in aldh activity ranging from 150 8 0 to 180 7 0 this finding is consistent with the high residual acetaldehyde concentration in the control culture after 6 0 h fermentation time when maximum hpr was attained thirdly the results in fig 6d revealed that significant enhancement in hyd activity ranging from 170 6 0 to 170 9 0 was obtained when mcb supplied with dual and multi nps were used multi nps substantially promoted hyd activity by 17 and 10 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively however this promotion from multi nps was only by 4 0 compared to individual α fe2o3 nps this finding confirms the superior role of α fe2o3 nps in the enhancement of hyd activity and corresponding hp moreover fig 6 shows that mcb supplemented with nio zno dual nps improved hyd activity by 16 and 10 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively meanwhile comparable performance to α fe2o3 nps 200 mg l treatment could be attained when combining lower doses of nio and zno nps 20 and 10 mg l respectively which might be beneficial from economic point of view the modified gompertz model was successfully applied to the observed data profile of cumulative vhp as depicted in table 2 the model was fitted to the experimental results with high correlation coefficients r2 ranging from 0 96 to 0 99 the addition of nps decreased the lag phase period 0 31 0 49 h compared with the control 0 61 h suggesting the positive effect on fermentation process the positive impact of nps on the relative abundance of hydrogen producing bacteria fig 4 may be relevant to the reduction of the lag phase period as reported by taherdanak et al 2016 the rm peaked at optimum α fe2o3 nio and zno nps dosages of 200 20 and 10 mg l achieving 14 12 and 13 ml l h respectively compared to 8 0 ml l h for the control correspondingly hy was maximized to 37 2 5 34 2 5 and 33 3 2 ml g meg i e 47 3 2 43 2 6 and 43 4 1 ml g cod respectively for mcb supplemented with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps respectively however the highest rm of 14 ml l h was recorded when mcb incorporated with multi nps was used final ph values at the end of incubation dropped to a range of 4 3 0 060 to 4 6 0 040 without substantial difference between different supplements or dosage most likely due to the accumulation of acetic acid consequently promotion of fermentative hp using mcb incorporated with individual and multiple α fe2o3 nio and zno nps was found to be dosage and composition dependent α fe2o3 nps was the best individual supplement only slight improvements in hp were noted when α fe2o3 was used in dual or multiple combination with other nps combination of α fe2o3 200 mg l with nio 20 mg l and or zno nps 10 mg l significantly enhanced hp compared to their individual use mainly due to its high influence on hyd activity and relatively higher optimum dose in addition the dual addition of nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l substantially promoted hp and hyd enzyme activity compared to individual nio and zno nps 3 3 linear regression and principal components analyses linear regression analysis was conducted and correlation coefficients were obtained at a confidence level of 95 figs 7 and 8 and table s2 supplementary pca was also conducted to assess multiple variables considering all designed batch reactors fig s9a supplementary shows that the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 demonstrated nearly 94 variance in the data obtained the results confirm that hp was significantly correlated with residual acetic acid p 0 00010 and ethanol p 0 00080 with the latter correlation being in a reverse manner strong positive correlation was obtained between ethanol and acetic acid p 0 00020 acetaldehyde exhibited insignificant correlation with hp p 0 39 which can be attributed to its potential conversion to acetic acid or ethanol based on the effect of nps dosages α fe2o3 nps registered maximum variations compared to the control maximum hpr and hyd activity were highly correlated p 0 0041 whereas insignificant associations of hpr with adh and aldh activities were noted due possibly to the involvement of reversible redox reaction towards ethanol formation fig 8 significant correlation between adh and aldh activity was observed p 0 0017 which can be explained by the potential exchange between two forms of the essential coenzyme i e nad and nadh eqs 3 and 4 the pca among the maximum hpr and corresponding adh aldh and hyd enzyme activities showed that both pc1 and pc2 achieved total variance of 87 fig s9b supplementary both regression analysis and pca confirmed the positive impacts of individual dual and multi nps and the proposed pathway of metabolite products and correlations between related enzyme activities 4 conclusions mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps individually and in combination substantially promoted hp from synthetic industrial wastewater containing meg maximum hy values of 37 2 5 34 2 0 and 33 3 2 ml g meg were obtained for mcb supplemented with 200 20 and 10 mg l of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps respectively compared to 26 2 1 ml g meg for the control cultures the results highlight the potential use of zno nps in the anaerobic fermentation process moreover higher and lower abundance of hydrogen producing clostridiales and ethanol forming microbes thermoanaerobacterales respectively were ascribed to nps addition hp was further improved when mcb was incorporated with dual and multi nps resulting in maximum improvements of 13 and 14 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively adh aldh and hyd enzymes were significantly enhanced when mcb supplemented with nps were used significant correlations p 0 050 were found between hp with metabolite products i e acetic acid and ethanol and hyd

19076,the present study assessed the efficiency of utilizing mixed culture bacteria mcb incorporated with individual nanoparticles nps i e hematite α fe2o3 nickel oxide nio and zinc oxide zno dual nps α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno and nio zno and multi nps α fe2o3 nio zno for hydrogen production hp from industrial wastewater containing mono ethylene glycol meg when mcb was individually supplemented with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l hp improved significantly by 41 30 and 29 respectively further key enzymes associated with meg metabolism such as alcohol dehydrogenase adh aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh and hydrogenase hyd were rapidly and substantially enhanced in the medium nio and zno nps notably promoted adh and aldh activities respectively while α fe2o3 exhibited superior impact on hyd activity maximum hydrogen production rate was concomitant with higher acetic acid production and lower residual acetaldehyde and ethanol hp using mcb supplemented with individual nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l further improved by 8 0 14 when dual and multi nps were used the highest hp was recorded when multi nps were used in addition nps incorporation resulted in substantial increase in the relative abundance of clostridiales belonging to family clostridiaceae 83 overall this study provides significant insights into the impact of nps on hydrogen production from meg contaminated wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords fermentative hydrogen generation metal nanoparticles mono ethylene glycol intermediate metabolites enzymatic activity microbial community structure 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of industrial wastewater containing biodegradable organics is considered a sustainable solution especially in countries with limited conventional fuels resources anaerobes can be used to generate hydrogen ethanol and methane from organic containing wastewater hydrogen is a highly promising biofuel owing to its clean combustion properties and is presently utilized in electric vehicles and power generation fermentative hydrogen can be harvested separately through the two phases ad process of organic wastes this process consists of a dark fermentation df phase producing hydrogen and acetic acid followed by a methane producing phase only from acetic acid biodegradation nonetheless beneficial and affordable hydrogen production hp from df is challenging owing to various limitations such as reactor designs operational conditions competitive bacterial consortia substrate compositions essential macro and micronutrients and low yields mota et al 2018 currently several techniques have been developed to optimize hp however most techniques focus on its harvesting from common organic compounds such as starch glucose sucrose and proteins presently mono ethylene glycol meg a common industrial contaminant is widely used in petrochemical industries to produce aircraft runway deicers ethylene glycol oxide engine coolants and poly ethylene terephthalate pet and for natural gas extraction elreedy et al 2017a mahmoud et al 2017 meg is globally classified as hazardous but is biodegradable and can be used for hp hassani et al 2013 several techniques have been employed for the treatment of meg containing wastewater such as direct and catalytic oxidations vacuum membrane distillation nano filtration phytoremediation biological aerobic treatment and ad process elreedy et al 2017b however maximizing the hydrogen yield hy from df of meg containing wastewater through applying the two phases ad strategy is crucial to become a significant competitor from environmental and economic points of view compared with the common one phase ad producing solely methane recently enhanced hp has been achieved by supplementing fermentative bacteria with metal nanoparticles nps mudhoo et al 2018 however it is likely that hp and enhancement mechanism depend on nps composition dosage substrate degradation pathway and associated enzymes nps have unique physical and chemical characteristics firstly metal nanoparticles such as hematite α fe2o3 nickel oxide nio and zinc oxide zno nps can release bioavailable metal ions via dissolution in water even under anaerobic biotic environments han et al 2011 mu and chen 2011 xu et al 2019 further han et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 identified that nps can gradually supply appropriate amounts of metal ions while assessing the role of trace metals on microorganism growth and activity thus the inhibitory effect of excess metal ions can be avoided the potential toxicity associated with metal ions mainly relies on their speciation and concentration elevated doses of metals can a disrupt the enzymes function and structure when binding with thiol group rsh or other functional groups deforming as well as inactivating the protein and or replace the natural metals in prosthetic groups which are coenzymes chen et al 2008 and b increase the production of reactive oxygen species ros lowering the bacterial cell viability due to the oxidative stress mu and chen 2011 former studies have also confirmed that iron nps achieved higher hp compared to iron sulfate when tested at the same dosages han et al 2011 taherdanak et al 2016 however wang et al 2016 noted considerable increment in hp when 100 mg gtss of iron oxide nps was used although no release of fe2 was observed this mechanism is based on the use of conductive mineral particles as conduits of electrons by microbes which has been described as direct interspecies electron transfer diet tian et al 2017 wang et al 2016 this hypothesis was also proposed by lin et al 2016a who found that iron oxide nps maintained more aggregates of nanowire related proteins which play a crucial role in electron transfer between cells accordingly hp was enhanced using non metallic and high electrical conductive supplements such as graphene tian et al 2017 nickel graphene nanocomposite elreedy et al 2017b magnetite graphene oxide nanocomposite mostafa et al 2016 and granular activated carbon liu et al 2012 thirdly lin et al 2016a and yu et al 2015 reported that small nps such as zno and iron oxide were able to penetrate the microbial cell membrane without causing significant disruption which was supported by transmission and scanning electron microscopy tem and sem images under such conditions potential enhancement in intracellular enzyme synthesis stability and activity is expected owing to functional ion release from nps as well as the physical as attaching surface and chemical as electron conduits uniqueness of nps mcpherson and vincent 2014 eventually the inhibitory mechanism induced by certain doses of nps during ad due to either themselves or released ions is mainly related to cell membrane penetration and disruption as discussed by yang et al 2013 iron nps are widely used as supplements to promote hp as iron constitutes the metal component in active sites and fs clusters of fe fefe and feni hydrogenase enzymes which facilitates the release of hydrogen gas han et al 2011 four common iron based nps namely fe3o4 nps magnetite α fe2o3 nps γ fe2o3 nps maghemite and zvi nps zero valent iron have been successfully applied for hp particularly hematite nps achieved higher enhancement and less toxicity compared to other forms han et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 elreedy et al 2017b reported that reactors exposed to iron based nps achieved 17 63 improvement in hp using glucose based substrates nickel represents the core structure of feni hydrogenase which is widely dispersed among bacteria mullai et al 2013 nickel nps used at lower doses compared to iron nps enhanced hp by 16 23 23 and 24 with substrates such as dairy and distillery wastewater gadhe et al 2014 2015a meg elreedy et al 2017b and glucose mullai et al 2013 respectively similarly cultures supplemented with ni ions enhanced dehydrogenase enzyme activity associated ethanol production and growth of relevant bacterial species saxena and tanner 2011 in contrast to fe and ni based nps existing research on the impact of zno nps on biological treatment processes have focused mainly on its toxicity and its potential positive impact has been less investigated nonetheless chong et al 2009 highlighted that zinc is as one of the most important elements for hp besides magnesium sodium and iron srikanth and mohan 2012 noted that hy increased by 98 when 12 mg l of zn2 was used further sarris and papanikolaou 2016 highlighted the role of zinc as a cofactor for alcohol dehydrogenase adh it acts as a catalyst during the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol by recycling nadh to nad a process that occurs in the meg metabolic pathway particularly zinc dependent adhs are the most common enzymes when thermophilic adhs are orderly classified radianingtyas and wright 2003 saxena and tanner 2011 highlighted that zn2 achieved the highest bacterial growth and ethanol production among the trace metal ions tested co2 cu2 fe2 mn2 mo6 ni2 zn2 seo4 and wo4 while previous studies investigated the impact of nps on fermentative hp to our knowledge impacts of individual and multiple amendment of nps on the hydrogen generation for the treatment of meg contaminated wastewater have not been extensively studied furthermore comprehensive analyses will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism of nps induced hp enhancement therefore this study assessed the use of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps as supplements to promote hp from meg containing wastewater the main objective of the research was to study the efficiency of mixed culture bacteria mcb incorporated with individual α fe2o3 nio and zno dual α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno nio zno and multi nps α fe2o3 nio zno the study emphasized on the influence of supplemented nps on intermediate metabolites activity of key enzymes and microbial community structures furthermore linear regression and principal components analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between relevant intermediates enzyme activities and hp 2 materials and methods 2 1 mixed culture and substrate compositions mixed culture was collected as thickened sludge from the gravity thickener in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant located in kanto area japan the ph total solids ts and volatile solids vs of the collected sludge were 6 8 0 060 26 0 33 gts l and 19 0 42 gvs l respectively resulting in an average vs ts ratio of 0 73 the harvested sludge was initially acclimatized for four months under anaerobic conditions and using meg as the sole carbon source further the sludge was pre heated at a temperature of 105 c for 30 min for three times in this study i e initial stage of acclimatization one month prior to the experiment and just before the experiment this heat pretreatment strategy as well as acclimation temperature of 50 c and ph 5 0 6 0 were recognized to suppress the methanogenesis and harvest spore forming bacteria responsible for

scientific instruments ltd the detailed characteristics of three nanomaterials used in this study were discussed in the supplementary information figs s1 s3 2 3 experimental design two successive batch mode experiments for fermentative hp from synthetic wastewater containing meg were conducted table 1 to assess the efficiency of mcb incorporated with 1 individual nps α fe2o3 nio and zno at different doses 2 dual nps namely α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno nio zno and 3 multi nps which was α fe2o3 nio zno stock suspensions of α fe2o3 nps 0 80 g nio nps 0 20 g and zno nps 0 10 g were separately prepared in 50 ml milli q water and dispersed by ultrasonication for 1 0 h batch experiments were conducted using a series of 250 ml serum bottles with 200 ml working volume and 50 ml headspace all batches were inoculated with mcb with average vs and meg concentrations of 10 0 and 4 0 g l respectively resulting in an average substrate to biomass ratio s x of 0 50 gcod gvs this mixture was attained by centrifugation 4000 g for 5 0 min of 100 ml of concentrated mcb 20 gvs l and subsequent resuspension in substrate 4 gmeg l at a total volume of 200 ml initial ph values were adjusted to 5 5 0 070 which is optimal for hydrogen production when using meg as substrate and mixed culture as inoculum as reported earlier by elreedy et al 2018 2017a 2017b the headspaces of the batch reactors were initially purged with oxygen free nitrogen 90 n2 and 10 co2 and capped with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals to avoid air exchange wei et al 2014 the serum bottles were placed in shakers and subsequently moved to an incubator operated at 50 c duplicate tests were conducted to obtain values that represented mean standard deviation the significance of results was assessed using analysis of variance anova at a confidence level of 95 which is represented by a probability value p 0 050 2 4 data analysis the modified gompertz equation eq 1 taherdanak et al 2016 was used to model the experimental results of biohydrogen production assisted by the addition of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps individually and in combination 1 h p exp exp r m e p λ t 1 where h ml is the cumulative volumetric

principal components analysis pca were used to describe the relationships between hp intermediate products and activities of key enzymes linear regression analysis and pca were performed using sigmaplot 10 and minitab 18 software respectively 2 5 enzymatic activity assays the activity of hydrogenase hyd alcohol dehydrogenase adh and aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh enzymes were assessed for all batches including the control the hyd activity was estimated based on the associated reduction of methylene blue mb lee et al 2009 the activities of adh and aldh enzymes were colorimetrically measured at the wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate reader spectra fluor tecan uk adh and aldh activity assay kits abnova co catalog number ka3713 and ka3742 respectively were used according to the manufacturer s protocol abnova 2018 full description regarding the three enzyme activity assays is shown in the supplementary information 2 6 analytical techniques mixed liquor and supernatant samples of 1 ml each were collected from the incubated batches at different time intervals for analyses of biomass and metabolites after filtration respectively the samples were withdrawn using needle syringes after collecting the produced gas and then the head space was adjusted to initial conditions using oxygen free nitrogen ts and vs in the sludge were analyzed according to apha 2005 meg acetic acid ethanol and acetaldehyde were measured using gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu japan equipped with stabilwax column restek and flame ionized detector fid the detector was supplied with helium hydrogen and air and operated at flow rates of 4 0 50 and 300 ml min respectively as described by carnegie and ramsay 2009 the temperatures of the injection port and detector were 230 and 250 c respectively the column oven temperature was set at 55 c for 1 0 min subsequently the temperature was increased at the rate of 20 c min with 1 0 min hold until reaching 215 c the volume of hydrogen gas for all batches was measured using the displacement method wherein alkali water 3 0 naoh w v was used to absorb co2 and h2s zhang et al 2015 besides hydrogen gas content using a displacement method was validated using gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu japan equipped with a shincarbon column restek and thermal conductivity detector tcd helium was used as the carrier gas which was provided at a flow rate of 25 ml min the temperatures of the injection port column oven and detector were 100 120 and 150 c respectively the 16s rrna gene region of bacteria and archaea was used for next generation sequencing analysis and description of the procedures is shown in the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficiency assessment of hydrogen production metabolism and enzyme activity using mcb individually supplemented with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps 3 1 1 α fe2o3 nps addition fig 1 a depicts the efficiency of hp from df of meg rich wastewater using mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 the results revealed that mcb supplemented with 50 mg l of α fe2o3 nps promoted hp by 20 compared to the control test furthermore the cumulative volumetric hydrogen production vhp substantially increased to 150 9 0 ml l when α fe2o3 nps dosage was increased to 200 mg l resulting in hp improvement of 41 during the meg decomposition pathway eqs 2 4 trifunović et al 2016 higher hp is associated with higher availability of protons h which is correlated to acetic acid production consistently acetic acid substantially increased from 18 1 6 to 26 0 57 mmol l when α fe2o3 nps was increased from 0 to 200 mg l fig s4b supplementary moreover low levels of ethanol 3 4 0 19 mmol l and acetaldehyde 2 6 0 18 mmol l were registered for mcb supplemented with 200 mg l of α fe2o3 when maximum hp was achieved fig s4 supplementary thus consistent with eqs 3 5 this finding strongly indicates the sequential conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde to acetic acid and hydrogen similarly lin et al 2016a observed that the addition of 200 mg l maghemite nps γ fe2o3 dominantly shifted the ethanol fermentation type to acetic acid production which was coincided with enhanced hp during the df of glucose comparable results were observed by gadhe et al 2015a han et al 2011 and lin et al 2016b wherein addition of 200 mg l α fe2o3 achieved maximum hp from glucose pretreated cassava starch and sucrose and distillery wastewater however the optimum dose of α fe2o3 was 50 mg l for hp from dairy wastewater highlighting the impact of substrate composition and associated metabolism gadhe et al 2015b the main enzymes responsible for meg metabolism and hp in eqs 2 5 are 1 aldh which catalyzes the reduction of acetaldehyde to its corresponding carboxylic acid e g acetic acid eq 3 trifunović et al 2016 2 adh which catalyzes the reversible conversion between alcohols e g ethanol and aldehydes e g acetaldehyde eq 4 trifunović et al 2016 and 3 hyd which stimulates the potential overall redox reaction that gathers electrons derived from nadh and reduced ferredoxin fdred in the presence of protons to produce hydrogen gas eq 5 schut and adams 2009 2 2 hoch2ch2oh meg 2 ch3cho acetaldehyde 2 h2o 3 ch3cho nad h2o ch3cooh acetic acid nadh h 4 ch3cho nadh h ch3ch2oh ethanol nad 5 nadh 2fdred 3h 2h2 nad 2fdox the results shown in fig 2 a revealed that hyd activity substantially improved following the addition of α fe2o3 nps 50 400 mg l highest activity was achieved at the dosage of 200 mg l 160 3 0 compared to the control this is indeed consistent with the increase in relative abundance of hydrogen producing bacteria fig 4 in the presence of 200 mg l α fe2o3 nps additionally iron that is likely released from α fe2o3 nps contributed to hyd enzyme synthesis and activity as hyd is classified as fefe and feni hydrogenase based on enzyme active site han et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 observed that fe2 concentration of 300 mg l enhanced hyd activity notably further aldh activity was enhanced it peaked at α fe2o3 nps dosage of 200 mg l similarly srikanth and mohan 2012 proved that dehydrogenase enzymes activity was boosted following the addition of 100 mg l fe2 3 1 2 nio nps addition fig 1b shows that mcb supplemented with nio nps exhibited better hp compared to non supplemented cultures however hp fluctuated significantly at different doses of nio nps maximum hp was obtained when the mcb was incorporated with 20 mg l nio nps 130 6 0 ml l and 30 increment compared to the control this enhancement in hp can be elaborated by the prevalence of acetic acid production pathway resulting in higher residual value of 24 1 1 mmol l lower ethanol of 5 9 0 74 mmol l and lower acetaldehyde of 2 3 0 13 mmol l in the reaction medium fig s5 supplementary moreover adh aldh and hyd activities improved when the mcb was amended with 10 100 mg l nio nps fig 2b the highest increments in adh and hyd activities were 150 10 and 140 9 0 respectively at nio nps concentration of 20 mg l these findings can be ascribed to the essential role of ni2 as an active center for several metalloenzymes including feni hydrogenase and acetyl coa synthetase acs boer et al 2014 acs catalyzes the intermediate conversion of acetyl coa i e a crucial metabolite for microbial growth to acetate which is sequentially linked to the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetyl coa assisted by aldh lian et al 2012 trifunović et al 2016 meanwhile substantial increases in relative abundance of clostridiales and bacillales compared to the control were observed fig 4 which were previously known to release adh and aldh radianingtyas and wright 2003 saxena and tanner 2011 moreover saxena and tanner 2011 reported that excess concentration of ni2 when the optimum dose was increased by ten fold resulted in slight decrease in maximum adh activity compared to fe2 based on standard trace element solution however optimum dose of zero valent nickel nps 60 mg l resulted in 23 improvement in hp elreedy et al 2017b 3 1 3 zno nps addition hp was enhanced when mcb was supplemented with zno nps cumulative vhp peaked when 10 mg l zno nps was incorporated resulting in 130 12 ml l and 29 improvement in hp compared to the control fig 1c this was consistent with the maximum production of acetic acid 23 1 8 mmol l and minimum levels of residual ethanol 3 4 0 19 mmol l and acetaldehyde 2 6 0 19 mmol l fig s6 this positive metabolic pathway is most likely assisted by the observed increase in adh 120 6 0 and aldh 170 4 0 compared to control cultures fig 2c the crucial role of zn can be related to the involvement in zn dependent adhs which facilitate the synthesis of coenzyme nad needed for the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde radianingtyas and wright 2003 resulting in higher proton h availability in the medium moreover the highest growth of hydrogen producers and maximum hyd activity 150 7 0 relative to the control were registered when 10 mg l zno nps was used figs 2c and 4 comparable results were obtained by srikanth and mohan 2012 who found that hy increased significantly from 0 27 to 15 mol kg codremoved when zn2 was increased from 0 to 12 mg l however yang et al 2013 reported that the ad process was inhibited by 18 when 30 mg gtss of zno nps was used further increments of α fe2o3 nio or zno nps dosages from 200 to 400 20 to 100 and 10 50 mg l respectively resulted in decrease s in the improved cumulative vhp compared to the control 27 17 and 11 progression respectively this alleviation is likely due to the inhibitory effect of excess α fe2o3 nio and zno nps and their released ions in the fermentation medium which causes cell membrane penetration lin et al 2016a 3 1 4 comparison of mcb individually supplemented with optimum doses of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps fig 2 shows that hp from mcb incorporated with 10 mg l of zno nps was similar to hp from 20 mg l nio nps and lower than hp from 200 mg l α fe2o3 nps meanwhile fig 3 indicates that acetic acid fermentation type was the dominant pathway for meg metabolism in all mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps however meg was found to decrease with time in a similar manner among the tested batches including the control suggesting that the conversion rate of meg was not enhanced by nps treatments note that the dehydration of meg to acetaldehyde eq 2 is associated with activity of non metal based enzyme namely diol dehydratase trifunović et al 2016 diol hydratase was reported as coenzyme b12 dependent and no any positive impacts were observed when was supplemented with metals such as k na and mg schramm and schink 1991 further meg dehydration to acetaldehyde is a non redox reaction which is not likely affected when exposed to electron conduits such as metal nps the concurrent release of sequential metabolites along the meg degradation period of 48 h starting with acetaldehyde also indicates its rate limiting level afterwards for the control the higher residual acetaldehyde implies a slower conversion rate compared with the treatments with nps where the high improvements were observed in aldh activity fig 2 the acetaldehyde concentration had a peak in the control after 6 0 h 10 1 1 mmol l and 24 h incubation 7 5 0 71 mmol l and high meg concentration still remained fig 3 maximum residual ethanol of 8 8 0 30 mmol l was also observed in the control batch in contrast residual ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations at optimum α fe2o3 nio and zno nps doses peaked at fermentation time of 48 h and these concentrations were less than 5 9 0 74 and 3 6 0 21 mmol l respectively which were achieved at optimum α fe2o3 nps the results were corresponded with higher adh and aldh enzymes activities at optimum doses of nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l fig 2 these findings indicated the higher production of acetic acid along with lower residual acetaldehyde and ethanol in the nps treated batches particularly during the first 48 h incubation fig 3 figure s7 supplementary shows that maximum hpr was achieved at fermentation time of 6 h for mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l however α fe2o3 nps achieved higher hpr of 13 0 92 ml l h compared to nio nps 9 8 0 50 ml l h zno nps 10 1 3 ml l h and control cultures 7 3 0 59 ml l h the maximum hpr using α fe2o3 nps was highly correlated with the highest acetic acid ethanol hac etoh ratio 15 confirming higher conversion of ethanol hac etoh ratio gradually dropped until the 48 h incubation along with an increase in acetic acid acetaldehyde hac acet ratio which indicates an increase in the conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol eq 4 the increase in hac etoh and hac acet ratios after 48 h incubation corresponded to an increase in the vhp while insignificant hp was observed for the control these findings indicate that nps had a continuous and positive impact on intermediate reactions similarly elreedy et al 2017b indicated that maximum hp which coincided with the highest hac etoh value of 10 was achieved when a supplement of zero valent nickel nps was used on meg substrate overall the optimum dose of supplemented nps needed to maintain maximum hp depends on its composition this observation can be attributed to the variation in their positive and negative impacts on hydrogen gas release enzyme activity and metabolic response as aforementioned for instance yang et al 2013 reported that iron nps recorded lower ion release rate especially at low ph values as well as higher affinity to aggregate compared to zinc and silver nps which can explain their lower inhibitory effect at higher doses furthermore the potential role of nps on diet as electron conduits can be of interest the electrical conductivity of elements used in this study are different the superior conductor is zinc followed by nickel and iron the electrical conductivity of metal nps are also suggested by wang et al 2016 and they noted substantial improvement in biogas production when iron oxide nps were used though the release of fe2 ions was negligible hence the outperformance of α fe2o3 nps could be ascribed to the iron s superior role to enhance hyd activity as well as their role as electron conduits particularly due to the maintained safe exposure to higher doses compared with nio and zno nps 3 1 5 impacts on microbial community structure the microbial community structures of the culture were investigated using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing for mcb supplied with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l and control mcb after fermentation time of 24 h the relative abundance of dominant microbial order level is shown in fig 4a the relative abundance of clostridiales class clostridia for mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l increased from 10 in the control to 16 18 and 19 respectively clostridia is known to be the main hydrogen producer in the fermentation process under both mesophilic fang et al 2002 gagliano et al 2017 and thermophilic conditions akutsu et al 2008 among others genus clostridium order clostridiales family clostridiaceae is a key hydrogen producing bacteria several studies have investigated its hydrogen productivity li and liu 2012 in the present study 83 92 of clostridiales belonged to clostridiaceae in all tested batches fig 4b meanwhile the addition of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps under thermophilic fermentation conditions improved the hy possibly due to the acceleration of growth and metabolism of clostridiaceae similarly hendriks et al 2018 reported that trace elements significantly influence the growth and metabolism of clostridium particularly under thermophilic anaerobic conditions further order opb95 belonging to candidate phylum op8 was abundant in all tested cultures fig 4a opb related consortium is widespread under thermophilic conditions and plays a significant role in the acidification process ma et al 2017 however the relative abundance of thermoanaerobacterales decreased from 9 0 in the control to 4 0 4 0 and 5 0 when the mcb was supplied with α fe2o3 200 mg l nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l respectively fig 4a nonetheless the evidence that thermoanaerobacterales forms ethanol from acetaldehyde using adh enzyme onyenwoke and juergen 2015 is consistent with the high ethanol production and acetaldehyde consumption after 24 h incubation in the control cultures resulting in lower hp compared to other batches supplemented with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps 3 2 efficiency assessment of hydrogen production metabolism and enzyme activity using mcb supplemented with optimum doses of dual and multi nps the results depicted in fig 5 indicate that mcb supplemented with dual α fe2o3 nio α fe2o3 zno nio zno and multi nps significantly enhanced hp by 42 41 46 and 48 respectively compared to the control these increments were higher than increments caused by individual addition of nps maximum cumulative vhp of 150 9 0 ml l was achieved when multi nps were used this can be attributed to higher production of acetic acid 26 1 6 mmol l in the medium fig 5 similarly addition of the dual nps nio zno promoted hp by 12 and 13 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively lower levels of residual ethanol 2 2 3 3 mmol l and acetaldehyde 2 4 2 8 mmol l were maintained when dual and multi nps were used compared to individual nps suggesting the higher conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid with concurrent release of hydrogen eqs 3 and 4 further hpr obtained by the addition of dual and multi nps exhibited trends similar to individual nps fig s8 supplementary maximum hpr of 13 0 80 ml l h was achieved when mcb incorporated with multi nps was used which represented 1 8 fold increase compared to the control dual and multi nps exhibited higher hac etoh and hac acet ratios compared to individuals and control which highlights their impact on the relevant enzymes including enzymes that convert ethanol into acetaldehyde such as adh as shown in fig 6 high conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde after fermentation time of 48 h was particularly evident when multi nps were used this could be assisted by low ph values 4 5 5 0 which render the environment favourable for ethanol metabolism elreedy et al 2017b eskicioglu et al 2017 moreover a cod mass balance based on equivalent cod of meg and associated metabolites as well as produced hydrogen at different fermentation times is shown in table s1 supplementary a comparison of the effects of individual dual and multiple additions of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps on hp and enzymes activity is illustrated in fig 6 significant improvements in adh aldh and hyd enzyme activities were achieved for dual and multi nps firstly dual and multi nps mainly enhanced adh activity that was seen in the single treatment with α fe2o3 nps emphasizing that nio and zno nps played a role in the enhancement of adh activity moreover the maximum increment in adh activity of 140 9 0 was achieved when using single treatment with nio nps secondly mcb incorporated with individual dual and multi nps produced substantial increments in aldh activity ranging from 150 8 0 to 180 7 0 this finding is consistent with the high residual acetaldehyde concentration in the control culture after 6 0 h fermentation time when maximum hpr was attained thirdly the results in fig 6d revealed that significant enhancement in hyd activity ranging from 170 6 0 to 170 9 0 was obtained when mcb supplied with dual and multi nps were used multi nps substantially promoted hyd activity by 17 and 10 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively however this promotion from multi nps was only by 4 0 compared to individual α fe2o3 nps this finding confirms the superior role of α fe2o3 nps in the enhancement of hyd activity and corresponding hp moreover fig 6 shows that mcb supplemented with nio zno dual nps improved hyd activity by 16 and 10 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively meanwhile comparable performance to α fe2o3 nps 200 mg l treatment could be attained when combining lower doses of nio and zno nps 20 and 10 mg l respectively which might be beneficial from economic point of view the modified gompertz model was successfully applied to the observed data profile of cumulative vhp as depicted in table 2 the model was fitted to the experimental results with high correlation coefficients r2 ranging from 0 96 to 0 99 the addition of nps decreased the lag phase period 0 31 0 49 h compared with the control 0 61 h suggesting the positive effect on fermentation process the positive impact of nps on the relative abundance of hydrogen producing bacteria fig 4 may be relevant to the reduction of the lag phase period as reported by taherdanak et al 2016 the rm peaked at optimum α fe2o3 nio and zno nps dosages of 200 20 and 10 mg l achieving 14 12 and 13 ml l h respectively compared to 8 0 ml l h for the control correspondingly hy was maximized to 37 2 5 34 2 5 and 33 3 2 ml g meg i e 47 3 2 43 2 6 and 43 4 1 ml g cod respectively for mcb supplemented with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps respectively however the highest rm of 14 ml l h was recorded when mcb incorporated with multi nps was used final ph values at the end of incubation dropped to a range of 4 3 0 060 to 4 6 0 040 without substantial difference between different supplements or dosage most likely due to the accumulation of acetic acid consequently promotion of fermentative hp using mcb incorporated with individual and multiple α fe2o3 nio and zno nps was found to be dosage and composition dependent α fe2o3 nps was the best individual supplement only slight improvements in hp were noted when α fe2o3 was used in dual or multiple combination with other nps combination of α fe2o3 200 mg l with nio 20 mg l and or zno nps 10 mg l significantly enhanced hp compared to their individual use mainly due to its high influence on hyd activity and relatively higher optimum dose in addition the dual addition of nio 20 mg l and zno nps 10 mg l substantially promoted hp and hyd enzyme activity compared to individual nio and zno nps 3 3 linear regression and principal components analyses linear regression analysis was conducted and correlation coefficients were obtained at a confidence level of 95 figs 7 and 8 and table s2 supplementary pca was also conducted to assess multiple variables considering all designed batch reactors fig s9a supplementary shows that the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 demonstrated nearly 94 variance in the data obtained the results confirm that hp was significantly correlated with residual acetic acid p 0 00010 and ethanol p 0 00080 with the latter correlation being in a reverse manner strong positive correlation was obtained between ethanol and acetic acid p 0 00020 acetaldehyde exhibited insignificant correlation with hp p 0 39 which can be attributed to its potential conversion to acetic acid or ethanol based on the effect of nps dosages α fe2o3 nps registered maximum variations compared to the control maximum hpr and hyd activity were highly correlated p 0 0041 whereas insignificant associations of hpr with adh and aldh activities were noted due possibly to the involvement of reversible redox reaction towards ethanol formation fig 8 significant correlation between adh and aldh activity was observed p 0 0017 which can be explained by the potential exchange between two forms of the essential coenzyme i e nad and nadh eqs 3 and 4 the pca among the maximum hpr and corresponding adh aldh and hyd enzyme activities showed that both pc1 and pc2 achieved total variance of 87 fig s9b supplementary both regression analysis and pca confirmed the positive impacts of individual dual and multi nps and the proposed pathway of metabolite products and correlations between related enzyme activities 4 conclusions mcb incorporated with α fe2o3 nio and zno nps individually and in combination substantially promoted hp from synthetic industrial wastewater containing meg maximum hy values of 37 2 5 34 2 0 and 33 3 2 ml g meg were obtained for mcb supplemented with 200 20 and 10 mg l of α fe2o3 nio and zno nps respectively compared to 26 2 1 ml g meg for the control cultures the results highlight the potential use of zno nps in the anaerobic fermentation process moreover higher and lower abundance of hydrogen producing clostridiales and ethanol forming microbes thermoanaerobacterales respectively were ascribed to nps addition hp was further improved when mcb was incorporated with dual and multi nps resulting in maximum improvements of 13 and 14 compared to individual nio and zno nps respectively adh aldh and hyd enzymes were significantly enhanced when mcb supplemented with nps were used significant correlations p 0 050 were found between hp with metabolite products i e acetic acid and ethanol and hyd

19077,sulfidogenic process using sulfate reducing bacteria srb has been used to remove arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters through the precipitation of arsenite with sulfide however excessive sulfide production and significant ph increase induced by sulfate reduction result in the formation of the mobile thioarsenite by products and the inefficiency and instability of arsenite removal especially when the arsenite level fluctuates in this study we proposed a novel sulfidogenic process driven by sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb for the arsenite removal under acidic conditions in a long term experiment efficient sulfide production 0 42 0 2 kg s m3 d was achieved without changing the acidic condition ph around 4 3 in a sulfur reduction bio reactor with the acidic sulfide containing effluents from the bio reactor over 99 of arsenite 10 mg as l in the arsenic contaminated water was precipitated without the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products even in the presence of excessive sulfide maintaining the acidic condition ph around 4 3 of the sulfide containing effluent was essential to ensure the efficient arsenite precipitation and minimize the formation of thioarsenite by products when the arsenite to sulfide molar ratios ranged from 0 1 to 0 46 an acid tolerant s0rb desulfurella was found to be responsible for the efficient dissimilatory sulfur reduction under acidic conditions without changing the solution ph significantly the microbial sulfur reduction may proceed through the direct electron transfer between the s0rb and sulfur particles and also through the indirect electron transport mediated by electron carriers the findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb working under acidic conditions can be a promising alternative to the srb based process for arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidogenic process wastewater treatment sulfur reducing bacteria acid mine drainage arsenic removal thioarsenite 1 introduction arsenic present in acid mine drainage amd metallurgy industry effluents soils surface and ground waters is a well recognized environmental concern due to its high toxicity to humans and other living organisms carlson et al 2002 jang and dempsey 2008 stafilov et al 2010 the who provisional guideline value of arsenic is 10 μg l who 2004 arsenite asiii and arsenate asv are the most abundant arsenic species in aqueous systems while arsenite exhibits much higher mobility and toxicity than arsenate bissen and frimmel fritz 2003 straif et al 2009 therefore the removal of arsenic especially arsenite is critical to the treatment of the arsenic contaminated waters sulfidogenic process based on the microbial sulfate reduction has been regarded as an attractive approach to remove arsenite and heavy metals from the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd groundwater and metallurgy industry effluents battaglia brunet et al 2012 kirk et al 2010 le pape et al 2017 the process makes use of sulfate reducing bacteria srb to generate hydrogen sulfide using organics as electron donors taking acetate as an example eq 1 and then arsenite reacts with sulfide to form arsenic sulfide precipitates as2s3 ass eqs 2 and 3 de matos et al 2018 le pape et al 2017 rittle et al 1995 the srb based sulfidogenic process is also capable of removing arsenate through the microbial reduction of arsenate to arsenite by srb and subsequent arsenite precipitation with sulfide rodriguez freire et al 2014 1 ch 3 cooh s o 4 2 s r b hs 2 co 2 oh h 2 o 2 2 h 3 aso 3 3 hs as 2 s 3 3 h 2 o 3 oh 3 h 3 aso 3 hs 2 h ass 3 h 2 o 4 as 2 s 3 hs 3 oh 2 as oh s 2 2 h 2 o however the arsenite removal performance of such processes is often unstable and unsatisfactory due to the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products battaglia brunet et al 2012 sulfate reduction generates a large amount of hydrogen sulfide and hydroxyl ions eq 1 and significantly elevates the ph level altun et al 2014 poinapen et al 2009 which favors the transformation of insoluble arsenite sulfide into thioarsenite in the presence of sulfide and at near neutral phs eq 4 bostick et al 2005 wilkin et al 2003 although the sulfide production in the sulfidogenic system could be controlled by adjusting the supply of organics to reduce the excessive sulfide to some extent the fluctuating arsenite concentrations in the arsenic contaminated waters may lead to the large fluctuations in the arsenite removal efficiency due to the formation of thioarsenite by products at the low arsenic to sulfide molar ratio as s rodriguez freire et al 2014 2016 webster 1990 therefore it is necessary to develop the sulfidogenic process to stably and completely remove arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters without the formation of thioarsenite by products as a novel biotechnology sulfur reduction process has been considered as an attractive alternative to sulfate reduction process in sulfidogenic arsenic treatment systems due to the substantial saving of electron donors and the remarkably high rate of sulfide production florentino et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a this novel sulfidogenic process driven by sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb may be used to remove arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters in this process sulfide is produced via microbial sulfur reduction eq 5 florentino et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a and then arsenite can be removed through precipitation with sulfide eqs 2 and 3 5 ch 3 cooh 4 s 0 2 h 2 o s 0 r b 4 hs 2 co 2 4 h compared to the microbial sulfate reduction process the microbial sulfur reduction has been found to consume 66 80 less organic carbon on the basis of equivalent sulfide production qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b more importantly the sulfur reduction generates protons eq 5 which minimize the ph increase in the arsenic contaminated waters and may eliminate the formation of thioarsenite by products our previous studies have demonstrated the efficient sulfide production and removal of heavy metals e g mercury under near neutral conditions ph 6 0 9 0 sun et al 2018b wang et al 2018 however the key challenge is to efficiently produce sulfide by s0rb for arsenite removal at the ph levels relevant to the acidic arsenic contaminated waters 2 5 0 therefore this study aims to investigate the sulfide production and arsenite removal by the proposed sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb under acidic conditions the performance of sulfide generation in a bench scale sulfur packed bed bio reactor under acidic conditions was evaluated the efficiency of arsenite precipitation from a synthetic contaminated water containing arsenite with the sulfide containing effluent was tested the effects of ph and arsenite to sulfide molar ratio as s on the efficiency of arsenite removal and the formation of thioarsenite by products were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigation of sulfide production and arsenite removal in the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb a bench scale sulfidogenic system that included a sulfur reducing bio reactor and an arsenite precipitation tank see fig 1 was constructed to investigate the performances of sulfide production by microbial sulfur reduction and arsenite removal the sulfur packed bed bio reactor was a plexiglass column reactor 6 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height which was filled with sulfur particles 99 9 octasulfur 10 30 mesh damao china the volume of the sulfur bed was 1 15 l seeding sludge with a high abundance of srb was obtained from the sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong ye and zhang 2013 a concentrated synthetic substrate with the return water from the arsenite precipitator was continuously pumped into the reactor from the bottom at room temperature 25 c the concentrated synthetic substrate containing acetate yeast extract and other components was prepared according to our previous studies table s1 sun et al 2018b wang et al 2018 the operation of the sulfur packed bed bio reactor was divided into four phases the detailed operational parameters including hydraulic retention time hrt influent toc concentration and ph are listed in table 1 the hrt was fixed at 6 7 h and the influent ph was gradually decreased from 7 0 to 4 0 in phases i iv to optimize the rate of sulfide production under acidic conditions influent and effluent solution samples were daily collected to measure dissolved sulfide total organic carbon toc redox potential eh and ph aliquots of sulfur particle samples were taken from the bio reactor on days 60 90 and 150 to reveal the changes in the microbial community compositions the efficiency of the arsenite removal by sulfide precipitation was investigated using a 4 l precipitation tank 15 cm in length 15 cm in width and 20 cm in height the effluents from the sulfur reducing bio reactor were collected and then mixed with a synthetic arsenite containing wastewater at a volumetric ratio of 1 4 the synthetic arsenite containing wastewater was prepared by dissolving sodium arsenite na3aso3 aike reagent china

potential and dissolved sulfide 2 2 batch tests to evaluate the effects of ph of sulfide containing effluents and as s molar ratio on the efficiency of arsenite removal and the formation thioarsenite additional batch experiments were performed under the conditions relevant to the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb 50 ml glass bottles with butyl rubber caps with 25 ml of synthetic arsenite

9h2o sigma aldrich with de oxygenated water and ph was adjusted to 4 5 7 5 by adding 0 5 m hcl or naoh the sealed bottles were then mixed on an orbital shaker at a rotating speed of 200 rpm after 3 h for reaction solution samples were collected for the analysis of arsenite ph redox potential and dissolved sulfide to identify the formation of the thioarsenite by products parallel tests were also conducted at an as s molar ratio of 0 1 the solution samples were filtrated through a 0 45 μm membrane and then vacuum freeze dried the obtained solids were collected and subjected to the characterization using raman microscope 2 3 geochemical modeling to understand the formation and stability of arsenic compounds under the experimental conditions eh ph diagrams were constructed using

in the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb were evaluated and the results are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the concentrations of sulfide produced in the sulfur reducing bio reactor ranged from 45 to 145 mg s l with an average of 91 mg s l when the influent ph was decreased from 7 0 to 5 0 in phases i iii the sulfide concentration fluctuated around 114 mg l at an influent of ph 4 0 in phase iv 126 d and the corresponding sulfide production rates were 0 42 0 2 kg s m3 d fig 3 demonstrating the efficient sulfide production by s0rb under acidic conditions the mass ratios of the consumed organic carbon to the produced sulfide c s which was an indicator of sulfur reducing activities ranged from 0 24 to 0 75 mg c mg s in phases i iii and then retained at 0 34 0 12 mg c mg s in phase iv fig 3 fig 2a also shows the high efficiencies of the arsenite removal from the synthetic amd by mixing the sulfide containing effluent from the bio reactor with amd at a volumetric ratio of 1 4 the arsenite removal efficiency increased from 70 to 97 in phases i iii and it remained above 99 in phase iv the products of the arsenite precipitation by sulfide can be realgar ass and orpiment as2s3 with stoichiometric as s molar ratios of 1 0 and 0 67 respectively in the four phases the average molar ratio of arsenite removed and sulfide consumed δas δs in the precipitation tank was 0 65 fig 2a suggesting that orpiment was the major product the results also suggest that the complete conversion of arsenite into the insoluble orpiment precipitates eq 2 was achieved without the formation of soluble arsenic by products e g thioarsenic complexes under acidic conditions even though the fluctuations in the sulfide production resulted in remarkable variations in the initial as s molar ratios 0 1 0 46 the highly efficient and stable arsenite removal achieved in the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb can be mainly due to the proper redox potential and the low ph of the sulfide containing effluents from the bio reactor as shown in fig 2b the redox potentials of the effluents from the bio reactor were in the range of 141 178 mv in the four phases which favor the formation of arsenic sulfide precipitates kumar et al 2016 fig 2b also shows that the ph values of the sulfide containing effluents were 6 3 0 4 in phases i iii and they remained around 4 3 in phase iv which were very close to the influent ph p 0 05 it should be noticed that the microbial sulfur reduction generates protons h and bisulfide anions hs pka 7 05 eq 5 the reactions of bisulfide with protons at ph lower than 7 eq 6 can offset the ph decrease caused by the proton production 6 hs h h 2 s aq p k a 7 05 the minor ph increases in the sulfur reducing bio reactor ensure the stable arsenite removal during the precipitation because the acidic ph is known to inhibit the transformation of arsenic sulfide precipitates into soluble thioarsenic complexes in the presence of excessive dissolved sulfide as s 0 67 wilkin et al 2003 in comparison the microbial sulfate reduction generates a large amount of alkalinity eq 1 which can increase the ph levels by 2 4 units in the sulfidogenic system driven by srb altun et al 2014 battaglia brunet et al 2012 rodriguez freire et al 2016 the significant ph increases often induce the formation of thioarsenite by products in the presence of excessive sulfide and result in the failure of arsenite removal these findings demonstrate that the proposed technology can be a promising alternative to the sulfidogenic system driven by srb for the arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd metallurgy industry effluents soils surface and ground waters from the aspect of reliability 3 2 microbial community compositions in the sulfur reducing bio reactor the microbial community compositions in the sulfur reducing bio reactor collected in days 60 90 and 150 were analyzed to identify the sulfur reducers tolerant to the acidic conditions the results of rarefaction analysis based on operational taxonomic units at 3 dissimilarity show that the diversity of the microbial community was well represented by the sequencing depth of the samples collected fig s1 as shown in fig 4 at genus level azovibrio 26 7 paludibacter 14 3 zoogloea 7 7 desulfovibrio 4 8 and desulfurella 2 4 were the major genera identified in the bio reactor in day 60 paludibacter is a fermentative bacteria and desulfovibrio and desulfurella are known as sulfur reducers bonch osmolovskaya et al 1990 miroshnichenko et al 1998 although some sulfate reducers such as desulfuromonas and sulfurospirillum were also identified their relative abundances were all below 0 5 in day 150 only two major genera including paludibacter and desulfurella were identified and their relative abundances increased significantly to 34 8 and 49 2 respectively therefore desulfurella was the dominant sulfur reducer in the bio reactor at ph around 4 3 3 3 discussion 3 3 1 microbial sulfur reduction under acidic conditions the results obtained in this study demonstrate that the efficient sulfide production at ph around 4 3 is essential to the efficient arsenite removal in the wide range of as s molar ratios the average sulfide production rate spr observed in this study was 0 42 0 2 kg s m3 d at ph around 4 3 fig 3 the spr was lower than those of sulfur reduction 1 47 2 7 kg s m3 d at ph 6 0 9 0 hao et al 2014 sun et al 2018a zhang et al 2018a however the spr observed was still comparable to those of sulfate reduction processes at ph 6 0 9 0 0 04 1 kg s m3 d and much higher than those at ph 3 5 5 5 0 01 0 04 kg s m3 d elliott et al 1998 hao et al 2014 jong and parry 2006 qiu et al 2017 in addition the carbon consumption of microbial sulfur reduction under acidic conditions was also much lower than that of the sulfate reduction process the c s mass ratios of the sulfur reduction measured in this study were 0 34 0 12 mg c mg s fig 3 which were close to those of sulfur reduction at ph 6 0 9 0 sun et al 2018b zhang et al 2018a but much lower than those of the sulfate reduction process with an average c s ratio of 1 1 mg c mg s qiu et al 2017 as a reference the theoretical c s ratios of sulfur reduction and sulfate reduction are 0 19 and 0 75 respectively these findings suggest that the microbial sulfur reduction process under acidic conditions has advantages in generating sulfide for the arsenite removal and saving carbon source compared to the sulfate reduction process further investigation is needed to evaluate the overall cost effectiveness of the proposed s0rb based process taking the costs of carbon source and elemental sulfur mechanisms of the microbial sulfur reduction under acidic conditions may be different from those under near neutral conditions under the near neutral conditions polysulfides s n 1 2 that are formed via the reaction between sulfide and sulfur eq 7 are the key intermediates which increase the bio availability of insoluble sulfur and accelerate microbial sulfur reduction boyd and druschel 2013 liang et al 2016 7 hs n s 0 s n 1 2 h however polysulfides decompose at ph lower than 6 0 kleinjan et al 2005 and the direct electron transfer and or indirect electron transport from s0rb to sulfur may play an important role during the microbial sulfur reduction under acidic conditions as shown in fig 5 desulfurella bacteria within the biofilm which are attached onto the surface of sulfur lumps and contact sulfur can reduce sulfur through direct electron transfer the direct electron transfer has been reported to be an important pathway for the microbial reduction of iron oxides by srb and iron reducing bacteria lovley 1997 in addition desulfurella without direct contact with sulfur can also reduce sulfur via electron transport mediated by electron carriers some strains in desulfurella genus are capable of reducing sulfur via electron carriers such as encoded menaquinones naowires and cytochromes which shuttle electrons within the cells to the sulfur surface florentino et al 2017 rabus et al 2006 further investigation is needed to confirm the proposed mechanisms it should be noted that the unionized hydrogen sulfide h2saq and protonated organic acids e g acetic acid and formic acid may be toxic to microorganisms under the acidic conditions at ph around 4 3 over 99 9 of dissolved sulfide generated in the bio reactor at ph around 4 3 was h2saq pka 7 05 and 71 of acetate added is in the form of acetic acid pka 4 76 h2saq and acetic acid are known to inhibit the activity of srb s0rb and fermentative bacteria significantly florentino et al 2017 kimura et al 2006 however the biofilm growing on the surface of the sulfur lumps is expected to shield the bacteria from the toxic h2saq hao et al 2015 sun et al 2018a in addition desulfurella has been reported to bear the genes encoding resistance to the acidic conditions ph 3 0 5 0 florentino et al 2016 this can explain the efficient sulfide production by desulfurella observed in this study in the real practice the treated water at acidic ph can be returned and reused to prepare the organic containing substrate of the sulfur reducing bio reactor fig 1 and the ph adjustment will be minimized the sulfidogenic process driven by acid tolerant s0rb may also be an attractive approach for arsenate removal from the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd metallurgy industry effluents soils surface and ground waters the microbial reduction of arsenate to arsenite by srb has been well documented in the literature rodriguez freire et al 2014 2016 the microbial reduction of arsenate and arsenite precipitation with sulfide are expected to be simultaneously achieved in the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb under the acidic conditions which deserve further investigation in the future 3 3 2 arsenite speciation in the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb ph and as s molar ratio can be the key factors which influence the efficiency of arsenite removal and the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products in the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb previous studies have demonstrated that the higher ph and lower as s molar ratio enhance the conversion of as2s3 into soluble thioarsenic complexes as oh 2s as oh s2 2 and as sh 4 couture and van cappellen 2011 newman et al 1997 planer friedrich and wallschläger 2009 stauder et al 2005 suess et al 2009 wilkin et al 2003 found that the fraction of soluble thioarsenic complexes significantly increased when the as s molar ratio decreased from 1 0 to 0 25 and ph increased from 7 to 10 in the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb tested in this study the formation of thioarsenite by products at the fluctuating as s molar ratios 0 1 0 46 lead to the low arsenite removal efficiencies at ph 6 0 7 5 phases i and ii the formation of thioarsenite by products was suppressed at ph 4 0 5 5 which ensured the efficient removal of arsenite in phase iv the trends are well supported by the results of batch experiments under the conditions relevant to the sulfidogenic system fig 6 when the ph levels of the sulfide solutions decreased to 6 5 5 5 and 4 5 the removal efficiencies were significantly enhanced and exceeded 99 at as s molar ratios of 0 35 0 1 0 55 and 0 05 0 55 respectively the formation of thioarsenite by products was not observed in the raman spectra of freeze dried solid samples collected at the as s molar ratio of 0 1 and ph 5 5 and 4 5 the arsenic speciation at an arsenite concentration of 10 mg l and an as s molar ratios of 0 1 is simulated using phreeplot also shows that thioarsenic complexes form at ph 5 9 9 2 realgar and orpiment are the dominant arsenic products at ph 2 5 9 fig s2a our simulation results are in agreement with the eh ph diagrams constructed by lu and zhu 2011 and rodriguez freire et al 2014 the predictions well explain the complete precipitation of arsenite without the formation of thioarsenic complexes in the presence of excessive dissolved sulfide at ph lower than 5 5 the critical ph values for the thioarsenite formation at different equilibrium as s molar ratios are also plotted in fig s2b to minimize the formation of thioarsenic complexes the ph value should be maintained below 6 9 at a high as s molar ratio of 0 67 or below 5 5 at a low as s molar ratio of 0 05 these findings suggest that maintaining the as s molar ratio at the theoretical level of forming orpiment 0 67 would be favorable for the simultaneous removal of both arsenite and sulfide at a neutral ph level however to ensure the efficient removal of arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters excessive sulfide should be provided although a portion of dissolved sulfide provided for arsenite removal at as s molar ratios of lower than 0 67 will remain in water after arsenite removal the residual sulfide can serve as a good precipitant for the removal of other heavy metals such as zinc copper and cadmium co present in the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd and metallurgy industry effluents sun et al 2018b in real practice the closed reactor system should be employed to minimize the risk of hydrogen sulfide gas release into the atmosphere in this study the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb worked well at an acidic condition ph 4 3 to produce excessive sulfide without ph elevation which ensured the highly efficient and stable arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters without thioarsenite formation even though the as s molar ratio fluctuated significantly 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the long term performances of sulfide production by s0rb under acidic conditions and arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters by the sulfidogenic process efficient sulfide production via microbial sulfur reduction by desulfurella an acid tolerant sulfur reducing genus was realized in a sulfur packed bed bio reactor at ph around 4 3 the sulfur reduction process did not increase the solution ph significantly and consumed much less organic carbon compared to sulfate reduction processes by mixing with the acidic sulfide containing effluents from the bio reactor arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters was completely and stably precipitated as orpiment even in the presence of excessive sulfide the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products was completely minimized at acidic conditions ph 4 5 and a wide range of as s molar ratios 0 05 0 55 the proposed sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb working under acidic conditions can thus be a promising alternative to srb based processes for arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd metallurgy industry effluents soils surface and ground waters especially under the conditions with fluctuating arsenite levels and sulfide production further investigation is needed to evaluate the overall cost effectiveness of the proposed s0rb based process taking the costs of

19077,sulfidogenic process using sulfate reducing bacteria srb has been used to remove arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters through the precipitation of arsenite with sulfide however excessive sulfide production and significant ph increase induced by sulfate reduction result in the formation of the mobile thioarsenite by products and the inefficiency and instability of arsenite removal especially when the arsenite level fluctuates in this study we proposed a novel sulfidogenic process driven by sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb for the arsenite removal under acidic conditions in a long term experiment efficient sulfide production 0 42 0 2 kg s m3 d was achieved without changing the acidic condition ph around 4 3 in a sulfur reduction bio reactor with the acidic sulfide containing effluents from the bio reactor over 99 of arsenite 10 mg as l in the arsenic contaminated water was precipitated without the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products even in the presence of excessive sulfide maintaining the acidic condition ph around 4 3 of the sulfide containing effluent was essential to ensure the efficient arsenite precipitation and minimize the formation of thioarsenite by products when the arsenite to sulfide molar ratios ranged from 0 1 to 0 46 an acid tolerant s0rb desulfurella was found to be responsible for the efficient dissimilatory sulfur reduction under acidic conditions without changing the solution ph significantly the microbial sulfur reduction may proceed through the direct electron transfer between the s0rb and sulfur particles and also through the indirect electron transport mediated by electron carriers the findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb working under acidic conditions can be a promising alternative to the srb based process for arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidogenic process wastewater treatment sulfur reducing bacteria acid mine drainage arsenic removal thioarsenite 1 introduction arsenic present in acid mine drainage amd metallurgy industry effluents soils surface and ground waters is a well recognized environmental concern due to its high toxicity to humans and other living organisms carlson et al 2002 jang and dempsey 2008 stafilov et al 2010 the who provisional guideline value of arsenic is 10 μg l who 2004 arsenite asiii and arsenate asv are the most abundant arsenic species in aqueous systems while arsenite exhibits much higher mobility and toxicity than arsenate bissen and frimmel fritz 2003 straif et al 2009 therefore the removal of arsenic especially arsenite is critical to the treatment of the arsenic contaminated waters sulfidogenic process based on the microbial sulfate reduction has been regarded as an attractive approach to remove arsenite and heavy metals from the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd groundwater and metallurgy industry effluents battaglia brunet et al 2012 kirk et al 2010 le pape et al 2017 the process makes use of sulfate reducing bacteria srb to generate hydrogen sulfide using organics as electron donors taking acetate as an example eq 1 and then arsenite reacts with sulfide to form arsenic sulfide precipitates as2s3 ass eqs 2 and 3 de matos et al 2018 le pape et al 2017 rittle et al 1995 the srb based sulfidogenic process is also capable of removing arsenate through the microbial reduction of arsenate to arsenite by srb and subsequent arsenite precipitation with sulfide rodriguez freire et al 2014

such processes is often unstable and unsatisfactory due to the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products battaglia brunet et al 2012 sulfate reduction generates a large amount of hydrogen sulfide and hydroxyl ions eq 1 and significantly elevates the ph level altun et al 2014 poinapen et al 2009 which favors the transformation of insoluble arsenite sulfide into thioarsenite in the presence of sulfide and at near neutral phs eq 4 bostick et al 2005 wilkin et al 2003 although the sulfide production in the sulfidogenic system could be controlled by adjusting the supply of organics to reduce the excessive sulfide to some extent the fluctuating arsenite concentrations in the arsenic contaminated waters may lead to the large fluctuations in the arsenite removal efficiency due to the formation of thioarsenite by products at the low arsenic to sulfide molar ratio as s rodriguez freire et al 2014 2016 webster 1990 therefore it is necessary to develop the sulfidogenic process to stably and completely remove arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters without the formation of thioarsenite by products as a novel biotechnology sulfur reduction process has been considered as an attractive alternative to sulfate reduction process in sulfidogenic arsenic treatment systems due to the substantial saving of electron donors and the remarkably high rate of sulfide production florentino et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a this novel sulfidogenic process driven by sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb may be used to remove arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters in this process sulfide is produced via microbial sulfur reduction eq 5 florentino et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a and then arsenite can be removed through precipitation with sulfide eqs 2 and 3 5 ch 3 cooh 4 s 0 2 h 2

production qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b more importantly the sulfur reduction generates protons eq 5 which minimize the ph increase in the arsenic contaminated waters and may eliminate the formation of thioarsenite by products our previous studies have demonstrated the efficient sulfide production and removal of heavy metals e g mercury under near neutral conditions ph 6 0

therefore this study aims to investigate the sulfide production and arsenite removal by the proposed sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb under acidic conditions the performance of sulfide generation in a bench scale sulfur packed bed bio reactor under acidic conditions was evaluated the efficiency of arsenite precipitation from a synthetic contaminated water containing arsenite with the sulfide containing effluent was tested the effects of ph and arsenite to sulfide molar ratio as s on the efficiency of arsenite removal and the formation of thioarsenite by products were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 investigation of sulfide production and arsenite removal in the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb a bench scale sulfidogenic system that included a sulfur reducing bio reactor and an arsenite precipitation tank see fig 1 was constructed to investigate the performances of sulfide production by microbial sulfur reduction and arsenite removal the sulfur packed bed bio

with stoichiometric as s molar ratios of 1 0 and 0 67 respectively in the four phases the average molar ratio of arsenite removed and sulfide consumed δas δs in the precipitation tank was 0 65 fig 2a

soluble arsenic by products e g thioarsenic complexes under acidic conditions even though the fluctuations in the sulfide production resulted in remarkable variations in the initial as s molar ratios 0 1 0 46 the highly efficient and stable arsenite removal achieved in the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb can be mainly due to the proper redox potential and the low ph of the sulfide containing effluents from the bio reactor as shown in fig 2b the redox potentials of the effluents from the bio reactor were in the range of 141 178 mv in the four phases which favor the formation of arsenic sulfide precipitates kumar et al 2016 fig 2b also shows that the ph values of the sulfide containing effluents were 6 3 0 4 in phases i iii and they remained around 4 3 in phase iv which were very close to the influent ph p 0 05 it should be noticed that the microbial sulfur reduction generates protons h and bisulfide anions hs pka 7 05 eq 5 the reactions of bisulfide with protons at ph lower

reactor the microbial community compositions in the sulfur reducing bio reactor collected in days 60 90 and 150 were analyzed to identify the sulfur reducers tolerant to the acidic conditions the results of rarefaction analysis based on operational taxonomic units at 3 dissimilarity show that the diversity of the microbial community was well represented by the sequencing depth of the samples collected fig s1 as shown in fig 4 at genus level azovibrio 26 7 paludibacter 14 3 zoogloea 7 7 desulfovibrio 4 8 and desulfurella 2 4 were the major genera identified in the bio reactor in day 60 paludibacter is a fermentative bacteria and desulfovibrio and desulfurella are known as sulfur reducers bonch osmolovskaya et al 1990 miroshnichenko et al 1998 although some sulfate reducers such as desulfuromonas and sulfurospirillum were also identified their relative abundances were all below 0 5 in day 150 only two major genera including paludibacter and desulfurella were identified and their relative abundances increased significantly to 34 8 and 49 2 respectively therefore desulfurella was the dominant sulfur reducer in the bio reactor at ph around 4 3 3 3 discussion 3 3 1 microbial

wide range of as s molar ratios the average sulfide production rate spr observed in this study was 0 42 0 2 kg s m3 d at ph around 4 3 fig 3 the spr was lower than those of sulfur reduction 1 47 2 7 kg s m3 d at ph 6 0 9 0 hao et al 2014 sun et al 2018a zhang et al 2018a however the spr observed was still comparable to those of sulfate reduction processes at ph 6 0 9 0 0 04 1 kg s m3 d and much higher than those at ph 3 5 5 5 0 01 0 04 kg s m3 d elliott et al 1998 hao et al 2014 jong and parry 2006 qiu et al 2017 in addition the carbon consumption of microbial sulfur reduction under acidic conditions was also much lower than that of the sulfate reduction process the c s mass ratios of the sulfur reduction measured in this study were 0 34 0 12 mg c mg s fig 3 which were close to those of sulfur reduction at ph 6 0 9 0 sun et al 2018b zhang et al 2018a but much lower than those of the sulfate reduction process with an average c s ratio of 1 1 mg c mg s qiu et al 2017 as a reference the theoretical c s ratios of sulfur reduction and sulfate reduction are 0 19 and 0 75 respectively these findings suggest that the microbial sulfur reduction process under acidic conditions has advantages in generating sulfide for the arsenite removal and saving carbon source compared to the sulfate reduction process further investigation is needed to evaluate the overall cost effectiveness of the proposed s0rb based process taking the costs of carbon source and elemental sulfur mechanisms of the microbial sulfur reduction under acidic conditions may be different from those under near neutral conditions under the near neutral conditions polysulfides s n 1 2 that are formed via the reaction between sulfide and sulfur eq 7 are the key intermediates which increase the bio availability of insoluble sulfur and accelerate microbial sulfur reduction boyd and druschel 2013 liang et al 2016 7 hs n s 0 s n 1 2 h however polysulfides decompose at ph lower than 6 0 kleinjan et al 2005 and the direct electron transfer and or indirect electron transport from s0rb to sulfur may play an important role during the microbial sulfur reduction under acidic conditions as shown in fig 5 desulfurella bacteria within the biofilm which are attached onto the surface of sulfur lumps and contact sulfur can reduce sulfur through direct electron transfer the direct electron transfer has been reported to be an important pathway for the microbial reduction of iron oxides by srb and iron reducing bacteria lovley 1997 in addition desulfurella without direct contact with sulfur can also reduce sulfur via electron transport mediated by electron carriers some strains in desulfurella genus are capable of reducing sulfur via electron carriers such as encoded menaquinones naowires and cytochromes which shuttle electrons within the cells to the sulfur surface florentino et al 2017 rabus et al 2006 further investigation is needed to confirm the proposed mechanisms it should be noted that the unionized hydrogen sulfide h2saq and protonated organic acids e g acetic acid and formic acid may be toxic to microorganisms under the acidic conditions at ph around 4 3 over 99 9 of dissolved sulfide generated in the bio reactor at ph around 4 3 was h2saq pka 7 05 and 71 of acetate added is in the form of acetic acid pka 4 76 h2saq and acetic acid are known to inhibit the activity of srb s0rb and fermentative bacteria significantly florentino et al 2017 kimura et al 2006 however the biofilm growing on the surface of the sulfur lumps is expected to shield the bacteria from the toxic h2saq hao et al 2015 sun et al 2018a in addition desulfurella has been reported to bear the genes encoding resistance to the acidic conditions ph 3 0 5 0 florentino et al 2016 this can explain the efficient sulfide production by desulfurella observed in this study in the real practice the treated water at acidic ph can be returned and reused to prepare the organic containing substrate of the sulfur reducing bio reactor fig 1 and the ph adjustment will be minimized the sulfidogenic process driven by acid tolerant s0rb may also be an attractive approach for arsenate removal from the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd metallurgy industry effluents soils surface and ground waters the microbial reduction of arsenate to arsenite by srb has been well documented in the literature rodriguez freire et al 2014 2016 the microbial reduction of arsenate and arsenite precipitation with sulfide are expected to be simultaneously achieved in the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb under the acidic conditions which deserve further investigation in the future 3 3 2 arsenite speciation in the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb ph and as s molar ratio can be the key factors which influence the efficiency of arsenite removal and the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products in the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb previous studies have demonstrated that the higher ph and lower as s molar ratio enhance the conversion of as2s3 into soluble thioarsenic complexes as oh 2s as oh s2 2 and as sh 4 couture and van cappellen 2011 newman et al 1997 planer friedrich and wallschläger 2009 stauder et al 2005 suess et al 2009 wilkin et al 2003 found that the fraction of soluble thioarsenic complexes significantly increased when the as s molar ratio decreased from 1 0 to 0 25 and ph increased from 7 to 10 in the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb tested in this study the formation of thioarsenite by products at the fluctuating as s molar ratios 0 1 0 46 lead to the low arsenite removal efficiencies at ph 6 0 7 5 phases i and ii the formation of thioarsenite by products was suppressed at ph 4 0 5 5 which ensured the efficient removal of arsenite in phase iv the trends are well supported by the results of batch experiments under the conditions relevant to the sulfidogenic system fig 6 when the ph levels of the sulfide solutions decreased to 6 5 5 5 and 4 5 the removal efficiencies were significantly enhanced and exceeded 99 at as s molar ratios of 0 35 0 1 0 55 and 0 05 0 55 respectively the formation of thioarsenite by products was not observed in the raman spectra of freeze dried solid samples collected at the as s molar ratio of 0 1 and ph 5 5 and 4 5 the arsenic speciation at an arsenite concentration of 10 mg l and an as s molar ratios of 0 1 is simulated using phreeplot also shows that thioarsenic complexes form at ph 5 9 9 2 realgar and orpiment are the dominant arsenic products at ph 2 5 9 fig s2a our simulation results are in agreement with the eh ph diagrams constructed by lu and zhu 2011 and rodriguez freire et al 2014 the predictions well explain the complete precipitation of arsenite without the formation of thioarsenic complexes in the presence of excessive dissolved sulfide at ph lower than 5 5 the critical ph values for the thioarsenite formation at different equilibrium as s molar ratios are also plotted in fig s2b to minimize the formation of thioarsenic complexes the ph value should be maintained below 6 9 at a high as s molar ratio of 0 67 or below 5 5 at a low as s molar ratio of 0 05 these findings suggest that maintaining the as s molar ratio at the theoretical level of forming orpiment 0 67 would be favorable for the simultaneous removal of both arsenite and sulfide at a neutral ph level however to ensure the efficient removal of arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters excessive sulfide should be provided although a portion of dissolved sulfide provided for arsenite removal at as s molar ratios of lower than 0 67 will remain in water after arsenite removal the residual sulfide can serve as a good precipitant for the removal of other heavy metals such as zinc copper and cadmium co present in the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd and metallurgy industry effluents sun et al 2018b in real practice the closed reactor system should be employed to minimize the risk of hydrogen sulfide gas release into the atmosphere in this study the sulfidogenic system driven by s0rb worked well at an acidic condition ph 4 3 to produce excessive sulfide without ph elevation which ensured the highly efficient and stable arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters without thioarsenite formation even though the as s molar ratio fluctuated significantly 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the long term performances of sulfide production by s0rb under acidic conditions and arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters by the sulfidogenic process efficient sulfide production via microbial sulfur reduction by desulfurella an acid tolerant sulfur reducing genus was realized in a sulfur packed bed bio reactor at ph around 4 3 the sulfur reduction process did not increase the solution ph significantly and consumed much less organic carbon compared to sulfate reduction processes by mixing with the acidic sulfide containing effluents from the bio reactor arsenite from the arsenic contaminated waters was completely and stably precipitated as orpiment even in the presence of excessive sulfide the formation of soluble thioarsenite by products was completely minimized at acidic conditions ph 4 5 and a wide range of as s molar ratios 0 05 0 55 the proposed sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb working under acidic conditions can thus be a promising alternative to srb based processes for arsenite removal from the arsenic contaminated waters such as amd metallurgy industry effluents soils surface and ground waters especially under the conditions with fluctuating arsenite levels and sulfide production further investigation is needed to evaluate the overall cost effectiveness of the proposed s0rb based process taking the costs of

19078,while wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents have become increasingly recognized as a stressor for receiving rivers their effects on river microbial communities remain elusive moreover global change is increasing the frequency and duration of desiccation events in river networks and we ignore how desiccation might influence the response of microbial communities to wwtp effluents in this study we evaluated the interaction between desiccation events and wwtp effluents under different dilution capacities specifically we used artificial streams in a replicated regressional design exposing first a section of the streams to a 7 day desiccation period and then the full stream to different levels of a realistic wwtp effluent dilution from 0 to 100 of wwtp effluent proportion of the total stream flow the microbial community response was assessed by means of high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and quantitative pcr targeting ecologically relevant microbial groups threshold indicator taxa analysis titan was used together with model fitting to determine community thresholds and potential indicator taxa results show significant interactions between wwtp effluents and desiccation particularly when sediment type is considered indicator taxa included members of proteobacteria actinobacteria and cyanobacteria with abrupt changes in community structure at wwtp effluent proportion of the total flow above 50 which is related to nutrient levels ranging 4 6 5 2 mg n n o 3 l 1 0 21 0 32 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 7 09 9 00 mg doc l 1 our work indicates that situations where wwtp effluents account for 50 of the total river flow might risk of dramatic microbial community structure changes and should be avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater

treatment plant effluent wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction pollution from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a common impact on freshwater ecosystems rice and westerhoff 2017 through their effluents wwtps subject rivers to a wide range of chemical stressors including organic matter inorganic nutrients in excess carey and migliaccio 2009 and many organic micropollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals or industrial products rodriguez mozaz et al 2004 kuzmanovic et al 2015 moreover rivers may receive other stressors that co occur with these chemicals amongst these stressors interruption of water flow and higher water temperature threaten the survival of river biota as they are at the base of local extinctions and the overall decrease of biodiversity dudgeon 2010 these stressors imply environmental filters as they act as additional selective pressures and condition the composition and relative abundance of species in the riverine biological communities at the discharge point wwtp effluent is mixed and therefore diluted with river discharge the proportion of wwtp effluent to the total river flow defines the dilution factor lower dilution factors indicate a larger fraction of wwtp effluent in the river the dilution factor ultimately depends on variations of river flow and wwtp effluents and the balance between them exposure time and interaction with environmental factors add even more complexity to the effect that wwtp effluents may have on river ecosystems sabater et al 2016 under high anthropogenic pressure e g water abstraction wwtp effluents can make up a significant proportion of the flow of the receiving water body a recent analysis of the current situation in the us showed that wwtp effluents make up more than 50 of the river flow for over 900 receiving systems at the point of discharge i e 6 of the studied rivers making these rivers predominantly composed of wwtp effluent rice and westerhoff 2017 moreover global change is expected to change natural variation of rivers flow towards increased low flow and complete desiccation periods so the number of wwtp effluent dominated rivers worldwide is expected to increase döll and schmied 2012 the biota inhabiting freshwater ecosystems is the final receptor of these co occurring pressures freshwater communities are modulated by chemical e g dissolved organic matter nutrients and physical e g alterations in water flow stressors as well as their interactions sabater et al 2016 the response of each group of organisms e g bacteria algae invertebrates or fish to chemical and physical stress is related to their life cycle and environmental requirements shorter life cycle organisms such as bacterial communities may respond to rapid changes occurring in the river environment including physical e g water flow temperature and chemical e g nutrient abundance organic matter availability stressors bacteria inhabiting sediments can be the most responsive to short term changes after these pressures because of their short generation time and intimate contact with the substratum sabater et al 2007 besemer et al 2012 segner and sabater 2014 the overall effect of wwtp effluents on river bacterial communities mostly depends on the resulting effluent proportion to the total flow of the receiving water body effluents from wwtp often induce changes in river bacterial diversity wakelin et al 2008 drury et al 2013 price et al 2018 while some authors have described increases in bacterial diversity as a result of exposure to wwtp effluents price et al 2018 others have associated them to decreases wakelin et al 2008 drury et al 2013 the complex nature of bacterial communities which are extremely diverse together with the large uncertainty that comes along with field approximations is at the base of these non consistent responses desiccation in turn can drive the structure of river bacterial communities from riverine to terrestrial such as those occurring in soils pohlon et al 2013 2018 experimental approximations to the effects of wwtp effluents on bacterial communities are usually focused on the comparison between the community composition upstream and downstream of a wwtp discharge point using composite metrics such as richness and diversity marti et al 2013 although these approaches are useful to investigate the effects of wwtp effluents at the local scale they are usually placed in the context of specific hydrological conditions thus being impossible to derive ecological thresholds from them that could be useful for water managers and policy makers moreover studies assessing how desiccation events modulate the response of bacterial communities to wwtp effluent pollution under different dilution capacities are still lacking sophisticated experimental designs under controlled conditions and much more sensitive community analysis methods are required to disentangle the effects of wwtp effluents and desiccation events in river bacterial communities this study aimed to evaluate the overall effects of a realistic wwtp effluent and its interaction with desiccation on the bacterial community inhabiting river sediments we used 24 artificial streams to investigate under controlled conditions how different proportions of wwtp effluent alter sediment bacterial community moreover we applied a simulated 7 day desiccation period to assess how it interacts with the gradient of wwtp effluent dilution we used non parametric change point determination together with indicator taxa analysis to determine community thresholds and reliably responding bacterial taxa dufrêne and legendre 1997 king and richardson 2003 qian et al 2003 we hypothesize that bacterial community composition will shift across the gradient of wwtp effluent dilution towards increased abundance of pollution tolerant taxa and that desiccation will modify the effects of the wwtp effluent by selecting highly tolerant taxa 2 methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was performed at the indoor experimental streams facility of the catalan institute for water research girona eu between january 19th and march 16th 2017 the experimental streams facility consists of 24 artificial streams see details in section 2 2 that have been previously used to explore the effects of contaminants and physical perturbations on stream biofilms acuña et al 2015 freixa et al 2017 subirats et al 2018 each of the 24 artificial streams was assigned to one of eight treatments 0 14 29 43 58 72 86 and 100 of wwtp effluent water following a gradient of wwtp effluent dilution these values span from an unpolluted river to an extreme low dilution condition where all the flow 100 originates from wwtp discharge river sediment containing biofilm was transported to the artificial streams and allowed to acclimate in clean water for 2 weeks at this point 3 replicated samples were taken to compare the community developed in our artificial streams at the onset of the experiment with the communities present at the source location i e the llémena river girona eu after the acclimation period wire net baskets containing biofilm were placed out of the experimental streams and desiccated for 7 days the biofilm contained in these baskets was used to explore how a 7 day desiccation event would shape the response of the biofilm to the wwtp effluent gradient immediately after wire net baskets were placed back again in the streams and wwtp effluent treatments were implemented during 5 weeks at the end of the last week fine and coarse sediment samples were taken for biofilm dna extraction fine sediment was defined as the 5 cm sand column sampled using a cylindrical core whereas coarse sediment consisted on small flat cobbles placed on top of the sand see next section 2 2 experimental conditions each artificial stream consisted of an independent methacrylate channel l w d 200 cm 10 cm 10 cm and a 70 l water tank from which water can be recirculated each artificial stream was filled with 5 l of fine sediment i e sand extracted from an unpolluted segment of the llémena river sant esteve de llémena girona eu which is a permanent river draining a calcareous mountainous range d50 0 74 mm the extracted sand was transported in less than one hour to the artificial streams and evenly distributed to create a plane bed that facilitated the growth of the biofilm to assess the response of coarse sediment small flat cobbles l w d 2 cm 2 cm 1 cm were also extracted from the llémena river transported and distributed on the artificial streams each stream received a constant flow of 50 ml s 1 from the tank and operated as a closed system for 72 h as water from all the channels was renovated every three days mean water velocity was 0 71 cm s 1 and water depth over the plane bed ranged 3 5 cm water sources for the artificial streams were rainwater filtered through activated carbon filters and wwtp effluent water from the quart wwtp girona eu during the acclimation period biofilm was allowed to grow on the artificial streams from the inocula present in the sediments from the llémena river afterwards water from the wwtp was transported in 200 l tanks and transferred to the artificial streams in less than 2 h desiccation was applied by letting fine and coarse sediment samples contained in wire net baskets air dry during 7 days as this has been reported to be the minimum to produce significant effects on biofilm community acuña et al 2015 daily cycles of photosynthetic active radiation par were defined as 10 h

the renewal of the artificial streams water from water collected from the channel outlet water was filtered immediately through 0 2 μm pore size nylon filters whatman kent uk into pre washed polyethylene containers for nutrients and through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters previously ashed whatman gf f kent uk for doc nutrient and doc analyses were carried out as described in corcoll et al 2015

centrifuged at 13000 g during 60 s to remove excess water and then 300 mg of biofilm were used for total dna extraction following manufacturer s recommendations fastdna spin kit isolation kit mp biomedicals 2 5 quantification of ecologically relevant marker genes quantitative real time pcr qpcr assays were used to quantify six ecologically relevant genes including 16s rrna marker for total bacteria psaa and psba markers for total photosynthesizers dsra marker for sulphate reducing bacteria narg marker for denitrifying bacteria and mcra marker for methanogenic archaea all qpcr assays were performed in triplicate using sybr green detection chemistry on an mx3005p system agilent technologies santa clara ca usa as previously described marti et al 2013 briefly an initial denaturation was performed at 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 60 s standard curves were obtained by serial dilutions of pcr products previously purified with qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen inc valencia ca usa which were verified by sanger sequencing macrogen amsterdam the netherlands all genes were quantified using specific primers table s1 2 6 high throughput sequencing and sequence processing for community analysis independent dna extractions from coarse and fine sediment samples were subjected to high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes with the illumina miseq system 2 250 pe using the primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 complemented with illumina adapters and sample specific barcodes at the research technology support facility michigan state university usa kozich et al 2013 pair merging quality filtering chimera checking clustering into operational taxonomic units otu and construction of otu table were carried out against the greengenes database mcdonald et al 2011 with a 0 97 similarity cutoff using default parameters in mothur schloss et al 2009 sequencing depth was 54652 1676 sequences per sample otus affiliated to eukaryotes algal chloroplasts archaea and unclassified were filtered from the original otu table using appropriate scripts in mothur additionally a biological information matrix biom file was generated with mothur and was uploaded to metagenassist web served to predict the functional community profile from the 16s rrna dataset arndt et al 2012 2 7 statistical approaches we applied a series of statistical methods to study the response of the microbial community to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient and its interaction with desiccation the overall single and interactive effects of wwtp effluents and desiccation on bacterial community structure were investigated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova section 2 7 1 the determination of community thresholds and indicator taxa was performed by means of threshold indicator taxa analysis titan section 2 7 2 in order to understand the shape of the relationship between the proportion of wwtp effluent to total flow and the abundance of gene markers related to ecologically relevant microbial groups we fitted a series of regression models commonly used in environmental sciences to explain the relationship between environmental gradients and response variables such as the exponential or the monod model section 2 7 3 2 7 1 overall effects on bacterial community structure we constructed a similarity matrix using the bray curtis distance legendre and gallagher 2001 based on the relative abundance of each bacterial otu analysis of similarity between the taxonomic composition of communities was done after grouping samples by stressor that is wwtp effluent we and desiccation d which were used as factors together with sediment type s in permanova the interaction terms i e we d we s d s and we d s were also included in the analyses these analyses were run in r 3 4 3 using the adonis function in the vegan package oksanen et al 2018 2 7 2 determination of community thresholds and indicator taxa threshold indicator taxa analysis titan 2 1 was performed in r 3 4 3 combining indicator taxa analysis dufrêne and legendre 1997 with nonparametric change point analysis king and richardson 2003 qian et al 2003 in order to identify change points in the frequency and abundance of individual taxon and examine if multiple taxa had synchronous responses over changes in the proportion of wwtp effluent to total stream flow titan allows identifying the optimum value of a continuous variable here the proportion of wwtp effluent in each treatment that partitions sampling units while maximizing taxon specific scores association is measured by indicator values indval calculated for all taxa and possible change points along the wwtp effluent dilution gradient with permutation tests to assess the uncertainty in these scores permuted indval scores are standardized as z scores and summed for positive sum z and negative sum z response values for each possible change point sum z peaks highlight values of wwtp effluent proportion to the total stream flow around which many taxa exhibit strong changes in relative abundance thus representing potential community thresholds bootstrapping 500 repetitions was here used to estimate indicator reliability proportion of bootstrap replicates with maximum indval reaching a p value 0 05 and purity proportion of bootstrap replicates matching group assignment in the original data as well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxon and community change points the following criteria were used to judge evidence for community thresholds from calculated change points and indicator taxa synchronous shifts in many reliably responding taxa and strong responses of individual taxa i e narrow bootstrapped quantile intervals more details of titan method can be found elsewhere baker and king 2010 2 7 3 regression model the relationship between the copy number of ecologically relevant gene markers and the proportion of wwtp effluent to total flow in the treatments was searched after application of a series of models fitted to the quantitative pcr data table s5 polynomial regressions included the linear quadratic and cubic relationships the linear relationship implied that the gene copy number increased linearly with increasing proportion of wwtp effluent in the treatment the exponential and power models implied that the magnitude of the response increased either exponentially or potentially to increasing proportion of wwtp effluent the logistic and its inverse function i e logit implied that the increase in the copy number for increasing proportion of wwtp effluent was minimal at low and high concentrations but maximum at intermediate concentrations the monod fitting implied that copy numbers increased but approached an asymptote at high wwtp effluent proportions the r functions gnls for all equations except the polynomials and lm for the polynomial equations both from the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2017 were used to determine the parameters in the models that best match the experimental data sets these functions fit a nonlinear model using generalized least squares pinheiro et al 2017 once each of the models was run the corresponding residual standard error rse and r2 were computed thus the models could be ranked according to their rse being the lowest the one that better explains the data 3 results 3 1 experimental conditions temperature was held constant during the entire experiment air temperature averaging 21 0 2 2 c and water temperature in the artificial streams averaging 20 13 0 31

highest values of nutrients dissolved organic carbon doc and conductivity were measured in the artificial streams containing 100 of wwtp effluent and decreased progressively up to the 0 treatment 3 3 bacterial community response to wwtp effluent and desiccation 3 3 1 overview of bacterial community structure and functional potential a total of 5246620 16s rrna sequences were generated through miseq illumina sequencing after removing short and low quality sequences with an average read length of 250 bp a total of 29645 otus defined at the 97 sequence similarity level were found in sediment samples from the artificial streams the bacterial communities derived from the investigated treatments were dominated by proteobacteria which showed an overall relative abundance of 49 47 5 42 of total reads the second and third most abundant phyla were bacteroidetes and planctomycetes the relative abundances of the main bacterial classes across treatments can be found in fig 1 a table summarizing the overall bacterial community structure indicating the most abundant genera and their relative abundance can be found in table s7 raw sequences are available at the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information under accession number srp155490 https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra srp155490 the taxonomic functional profiles derived from metagenassist revealed the existence of 22 metabolic phenotypes in our data set among them ammonia oxidation dehalogenation aromatic hydrocarbon degradation nitrite reduction sulphate reduction sulfide oxidation xylan degradation and sporulation were the 8 most abundant phenotypic features fig s1 a detailed version of the phenotypic profile across all treatments can be found in table s2 3 3 2 comparison between the bacterial community in the artificial streams and the llémena river even though the main goal of this study was not to compare the communities present at the llémena river and the communities in our artificial streams we used illumina sequencing to assess the filtering effect the filtering effect is considered here as the amount of otus that we might have lost when placing a natural bacterial community into an experimental system we were able to detect 26 otus that were present in llémena samples but were not present in sediment from our artificial streams these 26 otus represent 8 38 of the total otus obtained in this parallel experiment this means that the 91 62 of the otus present in the llémena river were also detected in our experimental streams the community in the llémena river shared 72 66 of similarity with the community in our artificial streams bray curtis similarity percentage fig s2 3 3 3 overall effects of wwtp effluents and desiccation on bacterial community we

levels f values ranging 1 74 2 25 table 2 3 3 4 overall responses of bacterial community structure to wwtp effluents and potential community thresholds the threshold indicator taxa analysis titan 2 1 for r 3 4 3 was used to evaluate variation in taxonomic composition of the bacterial community in response to a wwtp effluent dilution gradient taking into account all the possible sediment stressor combinations i e fine sediment vs coarse sediment or the use of non desiccated vs desiccated sediments an effluent proportion of 21 5 72 to the total stream flow resulted in the greatest changes table 3 for coarse sediment wwtp effluent proportions around 50 5 72 of the total flow were strongly associated to abrupt changes in bacterial community structure the determination of potential community thresholds in fine sediments was complicated by the occurrence of larger confidence intervals in individual taxa however the overall trend pointed towards lower wwtp effluent proportions in fine sediment than in coarse sediment table 3 3 3 5 potential indicator taxa in coarse sediment samples 65 taxa responded significantly to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient in the non desiccated treatments fig 2 a of these 17 taxa increased their relative abundance at some point across the wwtp effluent dilution gradient z responders other 48 taxa decreased their relative abundance z responders on desiccated coarse sediments 16 taxa were classified as positive responders and 40 as negative responders fig 2 b positive responders z included members of actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig 2a and b the negative z responders included members of firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria among these members affiliated to the class gammaproteobacteria especially the genera allochromatium citrobacter hahella rheinheimera and thermomonas were the best indicator taxa as they showed narrow confidence intervals around 50 of wwtp effluent proportion to the total flow fig 2 a only for desiccated coarse samples members of soil related alphaproteobacteria i e aminobacter sphingobium were also good indicator taxa fig 2 b in fine sediment samples 89 taxa responded significantly to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient in non desiccated treatments of these 51 were classified as positive responders and 38 as negative fig 2 c on desiccated fine sediments a total of 18 taxa responded with high purity and reliability of these 6 taxa were classified as positive responders and 12 as negative responders fig 2 d positive responders z included members of actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria we found two indicator taxa that presented overall abundances 0 5 of total reads in our data set suggesting a strong response to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient these taxa were the genus gemmata relative abundance 2 39 and an unclassified member of cyanobacteria relative abundance 0 79 fig 2 c in fine sediments the negative z responders included mainly members of proteobacteria as well as two members of firmicutes and bacteroidetes fig 2c and d indicator taxa were mainly affiliated to alphaproteobacteria aminobacter lutibacterium and gammaproteobacteria hahella citrobacter dokdonella 3 3 6 abundance of ecologically relevant microbial groups we examined the relationship between the abundance of six ecologically relevant gene markers i e 16s rrna narg mcra dsra psaa and psba and the wwtp effluent dilution gradient by fitting a series of models and comparing the outputs in terms of residual standard error rse and r2 fig 3 table 4 for non desiccated coarse sediment the abundance of the studied genes followed a cubic response in all cases except the dsra gene which showed a quadratic negative response with r2 ranging 0 21 0 45 the best adjustment to the cubic response was observed for 16s rrna r2 0 44 psaa r2 0 45 and psba r2 0 39 desiccation of coarse sediments shifted gene abundance relationship with wwtp effluent towards a logit type model narg psaa and psba genes for non desiccated fine sediment half of the studied genes narg psaa and psba showed a logit type response whereas the abundance of 16s rrna followed an exponential growth desiccation of fine sediment resulted in no change for narg and dsra genes response whereas the rest of the genes 16s rrna mcra psaa and psba shifted towards a cubic type response pattern fig 3 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 experimental design and treatment conditions our experimental approach had the advantage of combining rigorous control over anthropogenic stressors and sufficient statistical power to detect individual and combined effects however experimental designs relying on the use of artificial ecosystems might fail to reproduce the communities that develop in natural environments to assess this likely limitation we compared the community in our artificial streams with that of the natural reference stream from where the sediment was extracted llémena river girona eu results indicate that in terms of bacterial otus 92 of the otus retrieved from llémena river were detected in our artificial streams at the end of the acclimation period representing a bray curtis similarity of 72 thus despite the limitations associated to performing the study on an artificial environment the similarity of bacterial community with that on the natural reference site places our results in context and provides reliability to our conclusions wwtp effluent strongly interacted with sediment type which is known to be one of the major drivers of bacterial community composition in river beds zeglin 2015 also the triple interaction between wwtp effluent desiccation and sediment type we d s was significant suggesting that the combined effect of wwtp effluents and desiccation is particularly important when sediment type is considered importantly desiccation did not affect bacterial community composition at high taxonomic levels i e phylum and its interaction with wwtp effluent and sediment type was weak this adds further empirical evidence to previous work aiming at finding the best taxonomic resolution for studying multiple stressor effects salis et al 2017 in their work salis and collaborators argued that the order level might represent the best compromise between stressor sensitivity and coverage of bacterial community here we show that lower taxonomic levels better respond to the stress caused by a desiccation event associated to this higher taxonomic levels i e phylum level are more likely to contain taxa with opposing sensitivities to desiccation likely blurring the overall response the range of main nutrient nitrate and phosphate concentrations that we were able to achieve in our treatments span from the less polluted river basins in europe containing 0 02 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 0 8 mg n n o 3 l 1 to the most polluted european basins containing up to 0 40 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 11 3 mg n n o 3 l 1 grizzetti et al 2017 european environment agency eea 2018 the nutrient values in the 100 streams i e the treatment containing pure wwtp effluent were 10 1 3 5 mg n n o 3 l 1 0 72 0 16 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 14 3 0 60 mg doc l 1 levels of nutrients and doc in wwtp effluents depend on treatment processes and influent conditions and the levels tested in this study represent overall nutrient concentrations observed in wwtp effluents across europe european environment agency eea 2018 4 2 proposed community thresholds results presented here show a significant overall effect of wwtp effluents on bacterial community composition as determined by illumina sequencing and quantitative pcr threshold indicator taxa analysis titan was used to identify community thresholds and indicator taxa titan outcomes revealed that wwtp effluent proportion around 50 of the total flow resulted in the greatest change in sediment bacterial community structure the steep shift of taxa relative abundance near the 50 of wwtp effluent identified by titan analysis suggests that any river with the physicochemical characteristics that we achieved in the 43 56 treatments might be considered at risk as an example a recent study in the us showed that over 6 of the studied rivers 15 000 had wwtp effluent contributions 50 of the total river flow and that global change might worsen this situation by reducing natural dilution capacity rice and westerhoff 2017 this 50 of wwtp effluent was associated with moderate to high nutrient levels i e 4 6 5 2 mg n n o 3 l 1 0 21 0 32 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 7 09 9 00 mg doc l 1 bacterial communities in fine sediments experienced higher changes in their composition at lower wwtp effluent proportions indicating their higher sensitivity to wwtp effluents since bacterial communities inhabiting fine sediments are known to be major contributors to the accumulation and degradation of organic matter changes in their composition might affect carbon dynamics at the ecosystem level romaní et al 2004 together with this larger confidence intervals were retrieved from fine sediment samples probably due to the fact that bacterial communities in fine sediments are richer and more diverse than bacterial communities in cobbles therefore making their response to the gradient of wwtp effluent more complex taken together our results indicate that rivers receiving wwtp discharges under reduced dilution capacity might potentially risk of dramatic bacterial community structure changes 4 3 potential indicator taxa members of actinobacteria and cyanobacteria might be seen as good positive indicator taxa as they increased in their relative abundance while showed narrow confidence intervals on the other hand results point towards members of gammaproteobacteria as good negative indicator species although gammaproteobacteria contain several pathogenic bacteria that are known to be discharged from wwtps their abundance was recently reported to decrease 100 m downstream of a wwtp discharge point marti and balcázar 2014 this decrease is reflected in the qpcr results as a decrease in the number 16s rrna copies in fine sediment samples this decrease in the 16s rrna copy numbers is not observed probably due to a counteracting effect caused by increased abundances of cyanobacteria and gemmata class planctomycetia at 50 of wwtp effluent we observed that a wwtp effluent proportion 40 50 of the total flow resulted in decreased relative abundance of keystone taxa such as phyllobacteriaceae and bacilli the former contains members with the unique ability to fix diatomic nitrogen into forms that are usable for most organisms mergaert and swings 2015 while the latter are capable to degrade organic matter ludwig et al 2015 decreases in the relative abundance of these groups might imply changes that go beyond the structure of the bacterial community as their ecological roles are decisive for the ecosystem integrity of small rivers receiving large wwtp discharges the increase in the relative abundance of cyanobacteria is in line with increased copy numbers of the genes psaa and psba both of them involved in the photosynthesis and present in the cyanobacteria the abundance of 16s rrna in non desiccated coarse sediments was highest at 100 of wwtp effluent resulting in a cubic type response pattern this increase was related to the dominance of taxa associated to wwtp effluent dominated sites such as members of rhodobacteraceae and verrucomicrobia drury et al 2013 drury et al 2013 showed increased relative abundance of members affiliated to these groups 50 m downstream of a wwtp discharge point rhodobacteraceae are deeply involved in sulphur and carbon biogeochemical cycling pujalte et al 2014 and verrucomicrobia have recently been proposed as major polysaccharide degraders in freshwaters he et al 2017 several microbial functions assessed by the metagenassist functional predictor were potentially affected in coarse sediment samples exposed to wwtp effluent sporulating capacity was particularly affected the decrease in the relative abundance of sporulating associated bacterial sequences at 43 of wwtp effluent is in line with the observed decrease in relative abundance of spore forming bacteria such as members affiliated to the class clostridia most members of clostridia play an important role in degrading organic matter in the environment wiegel et al 2006 and their decrease could lead to the accumulation of organic carbon in river ecosystems affected by wwtp discharges although the functional annotation did not show any clear patterns for sulphate reduction we observed a decay on the abundance of the sulphate reducing bacteria gene marker dsra quadratic model r2 0 34 and titan identified a sulphate reducing deltaproteobacteria desulfomicrobium as a reliably decreasing taxon in desiccated sediments reliably decreasing taxa included members of alpha and gammaproteobacteria as well as bacteroidetes it has been previously stated that desiccation of river sediments could drive the bacterial community towards those occurring in soils with increased abundances of alphaproteobacteria and actinobacteria pohlon et al 2013 2018 here we found that in desiccated sediments members of alphaproteobacteria usually isolated from soil i e aminobacter kaistia sphingobium could be used as indicator taxa 5 conclusions in the present study the individual and interactive effects of a wwtp effluent dilution gradient and a 7 day desiccation period were assessed using artificial streams and sediment bacterial communities the major conclusions of the work are among the 3 studied factors i e wwtp effluent desiccation and sediment type the one showing highest individual effect was wwtp effluent lower taxonomic levels i e order family and genera were more sensitive to the effects of desiccation the strongest interactive effect was observed between wwtp effluent and sediment type a wwtp effluent proportion between 21 5 and 72 of the total stream flow and particularly 50 resulted in the greatest changes for bacterial community structure positive indicator taxa were mostly affiliated to actinobacteria and cyanobacteria whereas negative indicator taxa were affiliated to gammaproteobacteria desiccation increased the number of indicator taxa related to soil environments such as

19078,while wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents have become increasingly recognized as a stressor for receiving rivers their effects on river microbial communities remain elusive moreover global change is increasing the frequency and duration of desiccation events in river networks and we ignore how desiccation might influence the response of microbial communities to wwtp effluents in this study we evaluated the interaction between desiccation events and wwtp effluents under different dilution capacities specifically we used artificial streams in a replicated regressional design exposing first a section of the streams to a 7 day desiccation period and then the full stream to different levels of a realistic wwtp effluent dilution from 0 to 100 of wwtp effluent proportion of the total stream flow the microbial community response was assessed by means of high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and quantitative pcr targeting ecologically relevant microbial groups threshold indicator taxa analysis titan was used together with model fitting to determine community thresholds and potential indicator taxa results show significant interactions between wwtp effluents and desiccation particularly when sediment type is considered indicator taxa included members of proteobacteria actinobacteria and cyanobacteria with abrupt changes in community structure at wwtp effluent proportion of the total flow above 50 which is related to nutrient levels ranging 4 6 5 2 mg n n o 3 l 1 0 21 0 32 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 7 09 9 00 mg doc l 1 our work indicates that situations where wwtp effluents account for 50 of the total river flow might risk of dramatic microbial community structure changes and should be avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater

treatment plant effluent wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction pollution from point sources such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a common impact on freshwater ecosystems rice and westerhoff 2017 through their effluents wwtps subject rivers to a wide range of chemical stressors including organic matter inorganic nutrients in excess carey and migliaccio 2009 and many organic micropollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals or industrial products rodriguez mozaz et al 2004 kuzmanovic et al 2015 moreover rivers may receive other stressors that co occur with these chemicals amongst these stressors interruption of water flow and higher water temperature threaten the survival of river biota as they are at the base of local extinctions and the overall decrease of biodiversity dudgeon 2010 these stressors imply environmental filters as they act as additional selective pressures and condition the composition and relative abundance of species in the riverine biological communities at the discharge point wwtp effluent is mixed and therefore diluted with river discharge the proportion of wwtp effluent to the total river flow defines the dilution factor lower dilution factors indicate a larger fraction of wwtp effluent in the river the dilution factor ultimately depends on variations of river flow and wwtp effluents and the balance between them exposure time and interaction with environmental factors add even more complexity to the effect that wwtp effluents may have on river ecosystems sabater et al 2016 under high anthropogenic pressure e g water abstraction wwtp effluents can make up a significant proportion of the flow of the receiving water body a recent analysis of the current situation in the us showed that wwtp effluents make up more than 50 of the river flow for over 900 receiving systems at the point of discharge i e 6 of the studied rivers making these rivers predominantly composed of wwtp effluent rice and westerhoff 2017 moreover global change is expected to change natural variation of rivers flow towards increased low flow and complete desiccation periods so the number of wwtp effluent dominated rivers worldwide is expected to increase döll and schmied 2012 the biota inhabiting freshwater ecosystems is the final receptor of these co occurring pressures freshwater communities are modulated by chemical e g dissolved organic matter nutrients and physical e g alterations in water flow stressors as well as their interactions sabater et al 2016 the response of each group of organisms e g bacteria algae invertebrates or fish to chemical and physical stress is related to their life cycle and environmental requirements shorter life cycle organisms such as bacterial communities may respond to rapid changes occurring in the river environment including physical e g water flow temperature and chemical e g nutrient abundance organic matter availability stressors bacteria inhabiting sediments can be the most responsive to short term changes after these pressures because of their short generation time and intimate contact with the substratum sabater et al 2007 besemer et al 2012 segner and sabater 2014 the overall effect of wwtp effluents on river bacterial communities mostly depends on the resulting effluent proportion to the total flow of the receiving water body effluents from wwtp often induce changes in river bacterial diversity wakelin et al 2008 drury et al 2013 price et al 2018 while some authors have described increases in bacterial diversity as a result of exposure to wwtp effluents price et al 2018 others have associated them to decreases wakelin et al 2008 drury et al 2013 the complex nature of bacterial communities which are extremely diverse together with the large uncertainty that comes along with field approximations is at the base of these non consistent responses desiccation in turn can drive the structure of river bacterial communities from riverine to terrestrial such as those occurring in soils pohlon et al 2013 2018 experimental approximations to the effects of wwtp effluents on bacterial communities are usually focused on the comparison between the community composition upstream and downstream of a wwtp discharge point using composite metrics such as richness and diversity marti et al 2013 although these approaches are useful to investigate the effects of wwtp effluents at the local scale they are usually placed in the context of specific hydrological conditions thus being impossible to derive ecological thresholds from them that could be useful for water managers and policy makers moreover studies assessing how desiccation events modulate the response of bacterial communities to wwtp effluent pollution under different dilution capacities are still lacking sophisticated experimental designs under controlled conditions and much more sensitive community analysis methods are required to disentangle the effects of wwtp effluents and desiccation events in river bacterial communities this study aimed to evaluate the overall effects of a realistic wwtp effluent and its interaction with desiccation on the bacterial community inhabiting river sediments we used 24 artificial streams to investigate under controlled conditions how different proportions of wwtp effluent alter sediment bacterial community moreover we applied a simulated 7 day desiccation period to assess how it interacts with the gradient of wwtp effluent dilution we used non parametric change point determination together with indicator taxa analysis to determine community thresholds and reliably responding bacterial taxa dufrêne and legendre 1997 king and richardson 2003 qian et al 2003 we hypothesize that bacterial community composition will shift across the gradient of wwtp effluent dilution towards increased abundance of pollution tolerant taxa and that desiccation will modify the effects of the wwtp effluent by selecting highly tolerant taxa 2 methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was performed at the indoor experimental streams facility of the catalan institute for water research girona eu between january 19th and march 16th 2017 the experimental streams facility consists of 24 artificial streams see details in section 2 2 that have been previously used to explore the effects of contaminants and physical perturbations on stream biofilms acuña et al 2015 freixa et al 2017 subirats et al 2018 each of the 24 artificial streams was assigned to one of eight treatments 0 14 29 43 58 72 86 and 100 of wwtp effluent water following a gradient of wwtp effluent dilution these values span from an unpolluted river to an extreme low dilution condition where all the flow 100 originates from wwtp discharge river sediment containing biofilm was transported to the artificial streams and allowed to acclimate in clean water for 2 weeks at this point 3 replicated samples were taken to compare the community developed in our artificial streams at the onset of the experiment with the communities present at the source location i e the llémena river girona eu after the acclimation period wire net baskets containing biofilm were placed out of the experimental streams and desiccated for 7 days the biofilm contained in these baskets was used to explore how a 7 day desiccation event would shape the response of the biofilm to the wwtp effluent gradient immediately after wire net baskets were placed back again in the streams and wwtp effluent treatments were implemented during 5 weeks at the end of the last week fine and coarse sediment samples were taken for biofilm dna extraction fine sediment was defined as the 5 cm sand column sampled using a cylindrical core whereas coarse sediment consisted on small flat cobbles placed on top of the sand see next section 2 2 experimental conditions each artificial stream consisted of an independent methacrylate channel l w d 200 cm 10 cm 10 cm and a 70 l water tank from which water can be recirculated each artificial stream was filled with 5 l of fine sediment i e sand extracted from an unpolluted segment of the llémena river sant esteve de llémena girona eu which is a permanent river draining a calcareous mountainous range d50 0 74 mm the extracted sand was transported in less than one hour to the artificial streams and evenly distributed to create a plane bed that facilitated the growth of the biofilm to assess the response of coarse sediment small flat cobbles l w d 2 cm 2 cm 1 cm were also extracted from the llémena river transported and distributed on the artificial streams each stream received a constant flow of 50 ml s 1 from the tank and operated as a closed system for 72 h as water from all the channels was renovated every three days mean water velocity was 0 71 cm s 1 and water depth over the plane bed ranged 3 5 cm water sources for the artificial streams were rainwater filtered through activated carbon filters and wwtp effluent water from the quart wwtp girona eu during the acclimation period biofilm was allowed to grow on the artificial streams from the inocula present in the sediments from the llémena river afterwards water from the wwtp was transported in 200 l tanks and transferred to the artificial streams in less than 2 h desiccation was applied by letting fine and coarse sediment samples contained in wire net baskets air dry during 7 days as this has been reported to be the minimum to produce significant effects on biofilm community acuña et al 2015 daily cycles of photosynthetic active radiation par were defined as 10 h daylight 14 h darkness and were simulated by led lights lightech girona eu par was held constant at 173 99 33 μe m 2 s 1 during the daytime and was recorded every 10 min using 4 quantum sensors

the renewal of the artificial streams water from water collected from the channel outlet water was filtered immediately through 0 2 μm pore size nylon filters whatman kent uk into pre washed polyethylene containers for nutrients and through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters previously ashed whatman gf f kent uk for doc nutrient and doc analyses were carried out as described in corcoll et al 2015

centrifuged at 13000 g during 60 s to remove excess water and then 300 mg of biofilm were used for total dna extraction following manufacturer s recommendations fastdna spin kit isolation kit mp biomedicals 2 5 quantification of ecologically relevant marker genes quantitative real time pcr qpcr assays were used to quantify six ecologically relevant genes including 16s rrna marker for total bacteria psaa and psba markers for total photosynthesizers dsra marker for sulphate reducing bacteria narg marker for denitrifying bacteria and mcra marker for methanogenic archaea all qpcr assays were performed in triplicate using sybr green detection chemistry on an mx3005p system agilent technologies santa clara ca usa as previously described marti et al 2013 briefly an initial denaturation was performed at 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 60 s standard curves were obtained by serial dilutions of pcr products previously purified with qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen inc valencia ca usa which were verified by sanger sequencing macrogen amsterdam the netherlands all genes were quantified using specific primers table s1 2 6 high throughput sequencing and sequence processing for community analysis independent dna extractions from coarse and fine sediment samples were subjected to high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes with the illumina miseq system 2 250 pe using the primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 complemented with illumina adapters and sample specific barcodes at the research technology support facility michigan state university usa kozich et al 2013 pair merging quality filtering chimera checking clustering into operational taxonomic units otu and construction of otu table were carried out against the greengenes database mcdonald et al 2011 with a 0 97 similarity cutoff using default parameters in mothur schloss et al 2009 sequencing depth was 54652 1676 sequences per sample otus affiliated to eukaryotes algal chloroplasts archaea and unclassified were filtered from the original otu table using appropriate scripts in mothur additionally a biological information matrix biom file was generated with mothur and was uploaded to metagenassist web served to predict the functional community profile from the 16s rrna dataset arndt et al 2012 2 7 statistical approaches we applied a series of statistical methods to study the response of the microbial community to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient and its interaction with desiccation the overall single and interactive effects of wwtp effluents and desiccation on bacterial community structure were investigated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova section 2 7 1 the determination of community thresholds and indicator taxa was performed by means of threshold indicator taxa analysis titan section 2 7 2 in order to understand the shape of the relationship between the proportion of wwtp effluent to total flow and the abundance of gene markers related to ecologically relevant microbial groups we fitted a series of regression models commonly used in environmental sciences to explain the relationship between environmental gradients and response variables such as the exponential or the monod model section 2 7 3 2 7 1 overall effects on bacterial community structure we constructed a similarity matrix using the bray curtis distance legendre and gallagher 2001 based on the relative abundance of each bacterial otu analysis of similarity between the taxonomic composition of communities was done after grouping samples by stressor that is wwtp effluent we and desiccation d which were used as factors together with sediment type s in permanova the interaction terms i e we d we s d s and we d s were also included in the analyses these analyses were run in r 3 4 3 using the adonis function in the vegan package oksanen et al 2018 2 7 2 determination of community thresholds and indicator taxa threshold indicator taxa analysis titan 2 1 was performed in r 3 4 3 combining indicator taxa analysis dufrêne and legendre 1997 with nonparametric change point analysis king and richardson 2003 qian et al 2003 in order to identify change points in the frequency and abundance of individual taxon and examine if multiple taxa had synchronous responses over changes in the proportion of wwtp effluent to total stream flow titan allows identifying the optimum value of a continuous variable here the proportion of wwtp effluent in each treatment that partitions sampling units while maximizing taxon specific scores association is measured by indicator values indval calculated for all taxa and possible change points along the wwtp effluent dilution gradient with permutation tests to assess the uncertainty in these scores permuted indval scores are standardized as z scores and summed for positive sum z and negative sum z response values for each possible change point sum z peaks highlight values of wwtp effluent proportion to the total stream flow around which many taxa exhibit strong changes in relative abundance thus representing potential community thresholds bootstrapping 500 repetitions was here used to estimate indicator reliability proportion of bootstrap replicates with maximum indval reaching a p value 0 05 and purity proportion of bootstrap replicates matching group assignment in the original data as well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxon and community change points the following criteria were used to judge evidence for community thresholds from calculated change points and indicator taxa synchronous shifts in many reliably responding taxa and strong responses of individual taxa i e narrow bootstrapped quantile intervals more details of titan method can be found elsewhere baker and king 2010 2 7 3 regression model the relationship between the copy number of ecologically relevant gene markers and the proportion of wwtp effluent to total flow in the treatments was searched after application of a series of models fitted to the quantitative pcr data table s5 polynomial regressions included the linear quadratic and cubic relationships the linear relationship implied that the gene copy number increased linearly with increasing proportion of wwtp effluent in the treatment the exponential and power models implied that the magnitude of the response increased either exponentially or potentially to increasing proportion of wwtp effluent the logistic and its inverse function i e logit implied that the increase in the copy number for increasing proportion of wwtp effluent was minimal at low and high concentrations but maximum at intermediate concentrations the monod fitting implied that copy numbers increased but approached an asymptote at high wwtp effluent proportions the r functions gnls for all equations except the polynomials and lm for the polynomial equations both from the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2017 were used to determine the parameters in the models that best match the experimental data sets these functions fit a nonlinear model using generalized least squares pinheiro et al 2017 once each of the models was run the corresponding residual standard error rse and r2 were computed thus the models could be ranked according to their rse being the lowest the one that better explains the data 3 results 3 1 experimental conditions temperature was held constant during the entire experiment air temperature averaging 21 0 2 2 c and water temperature in the artificial streams averaging 20 13 0 31

start of the experimental manipulation data not shown 3 2 water chemistry analyses the implementation of the treatments i e the exposure to the dilution gradient of wwtp effluent water involved

highest values of nutrients dissolved organic carbon doc and conductivity were measured in the artificial streams containing 100 of wwtp effluent and decreased progressively up to the 0 treatment 3 3 bacterial community response to wwtp effluent and desiccation 3 3 1 overview of bacterial community structure and functional potential a total of 5246620 16s rrna sequences were generated through miseq illumina sequencing after removing short and low quality sequences with an average read length of 250 bp a total of 29645 otus defined at the 97 sequence similarity level were found in sediment samples from the artificial streams the bacterial communities derived from the investigated treatments were dominated by proteobacteria which showed an overall relative abundance of 49 47 5 42 of total reads the second and third most abundant phyla were bacteroidetes and planctomycetes the relative abundances of the main bacterial classes across treatments can be found in fig 1 a table summarizing the overall bacterial community structure indicating the most abundant genera and their relative abundance can be found in table s7 raw sequences are available at the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information under accession number srp155490 https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra srp155490 the taxonomic functional profiles derived from metagenassist revealed the existence of 22 metabolic phenotypes in our data set among them ammonia oxidation dehalogenation aromatic hydrocarbon degradation nitrite reduction sulphate reduction sulfide oxidation xylan degradation and sporulation were the 8 most abundant phenotypic features fig s1 a detailed version of the phenotypic profile across all treatments can be found in table s2 3 3 2 comparison between the bacterial community in the artificial streams and the llémena river even though the main goal of this study was not to compare the communities present at the llémena river and the communities in our artificial streams we used illumina sequencing to assess the filtering effect the filtering effect is considered here as the amount of otus that we might have lost when placing a natural bacterial community into an experimental system we were able to detect 26 otus that were present in llémena samples but were not present in sediment from our artificial streams these 26 otus represent 8 38 of the total otus obtained in this parallel experiment this means that the 91 62 of the otus present in the llémena river were also detected in our experimental streams the community in the llémena river shared 72 66 of similarity with the community in our artificial streams bray curtis similarity percentage fig s2 3 3 3 overall effects of wwtp effluents and desiccation on bacterial community we

levels f values ranging 1 74 2 25 table 2 3 3 4 overall responses of bacterial community structure to wwtp effluents and potential community thresholds the threshold indicator taxa analysis titan 2 1 for r 3 4 3 was used to evaluate variation in taxonomic composition of the bacterial community in response to a wwtp effluent dilution gradient taking into account all the possible sediment stressor combinations i e fine sediment vs coarse sediment or the use of non desiccated vs desiccated sediments an effluent proportion of 21 5 72 to the total stream flow resulted in the greatest changes table 3 for coarse sediment wwtp effluent proportions around 50 5 72 of the total flow were strongly associated to abrupt changes in bacterial community structure the determination of potential community thresholds in fine sediments was complicated by the occurrence of larger confidence intervals in individual taxa however the overall trend pointed towards lower wwtp effluent proportions in fine sediment than in coarse sediment table 3 3 3 5 potential indicator taxa in coarse sediment samples 65 taxa responded significantly to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient in the non desiccated treatments fig 2 a of these 17 taxa increased their relative abundance at some point across the wwtp effluent dilution gradient z responders other 48 taxa decreased their relative abundance z responders on desiccated coarse sediments 16 taxa were classified as positive responders and 40 as negative responders fig 2 b positive responders z included members of actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig 2a and b the negative z responders included members of firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria among these members affiliated to the class gammaproteobacteria especially the genera allochromatium citrobacter hahella rheinheimera and thermomonas were the best indicator taxa as they showed narrow confidence intervals around 50 of wwtp effluent proportion to the total flow fig 2 a only for desiccated coarse samples members of soil related alphaproteobacteria i e aminobacter sphingobium were also good indicator taxa fig 2 b in fine sediment samples 89 taxa responded significantly to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient in non desiccated treatments of these 51 were classified as positive responders and 38 as negative fig 2 c on desiccated fine sediments a total of 18 taxa responded with high purity and reliability of these 6 taxa were classified as positive responders and 12 as negative responders fig 2 d positive responders z included members of actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria we found two indicator taxa that presented overall abundances 0 5 of total reads in our data set suggesting a strong response to the wwtp effluent dilution gradient these taxa were the genus gemmata relative abundance 2 39 and an unclassified member of cyanobacteria relative abundance 0 79 fig 2 c in fine sediments the negative z responders included mainly members of proteobacteria as well as two members of firmicutes and bacteroidetes fig 2c and d indicator taxa were mainly affiliated to alphaproteobacteria aminobacter lutibacterium and gammaproteobacteria hahella citrobacter dokdonella 3 3 6 abundance of ecologically relevant microbial groups we examined the relationship between the abundance of six ecologically relevant gene markers i e 16s rrna narg mcra dsra psaa and psba and the wwtp effluent dilution gradient by fitting a series of models and comparing the outputs in terms of residual standard error rse and r2 fig 3 table 4 for non desiccated coarse sediment the abundance of the studied genes followed a cubic response in all cases except the dsra gene which showed a quadratic negative response with r2 ranging 0 21 0 45 the best adjustment to the cubic response was observed for 16s rrna r2 0 44 psaa r2 0 45 and psba r2 0 39 desiccation of coarse sediments shifted gene abundance relationship with wwtp effluent towards a logit type model narg psaa and psba genes for non desiccated fine sediment half of the studied genes narg psaa and psba showed a logit type response whereas the abundance of 16s rrna followed an exponential growth desiccation of fine sediment resulted in no change for narg and dsra genes response whereas the rest of the genes 16s rrna mcra psaa and psba shifted towards a cubic type response pattern fig 3 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 experimental design and treatment conditions our experimental approach had the advantage of combining rigorous control over anthropogenic stressors and sufficient statistical power to detect individual and combined effects however experimental designs relying on the use of artificial ecosystems might fail to reproduce the communities that develop in natural environments to assess this likely limitation we compared the community in our artificial streams with that of the natural reference stream from where the sediment was extracted llémena river girona eu results indicate that in terms of bacterial otus 92 of the otus retrieved from llémena river were detected in our artificial streams at the end of the acclimation period representing a bray curtis similarity of 72 thus despite the limitations associated to performing the study on an artificial environment the similarity of bacterial community with that on the natural reference site places our results in context and provides reliability to our conclusions wwtp effluent strongly interacted with sediment type which is known to be one of the major drivers of bacterial community composition in river beds zeglin 2015 also the triple interaction between wwtp effluent desiccation and sediment type we d s was significant suggesting that the combined effect of wwtp effluents and desiccation is particularly important when sediment type is considered importantly desiccation did not affect bacterial community composition at high taxonomic levels i e phylum and its interaction with wwtp effluent and sediment type was weak this adds further empirical evidence to previous work aiming at finding the best taxonomic resolution for studying multiple stressor effects salis et al 2017 in their work salis and collaborators argued that the order level might represent the best compromise between stressor sensitivity and coverage of bacterial community here we show that lower taxonomic levels better respond to the stress caused by a desiccation event associated to this higher taxonomic levels i e phylum level are more likely to contain taxa with opposing sensitivities to desiccation likely blurring the overall response the range of main nutrient nitrate and phosphate concentrations that we were able to achieve in our treatments span from the less polluted river basins in europe containing 0 02 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 0 8 mg n n o 3 l 1 to the most polluted european basins containing up to 0 40 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 11 3 mg n n o 3 l 1 grizzetti et al 2017 european environment agency eea 2018 the nutrient values in the 100 streams i e the treatment containing pure wwtp effluent were 10 1 3 5 mg n n o 3 l 1 0 72 0 16 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 14 3 0 60 mg doc l 1 levels of nutrients and doc in wwtp effluents depend on treatment processes and influent conditions and the levels tested in this study represent overall nutrient concentrations observed in wwtp effluents across europe european environment agency eea 2018 4 2 proposed community thresholds results presented here show a significant overall effect of wwtp effluents on bacterial community composition as determined by illumina sequencing and quantitative pcr threshold indicator taxa analysis titan was used to identify community thresholds and indicator taxa titan outcomes revealed that wwtp effluent proportion around 50 of the total flow resulted in the greatest change in sediment bacterial community structure the steep shift of taxa relative abundance near the 50 of wwtp effluent identified by titan analysis suggests that any river with the physicochemical characteristics that we achieved in the 43 56 treatments might be considered at risk as an example a recent study in the us showed that over 6 of the studied rivers 15 000 had wwtp effluent contributions 50 of the total river flow and that global change might worsen this situation by reducing natural dilution capacity rice and westerhoff 2017 this 50 of wwtp effluent was associated with moderate to high nutrient levels i e 4 6 5 2 mg n n o 3 l 1 0 21 0 32 mg p p o 4 3 l 1 and 7 09 9 00 mg doc l 1 bacterial communities in fine sediments experienced higher changes in their composition at lower wwtp effluent proportions indicating their higher sensitivity to wwtp effluents since bacterial communities inhabiting fine sediments are known to be major contributors to the accumulation and degradation of organic matter changes in their composition might affect carbon dynamics at the ecosystem level romaní et al 2004 together with this larger confidence intervals were retrieved from fine sediment samples probably due to the fact that bacterial communities in fine sediments are richer and more diverse than bacterial communities in cobbles therefore making their response to the gradient of wwtp effluent more complex taken together our results indicate that rivers receiving wwtp discharges under reduced dilution capacity might potentially risk of dramatic bacterial community structure changes 4 3 potential indicator taxa members of actinobacteria and cyanobacteria might be seen as good positive indicator taxa as they increased in their relative abundance while showed narrow confidence intervals on the other hand results point towards members of gammaproteobacteria as good negative indicator species although gammaproteobacteria contain several pathogenic bacteria that are known to be discharged from wwtps their abundance was recently reported to decrease 100 m downstream of a wwtp discharge point marti and balcázar 2014 this decrease is reflected in the qpcr results as a decrease in the number 16s rrna copies in fine sediment samples this decrease in the 16s rrna copy numbers is not observed probably due to a counteracting effect caused by increased abundances of cyanobacteria and gemmata class planctomycetia at 50 of wwtp effluent we observed that a wwtp effluent proportion 40 50 of the total flow resulted in decreased relative abundance of keystone taxa such as phyllobacteriaceae and bacilli the former contains members with the unique ability to fix diatomic nitrogen into forms that are usable for most organisms mergaert and swings 2015 while the latter are capable to degrade organic matter ludwig et al 2015 decreases in the relative abundance of these groups might imply changes that go beyond the structure of the bacterial community as their ecological roles are decisive for the ecosystem integrity of small rivers receiving large wwtp discharges the increase in the relative abundance of cyanobacteria is in line with increased copy numbers of the genes psaa and psba both of them involved in the photosynthesis and present in the cyanobacteria the abundance of 16s rrna in non desiccated coarse sediments was highest at 100 of wwtp effluent resulting in a cubic type response pattern this increase was related to the dominance of taxa associated to wwtp effluent dominated sites such as members of rhodobacteraceae and verrucomicrobia drury et al 2013 drury et al 2013 showed increased relative abundance of members affiliated to these groups 50 m downstream of a wwtp discharge point rhodobacteraceae are deeply involved in sulphur and carbon biogeochemical cycling pujalte et al 2014 and verrucomicrobia have recently been proposed as major polysaccharide degraders in freshwaters he et al 2017 several microbial functions assessed by the metagenassist functional predictor were potentially affected in coarse sediment samples exposed to wwtp effluent sporulating capacity was particularly affected the decrease in the relative abundance of sporulating associated bacterial sequences at 43 of wwtp effluent is in line with the observed decrease in relative abundance of spore forming bacteria such as members affiliated to the class clostridia most members of clostridia play an important role in degrading organic matter in the environment wiegel et al 2006 and their decrease could lead to the accumulation of organic carbon in river ecosystems affected by wwtp discharges although the functional annotation did not show any clear patterns for sulphate reduction we observed a decay on the abundance of the sulphate reducing bacteria gene marker dsra quadratic model r2 0 34 and titan identified a sulphate reducing deltaproteobacteria desulfomicrobium as a reliably decreasing taxon in desiccated sediments reliably decreasing taxa included members of alpha and gammaproteobacteria as well as bacteroidetes it has been previously stated that desiccation of river sediments could drive the bacterial community towards those occurring in soils with increased abundances of alphaproteobacteria and actinobacteria pohlon et al 2013 2018 here we found that in desiccated sediments members of alphaproteobacteria usually isolated from soil i e aminobacter kaistia sphingobium could be used as indicator taxa 5 conclusions in the present study the individual and interactive effects of a wwtp effluent dilution gradient and a 7 day desiccation period were assessed using artificial streams and sediment bacterial communities the major conclusions of the work are among the 3 studied factors i e wwtp effluent desiccation and sediment type the one showing highest individual effect was wwtp effluent lower taxonomic levels i e order family and genera were more sensitive to the effects of desiccation the strongest interactive effect was observed between wwtp effluent and sediment type a wwtp effluent proportion between 21 5 and 72 of the total stream flow and particularly 50 resulted in the greatest changes for bacterial community structure positive indicator taxa were mostly affiliated to actinobacteria and cyanobacteria whereas negative indicator taxa were affiliated to gammaproteobacteria desiccation increased the number of indicator taxa related to soil environments such as

19079,the strong greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o can be emitted from wastewater treatment systems as a byproduct of ammonium oxidation and as the last intermediate in the stepwise reduction of nitrate to n2 by denitrifying organisms a potential strategy to reduce n2o emissions would be to enhance the activity of n2o reductase nos in the denitrifying microbial community a survey of existing literature on denitrification in wastewater treatment systems showed that the n2o reducing capacity v maxn2o n2 exceeded the capacity to produce n2o v maxno3 n2o by a factor of 2 10 this suggests that denitrification can be an effective sink for n2o potentially scavenging a fraction of the n2o produced by ammonium oxidation or abiotic reactions we conducted a series of incubation experiments with freshly sampled activated sludge from a wastewater treatment system in oslo and found that the ratio α v maxn2o n2 v maxno3 n2o fluctuated between 2 and 5 in samples taken at intervals over a period of 5 weeks adding a cocktail of carbon substrates resulted in increasing rates but had no significant effect on α based on these results complemented with qpcr and metaproteomic data we discuss whether the overcapacity to reduce n2o can be ascribed to gene protein abundance ratios nosz nir or whether in cell competition between the reductases for electrons could be of greater importance graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide denitrification activated sludge wastewater treatment 1 introduction with a global warming potential roughly 300 times greater than co2 n2o can be a major contributor to the greenhouse gas footprint of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp daelman et al 2013 n2o accumulates during biological nitrogen removal from wastewater as a byproduct of nitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and or as a result of incomplete denitrification by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the activated sludge kampschreur et al 2009 schreiber et al 2012 the fact that most of the emission of n2o occurs in aerated nitrification zones in the full scale could be taken to suggest that nitrification is the primary source of n2o but this is far from clear since the n2o stripped off by aeration could a originate from non aerated anoxic zones or b be produced by denitrification in anoxic microsites within the aerated nitrification zones attempts to discriminate n2o produced via nitrification or denitrification by isotopomer analyses wunderlin et al 2013 or by correlating a wide range of process variables to emissions in a long term n2o monitoring campaign in a full scale wwtp daelman et al 2015 have not been conclusive furthermore n2o can be produced via abiotic reactions between intermediates of nitrification and denitrification e g between no2 and hydroxylamine soler jofra et al 2016 or reduced iron species kampschreur et al 2011 the relative contribution of all these different processes to n2o accumulation remains unresolved and makes it a challenge to develop greenhouse gas mitigation strategies in full scale systems a number of studies have focused on reducing the production of n2o during nitrogen removal lu and chandran 2010 perez garcia et al 2017 ribera guardia et al 2014 wunderlin et al 2012 but far fewer have focused on increasing the consumption of n2o as an equally valid and arguably more simple strategy to reduce emissions while ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are invariably net sources of n2o denitrifying organisms are either net sources or net sinks both producing and consuming this gas as shown in fig 1 a the propensity of a wastewater treatment system be it of the activated sludge type or other to emit n2o will be strongly dependent on the intrinsic capacity of its heterotrophic denitrifying community to reduce n2o a community with low n2o reductase nos activity relative to the other reductases i e nitrate reductases nar nitrite reductases nir and nitric oxide reductases nor will be a strong n2o source while one with high relative nos activity will emit less n2o and may even be able to function as a net sink for n2o produced during nitrification as observed in microcosm experiments with leca particle biofilms in mao et al 2008 the degree of nos activity and the resulting n2o sink source strength of an ecosystem will ultimately depend on a the genetic potential of the denitrifying community within and or b on the overall physiology of said community including regulation phenomena enzyme kinetics electron affinity of the different reductases etc microorganisms can harbor different combinations of denitrification genes in their genome graf et al 2014 lycus et al 2017 roco et al 2017 shapleigh 2013 e g denitrifiers lacking the nosz gene encoding nos are widespread as are organisms solely equipped with nosz coined non denitrifying n2o reducers in sanford et al 2012 hallin et al 2018 and referred to as such from here on thus microbial community structure can play a role in the n2o sink source potential of a system but even in denitrifying organisms harboring all the reductases necessary to complete the denitrification pathway i e nar nap nir nor and nos transcriptional regulation and post transcriptional phenomena may cause an imbalance in the activity of these enzymes leading to the release of n2o and or other intermediate products i e no2 and no liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 such imbalances have been associated with e g the presence of o2 significant no2 accumulation low c n ratios storage polymer metabolism and not the least rapid fluctuations in these parameters foley et al 2010 kampschreur et al 2008 law et al 2012 lu and chandran 2010 otte et al 1996 wunderlin et al 2012 in order to assess the intrinsic n2o reduction capacity of activated sludge and its potential use in full scale n2o emission mitigation strategies an inventory was made of literature studies reporting maximum conversion rates for no3 no2 and n2o in a variety of heterotrophic denitrifying systems below we compiled the ratios of maximum rates of n2o production from no3 to n2o reduction which in general were not explicitly reported as a proxy for the n2o sink capacity of these systems and calculated the steady state concentrations of n2o n2o ss an estimation of the n2o concentrations at which denitrification changes from being a net source of n2o n2o n2o ss to become a net sink for n2o n2o n2o ss most studies involved lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs run for prolonged periods of time and the resulting microbial population likely had little similarities to that of the activated sludge used as inoculum an exception is wicht 1996 who determined n2o vs no3 consumption rates for activated sludge however acetate was used as a sole carbon and energy source neglecting the contribution of microorganisms unable to use acetate in the no3 and n2o rates reported in the present study we complement the existing literature by comparing the n2o and no3 conversion rates of fresh activated sludge from a full scale wwtp with and without the addition of a mix of organic electron donors and at 12 c a value within the temperature range of the wastewater during most part of the sampling furthermore we address the potential role of i the microbial gene and protein abundance in the n2o sink capacity of the sludge by quantifying the ratio of nir vs nosz genes and nir vs nos proteins and ii of differences in electron affinity amongst denitrifying reductases by means of batch tests with the simultaneous addition of no3 and n2o based on the results obtained we discuss the reasons why denitrification is potentially a source of n2o in full scale systems and the possibility of exploiting the n2o sink potential as a mitigation strategy to reduce emissions of this potent greenhouse gas 2 materials and methods 2 1 no3 and n2o batch tests with activated sludge batch tests were performed in 120 ml serum flasks filled with 50 ml of untreated undiluted fresh activated sludge from one of the pre denitrification tanks of the bekkelaget wwtp which is a modified ludzack ettinger mle type plant in oslo norway see figure s1 and for a scheme of the process units also described invenkatesh and elmi 2013 samples were taken over a period of 5 weeks in april and may 2015 and later in october 2015 and may 2017 immediately after sampling the activated sludge was transported to the lab on ice dispensed in serum flasks while stirring for sample heterogeneity and used for batch tests within 4 h after sampling preliminary tests showed that conversion rates were not affected by which process unit of the wwtp the activated sludge was obtained from data not shown the flasks once filled with the 50 ml of activated sludge sample and 3 5 cm long teflon covered magnets were sealed with rubber septa and metallic crimps helium washed with 6 cycles of vacuum and refilling of the headspace and placed in the robotized incubation system described in molstad et al 2007 after a period of 15 min with stirring at 600 rpm for the temperature of the samples to equilibrate with the surrounding water bath at 12 c the flasks were injected with either 1 ml of pure n2o gas using a gas tight syringe aiming for a final headspace concentration of 1 n2o or 0 9 mm n2on or 1 mm no3 from a 0 5m stock solution of nano3 or both these batch tests were conducted both with and without the addition of an external electron donor a mixture of acetate pyruvate ethanol and glutamic acid which was injected into the serum flasks to a final concentration of 0 5 mm for each electron donor immediately before the injection of n2o or no3 the transport coefficient for the transfer of gas between the headspace and the liquid was calculated to be 10 3 l s 1 at the stirring speed used 600 rpm meaning that roughly 5 6 min were necessary for the gas liquid concentrations to reach an equilibrium as demonstrated in figure s2 therefore to avoid confounding transport and n2o reduction kinetics a period of 6 3 min was kept between the injection of n2o and the first sampling of the headspace thereafter the concentration of no n2o n2 co2 he and o2 in the headspace was regularly analyzed by the robotized system and the corresponding concentration of no n2o and n2 in the liquid calculated as described in molstad et al 2007 when relevant 100 μl of slurry sample was collected manually for the immediate determination of no3 and no2 concentrations see below after verifying that results were reproducible see figure s3 replicate runs were sacrificed in exchange for a higher time resolution of the conversion rates the sampling frequency of the robotized incubation system being limited by the length of the gc run and the number of flasks for our purposes we only considered the initial consumption rates i e approximately during the first hour of incubation to avoid the potential effect of changes in enzyme pools or depletion accumulation of storage polymers e g phb on n2o reduction rates the buffering capacity of the activated sludge itself was sufficient to maintain the ph in the range of 6 5 7 5 during the batch tests the initial ph being 6 5 0 2 data not shown control experiments with either 15 of acetylene in the headspace or with autoclaved activated sludge 15 min at 121 c both treatments effectively inhibiting nos activity were performed 2 2 analytical procedures no3 and no2 concentrations were determined by measuring the amount of nitric oxide no produced by the reaction with vanadium iii chloride in hcl at 95 c no2 no3 and the reaction with sodium iodide in acetic acid at room temperature no2 only using the purger system coupled to the sievers nitric oxide analyser noa280i braman and hendrix 1989 cox 1980 2 3 qpcr and metaproteomics activated sludge samples were fixed in 100 ethanol 1 ethanol 1 sample and dna was extracted using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals the primers and pcr conditions used are found in table s1 given the potential pcr biases and the fact that genes are not always expressed as evidenced by the lacking correlation between gene numbers and related functions in microbial communities rocca et al 2014 lycus et al 2017 we also performed an orbitrap based mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins for this we used a curated database where all the bacterial genera reported to be abundant in activated sludge anaerobic digesters and influent wastewater based on midas survey of 24 danish wastewater treatment plants mielczarek et al 2013 were included the protein extraction procedure aimed at the periplasmic fraction of proteins adapting the protocol for spheroplasts generation kučera 2003 50 ml of activated sludge was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min and the pellet was used for protein extraction the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 0 20 sucrose 1 mm edta 60 mg lysozyme fluka and incubated for 30 min at 37 c followed by addition of 25 ml of ice cold h2o and gentle mixing by inverting the tube the sample was then incubated on ice for another 10 min and centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min the supernatant containing water soluble proteins was then concentrated on vivaspin centrifugal concentrator sartorius with the 30 kda cutoff concentrated preparate was used for proteomic analysis more details can be found in supplementary materials 2 4 analysis of literature data we selected studies that reported rates of nitrate reduction in the presence of nitrate excess r no3 and rates of n2o reduction under conditions of n2o excess and absence of other nitrogen oxyanions r n2o which were taken as estimates of the maximum rates of n2o production vmaxno3 n2o assuming no significant accumulation of intermediates and the maximum rates of n2o reduction v maxn2o n2 respectively we calculated the ratio α v maxn2o n2 vmaxno3 n2o with the data from these studies and we used this data to estimate steady state n2o concentration during denitrification at high nitrate concentrations k s no extra n2o added assuming the gross production of n2o to be as measured vmaxno3 n2o and the n2o reduction rate a simple michaelis menten function of the n2o concentration the following differential equation can be set up 1 d n2o dt vmaxno3 n2o vmaxn2o n2 n2o n2o kmn2or where n2o is the concentration in mol l 1 of n2o in the liquid and kmn2or is the half saturation constant in mol l 1 for n2o reductase solving for n2o when d n2o dt 0 the steady state n2o concentration n2o ss can be obtained 2 n2o ss kmn2or α 1 where α v maxn2o n2 vmaxno3 n2o 3 results and discussion 3 1 overcapacity of n2o reduction in activated sludge and other denitrifying systems a number of studies in literature report the maximum rates as measured in batch tests in the absence of substrate limitation for the different steps of denitrification in activated sludge wicht 1996 and denitrifying sbrs itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2012 2013 ribera guardia et al 2014 wang et al 2014 we calculated the ratio α v maxn2o n2 vmaxno3 n2o which was not explicitly reported in these studies as an indication of the n2o sink or source potential of the denitrifiying community in these systems interestingly the α values obtained showed that n2o reduction rates were consistently higher than the corresponding no3 reduction rates by a factor between 2 and 10 table 1 we consider α values 1 to represent the overcapacity of the n2o reduction step relative to the rest of the denitrification pathway as illustrated in fig 1 and a measure of the potential n2o sink capacity of the denitrifying community in these systems we carried out additional batch experiments to determine the v maxn2o n2 and vmaxno3 n2o in freshly sampled activated sludge taken during a 5 week sampling campaign at the bekkelaget wwtp and on two subsequent occasions fig 2 the α values obtained from these tests ranged from 2 to 5 reflecting a persistent n2o reduction overcapacity of the activated sludge over time fig 3 the overcapacity was apparent in the batch tests both with and without the addition of a mixture of acetate pyruvate glutamic acid and ethanol carbon substrate rates increased by a factor of roughly 3 5 in the presence of the carbon substrate fig s4 in the batch tests provided with external n2o the measured rate of n2o depletion sometimes exceeded the measured rates of n2 production by 5 10 data not shown and we considered that this could be due to strong sorption of n2o to the activated sludge or conversion via an abiotic pathway other than reduction to n2 however tests with acetylene in the headspace or with autoclaved sludge did not provide any evidence for loss of n2o and the difference was therefore attributed to error propagation in the calculation of gas liquid mass transfer of n2o from the headspace to the sludge which do not affect the n2 production rates figure s2 3 2 n2o overcapacity and nos nir ratio of the microbial community the nosz and nir gene abundance in the activated sludge determined by qpcr showed that copy numbers of the genes encoding for nos noszi noszii were higher but in the same order of magnitude as nir nirk nirs with a nosz nirs nirk abundance ratio of 2 table s2 the abundance of nir and nos proteins measured by means of a metaproteomic assay showed that protein numbers were on the contrary greater for nir than for nos 1 19 109 nir vs 6 4 108 nos but nevertheless close to the same order of magnitude taken together the gene and protein abundance data suggests that the efficient n2o reduction in activated sludge is likely not a result i of a numerical dominance of nos over nir or ii of a relatively abundant population of non denitrifying n2o reducers in the sludge n2o overcapacity in the context of electron competition in the electron transport chain electron competition amongst the different denitrifying reductases could create a bias in the n2o sink potential reflected in α note that the total electron flux for an equivalent amount of n2on reduction to n2 is 5 times greater during the batch tests with no3 than in those provided with only n2o denitrification is a sequential process in terms of substrates but a branched process in terms of electron flow within the electron transport chain etc see fig 1 a vs b and there is evidence that even under conditions of electron acceptor excess the electron supply rate to the etc may not match the combined electron accepting capacity of the denitrifying reductases pan et al 2013 to assess whether a lower affinity of nos for electrons relative to the other reductases would affect the nos overcapacity highlighted above electron competition being absent in our determination of v maxn2o n2 we performed additional batch tests providing n2o and no3 to the sludge simultaneously in the presence of both n2o and no3 the total flux going through nos decreased compared to the n2o only experiments indicating at least some degree of electron competition but n2o overcapacity persisted providing evidence that nos can effectively compete with the other denitrifying reductases fig 3c similar conclusions can be reached from the results of batch experiments with denitrifying sbr cultures in ribera guardia et al 2014 and pan et al 2013 though it remains to be seen if the competitiveness of nos would persist under for example more extreme conditions of c limitation ph microaerophilic conditions etc 3 3 implications for full scale wwt systems given the literature survey and our results it would seem that 1 a varying degree of n2o reduction overcapacity is universal in denitrifying heterotrophic communities true for a broad range of ph and temperature values cod n ratios organic electron donors and irrespective of whether microbial cultures are exposed to fully anoxic or alternatingly oxic anoxic conditions or electron competition phenomena and 2 that this nos overcapacity is a physiological characteristic of denitrifying microorganisms rather than a result of the genetic potential of the microbial community indeed nos overcapacity has also been non explicitly reported for pure cultures of the full fledged denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans with conversion rates of n2on 2 to 6 times higher than those of no2 depending on whether the culture had been exposed to oxic conditions shortly before a switch to anoxia or had been growing for a number of generations under anoxic conditions bergaust et al 2012 hassan et al 2016 we are not aware of a conserved regulatory or post regulatory mechanism hardwiring denitrifying cells to overexpress the n2o reduction step relative to the other denitrification steps the existence of such a mechanism would be a surprising explanation given the diversity of denitrifying regulatory phenotypes found even within a same genus liu et al 2013 furthermore given that protein numbers of nos were lower than nir nos overcapacity is more likely to be a result of enzyme activity or electron affinity than of gene overexpression whatever the mechanism behind it a hardwired nos overcapacity could be a competitive strategy evolved to maximize the effective electron accepting capacity of denitrifying cells which could be particularly advantageous in systems like wwtp with frequently fluctuating availability of electron donor and electron acceptor limitations e g we estimated that any given denitrifying species in the bekkelaget activated sludge would be exposed to oxic anoxic transitions in the range of 12 104 times per generation see figure s1 unfortunately an overcapacity of n2o reduction which reflects maximum conversion rates under substrate excess is not a guarantee that n2o will not accumulate and be emitted to the atmosphere in a wastewater system the affinity constant ks of the culture for the n2o determines the steady state n2o concentration n2o ss at which the denitrifying community changes from being a net source of n2o to become a net sink and relatively high steady state n2o concentrations during denitrification imply a greater likelihood of n2o stripping into the gas phase the degree of which will depend on the gas liquid mass transfer of the system using the data obtained in literature and in this study we estimate the steady state n2o concentrations to be in the range of 0 1 1 1 k s table 1 and assuming ks values for n2o in the range of 0 6 3 4 μm based on km values determined by hassan et al 2016 and pouvreau et al 2008 this would mean concentrations of 0 07 3 74 μm equivalent to a partial pressure range 2 100 10 6 atm at 10 c given a solubility of n2o of 0 039 mol l 1atm 1 or a concentration range of 2 100 ppmv of n2o in the gas phase if in equilibrium with the liquid this relatively low concentration range suggests that denitrification is likely to be a net sink for n2o in activated sludge systems able to consume part of the n2o produced by nitrification or abiotic reactions the observation that n2o reduction overcapacity in denitrifying communities is widespread should be considered in modeling efforts and in the development of n2o mitigation strategies during nitrogen removal from wastewater for example carrousel type systems or mle systems with increased recirculation rates could be less prone to emissions than e g mle systems with a low recirculation rate since microbial communities are subjected to more frequent oxic anoxic shifts under such conditions nitrification derived n2o would be more rapidly transferred to the anoxic zones and readily consumed by n2o reducing microorganisms instead of being stripped to the atmosphere 4 conclusions the n2o reducing capacity of denitrifying microbial communities generally exceeds their capacity to produce n2o by a factor of 2 10 making denitrification a potential n2o sink in wastewater treatment systems scavenging n2o derived not only from denitrification but also from ammonium oxidation and

19079,the strong greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o can be emitted from wastewater treatment systems as a byproduct of ammonium oxidation and as the last intermediate in the stepwise reduction of nitrate to n2 by denitrifying organisms a potential strategy to reduce n2o emissions would be to enhance the activity of n2o reductase nos in the denitrifying microbial community a survey of existing literature on denitrification in wastewater treatment systems showed that the n2o reducing capacity v maxn2o n2 exceeded the capacity to produce n2o v maxno3 n2o by a factor of 2 10 this suggests that denitrification can be an effective sink for n2o potentially scavenging a fraction of the n2o produced by ammonium oxidation or abiotic reactions we conducted a series of incubation experiments with freshly sampled activated sludge from a wastewater treatment system in oslo and found that the ratio α v maxn2o n2 v maxno3 n2o fluctuated between 2 and 5 in samples taken at intervals over a period of 5 weeks adding a cocktail of carbon substrates resulted in increasing rates but had no significant effect on α based on these results complemented with qpcr and metaproteomic data we discuss whether the overcapacity to reduce n2o can be ascribed to gene protein abundance ratios nosz nir or whether in cell competition between the reductases for electrons could be of greater importance graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide denitrification activated sludge wastewater treatment 1 introduction with a global warming potential roughly 300 times greater than co2 n2o can be a major contributor to the greenhouse gas footprint of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp daelman et al 2013 n2o accumulates during biological nitrogen removal from wastewater as a byproduct of nitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and or as a result of incomplete denitrification by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the activated sludge kampschreur et al 2009 schreiber et al 2012 the fact that most of the emission of n2o occurs in aerated nitrification zones in the full scale could be taken to suggest that nitrification is the primary source of n2o but this is far from clear since the n2o stripped off by aeration could a originate from non aerated anoxic zones or b be produced by denitrification in anoxic microsites within the aerated nitrification zones attempts to discriminate n2o produced via nitrification or denitrification by isotopomer analyses wunderlin et al 2013 or by correlating a wide range of process variables to emissions in a long term n2o monitoring campaign in a full scale wwtp daelman et al 2015 have not been conclusive furthermore n2o can be produced via abiotic reactions between intermediates of nitrification and denitrification e g between no2 and hydroxylamine soler jofra et al 2016 or reduced iron species kampschreur et al 2011 the relative contribution of all these different processes to n2o accumulation remains unresolved and makes it a challenge to develop greenhouse gas mitigation strategies in full scale systems a number of studies have focused on reducing the production of n2o during nitrogen removal lu and chandran 2010 perez garcia et al 2017 ribera guardia et al 2014 wunderlin et al 2012 but far fewer have focused on increasing the consumption of n2o as an equally valid and arguably more simple strategy to reduce emissions while ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are invariably net sources of n2o denitrifying organisms are either net sources or net sinks both producing and consuming this gas as shown in fig 1 a the propensity of a wastewater treatment system be it of the activated sludge type or other to emit n2o will be strongly dependent on the intrinsic capacity of its heterotrophic denitrifying community to reduce n2o a community with low n2o reductase nos activity relative to the other reductases i e nitrate reductases nar nitrite reductases nir and nitric oxide reductases nor will be a strong n2o source while one with high relative nos activity will emit less n2o and may even be able to function as a net sink for n2o produced during nitrification as observed in microcosm experiments with leca particle biofilms in mao et al 2008 the degree of nos activity and the resulting n2o sink source strength of an ecosystem will ultimately depend on a the genetic potential of the denitrifying community within and or b on the overall physiology of said community including regulation phenomena enzyme kinetics electron affinity of the different reductases etc microorganisms can harbor different combinations of denitrification genes in their genome graf et al 2014 lycus et al 2017 roco et al 2017 shapleigh 2013 e g denitrifiers lacking the nosz gene encoding nos are widespread as are organisms solely equipped with nosz coined non denitrifying n2o reducers in sanford et al 2012 hallin et al 2018 and referred to as such from here on thus microbial community structure can play a role in the n2o sink source potential of a system but even in denitrifying organisms harboring all the reductases necessary to complete the denitrification pathway i e nar nap nir nor and nos transcriptional regulation and post transcriptional phenomena may cause an imbalance in the activity of these enzymes leading to the release of n2o and or other intermediate products i e no2 and no liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 such imbalances have been associated with e g the presence of o2 significant no2 accumulation low c n ratios storage polymer metabolism and not the least rapid fluctuations in these parameters foley et al 2010 kampschreur et al 2008 law et al 2012 lu and chandran 2010 otte et al 1996 wunderlin et al 2012 in order to assess the intrinsic n2o reduction capacity of activated sludge and its potential use in full scale n2o emission mitigation strategies an inventory was made of literature studies reporting maximum conversion rates for no3 no2 and n2o in a variety of heterotrophic denitrifying systems below we compiled the ratios of maximum rates of n2o production from no3 to n2o reduction which in general were not explicitly reported as a proxy for the n2o sink capacity of these systems and calculated the steady state concentrations of n2o n2o ss an estimation of the n2o concentrations at which denitrification changes from being a net source of n2o n2o n2o ss to become a net sink for n2o n2o n2o ss most studies involved lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs run for prolonged periods of time and the resulting microbial population likely had little similarities to that of the activated sludge used as inoculum an exception is wicht 1996 who determined n2o vs no3 consumption rates for activated sludge however acetate was used as a sole carbon and energy source neglecting the contribution of microorganisms unable to use acetate in the no3 and n2o rates reported in the present study we complement the existing literature by comparing the n2o and no3 conversion rates of fresh activated sludge from a full scale wwtp with and without the addition of a mix of organic electron donors and at 12 c a value within the temperature range of the wastewater during most part of the sampling furthermore we address the potential role of i the microbial gene and protein abundance in the n2o sink capacity of the sludge by quantifying the ratio of nir vs nosz genes and nir vs nos proteins and ii of differences in electron affinity amongst denitrifying reductases by means of batch tests with the simultaneous addition of no3 and n2o based on the results obtained we discuss the reasons why denitrification is potentially a source of n2o in full scale systems and the possibility of exploiting the n2o sink potential as a mitigation strategy to reduce emissions of this potent greenhouse gas 2 materials and methods 2 1 no3 and n2o batch tests with activated sludge batch tests were performed in 120 ml serum flasks filled with 50 ml of untreated undiluted fresh activated sludge from one of the pre denitrification tanks of the bekkelaget wwtp which is a modified ludzack ettinger mle type plant in oslo norway see figure s1 and for a scheme of the process units also described invenkatesh and elmi 2013 samples were taken over a period of 5 weeks in april and may 2015 and later in october 2015 and may 2017 immediately after sampling the activated sludge was transported to the lab on ice dispensed in serum flasks while stirring for sample heterogeneity and used for batch tests within 4 h after sampling preliminary tests showed that conversion rates were not affected by which process unit of the wwtp the activated sludge was obtained from data not shown the flasks once filled with the 50 ml of activated sludge sample and 3 5 cm long teflon covered magnets were sealed with rubber septa and metallic crimps helium washed with 6 cycles of vacuum and refilling of the headspace and placed in the robotized incubation system described in molstad et al 2007 after a period of 15 min with stirring at 600 rpm for the temperature of the samples to equilibrate with the surrounding water bath at 12 c the flasks were injected with either 1 ml of pure n2o gas using a gas tight syringe aiming for a final headspace concentration of 1 n2o or 0 9 mm n2on or 1 mm no3 from a 0 5m stock solution of nano3 or both these batch tests were conducted both with and without the addition of an external electron donor a mixture of acetate pyruvate ethanol and glutamic acid which was injected into the serum flasks to a final concentration of 0 5 mm for each electron donor immediately before the injection of n2o or no3 the transport coefficient for the transfer of gas between the headspace and the liquid was calculated to be 10 3 l s 1 at the stirring speed used 600 rpm meaning that roughly 5 6 min were necessary for the gas liquid concentrations to reach an equilibrium as demonstrated in figure s2 therefore to avoid confounding transport and n2o reduction kinetics a period of 6 3 min was kept between the injection of n2o and the first sampling of the headspace thereafter the concentration of no n2o n2 co2 he and o2 in the headspace was regularly analyzed by the robotized system and the corresponding concentration of no n2o and n2 in the liquid calculated as described in molstad et al 2007 when relevant 100 μl of slurry sample was collected manually for the immediate determination of no3 and no2 concentrations see below after verifying that results were reproducible see figure s3 replicate runs were sacrificed in exchange for a higher time resolution of the conversion rates the sampling frequency of the robotized incubation system being limited by the length of the gc run and the number of flasks for our purposes we only considered the initial consumption rates i e approximately during the first hour of incubation to avoid the potential effect of changes in enzyme pools or depletion accumulation of storage polymers e g phb on n2o reduction rates the buffering capacity of the activated sludge itself was sufficient to maintain the ph in the range of 6 5 7 5 during the batch tests the initial ph being 6 5 0 2 data not shown control experiments with either 15 of acetylene in the headspace or with autoclaved activated sludge 15 min at 121 c both treatments effectively inhibiting nos activity were performed 2 2 analytical procedures no3 and no2 concentrations were determined by measuring the amount of nitric oxide no produced by the reaction with vanadium iii chloride in hcl at 95 c no2 no3 and the reaction with sodium iodide in acetic acid at room temperature no2 only using the purger system coupled to the sievers nitric oxide analyser noa280i braman and hendrix 1989 cox 1980 2 3 qpcr and metaproteomics activated sludge samples were fixed in 100 ethanol 1 ethanol 1 sample and dna was extracted using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals the primers and pcr conditions used are found in table s1 given the potential pcr biases and the fact that genes are not always expressed as evidenced by the lacking correlation between gene numbers and related functions in microbial communities rocca et al 2014 lycus et al 2017 we also performed an orbitrap based mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins for this we used a curated database where all the bacterial genera reported to be abundant in activated sludge anaerobic digesters and influent wastewater based on midas survey of 24 danish wastewater treatment plants mielczarek et al 2013 were included the protein extraction procedure aimed at the periplasmic fraction of proteins adapting the protocol for spheroplasts generation kučera 2003 50 ml of activated sludge was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min and the pellet was used for protein extraction the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 0 20 sucrose 1 mm edta 60 mg lysozyme fluka and incubated for 30 min at 37 c followed by addition of 25 ml of ice cold h2o and gentle mixing by inverting the tube the sample was then incubated on ice for another 10 min and centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min the supernatant containing water soluble proteins was then concentrated on vivaspin centrifugal concentrator sartorius with the 30 kda cutoff concentrated preparate was used for proteomic analysis more details can be found in supplementary materials 2 4 analysis of literature data we selected studies that reported rates of nitrate reduction in the presence of nitrate excess r no3 and rates of n2o reduction under conditions of n2o excess and absence of other nitrogen oxyanions r n2o which were taken as estimates of the maximum rates of n2o production vmaxno3 n2o assuming no significant accumulation of intermediates and the maximum rates of n2o reduction v maxn2o n2 respectively we calculated the ratio α v maxn2o n2 vmaxno3 n2o with the data from these studies and we used this data to estimate steady state n2o concentration during denitrification at high nitrate concentrations k s no extra n2o added assuming the gross production of n2o to be as measured vmaxno3 n2o and the n2o reduction rate a simple michaelis menten function of the n2o concentration the following differential equation can be set up 1 d n2o dt vmaxno3 n2o vmaxn2o n2 n2o n2o kmn2or where n2o is the concentration in mol l 1 of n2o in the liquid and kmn2or is the half saturation constant in mol l 1 for n2o reductase solving for n2o when d n2o dt 0 the steady state n2o concentration n2o ss can be obtained 2 n2o ss kmn2or α 1 where α v maxn2o n2 vmaxno3 n2o 3 results and discussion 3 1 overcapacity of n2o reduction in activated sludge and other denitrifying systems a number of studies in literature report the maximum rates as measured in batch tests in the absence of substrate limitation for the different steps of denitrification in activated sludge wicht 1996 and denitrifying sbrs itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2012 2013 ribera guardia et al 2014 wang et al 2014 we calculated the ratio α v maxn2o n2 vmaxno3 n2o which was not explicitly reported in these studies as an indication of the n2o sink or source potential of the denitrifiying community in these systems interestingly the α values obtained showed that n2o reduction rates were consistently higher than the corresponding no3 reduction rates by a factor between 2 and 10 table 1 we consider α values 1 to represent the overcapacity of the n2o reduction step relative to the rest of the denitrification pathway as illustrated in fig 1 and a measure of the potential n2o sink capacity of the denitrifying community in these systems we carried out additional batch experiments to determine the v maxn2o n2 and vmaxno3 n2o in freshly sampled activated sludge taken during a 5 week sampling campaign at the bekkelaget wwtp and on two subsequent occasions fig 2 the α values obtained from these tests ranged from 2 to 5 reflecting a persistent n2o reduction overcapacity of the activated sludge over time fig 3 the overcapacity was apparent in the batch tests both with and without the addition of a mixture of acetate pyruvate glutamic acid and ethanol carbon substrate rates increased by a factor of roughly 3 5 in the presence of the carbon substrate fig s4 in the batch tests provided with external n2o the measured rate of n2o depletion sometimes exceeded the measured rates of n2 production by 5 10 data not shown and we considered that this could be due to strong sorption of n2o to the activated sludge or conversion via an abiotic pathway other than reduction to n2 however tests with acetylene in the headspace or with autoclaved sludge did not provide any evidence for loss of n2o and the difference was therefore attributed to error propagation in the calculation of gas liquid mass transfer of n2o from the headspace to the sludge which do not affect the n2 production rates figure s2 3 2 n2o overcapacity and nos nir ratio of the microbial community the nosz and nir gene abundance in the activated sludge determined by qpcr showed that copy numbers of the genes encoding for nos noszi noszii were higher but in the same order of magnitude as nir nirk nirs with a nosz nirs nirk abundance ratio of 2 table s2 the abundance of nir and nos proteins measured by means of a metaproteomic assay showed that protein numbers were on the contrary greater for nir than for nos 1 19 109 nir vs 6 4 108 nos but nevertheless close to the same order of magnitude taken together the gene and protein abundance data suggests that the efficient n2o reduction in activated sludge is likely not a result i of a numerical dominance of nos over nir or ii of a relatively abundant population of non denitrifying n2o reducers in the sludge n2o overcapacity in the context of electron competition in the electron transport chain electron competition amongst the different denitrifying reductases could create a bias in the n2o sink potential reflected in α note that the total electron flux for an equivalent amount of n2on reduction to n2 is 5 times greater during the batch tests with no3 than in those provided with only n2o denitrification is a sequential process in terms of substrates but a branched process in terms of electron flow within the electron transport chain etc see fig 1 a vs b and there is evidence that even under conditions of electron acceptor excess the electron supply rate to the etc may not match the combined electron accepting capacity of the denitrifying reductases pan et al 2013 to assess whether a lower affinity of nos for electrons relative to the other reductases would affect the nos overcapacity highlighted above electron competition being absent in our determination of v maxn2o n2 we performed additional batch tests providing n2o and no3 to the sludge simultaneously in the presence of both n2o and no3 the total flux going through nos decreased compared to the n2o only experiments indicating at least some degree of electron competition but n2o overcapacity persisted providing evidence that nos can effectively compete with the other denitrifying reductases fig 3c similar conclusions can be reached from the results of batch experiments with denitrifying sbr cultures in ribera guardia et al 2014 and pan et al 2013 though it remains to be seen if the competitiveness of nos would persist under for example more extreme conditions of c limitation ph microaerophilic conditions etc 3 3 implications for full scale wwt systems given the literature survey and our results it would seem that 1 a varying degree of n2o reduction overcapacity is universal in denitrifying heterotrophic communities true for a broad range of ph and temperature values cod n ratios organic electron donors and irrespective of whether microbial cultures are exposed to fully anoxic or alternatingly oxic anoxic conditions or electron competition phenomena and 2 that this nos overcapacity is a physiological characteristic of denitrifying microorganisms rather than a result of the genetic potential of the microbial community indeed nos overcapacity has also been non explicitly reported for pure cultures of the full fledged denitrifier paracoccus denitrificans with conversion rates of n2on 2 to 6 times higher than those of no2 depending on whether the culture had been exposed to oxic conditions shortly before a switch to anoxia or had been growing for a number of generations under anoxic conditions bergaust et al 2012 hassan et al 2016 we are not aware of a conserved regulatory or post regulatory mechanism hardwiring denitrifying cells to overexpress the n2o reduction step relative to the other denitrification steps the existence of such a mechanism would be a surprising explanation given the diversity of denitrifying regulatory phenotypes found even within a same genus liu et al 2013 furthermore given that protein numbers of nos were lower than nir nos overcapacity is more likely to be a result of enzyme activity or electron affinity than of gene overexpression whatever the mechanism behind it a hardwired nos overcapacity could be a competitive strategy evolved to maximize the effective electron accepting capacity of denitrifying cells which could be particularly advantageous in systems like wwtp with frequently fluctuating availability of electron donor and electron acceptor limitations e g we estimated that any given denitrifying species in the bekkelaget activated sludge would be exposed to oxic anoxic transitions in the range of 12 104 times per generation see figure s1 unfortunately an overcapacity of n2o reduction which reflects maximum conversion rates under substrate excess is not a guarantee that n2o will not accumulate and be emitted to the atmosphere in a wastewater system the affinity constant ks of the culture for the n2o determines the steady state n2o concentration n2o ss at which the denitrifying community changes from being a net source of n2o to become a net sink and relatively high steady state n2o concentrations during denitrification imply a greater likelihood of n2o stripping into the gas phase the degree of which will depend on the gas liquid mass transfer of the system using the data obtained in literature and in this study we estimate the steady state n2o concentrations to be in the range of 0 1 1 1 k s table 1 and assuming ks values for n2o in the range of 0 6 3 4 μm based on km values determined by hassan et al 2016 and pouvreau et al 2008 this would mean concentrations of 0 07 3 74 μm equivalent to a partial pressure range 2 100 10 6 atm at 10 c given a solubility of n2o of 0 039 mol l 1atm 1 or a concentration range of 2 100 ppmv of n2o in the gas phase if in equilibrium with the liquid this relatively low concentration range suggests that denitrification is likely to be a net sink for n2o in activated sludge systems able to consume part of the n2o produced by nitrification or abiotic reactions the observation that n2o reduction overcapacity in denitrifying communities is widespread should be considered in modeling efforts and in the development of n2o mitigation strategies during nitrogen removal from wastewater for example carrousel type systems or mle systems with increased recirculation rates could be less prone to emissions than e g mle systems with a low recirculation rate since microbial communities are subjected to more frequent oxic anoxic shifts under such conditions nitrification derived n2o would be more rapidly transferred to the anoxic zones and readily
