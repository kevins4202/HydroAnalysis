20815,one major accident scenario aboard fishing vessels is man overboard mob prevention of this accident scenario would reduce the high fatality rate in the fishing industry critical understanding of the risk factors is vital for a robust risk assessment of this accident scenario and to develop interventions this paper presents the objected oriented bayesian network oobn application for risk assessment of the mob scenario the oobn model is developed to probabilistically capture the key accident influencing factors in fragmented structures the proposed methodology is demonstrated in an accident scenario and the model captures the dynamic dependencies and interdependencies among basic variables and establishes their degree of influence on the accident occurrence probability the vulnerability path was identified and a pre and post accident intervention plan was proposed to minimize the accident occurrence and its associated risk applying the methodology provides vital safety based information that could be adopted for small vessel operation and maritime administration regulation keywords man overboard oobn fishing vessel accident risk control analysis risk analysis 1 introduction man overboard mob is a shipboard accident that occurs when a person onboard a marine vessel falls into the surrounding water and needs to be rescued lucas and lincoln 2007 sevin et al 2016 ortlund and larsson 2018 roberts 2010 the mob is also called fall overboard lucas and lincoln 2007 and person overboard karvinen 2017 almost every type of marine vessel sevin et al 2016 ortlund and larsson 2018 lusic et al 2019 neale and mirto 2012 chen and chen 2019 pitman et al 2019 has recorded mob occurrence on fishing vessels however case et al yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 and lucas and lincoln 2007 have identified mob as a significant accident next to capsize sinking or vessel loss to fishers and requires an immediate remedy the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh says that 23 of alaska s total fisher deaths from 1990 to 1999 were due to mob h 2002 surveillance 2002 similar death statistics have been mentioned for the commercial fishing industries in the united kingdom norway new zealand canada and other parts of the united states yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 looking at the eras in which these researchers generated statistics for mob one is tempted to say that the accident only existed before the twenty first century and no longer bothers the commercial fishing industry cfi such presumption would be incorrect since a recent study by uğurlu et al 2019 shows that between the 2009 and 2018 year period 26 mob accidents occurred and resulted in 20 fishers death meaning on average there was one fisher death for mob occurrence the mob categorized as a personal accident though has a low occurrence rate compared to vessel accidents such as capsizing sinking grounding collision or fire and explosion its fatality rate is as high as those for these accident types lucas and lincoln 2007 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 again among the leading personal accidents i e struck by gear or heavy seas entangled in gear fall into the dock and asphyxiated by fumes which happens on fishing vessels main deck and directly to the fisher mob presents the highest fatality rate roberts 2010 uğurlu et al 2019 mob poses a severe danger to fishing safety and is increasingly recognized worldwide as the one personal accident that if mitigated could reduce fishing fatality significantly lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 abraham 2002 the mob death toll in the industry has been linked to the small fishing vessels roberts 2010 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 noted that the absence of a harmonized safety legislation from the international maritime organization imo to regulate small fishing vessels activities encourages dangerous fishing practices which often result in various accidents including mob roberts 2010 reported 160 fisher deaths in the united kingdom uk fishing industry within the 1996 and 2005 year period the medium fishing vessels mfvs i e fishing vessels with a length overall from 24 m to 36 m and large fishing vessels lfvs i e fishing vessels with a length overall more than 36 m caused 38 and 20 deaths respectively leaving small fishing vessels sfvs i e fishing vessels with a length overall not more than 24 m with as much as 120 deaths furthermore 32 out of the 160 deaths were due to mob resulting in the distribution sfvs 24 deaths mfvs 6 deaths and lfvs 2 deaths therefore there is no doubt that sfvs harbor several safety risks and are vulnerable to mob the need to intensify research activities on sfvs and mob cannot be overemphasized from the discussion so far proactive measures to improve safety onboard sfvs through mob prevention are needed this calls for the development of proactive methods capable of quantifying the occurrence or non occurrence of mob during everyday shipboard operations the previous studies lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 on mob used post accident and qualitative methods in analyzing the mob scenario these methods have produced numeric results indicating a quantitative assessment of mob yet the numbers cannot be used to predict the chances of mob occurrence during in service operations aboard a vessel the methods used in generating these numbers are non probabilistic and only yield statistics on how often a mob causality the accident itself or both have happened for a given vessel maritime administration or country lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 lincoln and conway 1999 nevertheless the methods have successfully identified the risk factors associated with mob accidents though they cannot anticipate the occurrence or non occurrence of mob scenarios and the accident during everyday shipboard operations as a result though mob has been approached by previous researchers as a quantitative risk assessment qra brandsæter 2002 problem the aspects of occurrence prediction or predispose assessment are yet to be covered the present study proposed a qra methodology based on probability theory khakzad et al 2011 aziz et al 2019 khan et al 2018 to analyze the mob scenario methodologies founded on probability theory as explained in khakzad et al 2011 and goerlandt and montewka 2015 are excellent at handling accident prediction and predispose assessment of risk factors because they can 1 provide a broad picture of the accident scenario based on actual happenings 2 deal with the uncertainties that arise in accident occurrence prediction due to lack of sufficient data 3 identify the underpinning logic in accidents incidents and their risk factors 4 use the logic understanding to develop analytical networks for the accident scenario modeling and 5 provide percentages that measure the chances of occurrence or non occurrence of an accident and its risk factors another critical aspect of mob not covered in previous research is the linkage of mob risk factors as shown in later sections mob occurrence risk factors are broad and diverse and comprise human technical and environmental factors yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 the human factors feature errors made by persons aboard vessels which resulted in the mob the vessel and onboard equipment inadequacies leading to mob constitute the technical factors in contrast weather conditions such as the intensity of sea waves wind snow rainfall etc which interfered with vessel operations and caused mob to occur are the environmental factors although previous researchers lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 have identified these risk factors none has studied linking all the factors together into a network structure this places limitations on a comprehensive description of the mob scenario and the study of dependency and interdependency relationships among risk factors the result is that the mob scenario is not adequately understood and the most probable scenario to cause mob for a given vessel or operational condition cannot be predicted the current study uses object oriented bayesian network oobn modeling khan et al 2018 langseth and bangsø 2001 to probabilistically capture mob influencing factors in fragmented structures and link them together then the resulting model is used to dynamically analyze the dependencies and interdependencies among basic variables the oobn is a probabilistic modeling tool often preferred to bayesian network bn when handling massive accident scenarios due to vast influencing factors khakzad et al 2011 khan et al 2018 although oobn modeling has been applied to several complex accident scenarios in the maritime industry khan et al 2018 afenyo et al 2020a 2020b the literature search suggests that oobn has not been applied to mob or fishing vessels before the present study mob occurrence presents severe consequences including drowning yoo 2019 case et al 2018 cold shock responses abraham 2002 case et al 2018 hyperventilation aspiration chochinov 1998 case et al 2018 hypothermia abraham 2002 chochinov 1998 and muscle function deterioration chochinov 1998 case et al 2018 the studies of pitman et al 2019 and thomas et al 2001 showed that these post mob incidents are responsible for the high fisher deaths attributed to mob considering the death risk posed by these incidents and noting that lucas and lincoln 2007 and ugurlu et al uğurlu et al 2019 showed that mob occurrence had not declined yet in commercial fishing research efforts on mob interventions promotion must be stressed such interventions must provide control measures targeted at both pre and post mob incidents regulations provide firsthand control measures and are therefore taken seriously in every industry the msc 1 circ 1182 rev 1 wu et al 2014 and solas iii 17 1 krilić 2012 of imo entreats all vessels to have onboard the human and technological capacities to recover a mob victim from the water to that effect the regulations strongly advise frequent mob drills to ensure the shipboard crew is adequately prepared to handle mob accidents additionally the standards of training certification and watchkeeping stcw convention federation 2010 of imo urges vessels masters to conduct familiarisation tours of the safety systems and emergency procedures aboard their vessels for a new crew member among other things the new crew member must be told the procedures for mob aboard furthermore the international labour organization ilo s code organisation 1996 accident prevention on board ship at sea and in port provides mob control measures when carrying out overboard tasks e g checking draught readings the code says the crew member involved must wear a fall protection system and a personal floatation device it also advises that another crew member must standby and keep watch lastly the international organization for standardisation iso s iso pas 21195 2018 en o s 21195 2018 en 2020 have specified the minimum requirement expected of shipboard equipment used for mob interventions although the ilo code offers some pre mob interventions these regulations predominantly offer post mob control measures and therefore lack the ability to prevent mob occurrence proactively these regulations were enacted with vessels of length 24 m or more in mind for example the iso regulation was passed specifically for passenger vessels due to this their enforcement on sfvs is difficult also non overboard tasks that are equally liable for mob occurrence cannot be addressed by the ilo code s control measures realizing the inadequacies in existing regulations targeted at mob prevention aboard sfvs researchers lucas and lincoln 2007 thomas et al 2001 jensen et al 2014 case et al 2018 worked at developing control measures to that effect the control measures are broadly categorized into engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment ppe use lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 engineering controls require modifications to vessels systems and equipment to prevent a fisher from becoming a mob victim administrative controls are rules or working procedures onboard aimed at limiting the fisher s exposure to mob incidents the ppe use such as wearing of life jackets is encouraged to mitigate mob consequences the engineering controls and administrative controls are preferred to ppe use because they provide pre mob interventions and are proactive lucas and lincoln 2007 typical examples of the engineering controls administrative controls and ppe suggested for mob prevention and to mitigate consequences on sfvs will be discussed in later sections of the present study meanwhile lucas and lincoln 2007 recommended that more control measures be sought and paired with specific mob causality therefore the literature survey and brainstorming sessions held in the present study sought additional engineering and administrative controls together with those of previous researchers the discovered control measures were built into the mob interventions model the model selects from a bank of control measures appropriate engineering controls administrative controls and ppes for a given mob causality in summary though the present study builds on previous research works its primary purpose is to demonstrate how oobn modeling could be used to develop a probabilistic tool for mob scenario analysis aboard fishing vessels the present study is different from previous mob research the methodology proposed here can measure the likelihood of a mob accident occurrence and the causation during everyday shipboard operations therefore the study is novel in two ways 1 first time application of oobn in fishing safety assessment and 2 dynamic prediction of mob scenario in the maritime industry using probability theory the study presents a proactive assessment method and a pre accident analysis tool through the proposed qra framework and the oobn model for mob scenario analysis these are useful resources that policy makers for maritime accidents prevention ship owners and shipping companies and shipboard officers could employ to manage mob scenarios and related shipboard hazards before the incidents degenerate into accidents the present study sought to achieve the following specific objectives 1 to develop a mob oobn model for small fishing vessels 2 to use the model to support decision making on the most influencing factors for mob occurrence 3 to conduct a risk control analysis using the model to provide control options for mob prevention and its consequence mitigation and 4 to develop the mob interventions model from which control measures can be selected to address identified top risk factors for mob occurrence this paper consists of five sections section 2 is the next and describes the study framework and methods used to develop the mob oobn model in section 3 a small fishing vessel case study shows how the proposed methodology works in practice subsequently the case study results are presented and discussed in section 4 finally the summary and key message of the study are presented as conclusions in section 5 2 the methodology the qra is an established methodology that gives quantitative estimates of risks associated with operations or processes brandsæter 2002 khan et al 2018 qin et al 2011 by its nature qra combines hazard assessment with risk analysis to estimate the risk foreseen two estimation approaches are broadly followed in a qra probabilistic khan et al 2018 and non probabilistic qin et al 2011 probabilistic estimates give values between 0 and 1 while the non probabilistic yields other non zero values based on a likert scale score typically 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 the probabilistic by far is the choice approach because of its underlying probability theory and the rigorous estimation process khan et al 2018 goerlandt and montewka 2015 therefore the qra framework see fig 1 proposed for the present study used the probabilistic estimation approach the framework has four phases hazard identification accident scenario modeling occurrence probability estimation and risk control analysis rca rectangles squares denote task steps and the diamond shape is for decision making in each yellow ellipse the specific technique s to carry out a task is written and arrows give workflow direction to operationalize the framework start by identifying factors initiating mob occurrence go on to the next tasks and end after assigning control measures each phase of the framework is presented in detail subsequently phase 1 hazard identification this is the first stage in the framework presented in fig 1 here the risk factors to cause mob occurrence were identified through a literature survey and what if analysis when much literature exists on an accident or incident sanni anibire et al 2020 have shown that a literature survey can help identify the accident s cause s the academic databases used for the literature search were sciencedirect emerald ieee xplore digital library proquest springerlink taylor and francis online ebscohost engineering village federal science library google scholar and fish fisheries and aquatic biodiversity worldwide these databases hold many publications on maritime accidents particularly for the commercial fishing industry where mob accidents frequently occur lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 the keywords man overboard person overboard and fall overboard were combined with vessel ship marine maritime commercial fishing and fishing accidents to identify literature lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 relevant to the study to avoid missing out on relevant risk factors in addition to journal and conference papers the study team carefully scrutinized mob relevant contents in master s and doctoral dissertations textbooks book chapters technical reports and working papers too this exercise ensured that the developed oobn model captured the relevant aspects of mob occurrence some identified risk factors for mob occurrence needed further breakdown to identify root causes the what if analysis came in handy crowl and louvar 2019 the what if analysis yielded the additional risk factors needed through the study team s brainstorming sessions to ask questions about possible undesired events finally all risk factors identified were documented and saved on the computer and a backup storage device phase 2 accident scenario modeling this phase was responsible for creating the accident network for mob occurrence two assumptions were deemed critical for forming the network if a practical approach for mob accident occurrence was to be modeled first follow a realism approach based on how events unfolded to describe mob occurrence aboard vessels secondly the dependency relationship between a group of risk factors can only be modeled as either mutually exclusive or mutually inclusive the first assumption calls for a thorough digest of accident investigation reports to understand the circumstances that led to mob occurrence aboard vessels that fell victim to the accident however the second assumption calls for expert opinions on operational matters related to accident risk factors combination to cause the mob accident therefore the assumptions provide an opportunity to leverage lessons learned from past mob accidents and experience gained in causality relationship development to build a robust accident network for mob scenario analysis onboard marine vessels as uğurlu et al 2019 explained the accident network reveals the formation patterns of risk factors to result in the accident to do this first a causality relationship was established among the risk factors identified in phase 1 by following the three tier stages in fig 2 in establishing the causality relationship and the network the brainstorming sessions focused on understanding how mob occurs in reality the accident investigations reports lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 studied during the sessions revealed how the risk factors identified unfolded to cause mob accidents the study team discovered that regardless of the vessel type the crew member was on the main deck for every mob accident not wearing a fall arrest system though close to the gunwale and a significant unexpected vessel movement occurred too that is the tier i stage in the mob scenario modeling shown in fig 2 at this stage typical questions to be asked include why was the crew on the main deck and not inside the accommodation structure for vessels that have one and what caused the unexpected vessel movement to occur hence job related tasks personal behaviors and vessel motion factors contributing to mob occurrence followed as tier ii finally to complete the risk factors arrangement tier ii factors basic variables are placed next to constitute the tier iii stage the tiers i ii and iii together formed a hierarchical accident structure as shown in fig 2 in which the mob is positioned at the top as the accident the broken lines in fig 2 show that more causal factors may be sought in tier ii before defining tier iii s basic variables after establishing the hierarchical structure the second step was to define the dependency relationship among the risk factors in the structure the risk factors were assumed to be in mutually exclusive or mutually inclusive dependency relationship at each tier as a result it was possible to transform the hierarchical structure in fig 2 into a fault tree diagram ftd the ftd is a graphical risk modeling tool excellent at representing accident scenarios as diagrams for easy comprehension uğurlu et al 2015 kabir 2017 a group of risk factors modeled as mutually exclusive scenario mes require the occurrence of only one of the lower risk factors lrfs for the upper risk factor urf to occur this translates into an or logic gate on the ftd for an mes on the contrary a group of risk factors exhibiting a mutually inclusive scenario mis required all lrfs to occur before a urf would occur therefore an mis is represented by an and logic gate on the ftd the decision making on forming mes and mis was guided by published literature lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 on mob accident investigations and expert opinions the expert opinions were sought from senior researchers on the study team who shared their knowledge on ftd formation based on previous experience kabir 2017 also provides helpful guidance on ftd construction from the above discussion and bearing in mind the assumptions guiding the mob accident network formation fig 2 was turned into an ftd in fig 3 for a mob to occur the victim would be on the main deck not wearing a fall arrest system while close to the gunwale and an unexpected vessel movement would destabilize the victim which most likely could cause the victim to topple over and head for overboard as a result tier i factors are lrfs and together with mob as the urf they are modeled as an mis a mob victim s reason for being on the main deck could be for job task execution or self initiative e g taking a stroll to enjoy the cool sea breeze likewise vessel movements are either ship motions or some external factor e g the impact from the iceberg or another ship related these lrfs in tier ii are mutually exclusive events and so when connected to their respective urf an mes evolves the mes and mis then combine to cause mob accident as illustrated in fig 3 next the ftd formed was converted into the mob oobn model which is the accident network for mob occurrence as mentioned in the introduction section the oobn is excellent at handling accident scenarios whose modeling would result in vast and complex network structures viz a viz network learning requirements khakzad et al 2011 khan et al 2018 which was the case for the present study the conversion was achieved by creating and linking simple oobns complex oobns sub networks and finally the mob oobn model while fundamentally the oobn combines the knowledge of object oriented programming and bayesian network langseth and bangsø 2001 the simple oobn and complex oobn concepts introduced in khan et al 2018 was applied to the present study a simple oobn is a grouping of basic events variables only whereas groups of simple oobns only or simple oobn s and basic event s constituted a complex oobn subsequently groupings of complex oobns formed sub networks then sub networks were connected together to give the mob oobn model again the formation and linking of simple oobns complex oobns sub networks and the mob oobn model was guided by the earlier assumptions and the mis and mes reasoning for computational purposes mis and mes are represented by conditional probability tables cpts following the procedure described in yang et al 2017 for constructing cpts and using mob and unexpected vessel movement occurred in fig 3 as examples tables 1 and 2 describes the probability elicitation process for an mes and an mis respectively let the lrfs have binary decision states i e yes and no meaning occurrence and non occurrence respectively then the number of probabilities to be entered in the cpts for each urf was determined using equation 1 hence the example mes and mis required four and eight probabilities in their cpts as shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively 1 n p 2 n where n p is the number of probabilities needed in a conditional probability table for a urf and n is the number of lrfs describing the urf occurrence finally phase 2 of the study framework fig 1 was completed by implementing the mob oobn model in a software environment the academic version of genie 2 4 software used by yang et al 2017 was found suitable for the present study enabling the submodel feature in genie 2 4 genie and modeler 2016 the simple oobns the complex oobns the sub networks and the mob oobn model were created as fragmented sub models joined by their respective cpts phase 3 occurrence probability estimation with the mob oobn model hereafter referred to as the model developed and implemented in genie it is now possible to estimate mob occurrence probability mop this required all root cause risk factors hereafter referred to as root factors to be assigned prior probabilities although historical databases aziz et al 2019 and expert elicitations sotiralis et al 2016 are the primary sources to acquire prior probability data animah and shafiee 2020 mentioned literature databases as another source of data for prior probability especially at the initial stages of research therefore the present study sought prior probabilities from the mob literature during the phase 1 task execution to ensure a credible estimate for mop only prior probabilities from peer reviewed papers in english and top tier international journals and conference proceedings were used as evident in the list of references the chosen prior probabilities for root factors were then put into the model and genie calculated probabilities using the cpts for simple oobns complex oobns sub networks and finally mop the model also supports evidential reasoning and learning langseth and bangsø 2001 yang et al 2017 when new information was discovered about a risk factor in the model the calculation procedure was repeated to facilitate further analyses khakzad et al 2011 yang et al 2017 since the present study only aimed to use the model to predict the most probable mob occurrence scenario and conduct rca further analyses were limited to probability updating and sensitivity analysis probability updating enabled the estimation of posterior probabilities for root factors given the occurrence of mob this was achieved by setting mop to 100 in the model genie then recalculated new probabilities i e posterior probabilities for all the model factors the recalculation is based on bayes theory see equation 2 from the equation the model sought to calculate p x y meaning the posterior or new probabilities of root factors given that mop 100 2 p x y p y x p x p y where x a hypothesis i e root factors y the evidence obtained about the hypothesis i e mob occurrence p x prior probability and represent the probability of x before new evidence y became available i e prior probabilities of root factors p y x likelihood probability and denote the probability of seeing the evidence y if the hypothesis x is true i e conditional probabilities in cpts p y total probability and denote the prior probability of y under all possible hypotheses and p x y posterior probability and indicate the latest probability of x based on the new evidence y gathered i e posterior probabilities of root factors given that mop is 100 after probability updating the sensitivity analysis was next as explained in qian qian and mahdi 2020 sensitivity analysis measured the proportions of variability in the model s output i e mop attributed to root factors in doing so the contributions made by each root factor to the estimated mop were known several techniques exist for sensitivity analysis qian and mahdi 2020 however the present study used the improvement index technique khakzad et al 2011 because it allows for the model proposed to be involved in the conduction of sensitivity analysis this way the mob oobn model application in sensitivity analysis can be demonstrated to determine the percentage contribution of a root factor 0 was assigned to the factor and genie run for a new mop subsequently the percentage change in the old or original and new mop values was computed using equation 3 the procedure was repeated for the remainder of the root factors the percentage changes recorded were ranked from the highest to the lowest as improvement indices higher scores made more contribution to mob occurrence probability than lower scores 3 improvement index percentage change original mop new mop original mop 100 phase 4 risk control analysis this is the final stage of the framework its goal is to identify the most influencing root factors and then assign intervention measures to prevent or mitigate their occurrence this would ensure mob occurrence is prevented or minimized significantly first the list of most influencing root factors was created all root factors that appeared top e g first 3 or 5 factors during the probability updating and sensitivity analysis were put on the list khakzad et al 2011 showed that risk factors could combine to cause the accident occurrence therefore equation 4 was used to form combinations of the single factors and added to the list to create the risk control groups rcgs 4 c n r n r n r where c n r number of r groups out of n n total number of elements in the rcg set and r number of element combinations to be formed after creating rcgs a new mop was estimated given that an rcg has occurred i e p mob rcg the result was put into equation 5 and subsequently the joint probability of mob and rcg i e p mob rcg was estimated the procedure was repeated for other rcgs next the most influential rcg was determined by the z statistical test zhang 2011 liang and pan 2006 the most influential rcg is the most probable configuration mpc khakzad et al 2011 for mob occurrence the reason for doing the test is to check for a statistically significant difference among the rcgs which would justify using rcgs to define the mpc finally interventions were prescribed to the mpc by assigning control measures to each root factor involved 5 p m o b r c g i p m o b r c g i p r c g i where p mob r c g i conditional probability p mob r c g i joint probability and p r c g i total probability 3 case study applications it could be inferred from the introduction section that the commercial fishing industry and small fishing vessels are critical subjects when it comes to mob occurrence therefore applying the described methodology to case studies in these areas would be useful in the broader sense the case study serves two purposes 1 demonstrating how to develop the mob oobn model for a specific sector of the maritime transport industry e g cfi and 2 showing how to use the mob oobn model to conduct mob scenario analysis on a given vessel e g a small fishing boat the proceeding section presents the case study demonstrations 3 1 mob oobn model development for the cfi the mob risk factors in the cfi were identified by implementing phase 1 of the proposed framework fig 1 a total of 88 root factors see appendix a1 were realized and used in drawing the mob occurrence ftd see then 22 simple oobns were formed from these root factors and subsequently complex oobn n 19 and sub network n 5 were formed the simple oobns complex oobns and sub networks were finally linked together probabilistically using the cpts as explained in tables 1 and 2 resulting in the mob oobn model hereafter referred to as the model the model development implementation and computation analyses were done using the genie 2 4 academic version it must be noted that the summary description of procedures given here for the model development is based on the detailed explanation provided in phases 1 and 2 of section 2 fig 4 shows the model with its 3 of the 5 sub networks see appendix a3 and root factors categorized into technical environmental and human factors see appendices a1 and a4 in section 1 of this study the bases for these categorizations were stated simple oobns in these categories were grouped under t e and h respectively they then combine as complex oobns in m and their effects are extended as f a f b and f b to form sub networks by abstraction and encapsulation see fig 4 and appendix a1 for illustrations the developed model fig 4 described the possibility of mob occurrence given that the crew member involved was on the main deck yes no not wearing a fall arrest system yes no and there was unexpected vessel movement yes no sudden vessel movements or ship motions severely not severely triggered the unexpected vessel movement yes no 3 2 mob scenario analysis with the mob oobn model developed for the cfi the case study s first objective has been achieved likewise the foundation has been laid for the second objective mob scenario analysis to be accomplished a small fishing boat was employed as the case study vessel then probability updating and forward sensitivity and risk control analyses were performed for the boat by following the procedures in section 2 phases 3 and 4 further descriptive for the boat analyses follow 3 2 1 case scenario description the case study vessel is a hypothetical small fishing boat that uses pot gear and whose operational performances and environmental jurisdiction subjected it to the mob risk factors identified earlier generally a pot gear is a trap used to catch shellfishes such as lobsters crabs crayfish octopus and oysters lucas and lincoln 2007 case et al 2018 fishing vessels employing this gear type ranges from small boats used within territorial waters to as large as 50 m in length used on the high seas for this study the small boat type with a length overall not exceeding 24 m and capable of operating beyond territorial waters is the focus the vessel s suitability for demonstration comes from the fact that pot gear operation relies heavily on fishing lines yoo 2019 case et al 2018 which have been identified as the prime cause of gear entanglement roberts 2010 accidents leading to mob occurrence also among pot gillnet and longliner fishing gears lincoln and lucas lucas and lincoln 2007 reported 34 out of 71 fatal mob occurrences on fishing vessels that used pot gear this was the highest fatality by fishing gear type in alaska from 1990 to 2005 lucas and lincoln 2007 additionally thomas et al 2001 mentioned that out of 117 fishers hospitalized the crab pot was the cause of the injury sustained by 53 of these fishers using prior probabilities see appendix a5 sourced from literature and the model developed a qra was carried out on the case study vessel as detailed next 3 2 2 forward analysis the goal of this section was to estimate mop using the developed model fig 4 therefore probabilities for root factors were sought from literature as described in section 2 phase 3 and plugged into the model see appendix a4 the genie was run and it yielded an estimate for mop 3 2 3 probability updating the goal and procedure for probability updating were discussed in phase 3 of section 2 following the procedure described the yes decision state of the mob node yellow color in fig 4 was set to 100 and genie run to give posterior probabilities for root factors 3 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed to determine each root factor s contribution to the estimated mop the failed to use fall arrest system yes no in fig 4 will be used to demonstrate the process first the mop estimated in section 3 2 2 was noted as the original mop then the no decision state of the failed to use fall arrest system node was set to 100 meaning the node is excluded from the proceeding calculation genie was run and a new mop was estimated and called new mop finally the original mop and new mop were plugged into equation 3 and the node s percentage contribution to the original mop was estimated as its improvement index this process was repeated for the remaining 87 root risk factors 3 2 5 risk control analysis the mpc for mob occurrence was discussed in detail in phase 4 of section 2 and how to identify it using rca here a demonstration of the step by step procedures used is presented for the small fishing boat case study only three root factors were considered for a detailed rca more root factors must be considered based on the results of sensitivity analysis and probability updating step 1 the top three root factors for mob occurrence were identified see appendix a5 failed to use fall arrest system while on the main deck r1 working under alcohol influence r32 strolling working close to low guardrails r6 step 2 risk control groups rcgs were formed using equation 4 accident scenario triggered by a single risk factor r1 r6 and r32 accident scenario triggered by dual risk factors r1 r32 r1 r6 r6 r32 accident scenario triggered by triple risk factors r1 r6 r32 step 3 the total probability for each rcg was estimated for example the total probability for r1 was computed as follows p r 1 p mob yes r 1 yes p r 1 yes p mob yes r 1 no p r 1 no the model was used to evaluate p m o b y e s r 1 y e s and p m o b y e s r 1 n o as done in section 3 2 4 it gave 0 715 and 0 000 for earlier and later conditional probabilities hence p r 1 0 715 1 0 0 285 0 715 since p r 1 y e s p r 1 n o 1 step 4 the joint probability for each rcg and mob occurrence was estimated using equation 5 for example the joint probability of r1 and mob occurrence was computed as follows p m o b r 1 p m o b r 1 p r 1 0 715 0 715 0 511 step 5 find out if significant differences exist between p m o b r c g i values using the z statistic zhang 2011 liang and pan 2006 first the null h o and alternative h a hypotheses were stated h o all values of p m o b r c g i are the same h a at least one p m o b r c g i value is different next a significant level was set for the test e g 5 the z score table was then used to estimate the areas under the graph corresponding to values of p m o b r c g i i 1 7 for a two tails or one tail test the estimated areas were then plotted on the standard normal distribution curve to find out which region i e acceptance or rejection did each fall lastly a if all estimated areas fell in the acceptance region only or rejection region only the null hypothesis was upheld true b if the estimated areas are distributed in either region the alternative hypothesis was upheld true instead step 6 establish hierarchical risk control options hrcos base on p m o b r c g i from the fifth point of step 5 the following conclusions can be made if a holds then p m o b r c g i values are not statistically different and each rcg in step 2 has the same influence on mob occurrence in this case no particular order is required to form hrcos depending on other factors e g finance or convenience a specific rcg may be chosen first for redress towards mob occurrence prevention and the mitigation of consequences if b holds then p m o b r c g i values are statistically different which means some rcgs have more influence on mob occurrence than others therefore a peculiar order is required to form hrcos the values of p m o b r c g i were used to perform the ordering because mpc khakzad et al 2011 refers to the combination of root factors to cause the accident which is the joint probability higher values of p m o b r c g i were top on the hrcos list while lower values were at the bottom in assigning interventions for mob prevention or mitigation rcgs with higher p m o b r c g i values must be considered first those rcgs with lower p m o b r c g i values may be tackled later since the earlier forestalls mob occurrence the small fishing boat s rca results and those of the forward analysis probability updating and sensitivity analysis are presented and discussed in section 4 3 3 mob interventions model once the mpc for mob is known control measures are needed to prevent or mitigate the root factors involved to achieve this objective the mob interventions model see fig 5 was developed this model assigns control measures from the interventions bank see appendix a6 to a given root factor effective accident prevention requires control measures to address both pre accident and post accident occurrences lucas and lincoln 2007 case et al 2018 plog and quinlan 2012 therefore in fig 5 the mob interventions model uses engineering controls and administrative controls to provide safety against pre mob occurrences then ppe use is focused on post mob events to ensure a mob victim does not drown but remains afloat to be rescued the safest protection for a seafarer against mob accident is to stay inside the accommodation structure however that would mean no fishing activity can be performed for a fishing vessel resulting in economic loss therefore once a fisher is on the main deck depending on the fishing task appropriate engineering controls or administrative controls must be in place to ensure the fisher s protection against the mob accident these controls are intervention techniques retrieved from the interventions bank with samples provided in fig 5 the interventions bank was formed by gathering mob interventions mentioned in previous literature lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 and linking them to appropriate root factors during the brainstorming sessions held as described in phase 1 of section 2 new intervention techniques for mob prevention and the mitigation of the consequences were suggested adding to the present study s novelty notable among them are using a mantra system on the bridge deck compulsory use of the non slip boot on the main deck while fishing developing and implementing a checklist specifically for mob and designating a throw spot area on the main deck the mantra system guleria and sood 2020 is becoming increasingly popular in scientific studies fundamentally it is based on human meditation or concentration harne et al 2019 and learning and information retention marchetti et al 2020 in the present study the mantra is used to mean any system mostly audio capable of reminding a pilot or an officer of the watch oow on duty to continue focusing attention on the assigned task this way human errors that occur during vessel piloting and resulting in incidents e g collisions that could cause mob occurrence are averted a non slip boot would have soles that do not allow slipping thus slipping incidents culpable for mob occurrence can be prevented also the use of non slip boots to avoid slipping related mob occurrences is most likely to be a better economic choice than covering the entire main deck with non slip flooring proposed by lincoln and lucas lucas and lincoln 2007 checklists as decision aids have proven useful in the decision making environment for curbing human error stienen et al 2019 adya and phillips wren 2019 so during the brainstorming the going to main deck checklist and intoxication level checklist specifically for mob were proposed fishing vessels with accommodation structure will find the earlier checklist useful because it will define the fishers acceptable condition before going to the main deck the later checklist which can be implemented on every fishing vessel type using an appropriate mechanism will be geared towards preventing fishers who are highly intoxicated by alcohol or drug from going on a fishing voyage a significant mob fatality was recorded during the literature review for shooting and hauling fishing gears lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 designating an area on the main deck as a throw spot and encouraging fishers to do all shooting and hauling operations from there could have a positive impact on mob accidents caused by such operations the mob interventions model was applied to the small fishing boat case study and the outcome result is discussed in section 4 4 results and discussion table 3 shows the results from the forward analysis for the risk factors in fig 4 those for simple oobns complex oobns and sub networks not showing in fig 4 can be found in appendix a7 the values shown are occurrence probabilities for the risk factors involved the improvement index results from sensitivity analysis are presented in column 3 of table 4 next the difference in prior and posterior probabilities due to probability updating performed on the case study vessel are presented in table 4 column 4 only estimates for the top 7 root factors are shown in table 4 for both probability updating and sensitivity analysis the remainder of the estimations is in appendix a5 finally table 5 shows the rca results for the top 3 root factors from probability updating and sensitivity analysis while the previous research on mob focused on risk factors identification and their occurrence statistics generation the present study is primarily concerned with the probabilistic linking of the risk factors to predict probable mob occurrence scenarios aboard vessels very little was found in the literature on predicting a mob scenario before it degenerated into an accident so the case study application in the commercial fishing industry has shown that by connecting associated risk factors in an object oriented bayesian network environment it is possible to develop a pre mob analysis tool for a given vessel meaning using the mob oobn model developed endangering events culpable for mob occurrence during shipboard operations can now be noticed ahead of time and appropriate steps taken to avoid their occurrence an implication of this is that the mob oobn model could assist in the ongoing effort to reduce the frequency of mob cases aboard fishing vessels and in the industry at large lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 uğurlu et al 2019 it is also worth noting that the 17 see table 3 mob occurrence estimated by the model is comparable to some current statistics on the subject roberts 2010 thomas et al 2001 and uğurlu et al 2019 have recorded similar values for smaller groups e g fishing gear and communities for country specific estimations the mob occurrence rate stands between 23 and 33 of all fishing related accidents often per 10 years period lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 abraham 2002 these findings suggest that the mob oobn model is giving reasonable assessment estimation furthermore that the model can be used beyond single vessel analyses maritime administrations and ship owners could use the model to investigate their local e g vessels belonging to a group with a peculiar similarity global e g all the vessels of a shipping line and cumulative i e over a period say six months or a decade mob occurrence risk rates rough weather was mentioned by thomas et al 2001 as the cause for unexpected vessel movement 91 which then results in sudden vessel movement 88 or severe vessel motion 58 when these occur and a crew member outside the accommodation structure 78 did not wear a fall arrest system 24 a mob accident will likely occur thus a fisher not wearing a fall arrest system while the vessel is in rough seas is the pre existing condition to cause a mob accident since being outside the accommodation structure is unavoidable if fishing operations must continue however addressing the failure to wear a fall arrest system instead of rough seas appears reasonable due to sea state variability this viewpoint was also mentioned by case et al 2018 another question the present study sought to answer was which root factors contributed much to mob occurrence and how to determine these factors before the accident i e mob occurrence previous research works relied on eyewitness testimonies and other qualitative fact finding methods to arrive at these factors lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 thomas et al 2001 case et al 2018 the main disadvantage of these methods is that they are only useful after the accident has occurred knowing that mob consequences are grave proactive strategies would be more desirable in identifying the critical root factors leading to the accident sensitivity analysis by improvement index and probability updating as demonstrated in the works of khakzad et al 2011 and khan et al 2018 have proven useful in this regard after applying these techniques the first seven most influencing root factors identified are shown in table 4 these factors made the highest contributions to the 17 mop estimated consequently they are the most vulnerable events leading to mob occurrence aboard the small fishing boat under study any resource allocation towards mob occurrence prevention must be targeted first at these risk factors as explained in section 2 phase 3 and sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 the model developed facilitated sensitivity analysis and probability updating therefore the model supports decision making processes and policy makers in maritime accident prevention committees will find the model and the approach for vulnerable events identification useful when confronted with making decisions on which risk factors to target to mitigate mob and related shipboard accidents likewise the model and the approach could help vessel masters make decisions on daily proactive measures to avert mob occurrence during shipboard operations although knowing the individual critical factors or vulnerable events for mob occurrence on a given vessel matters it is equally important to define whether mob occurs more often when these factors act in singles or combine this way control measures would be targeted at the worst case scenario known as the mpc khakzad et al 2011 hence risk control analysis is necessary and table 5 shows the case study vessel s analysis results the first column lists the rcgs and their root factors column 2 stands for total probability and provides a frequency measure for each rcg under all the possible ways individual factors in an rcg could occur in calculating total probability the non occurrence probability of the factors involved is considered making it impossible to use total probability to determine the mpc also the conditional probability column 3 which gives the frequency measure for a mob occurrence given that an rcg has occurred cannot be used either it does not quantify the combined impact of each root factor s occurrence and non occurrence within an rcg on mob occurrence that is to say it does not explore all the possible ways the factors in an rcg could lead to mob occurrence on the other hand the joint probability can be used to decide the mpc because it estimates the possibility of mob occurrence given the simultaneous occurrence of rcg factors and mob from the above explanation the results of column 4 show that the mpc for mob occurrence considering the case study at hand is the simultaneous occurrence of all three root factors employed in the rca before deciding to assign control measures it is essential to inquire about statistical significance among the joint probability estimates for the sake of intervention prioritization and the creation of control options the results for the z statistics used are shown in column 5 of table 5 at a 5 significance level for either one or two tail test all the z scores are not in one region acceptance or rejection this means the joint probabilities are statistically different therefore the hierarchy i e last column of table 5 for administering interventions was formed based on the joint probabilities as an optimum solution to prevent mob occurrence for the case study vessel interventions for all three risk factors must be prioritized if for example because of budgetary limitations all the three factors cannot be addressed simultaneously hrco 2 3 and 5 i e two factors combination or hroc 4 and 6 i e single factor may be considered providing interventions to strolling working close to low guardrails i e r6 is at the bottom implying it is the last option of redress to be considered that does not necessarily mean it is the least effective option depending on the intervention technique used mob occurrence could be prevented by focusing on r6 if the technique erect high guardrails see fig 5 is used mob occurrence may be aborted even if a fisher is not using a fall arrest system and is still close to the guardrail the interventions bank is shown in appendix a6 it contains 119 control measures for the 88 root factors used in the case study model the install and use a fall arrest system prohibit alcohol or drug use prepare and use the go to main deck and alcohol level checklists and wear lifejackets while onboard are typical examples of control measures for mob accident prevention and consequence mitigation for the case study vessel the interventions bank will serve as an example for ship owners and shipping companies and guide developing similar intervention measures for the mob accident or other accidents mitigation aboard their vessels finally although the present study has provided useful insight into probabilistic methods application for mob scenario analysis it can still be improved due to the inconsistencies in literature data which raises data inadequacy issues the case study results may not reflect exact values this could be improved by accessing historical data from the commercial fishing industry and going through the computational process described in sections 2 and 3 also this study s methodology relied on hazard identification and analysis sanni anibire et al 2020 explained it is challenging if not impossible to enumerate all the incidents events culpable of an accident therefore the study is limited in the number of risk factors used so the model being a bayesian network may not capture all the possible dependency and interdependency relationships to trigger mob accident aboard vessels thus it is possible to enhance the analysis by considering more scenarios to identify additional risk factors dependency and interdependency relationships for mob occurrence and then build a new mob oobn model more control techniques can be researched in the same vein and added to the interventions bank to further equip it with tools for mob prevention and the mitigation of the consequences in following a practical approach to arriving at the model the thought process involved in oobn development may vary between researchers thus a different thought process could be used to model the mob accident scenario 5 conclusions man overboard mob is the one shipboard accident identified globally as a leading cause of commercial fishing s high death rate would it therefore not be remarkable progress if a tool existed to predict man overboard scenarios before they lead to an accident this is the purpose the present study sought to achieve using the object oriented bayesian network oobn mob risk factors were captured in fragmented structures and linked together probabilistically to develop the mob oobn model the model is capable of predicting scenarios culpable for mob occurrence during everyday operations aboard fishing vessels the model was applied to a small fishing vessel case study and as a result the following conclusions can be drawn given prior probabilities for basic variables the model would estimate the percentage likelihood of mob occurrence aboard a vessel the estimate predicts the chances of mob accident occurring at that instant when used together with sensitivity analysis and probability updating techniques the model could assist in decision making about the vulnerable factors requiring control to prevent a possible mob occurrence during risk control analysis the model can learn the most probable mob occurrence scenario aboard a vessel not wearing a fall arrest system strolling close to low guardrails and working on the main deck under alcohol or drug influence are the prime risk factors identified by the model as leading to mob accident apart from the mob oobn model the study made other contributions to the body of knowledge on mob it developed the mob interventions model from which engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment ppe can be assigned to risk factors constituting the most probable mob occurrence scenario it proposed the design of a going to main deck checklist to ensure for vessels with accommodation structures every crew member leaving for the main deck is adequately equipped against becoming a mob victim and it proposed designating a throw spot area like the helideck area on some offshore supply vessels on the main deck of fishing vessels to curb mob occurrences triggered by shooting and hauling of fishing gears which was among the leading causes of mob accidents the findings of the present study have important implications for mob accident prevention and future research when used together the two models i e the mob oobn model and the mob interventions model could serve as tools ship captains and superintendents can use to anticipate and correct probable mob scenarios aboard their vessels while the crew engages in daily operational tasks hence the models are recommended to fishing enterprises and shipping companies at large also policy makers in maritime administrations would find the mob oobn model helpful in decision making on which mob causality is the riskiest and deserves policy formulation to avoid mob occurrences aboard vessels further research in line with confidence interval prediction for mob when using the mob oobn model is strongly encouraged the artisanal fishing industry afi which is a subset of the commercial fishing industry employs boats and traditional fishing methods different from the case study application considered in many cases these boats do not have accommodation structures thus increasing the risk to the crew of being swept overboard in adverse conditions applying the present study methodology to the afi will ensure tailor made forms of the models in the present study are developed to mitigate the frequent mob occurrences in the sector additionally a feasibility study targeted at the proposals going to main deck checklist and throw spot area design for curbing a mob accident is needed a feasibility study must be done alongside an assessment of efficacy the present study s key message is that using the object oriented bayesian network a probabilistic model can be developed to predict man overboard

20815,one major accident scenario aboard fishing vessels is man overboard mob prevention of this accident scenario would reduce the high fatality rate in the fishing industry critical understanding of the risk factors is vital for a robust risk assessment of this accident scenario and to develop interventions this paper presents the objected oriented bayesian network oobn application for risk assessment of the mob scenario the oobn model is developed to probabilistically capture the key accident influencing factors in fragmented structures the proposed methodology is demonstrated in an accident scenario and the model captures the dynamic dependencies and interdependencies among basic variables and establishes their degree of influence on the accident occurrence probability the vulnerability path was identified and a pre and post accident intervention plan was proposed to minimize the accident occurrence and its associated risk applying the methodology provides vital safety based information that could be adopted for small vessel operation and maritime administration regulation keywords man overboard oobn fishing vessel accident risk control analysis risk analysis 1 introduction man overboard mob is a shipboard accident that occurs when a person onboard a marine vessel falls into the surrounding water and needs to be rescued lucas and lincoln 2007 sevin et al 2016 ortlund and larsson 2018 roberts 2010 the mob is also called fall overboard lucas and lincoln 2007 and person overboard karvinen 2017 almost every type of marine vessel sevin et al 2016 ortlund and larsson 2018 lusic et al 2019 neale and mirto 2012 chen and chen 2019 pitman et al 2019 has recorded mob occurrence on fishing vessels however case et al yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 and lucas and lincoln 2007 have identified mob as a significant accident next to capsize sinking or vessel loss to fishers and requires an immediate remedy the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh says that 23 of alaska s total fisher deaths from 1990 to 1999 were due to mob h 2002 surveillance 2002 similar death statistics have been mentioned for the commercial fishing industries in the united kingdom norway new zealand canada and other parts of the united states yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 looking at the eras in which these researchers generated statistics for mob one is tempted to say that the accident only existed before the twenty first century and no longer bothers the commercial fishing industry cfi such presumption would be incorrect since a recent study by uğurlu et al 2019 shows that between the 2009 and 2018 year period 26 mob accidents occurred and resulted in 20 fishers death meaning on average there was one fisher death for mob occurrence the mob categorized as a personal accident though has a low occurrence rate compared to vessel accidents such as capsizing sinking grounding collision or fire and explosion its fatality rate is as high as those for these accident types lucas and lincoln 2007 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 again among the leading personal accidents i e struck by gear or heavy seas entangled in gear fall into the dock and asphyxiated by fumes which happens on fishing vessels main deck and directly to the fisher mob presents the highest fatality rate roberts 2010 uğurlu et al 2019 mob poses a severe danger to fishing safety and is increasingly recognized worldwide as the one personal accident that if mitigated could reduce fishing fatality significantly lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 abraham 2002 the mob death toll in the industry has been linked to the small fishing vessels roberts 2010 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 noted that the absence of a harmonized safety legislation from the international maritime organization imo to regulate small fishing vessels activities encourages dangerous fishing practices which often result in various accidents including mob roberts 2010 reported 160 fisher deaths in the united kingdom uk fishing industry within the 1996 and 2005 year period the medium fishing vessels mfvs i e fishing vessels with a length overall from 24 m to 36 m and large fishing vessels lfvs i e fishing vessels with a length overall more than 36 m caused 38 and 20 deaths respectively leaving small fishing vessels sfvs i e fishing vessels with a length overall not more than 24 m with as much as 120 deaths furthermore 32 out of the 160 deaths were due to mob resulting in the distribution sfvs 24 deaths mfvs 6 deaths and lfvs 2 deaths therefore there is no doubt that sfvs harbor several safety risks and are vulnerable to mob the need to intensify research activities on sfvs and mob cannot be overemphasized from the discussion so far proactive measures to improve safety onboard sfvs through mob prevention are needed this calls for the development of proactive methods capable of quantifying the occurrence or non occurrence of mob during everyday shipboard operations the previous studies lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 on mob used post accident and qualitative methods in analyzing the mob scenario these methods have produced numeric results indicating a quantitative assessment of mob yet the numbers cannot be used to predict the chances of mob occurrence during in service operations aboard a vessel the methods used in generating these numbers are non probabilistic and only yield statistics on how often a mob causality the accident itself or both have happened for a given vessel maritime administration or country lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 lincoln and conway 1999 nevertheless the methods have successfully identified the risk factors associated with mob accidents though they cannot anticipate the occurrence or non occurrence of mob scenarios and the accident during everyday shipboard operations as a result though mob has been approached by previous researchers as a quantitative risk assessment qra brandsæter 2002 problem the aspects of occurrence prediction or predispose assessment are yet to be covered the present study proposed a qra methodology based on probability theory khakzad et al 2011 aziz et al 2019 khan et al 2018 to analyze the mob scenario methodologies founded on probability theory as explained in khakzad et al 2011 and goerlandt and montewka 2015 are excellent at handling accident prediction and predispose assessment of risk factors because they can 1 provide a broad picture of the accident scenario based on actual happenings 2 deal with the uncertainties that arise in accident occurrence prediction due to lack of sufficient data 3 identify the underpinning logic in accidents incidents and their risk factors 4 use the logic understanding to develop analytical networks for the accident scenario modeling and 5 provide percentages that measure the chances of occurrence or non occurrence of an accident and its risk factors another critical aspect of mob not covered in previous research is the linkage of mob risk factors as shown in later sections mob occurrence risk factors are broad and diverse and comprise human technical and environmental factors yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005

vessels which resulted in the mob the vessel and onboard equipment inadequacies leading to mob constitute the technical factors in contrast weather conditions such as the intensity of sea waves wind snow rainfall etc which interfered with vessel operations and caused mob to occur are the environmental factors although previous researchers lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 have identified these risk factors none has studied linking all the factors together into a network structure this places limitations on a comprehensive description of the mob scenario and the study of dependency and interdependency relationships among risk factors the result is that the mob scenario is not adequately understood and the most probable scenario to cause mob for a given vessel or operational condition cannot be predicted the current study uses object oriented bayesian network oobn modeling khan et al 2018 langseth and bangsø 2001 to probabilistically capture mob influencing factors in fragmented structures and link them together then the resulting model is used to dynamically analyze the dependencies and interdependencies among basic variables the oobn is a probabilistic modeling tool often preferred to bayesian network bn when handling massive accident scenarios due to vast influencing factors khakzad et al 2011 khan et al 2018 although oobn modeling has been applied to several complex accident scenarios in the maritime industry khan et al 2018 afenyo et al 2020a 2020b the literature search suggests that oobn has not been applied to mob or fishing vessels before the present study mob occurrence presents severe consequences including drowning yoo 2019 case et al 2018 cold shock responses abraham 2002 case et al 2018 hyperventilation aspiration chochinov 1998 case et al 2018 hypothermia abraham 2002 chochinov 1998 and muscle function deterioration chochinov 1998 case et al 2018 the studies of pitman et al 2019 and thomas et al 2001 showed that these post mob incidents are responsible for the high fisher deaths attributed to mob considering the death risk posed by these incidents and noting that lucas and lincoln 2007 and ugurlu et al uğurlu et al 2019 showed that mob occurrence had not declined yet in commercial fishing research efforts on mob interventions promotion must be stressed such interventions must provide control measures targeted at both pre and post mob incidents regulations provide firsthand control measures and are therefore taken seriously in every industry the msc 1 circ 1182 rev 1 wu et al 2014 and solas iii 17 1 krilić 2012 of imo entreats all vessels to have onboard the human and technological capacities to recover a mob victim from the water to that effect the regulations strongly advise frequent mob drills to ensure the shipboard crew is adequately prepared to handle mob accidents additionally the standards of training certification and watchkeeping stcw convention federation 2010 of imo urges vessels masters to conduct familiarisation tours of the safety systems and emergency procedures aboard their vessels for a new crew member among other things the new crew member must be told the procedures for mob aboard furthermore the international labour organization ilo s code organisation 1996 accident prevention on board ship at sea and in port provides mob control measures when carrying out overboard tasks e g checking draught readings the code says the crew member involved must wear a fall protection system and a personal floatation device it also advises that another crew member must standby and keep watch lastly the international organization for standardisation iso s iso pas 21195 2018 en o s 21195 2018 en 2020 have specified the minimum requirement expected of shipboard equipment used for mob interventions although the ilo code offers some pre mob interventions these regulations predominantly offer post mob control measures and therefore lack the ability to prevent mob occurrence proactively these regulations were enacted with vessels of length 24 m or more in mind for example the iso regulation was passed specifically for passenger vessels due to this their enforcement on sfvs is difficult also non overboard tasks that are equally liable for mob occurrence cannot be addressed by the ilo code s control measures realizing the inadequacies in existing regulations targeted at mob prevention aboard sfvs researchers lucas and lincoln 2007 thomas et al 2001 jensen et al 2014 case et al 2018 worked at developing control measures to that effect the control measures are broadly categorized into engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment ppe use lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 engineering controls require modifications to vessels systems and equipment to prevent a fisher from becoming a mob victim administrative controls are rules or working procedures onboard aimed at limiting the fisher s exposure to mob incidents the ppe use such as wearing of life jackets is encouraged to mitigate mob consequences the engineering controls and administrative controls are preferred to ppe use because they provide pre mob interventions and are proactive lucas and lincoln 2007 typical examples of the engineering controls administrative controls and ppe suggested for mob prevention and to mitigate consequences on sfvs will be discussed in later sections of the present study meanwhile lucas and lincoln 2007 recommended that more control measures be sought and paired with specific mob causality therefore the literature survey and brainstorming sessions held in the present study sought additional engineering and administrative controls together with those of previous researchers the discovered control measures were built into the mob interventions model the model selects from a bank of control measures appropriate engineering controls administrative controls and ppes for a given mob causality in summary though the present study builds on previous research works its primary purpose is to demonstrate how oobn modeling could be used to develop a probabilistic tool for mob scenario analysis aboard fishing vessels the present study is different from previous mob research the methodology proposed here can measure the likelihood of a mob accident occurrence and the causation during everyday shipboard operations therefore the study is novel in two ways 1 first time application of oobn in fishing safety assessment and 2 dynamic prediction of mob scenario in the maritime industry using probability theory the study presents a proactive assessment method and a pre accident analysis tool through the proposed qra framework and the oobn model for mob scenario analysis these are useful resources that policy makers for maritime accidents prevention ship owners and shipping companies and shipboard officers could employ to manage mob scenarios and related shipboard hazards before the incidents degenerate into accidents the present study sought to achieve the following specific objectives 1 to develop a mob oobn model for small fishing vessels 2 to use the model to support decision making on the most influencing factors for mob occurrence 3 to conduct a risk control analysis using the model to provide control options for mob prevention and its consequence mitigation and 4 to develop the mob interventions model from which control measures can be selected to address identified top risk factors for mob occurrence this paper consists of five sections section 2 is the next and describes the study framework and methods used to develop the mob oobn model in section 3 a small fishing vessel case study shows how the proposed methodology works in practice subsequently the case study results are presented and discussed in section 4 finally the summary and key message of the study are presented as conclusions in section 5 2 the methodology the qra is an established methodology that gives quantitative estimates of risks associated with operations or processes brandsæter 2002 khan et al 2018 qin et al 2011 by its nature qra combines hazard assessment with risk analysis to estimate the risk foreseen two estimation approaches are broadly followed in a qra probabilistic khan et al 2018 and non probabilistic qin et al 2011 probabilistic estimates give values between 0 and 1 while the non probabilistic yields other non zero values based on a likert scale score typically 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 the probabilistic by far is the choice approach because of its underlying probability theory and the rigorous estimation process khan et al 2018 goerlandt and montewka 2015 therefore the qra framework see fig 1 proposed for the present study used the probabilistic estimation approach the framework has four phases hazard identification accident scenario modeling occurrence probability estimation and risk control analysis rca rectangles squares denote task steps and the diamond shape is for decision making in each yellow ellipse the specific technique s to carry out a task is written and arrows give workflow direction to operationalize the framework start by identifying factors initiating mob occurrence go on to the next tasks and end after assigning control measures each phase of the framework is presented in detail subsequently phase 1 hazard identification this is the first stage in the framework presented in fig 1 here the risk factors to cause mob occurrence were identified through a literature survey and what if analysis when much literature exists on an accident or incident sanni anibire et al 2020 have shown that a literature survey can help identify the accident s cause s the academic databases used for the literature search were sciencedirect emerald ieee xplore digital library proquest springerlink taylor and francis online ebscohost engineering village federal science library google scholar and fish fisheries and aquatic biodiversity worldwide these databases hold many publications on maritime accidents particularly for the commercial fishing industry where mob accidents frequently occur lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 the keywords man overboard person overboard and fall overboard were combined with vessel ship marine maritime commercial fishing and fishing accidents to identify literature lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 relevant to the study to avoid missing out on relevant risk factors in addition to journal and conference papers the study team carefully scrutinized mob relevant contents in master s and doctoral dissertations textbooks book chapters technical reports and working papers too this exercise ensured that the developed oobn model captured the relevant aspects of mob occurrence some identified risk factors for mob occurrence needed further breakdown to identify root causes the what if analysis came in handy crowl and louvar 2019 the what if analysis yielded the additional risk factors needed through the study team s brainstorming sessions to ask questions about possible undesired events finally all risk factors identified were documented and saved on the computer and a backup storage device phase 2 accident scenario modeling this phase was responsible for creating the accident network for mob occurrence two assumptions were deemed critical for forming the network if a practical approach for mob accident occurrence was to be modeled first follow a realism approach based on how events unfolded to describe mob occurrence aboard vessels secondly the dependency relationship between a group of risk factors can only be modeled as either mutually exclusive or mutually inclusive the first assumption calls for a thorough digest of accident investigation reports to understand the circumstances that led to mob occurrence aboard vessels that fell victim to the accident however the second assumption calls for expert opinions on operational matters related to accident risk factors combination to cause the mob accident therefore the assumptions provide an opportunity to leverage lessons learned from past mob accidents and experience gained in causality relationship development to build a robust accident network for mob scenario analysis onboard marine vessels as uğurlu et al 2019 explained the accident network reveals the formation patterns of risk factors to result in the accident to do this first a causality relationship was established among the risk factors identified in phase 1 by following the three tier stages in fig 2 in establishing the causality relationship and the network the brainstorming sessions focused on understanding how mob occurs in reality the accident investigations reports lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 studied during the sessions revealed how the risk factors identified unfolded to cause mob accidents the study team discovered that regardless of the vessel type the crew member was on the main deck for every mob accident not wearing a fall arrest system though close to the gunwale and a significant unexpected vessel movement occurred too that is the tier i stage in the mob scenario modeling shown in fig 2 at this stage typical questions to be asked include why was the crew on the main deck and not inside the accommodation structure for vessels that have one and what caused the unexpected vessel movement to occur hence job related tasks personal behaviors and vessel motion factors contributing to mob occurrence followed as tier ii finally to complete the risk factors arrangement tier ii factors basic variables are placed next to constitute the tier iii stage the tiers i ii and iii together formed a hierarchical accident structure as shown in fig 2 in which the mob is positioned at the top as the accident the broken lines in fig 2 show that more causal factors may be sought in tier ii before defining tier iii s basic variables after establishing the hierarchical structure the second step was to define the dependency relationship among the risk factors in the structure the risk factors were assumed to be in mutually exclusive or mutually inclusive dependency relationship at each tier as a result it was possible to transform the hierarchical structure in fig 2 into a fault tree diagram ftd the ftd is a graphical risk modeling tool excellent at representing accident scenarios as diagrams for easy comprehension uğurlu et al 2015 kabir 2017 a group of risk factors modeled as mutually exclusive scenario mes require the occurrence of only one of the lower risk factors lrfs for the upper risk factor urf to occur this translates into an or logic gate on the ftd for an mes on the contrary a group of risk factors exhibiting a mutually inclusive scenario mis required all lrfs to occur before a urf would occur therefore an mis is represented by an and logic gate on the ftd the decision making on forming mes and mis was guided by published literature lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 on mob accident investigations and expert opinions the expert opinions were sought from senior researchers on the study team who shared their knowledge on ftd formation based on previous experience kabir 2017 also provides helpful guidance on ftd construction from the above discussion and bearing in mind the assumptions guiding the mob accident network formation fig 2 was turned into an ftd in fig 3 for a mob to occur the victim would be on the main deck not wearing a fall arrest system while close to the gunwale and an unexpected vessel movement would destabilize the victim which most likely could cause the victim to topple over and head for overboard as a result tier i factors are lrfs and together with mob as the urf they are modeled as an mis a mob victim s reason for being on the main deck could be for job task execution or self initiative e g taking a stroll to enjoy the cool sea breeze likewise vessel movements are either ship motions or some external factor e g the impact from the iceberg or another ship related these lrfs in tier ii are mutually exclusive events and so when connected to their respective urf an mes evolves the mes and mis then combine to cause mob accident as illustrated in fig 3 next the ftd formed was converted into the mob oobn model which is the accident network for mob occurrence as mentioned in the introduction section the oobn is excellent at handling accident scenarios whose modeling would result in vast and complex network structures viz a viz network learning requirements khakzad et al 2011 khan et al 2018 which was the case for the present study the conversion was achieved by creating and linking simple oobns complex oobns sub networks and finally the mob oobn model while fundamentally the oobn combines the knowledge of object oriented programming and bayesian network langseth and bangsø 2001 the simple oobn and complex oobn concepts introduced in khan et al 2018 was applied to the present study a simple oobn is a grouping of basic events variables only whereas groups of simple oobns only or simple oobn s and basic event s constituted a complex oobn subsequently groupings of complex oobns formed sub networks then sub networks were connected together to give the mob oobn model again the formation and linking of simple oobns complex oobns sub networks and the mob oobn model was guided by the earlier assumptions and the mis and mes reasoning for computational purposes mis and mes are represented by conditional probability tables cpts following the procedure described in yang et al 2017 for constructing cpts and using mob and unexpected vessel movement occurred in fig 3 as examples tables 1 and 2 describes the probability elicitation process for an mes and an mis respectively let the lrfs have binary decision states i e yes and no meaning occurrence and non occurrence respectively then the number of probabilities to be entered in the cpts for each urf was determined using equation 1 hence the example mes and mis required four and eight probabilities in their cpts as shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively 1 n p 2 n where n p is the number of probabilities needed in a conditional probability table for a urf and n is the number of lrfs describing the urf occurrence finally phase 2 of the study framework fig 1 was completed by implementing the mob oobn model in a software environment the academic version of genie 2 4 software used by yang et al 2017 was found suitable for the present study enabling the submodel feature in genie 2 4 genie and modeler 2016 the simple oobns the complex oobns the sub networks and the mob oobn model were created as fragmented sub models joined by their respective cpts phase 3 occurrence probability estimation with the mob oobn model hereafter referred to as the model developed and implemented in genie it is now possible to estimate mob occurrence probability mop this required all root cause risk factors hereafter referred to as root factors to be assigned prior probabilities although historical databases aziz et al 2019 and expert elicitations sotiralis et al 2016 are the primary sources to acquire prior probability data animah and shafiee 2020 mentioned literature databases as another source of data for prior probability especially at the initial stages of research therefore the present study sought prior probabilities from the mob literature during the phase 1 task execution to ensure a credible estimate for mop only prior probabilities from peer reviewed papers in english and top tier international journals and conference proceedings were used as evident in the list of references the chosen prior probabilities for root factors were then put into the model and genie calculated probabilities using the cpts for simple oobns complex oobns sub networks and finally mop the model also supports evidential reasoning and learning langseth and bangsø 2001 yang et al 2017 when new information was discovered about a risk factor in the model the calculation procedure was repeated to facilitate further analyses khakzad et al 2011 yang et al 2017 since the present study only aimed to use the model to predict the most probable mob occurrence scenario and conduct rca further analyses were limited to probability updating and sensitivity analysis probability updating enabled the estimation of posterior probabilities for root factors given the occurrence of mob this was achieved by setting mop to 100 in the model genie then recalculated new probabilities i e posterior probabilities for all the model factors the recalculation is based on bayes theory see equation 2 from the equation the model sought to calculate p x y meaning the posterior or new probabilities of root factors given that mop 100 2 p x y p y x p x p y where x a hypothesis i e root factors y the evidence obtained about the hypothesis i e mob occurrence p x prior probability and represent the probability of x before new evidence y became available i e prior probabilities of root factors p y x likelihood probability and denote the probability of seeing the evidence y if the hypothesis x is true i e conditional probabilities in cpts p y total probability and denote the prior probability of y under all possible hypotheses and p x y posterior probability and indicate the latest probability of x based on the new evidence y gathered i e posterior probabilities of root factors given that mop is 100 after probability updating the sensitivity analysis was next as explained in qian qian and mahdi 2020 sensitivity analysis measured the proportions of variability in the model s output i e mop attributed to root factors in doing so the contributions made by each root factor to the estimated mop were known several techniques exist for sensitivity analysis qian and mahdi 2020 however the present study used the improvement index technique khakzad et al 2011 because it allows for the model proposed to be involved in the conduction of sensitivity analysis this way the mob oobn model application in sensitivity analysis can be demonstrated to determine the percentage contribution of a root factor 0 was assigned to the factor and genie run for a new mop subsequently the percentage change in the old or original and new mop values was computed using equation 3 the procedure was repeated for the remainder of the root factors the percentage changes recorded were ranked from the highest to the lowest as improvement indices higher scores made more contribution to mob occurrence probability than lower scores 3 improvement index percentage change original mop new mop original mop 100 phase 4 risk control analysis this is the final stage of the framework its goal is to identify the most influencing root factors and then assign intervention measures to prevent or mitigate their occurrence this would ensure mob occurrence is prevented or minimized significantly first the list of most influencing root factors was created all root factors that appeared top e g first 3 or 5 factors during the probability updating and sensitivity analysis were put on the list khakzad et al 2011 showed that risk factors could combine to cause the accident occurrence therefore equation 4 was used to form combinations of the single factors and added to the list to create the risk control groups rcgs 4 c n r n r n r where c n r number of r groups out of n n total number of elements in the rcg set and r number of element combinations to be formed after creating rcgs a new mop was estimated given that an rcg has occurred i e p mob rcg the result was put into equation 5 and subsequently the joint probability of mob and rcg i e p mob rcg was estimated the procedure was repeated for other rcgs next the most influential rcg was determined by the z statistical test zhang 2011 liang and pan 2006 the most influential rcg is the most probable configuration mpc khakzad et al 2011 for mob occurrence the reason for doing the test is to check for a statistically significant difference among the rcgs which would justify using rcgs to define the mpc finally interventions were prescribed to the mpc by assigning control measures to each root factor involved 5 p m o b r c g i p m o b r c g i p r c g i where p mob r c g i conditional probability p mob r c g i joint probability and p r c g i total probability 3 case study applications it could be inferred from the introduction section that the commercial fishing industry and small fishing vessels are critical subjects when it comes to mob occurrence therefore applying the described methodology to case studies in these areas would be useful in the broader sense the case study serves two purposes 1 demonstrating how to develop the mob oobn model for a specific sector of the maritime transport industry e g cfi and 2 showing how to use the mob oobn model to conduct mob scenario analysis on a given vessel e g a small fishing boat the proceeding section presents the case study demonstrations 3 1 mob oobn model development for the cfi the mob risk factors in the cfi were identified by implementing phase 1 of the proposed framework fig 1 a total of 88 root factors see appendix a1 were realized and used in drawing the mob occurrence ftd see then 22 simple oobns were formed from these root factors and subsequently complex oobn n 19 and sub network n 5 were formed the simple oobns complex oobns and sub networks were finally linked together probabilistically using the cpts as explained in tables 1 and 2 resulting in the mob oobn model hereafter referred to as the model the model development implementation and computation analyses were done using the genie 2 4 academic version it must be noted that the summary description of procedures given here for the model development is based on the detailed explanation provided in phases 1 and 2 of section 2 fig 4 shows the model with its 3 of the 5 sub networks see appendix a3 and root factors categorized into technical environmental and human factors see appendices a1 and a4 in section 1 of this study the bases for these categorizations were stated simple oobns in these categories were grouped under t e and h respectively they then combine as complex oobns in m and their effects are extended as f a f b and f b to form sub networks by abstraction and encapsulation see fig 4 and appendix a1 for illustrations the developed model fig 4 described the possibility of mob occurrence given that the crew member involved was on the main deck yes no not wearing a fall arrest system yes no and there was unexpected vessel movement yes no sudden vessel movements or ship motions severely not severely triggered the unexpected vessel movement yes no 3 2 mob scenario analysis with the mob oobn model developed for the cfi the case study s first objective has been achieved likewise the foundation has been laid for the second objective mob scenario analysis to be accomplished a small fishing boat was employed as the case study vessel then probability updating and forward sensitivity and risk control analyses were performed for the boat by following the procedures in section 2 phases 3 and 4 further descriptive for the boat analyses follow 3 2 1 case scenario description the case study vessel is a hypothetical small fishing boat that uses pot gear and whose operational performances and environmental jurisdiction subjected it to the mob risk factors identified earlier generally a pot gear is a trap used to catch shellfishes such as lobsters crabs crayfish octopus and oysters lucas and lincoln 2007 case et al 2018 fishing vessels employing this gear type ranges from small boats used within territorial waters to as large as 50 m in length used on the high seas for this study the small boat type with a length overall not exceeding 24 m and capable of operating beyond territorial waters is the focus the vessel s suitability for demonstration comes from the fact that pot gear operation relies heavily on fishing lines yoo 2019 case et al 2018 which have been identified as the prime cause of gear entanglement roberts 2010 accidents leading to mob occurrence also among pot gillnet and longliner fishing gears lincoln and lucas lucas and lincoln 2007 reported 34 out of 71 fatal mob occurrences on fishing vessels that used pot gear this was the highest fatality by fishing gear type in alaska from 1990 to 2005 lucas and lincoln 2007 additionally thomas et al 2001 mentioned that out of 117 fishers hospitalized the crab pot was the cause of the injury sustained by 53 of these fishers using prior probabilities see appendix a5 sourced from literature and the model developed a qra was carried out on the case study vessel as detailed next 3 2 2 forward analysis the goal of this section was to estimate mop using the developed model fig 4 therefore probabilities for root factors were sought from literature as described in section 2 phase 3 and plugged into the model see appendix a4 the genie was run and it yielded an estimate for mop 3 2 3 probability updating the goal and procedure for probability updating were discussed in phase 3 of section 2 following the procedure described the yes decision state of the mob node yellow color in fig 4 was set to 100 and genie run to give posterior probabilities for root factors 3 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed to determine each root factor s contribution to the estimated mop the failed to use fall arrest system yes no in fig 4 will be used to demonstrate the process first the mop estimated in section 3 2 2 was noted as the original mop then the no decision state of the failed to use fall arrest system node was set to 100 meaning the node is excluded from the proceeding calculation genie was run and a new mop was estimated and called new mop finally the original mop and new mop were plugged into equation 3 and the node s percentage contribution to the original mop was estimated as its improvement index this process was repeated for the remaining 87 root risk factors 3 2 5 risk control analysis the mpc for mob occurrence was discussed in detail in phase 4 of section 2 and how to identify it using rca here a demonstration of the step by step procedures used is presented for the small fishing boat case study only three root factors were considered for a detailed rca more root factors must be considered based on the results of sensitivity analysis and probability updating step 1 the top three root factors for mob occurrence were identified see appendix a5 failed to use fall arrest system while on the main deck r1 working under alcohol influence r32 strolling working close to low guardrails r6 step 2 risk control groups rcgs were formed using equation 4 accident scenario triggered by a single risk factor r1 r6 and r32 accident scenario triggered by dual risk factors r1 r32 r1 r6 r6 r32 accident scenario triggered by triple risk factors r1 r6 r32 step 3 the total probability for each rcg was estimated for example the total probability for r1 was computed as follows p r 1 p mob yes r 1 yes p r 1 yes p mob yes r 1 no p r 1 no the model was used to evaluate p m o b y e s r 1 y e s and p m o b y e s r 1 n o as done in section 3 2 4 it gave 0 715 and 0 000 for earlier and later conditional probabilities hence p r 1 0 715 1 0 0 285 0 715 since p r 1 y e s p r 1 n o 1 step 4 the joint probability for each rcg and mob occurrence was estimated using equation 5 for example the joint probability of r1 and mob occurrence was computed as follows p m o b r 1 p m o b r 1 p r 1 0 715 0 715 0 511 step 5 find out if significant differences exist between p m o b r c g i values using the z statistic zhang 2011 liang and pan 2006 first the null h o and alternative h a hypotheses were stated h o all values of p m o b r c g i are the same h a at least one p m o b r c g i value is different next a significant level was set for the test e g 5 the z score table was then used to estimate the areas under the graph corresponding to values of p m o b r c g i i 1 7 for a two tails or one tail test the estimated areas were then plotted on the standard normal distribution curve to find out which region i e acceptance or rejection did each fall lastly a if all estimated areas fell in the acceptance region only or rejection region only the null hypothesis was upheld true b if the estimated areas are distributed in either region the alternative hypothesis was upheld true instead step 6 establish hierarchical risk control options hrcos base on p m o b r c g i from the fifth point of step 5 the following conclusions can be made if a holds then p m o b r c g i values are not statistically different and each rcg in step 2 has the same influence on mob occurrence in this case no particular order is required to form hrcos depending on other factors e g finance or convenience a specific rcg may be chosen first for redress towards mob occurrence prevention and the mitigation of consequences if b holds then p m o b r c g i values are statistically different which means some rcgs have more influence on mob occurrence than others therefore a peculiar order is required to form hrcos the values of p m o b r c g i were used to perform the ordering because mpc khakzad et al 2011 refers to the combination of root factors to cause the accident which is the joint probability higher values of p m o b r c g i were top on the hrcos list while lower values were at the bottom in assigning interventions for mob prevention or mitigation rcgs with higher p m o b r c g i values must be considered first those rcgs with lower p m o b r c g i values may be tackled later since the earlier forestalls mob occurrence the small fishing boat s rca results and those of the forward analysis probability updating and sensitivity analysis are presented and discussed in section 4 3 3 mob interventions model once the mpc for mob is known control measures are needed to prevent or mitigate the root factors involved to achieve this objective the mob interventions model see fig 5 was developed this model assigns control measures from the interventions bank see appendix a6 to a given root factor effective accident prevention requires control measures to address both pre accident and post accident occurrences lucas and lincoln 2007 case et al 2018 plog and quinlan 2012 therefore in fig 5 the mob interventions model uses engineering controls and administrative controls to provide safety against pre mob occurrences then ppe use is focused on post mob events to ensure a mob victim does not drown but remains afloat to be rescued the safest protection for a seafarer against mob accident is to stay inside the accommodation structure however that would mean no fishing activity can be performed for a fishing vessel resulting in economic loss therefore once a fisher is on the main deck depending on the fishing task appropriate engineering controls or administrative controls must be in place to ensure the fisher s protection against the mob accident these controls are intervention techniques retrieved from the interventions bank with samples provided in fig 5 the interventions bank was formed by gathering mob interventions mentioned in previous literature lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 h 2002 surveillance 2002 uğurlu et al 2019 abraham 2002 mcguinness et al 2013 wang et al 2005 chochinov 1998 dickey 2008 drudi 1998 jensen et al 2014 lincoln and conway 1999 lincoln and lucas 2010 holen et al 2017 ben yami and 2000 and linking them to appropriate root factors during the brainstorming sessions held as described in phase 1 of section 2 new intervention techniques for mob prevention and the mitigation of the consequences were suggested adding to the present study s novelty notable among them are using a mantra system on the bridge deck compulsory use of the non slip boot on the main deck while fishing developing and implementing a checklist specifically for mob and designating a throw spot area on the main deck the mantra system guleria and sood 2020 is becoming increasingly popular in scientific studies fundamentally it is based on human meditation or concentration harne et al 2019 and learning and information retention marchetti et al 2020 in the present study the mantra is used to mean any system mostly audio capable of reminding a pilot or an officer of the watch oow on duty to continue focusing attention on the assigned task this way human errors that occur during vessel piloting and resulting in incidents e g collisions that could cause mob occurrence are averted a non slip boot would have soles that do not allow slipping thus slipping incidents culpable for mob occurrence can be prevented also the use of non slip boots to avoid slipping related mob occurrences is most likely to be a better economic choice than covering the entire main deck with non slip flooring proposed by lincoln and lucas lucas and lincoln 2007 checklists as decision aids have proven useful in the decision making environment for curbing human error stienen et al 2019 adya and phillips wren 2019 so during the brainstorming the going to main deck checklist and intoxication level checklist specifically for mob were proposed fishing vessels with accommodation structure will find the earlier checklist useful because it will define the fishers acceptable condition before going to the main deck the later checklist which can be implemented on every fishing vessel type using an appropriate mechanism will be geared towards preventing fishers who are highly intoxicated by alcohol or drug from going on a fishing voyage a significant mob fatality was recorded during the literature review for shooting and hauling fishing gears lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 designating an area on the main deck as a throw spot and encouraging fishers to do all shooting and hauling operations from there could have a positive impact on mob accidents caused by such operations the mob interventions model was applied to the small fishing boat case study and the outcome result is discussed in section 4 4 results and discussion table 3 shows the results from the forward analysis for the risk factors in fig 4 those for simple oobns complex oobns and sub networks not showing in fig 4 can be found in appendix a7 the values shown are occurrence probabilities for the risk factors involved the improvement index results from sensitivity analysis are presented in column 3 of table 4 next the difference in prior and posterior probabilities due to probability updating performed on the case study vessel are presented in table 4 column 4 only estimates for the top 7 root factors are shown in table 4 for both probability updating and sensitivity analysis the remainder of the estimations is in appendix a5 finally table 5 shows the rca results for the top 3 root factors from probability updating and sensitivity analysis while the previous research on mob focused on risk factors identification and their occurrence statistics generation the present study is primarily concerned with the probabilistic linking of the risk factors to predict probable mob occurrence scenarios aboard vessels very little was found in the literature on predicting a mob scenario before it degenerated into an accident so the case study application in the commercial fishing industry has shown that by connecting associated risk factors in an object oriented bayesian network environment it is possible to develop a pre mob analysis tool for a given vessel meaning using the mob oobn model developed endangering events culpable for mob occurrence during shipboard operations can now be noticed ahead of time and appropriate steps taken to avoid their occurrence an implication of this is that the mob oobn model could assist in the ongoing effort to reduce the frequency of mob cases aboard fishing vessels and in the industry at large lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 yoo 2019 thomas et al 2001 uğurlu et al 2019 it is also worth noting that the 17 see table 3 mob occurrence estimated by the model is comparable to some current statistics on the subject roberts 2010 thomas et al 2001 and uğurlu et al 2019 have recorded similar values for smaller groups e g fishing gear and communities for country specific estimations the mob occurrence rate stands between 23 and 33 of all fishing related accidents often per 10 years period lucas and lincoln 2007 yoo 2019 abraham 2002 these findings suggest that the mob oobn model is giving reasonable assessment estimation furthermore that the model can be used beyond single vessel analyses maritime administrations and ship owners could use the model to investigate their local e g vessels belonging to a group with a peculiar similarity global e g all the vessels of a shipping line and cumulative i e over a period say six months or a decade mob occurrence risk rates rough weather was mentioned by thomas et al 2001 as the cause for unexpected vessel movement 91 which then results in sudden vessel movement 88 or severe vessel motion 58 when these occur and a crew member outside the accommodation structure 78 did not wear a fall arrest system 24 a mob accident will likely occur thus a fisher not wearing a fall arrest system while the vessel is in rough seas is the pre existing condition to cause a mob accident since being outside the accommodation structure is unavoidable if fishing operations must continue however addressing the failure to wear a fall arrest system instead of rough seas appears reasonable due to sea state variability this viewpoint was also mentioned by case et al 2018 another question the present study sought to answer was which root factors contributed much to mob occurrence and how to determine these factors before the accident i e mob occurrence previous research works relied on eyewitness testimonies and other qualitative fact finding methods to arrive at these factors lucas and lincoln 2007 roberts 2010 thomas et al 2001 case et al 2018 the main disadvantage of these methods is that they are only useful after the accident has occurred knowing that mob consequences are grave proactive strategies would be more desirable in identifying the critical root factors leading to the accident sensitivity analysis by improvement index and probability updating as demonstrated in the works of khakzad et al 2011 and khan et al 2018 have proven useful in this regard after applying these techniques the first seven most influencing root factors identified are shown in table 4 these factors made the highest contributions to the 17 mop estimated consequently they are the most vulnerable events leading to mob occurrence aboard the small fishing boat under study any resource allocation towards mob occurrence prevention must be targeted first at these risk factors as explained in section 2 phase 3 and sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 the model developed facilitated sensitivity analysis and probability updating therefore the model supports decision making processes and policy makers in maritime accident prevention committees will find the model and the approach for vulnerable events identification useful when confronted with making decisions on which risk factors to target to mitigate mob and related shipboard accidents likewise the model and the approach could help vessel masters make decisions on daily proactive measures to avert mob occurrence during shipboard operations although knowing the individual critical factors or vulnerable events for mob occurrence on a given vessel matters it is equally important to define whether mob occurs more often when these factors act in singles or combine this way control measures would be targeted at the worst case scenario known as the mpc khakzad et al 2011 hence risk control analysis is necessary and table 5 shows the case study vessel s analysis results the first column lists the rcgs and their root factors column 2 stands for total probability and provides a frequency measure for each rcg under all the possible ways individual factors in an rcg could occur in calculating total probability the non occurrence probability of the factors involved is considered making it impossible to use total probability to determine the mpc also the conditional probability column 3 which gives the frequency measure for a mob occurrence given that an rcg has occurred cannot be used either it does not quantify the combined impact of each root factor s occurrence and non occurrence within an rcg on mob occurrence that is to say it does not explore all the possible ways the factors in an rcg could lead to mob occurrence on the other hand the joint probability can be used to decide the mpc because it estimates the possibility of mob occurrence given the simultaneous occurrence of rcg factors and mob from the above explanation the results of column 4 show that the mpc for mob occurrence considering the case study at hand is the simultaneous occurrence of all three root factors employed in the rca before deciding to assign control measures it is essential to inquire about statistical significance among the joint probability estimates for the sake of intervention prioritization and the creation of control options the results for the z statistics used are shown in column 5 of table 5 at a 5 significance level for either one or two tail test all the z scores are not in one region acceptance or rejection this means the joint probabilities are statistically different therefore the hierarchy i e last column of table 5 for administering interventions was formed based on the joint probabilities as an optimum solution to prevent mob occurrence for the case study vessel interventions for all three risk factors must be prioritized if for example because of budgetary limitations all the three factors cannot be addressed simultaneously hrco 2 3 and 5 i e two factors combination or hroc 4 and 6 i e single factor may be considered providing interventions to strolling working close to low guardrails i e r6 is at the bottom implying it is the last option of redress to be considered that does not necessarily mean it is the least effective option depending on the intervention technique used mob occurrence could be prevented by focusing on r6 if the technique erect high guardrails see fig 5 is used mob occurrence may be aborted even if a fisher is not using a fall arrest system and is still close to the guardrail the interventions bank is shown in appendix a6 it contains 119 control measures for the 88 root factors used in the case study model the install and use a fall arrest system prohibit alcohol or drug use prepare and use the go to main deck and alcohol level checklists and wear lifejackets while onboard are typical examples of control measures for mob accident prevention and consequence mitigation for the case study vessel the interventions bank will serve as an example for ship owners and shipping companies and guide developing similar intervention measures for the mob accident or other accidents mitigation aboard their vessels finally although the present study has provided useful insight into probabilistic methods application for mob scenario analysis it can still be improved due to the inconsistencies in literature data which raises data inadequacy issues the case study results may not reflect exact values this could be improved by accessing historical data from the commercial fishing industry and going through the computational process described in sections 2 and 3 also this study s methodology relied on hazard identification and analysis sanni anibire et al 2020 explained it is challenging if not impossible to enumerate all the incidents events culpable of an accident therefore the study is limited in the number of risk factors used so the model being a bayesian network may not capture all the possible dependency and interdependency relationships to trigger mob accident aboard vessels thus it is possible to enhance the analysis by considering more scenarios to identify additional risk factors dependency and interdependency relationships for mob occurrence and then build a new mob oobn model more control techniques can be researched in the same vein and added to the interventions bank to further equip it with tools for mob prevention and the mitigation of the consequences in following a practical approach to arriving at the model the thought process involved in oobn development may vary between researchers thus a different thought process could be used to model the mob accident scenario 5 conclusions man overboard mob is the one shipboard accident identified globally as a leading cause of commercial fishing s high death rate would it therefore not be remarkable progress if a tool existed to predict man overboard scenarios before they lead to an accident this is the purpose the present study sought to achieve using the object oriented bayesian network oobn mob risk factors were captured in fragmented structures and linked together probabilistically to develop the mob oobn model the model is capable of predicting scenarios culpable for mob occurrence during everyday operations aboard fishing vessels the model was applied to a small fishing vessel case study and as a result the following conclusions can be drawn given prior probabilities for basic variables the model would estimate the percentage likelihood of mob occurrence aboard a vessel the estimate predicts the chances of mob accident occurring at that instant when used together with sensitivity analysis and probability updating techniques the model could assist in decision making about the vulnerable factors requiring control to prevent a possible mob occurrence during risk control analysis the model can learn the most probable mob occurrence scenario aboard a vessel not wearing a fall arrest system strolling close to low guardrails and working on the main deck under alcohol or drug influence are the prime risk factors identified by the model as leading to mob accident apart from the mob oobn model the study made other contributions to the body of knowledge on mob it developed the mob interventions model from which engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment ppe can be assigned to risk factors constituting the most probable mob occurrence scenario it proposed the design of a going to main deck checklist to ensure for vessels with accommodation structures every crew member leaving for the main deck is adequately equipped against becoming a mob victim and it proposed designating a throw spot area like the helideck area on some offshore supply vessels on the main deck of fishing vessels to curb mob occurrences triggered by shooting and hauling of fishing gears which was among the leading causes of mob accidents the findings of the present study have important implications for mob accident prevention and future research when used together the two models i e the mob oobn model and the mob interventions model could serve as tools ship captains and superintendents can use to anticipate and correct probable mob scenarios aboard their vessels while the crew engages in daily operational tasks hence the models are recommended to fishing enterprises and shipping companies at large also policy makers in maritime administrations would find the mob oobn model helpful in decision making on which mob causality is the riskiest and deserves policy formulation to avoid mob occurrences aboard vessels further research in line with confidence interval prediction for mob when using the mob oobn model is strongly encouraged the artisanal fishing industry afi which is a subset of the commercial fishing industry employs boats and traditional fishing methods different from the case study application considered in many cases these boats do not have accommodation structures thus increasing the risk to the crew of being swept overboard in adverse conditions applying the present study methodology to the afi will ensure tailor made forms of the models in the present study are developed to mitigate the frequent mob occurrences in the sector additionally a feasibility study targeted at the proposals going to main deck checklist and throw spot area design for curbing a mob accident is needed a feasibility study must be done alongside an assessment of efficacy the present study s key message is that using the object oriented bayesian network a probabilistic model can be developed to predict man overboard

20816,a series of experiments were performed to investigate the dynamic response of a mooring line based on the catenary configuration with imposed surge and heave motions in a water flume with a considered model scale factor of 1 70 the surge and heave motions with different amplitudes and periods were driven by a programmable electrical motor at the fairlead position respectively the dynamic tensions and motion trajectories of the mooring line were measured to illustrate the effects of pretension and motion period on the predominant harmonic components in the dynamic response the results show that the pretension and motion period have significant effects on the dynamic tensions and nonlinear motion trajectories of the mooring line multiple harmonic components of the dynamic tension are observed at the fairlead and the predominant harmonic tensions are found to be changed with variations of the pretension and motion period a sharp increase of the maximum tension force is observed at large pretension for the mooring line with the surge and heave imposed motions such sharp tension increase may result in floating platform and mooring system breakage the results of this paper revel the foundation of the further studies on the transforming mechanism of the slack and taut state of the mooring line as well as for optimism of the engineering designs in floating offshore devices mooring installations keywords mooring line surge motion heave motion dynamic tension motion trajectory 1 introduction investigations on the mooring system have been performed extensively due to its wide application in the offshore and ocean engineering such as floating production storage and offloading systems fpso lyu et al 2019 tension leg platforms tlp chandrasekaran et al 2006 offshore floating wind turbines jeon et al 2013 etc the top end of the mooring system is attached to the floating structure by fairleads and the bottom end is anchored to the seabed to provide a restoring moment under the combined environment loads during the service period the mooring system will suffer cyclic loads zarandi and skallerud 2020 such as storm surges and huge waves for a long time which could easily cause the cumulative fatigue damage of mooring systems xu et al 2014 over the past few decades numerous accidents of the offshore floating structures have been reported caused by the fatigue failures of the mooring systems ma et al 2013 kvitrud 2014 especially for those occurred near the touch down zone most of the previous experimental and numerical studies have been focused on the motion patterns and load transfer mechanisms of the mooring lines using the static and dynamic analysis methods walton and polachek 1960 webster 1975 kim et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 the rapid or periodic motion of the mooring line will cause the additional dynamic load increase the dynamic tension and may exceed its breaking strength liu et al 2013 the imposed motion and force loads at the fairlead and touchdown point are found to be critical for the dynamic responses of the mooring line johanning et al 2007 azcona et al 2017 hsu et al 2018 the initial horizontal force at the top of the mooring line is found to have significant effects on the surge and heave motion responses agarwal and jain 2003 azcona et al 2017 investigated different dynamic conditions such as the harmonic response loss tension of the mooring lines especially the shape of the line and tension at the fairlead to predict the shape of the mooring line and tension force at the considered diverse positions gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 investigated the dynamics of catenary mooring lines surrounding the touch down point zone the results indicate that the snap load and slack tension are observed during the upward and downward motions of the mooring line respectively the extreme mooring tension is found to cause a shock on the mooring line material and increase the fatigue damage of the mooring system when the floating system exhibits large motions hsu et al 2017 2018 thies et al 2014 hann et al 2015 palm et al 2017 most of the existing studies of the extreme tension have been focused on the snap load where a spike in tension occurs over a very short duration hsu et al 2017 based on the experimental investigation on the tension of a taut slack case zhang et al 2012 found that the snap tension is 5 times of the static one due to slack due to the effect of snap loads the maximum tension values are reported to be 37 68 higher than the corresponding cyclic non snap tension maxima in the study of hsu et al 2017 the structural parameters and wave parameters are reported to have important effects on the predictions of the slack and snap phenomena cross 1992 guo et al 2016 however a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism for the extreme tension of the mooring line is urgently needed the relationships between the dynamic tension and the excitation frequency have not been revealed therefore the purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of the imposed surge and heave motion amplitudes and periods on the dynamic tensions and motion trajectories of the mooring line the tension and motion trajectories are measured to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the mooring line with different pretensions imposed motion amplitudes and periods by analyzing the experimental data a complete understanding of the fundamental features of the dynamic tension load for the mooring line with different geometry configurations is illustrated the paper is organized as follows the experimental set up is described in section 2 in section 3 the results obtained from the tension force motion trajectories are presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experimental set up the experiments for flow past a mooring line undergoing surge and heave periodic motions were performed in the open recirculation water flume at coastal laboratory in ocean college zhejiang university china the test section of the water flume is 25 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m high the water depth is kept at 0 4 m both the sidewalls and the bottom of the water flume are made of transparent plexiglas to facilitate optical access fig 1 shows a schematic sketch of the experimental set up considering the typical mooring line in offshore floating wind turbine foundation and the water flume scales the model is scaled following froude s law with a scale factor of 1 70 to satisfy the relationship of the inertial and gravitational forces between the prototype and model scale mooring line modelling requires to scale the dominant hydrodynamic loads apart from the weight of the mooring line which provides the restoring force and the inertia loads as suggested in barrera et al 2019 the mooring chain used for the dynamic load test is made of stainless steel the diameter of the chain is d 2 mm and the length is l 1500 mm the length of the link t is 17 mm and the diameter of the chain link b is 8 mm the weight per unit length of the mooring line is 0 082 kg m a pendulum rig was used as a transmission device and an aluminum structure was designed to allow the surge and heave movements in the water flume the top end of the mooring line was connected to the aluminum structure and the lower end of the mooring line was anchored on a heavy steel plate placed at the bottom of the water flume where the rigid bottom was considered in the experiment the surge and heave motions of the mooring line could be driven by an electrical motor fixed in a frame placed on the upside of the water flume the range of the movement speed was from 10 mm s to 200 mm s the free stream velocity was uniform in the test section in order to ensure the uniformity of the flow the stilling chamber upstream of the contraction was fitted with perforated steel plates and honeycomb screen at the entrance of the water flume the flow velocity was measured by the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the flow velocity was u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s and the max flow turbulence intensity in the free stream was below 2 45 for u 0 0 20 m s the variations of the non dimensional flow velocity u u 0 profiles along the water depth at three different incoming flow velocities u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s for the test location are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the distribution of the flow velocity along the water depth is relatively uniform in the present study which is in good agreement with the results of keulegan 1938 kumbhakar and ghoshal 2016 kumbhakar et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 the static test of the mooring line without the surge and heave motions were performed at flow velocity u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s the dynamic tests of the imposed surge and heave motions of the mooring lines were performed with different amplitudes and periods at u 0 0 20 m s as shown in table 1 the surge motions are tested with two movement amplitudes a s 0 0375 m and 0 05 m corresponding to 2 625 m and 3 5 m with a 1 70 scale factor the surge movement period t s is varied from 1 77 s to 3 59 s a heave motion amplitude of a h 0 0225 m is imposed on the fairlead position with different movement periods t h varying from 1 19 s to 2 87 s a number of 84 dynamic tests were conducted for the surge and heave movements each case was performed for 300 s and repeated three times to ensure the accuracy the imposed top end surge and heave motions are sinusoidal motions as shown in fig 3 the description of motion is given by the following equation 1 xi ai cos 2 π t i t where x i represents the imposed motion a i and t i represent the imposed amplitude and period respectively the tension load of the mooring line was measured using a load cell klter 95736c which was installed at the fairlead position at the top end of the mooring line the measured range of the load cell was 0 500 n and the accuracy of the load cell was 0 20 the sampling rate of the load cell was 2000 hz as used in hennessey et al 2005 the time duration of the force measurement for each case was about 300 s in order to trace the motion trajectory of the mooring line black mark points were distributed with equal intervals along the mooring line the distance between two adjacent markers along the chain is approximately 0 09 m and the exact position of these markers is provided in table 2 a video camera canon eos7200 with a sampling rate of 50 frames per second was placed on the sidewall of the water flume to capture the dynamic motion of the mooring line 3 results and discussion 3 1 static tension at the fairlead in the static tests the pretension versus the offset distance from the origin point is shown in fig 4 the offset distance refers to the horizontal distance between the fairlead position and the anchor position which represents the different pretensions of the mooring line as the configuration changes from the catenary shape to fully taut shape the offset distance is gradually increased during the static load process to ensure the accuracy and repeatability of the static test each case is performed for five times under different pretensions the results indicate that the static test is highly repeatable when the offset distance changes from 110 cm to 140 cm the geometry of the mooring line is in the slack configuration a remarkable touchdown segment is observed the axial tension of the mooring line is small and shows a slight increase as the offset distance increases it is evident that when the offset distance increases to 140 cm the mooring line is lifted to the semi taut configuration accompanied with a slight stretching a jump increase of the axial load is observed when the offset distance increases to 143 cm the mooring line becomes fully taut and the results show that the pretension increases even sharply as the offset distance increasing the chain links segments of the mooring line on the bottom are gradually lifted up when the chain is fully lifted up the weight of the mooring line keeps constant the stretching of the mooring line becomes the dominant effect on the restoring behavior of the taut shape mooring line similar phenomenon is also observed in hsu et al 2018 the static test results are found to be remarkably repeatable in the present study 3 2 flow velocity effect the dynamic tests have been performed to investigate the effect of flow velocity on the tension force of the mooring line three different flow velocities u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s are chosen for the cases of the surge imposed movement with offset s3 a s 0 05 m t s 1 77s and heave imposed movement with offset case h2 a h 0 025 m t h 1 19s fig 5 shows the time histories of the tension forces and corresponding power spectra for the mooring line at different flow velocities it can be seen that the temporal variations of the tension forces appear to be similar for both the surge and heave imposed movement cases at three different velocities as well as the spectrum plots of the tension forces the dynamic tension at the fairlead consists of multiple harmonic components such as f 2f and 4f in the power spectra plots for the surge imposed movement cases and the power amplitudes of the three dominant harmonic components appear to be almost the same for the heave imposed movement cases a predominant peak at is observed in the power spectra plot at each flow velocity the variations of the maximum tension force mean tension force and minimum tension force with the flow velocity are presented in fig 6 and table 3 the tension force of the mooring line increases with increasing of the flow velocity the maximum discrepancies in the values of f max and f mean among different flow velocities are 4 76 and 3 45 for the offset s3 case respectively for the offset h2 case the maximum discrepancies in the values of f max and f mean among different flow velocities are 2 82 and 3 52 respectively the results indicate that the flow velocity has a slight effect on the tension force of the mooring line in the present experimental study therefore the flow velocity u 0 0 20 m s is chosen to investigate the dynamic responses of the mooring line in the following sections 3 3 dynamic tension at the fairlead 3 3 1 surge imposed motion figs 7 and 8 present the time histories of the tension forces and corresponding power spectra for the mooring line under the surge imposed motions the power spectra is obtained from the fast fourier transform fft analysis of the tension at the fairlead following guo et al 2016 the spectrum plot of the tension shows that the tension at 0 hz frequency is corresponding to the quasi static case for the small offset cases s1and s2 with the surge amplitude of a s 0 035 m the mooring line exhibits quasi static response due to the restoring effect the quasi static tension is larger compared with the dynamic value at the excitation frequency and it approaches to about 50 larger than the dynamic tension for the low frequency case t s 3 59s similar phenomenon is also observed in the surge amplitude of a s 0 05 m the effect caused by the dynamic behavior of the inertial and damping loads is about 50 of the total static value when the mooring line changes from the slack to taut configuration the dynamic behavior of the mooring line becomes predominant take the offset s4 and s5 cases for examples the dynamic tension is about 3 5 times the quasi static value as the pretension increases the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the mooring line is enhanced compared with the quasi static case the gravity force of the catenary mooring line could not provide the restoring tension due to the additional initial and damping effects the temporal variations of the tensions appear to be unstable due to the multiple excitation frequencies where the excitation frequencies represent different harmonic frequency components in the power spectrum obtained from the fast fourier transform fft analysis of the tension at the fairlead take the offset s1 and s2 cases with large imposed motion period t s 3 59 s for example it is interesting to note that multiple peak frequencies such as f 2f and 4f are observed in the power spectra plots indicating that the dynamic tension at the fairlead consists of multiple harmonic contents and the power amplitudes of the three dominant harmonic components appear to be almost the same the irregularity of the dynamic tension may be contributed to the superimposition of the three harmonic components under the combined effects of the excitation frequency and dynamic effect similar phenomenon is also observed in qiao et al 2020 as the pretension f increases to 0 85 n in the offset s3 case the dynamic tension is mostly dominated by the first and second harmonic components of the tension in the range of periods 2 39 s t s 3 59 s the tension spikes are observed near the valleys of the tension temporal process which may be caused by the elastic wave during the loading process similar to the case of offset s1 and s2 the dynamic tension is dominated by the second harmonic component at t s 1 77 s with increasing of f to 0 97 n in the offset s4 case it is interesting to note that the dynamic tension is generally dominated by the first harmonic component at all the examined five surge motion periods the spike tension observed may be dominated by the second harmonic component tension similar phenomenon is also observed in the offset s5 case as f increases to 3 52 n in the offset s6 case it is worth noting that the dynamic tension consists of multiple harmonic components such as f 2f 3f 4f 5f 6f 7f components observed at large surge motion period t s 3 59 s different from the small pretension cases the temporal variation of the tension shows that the crest appears to be flattened and the troughs become sharp at excitation periods 1 77 s t s 3 59 s in the offset s6 case with decreasing of the surge motion period the first second and third harmonic components become the dominant components of the dynamic tension when the surge motion amplitude a s increases to 0 05 m the temporal variations of the tension become more stable compared to those at a s 0 0375 m the dynamic tension is generally dominated by the first harmonic component at all the five surge motion periods at the pretension f 0 97 n in the offset s4 case similar to the cases at a s 0 0375 m in the offset s6 case the harmonic components of the dynamic tension change from seven predominant frequencies to three frequencies with decreasing of the motion period as the increasing of surge amplitude and decreasing of period the imposed motion at fairlead becomes violent the response becomes more complex due to the increased dynamic effect for t s 1 77 s in the offset s6 case the tension time series are not so smooth compared with large period case it may be owing to the complex dynamic effect under small period in the power spectrum plots the result changes from comprising all harmonic orders to lack of high order frequency components when the offset distance is small the mooring line is in a catenary configuration the restoring tension of the mooring line is dominated by the weight of the chain links the variation of the tension with the offset distance can be accurately described by the catenary equation for the small offset cases s1 and s2 the mooring line behaves quasi static response due to the restoring effect the quasi static tension value is larger compared with the dynamic value at the excitation frequency and it approaches to about 50 larger than the dynamic tension for the low frequency case t s 3 59 s the effect caused by the dynamic behavior of the inertial and damping loads is about 50 of the total static value as the offset distance increases the chain link segments of the mooring line on the bottom are gradually lifted up the configuration of the mooring line changes to the semi taut or fully taut shape the stretching of the mooring line will dominate the restoring effect with increase in the stretch of mooring line the tension is increased the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the mooring line is enhanced compared with the quasi static case the gravity force of the catenary mooring line could not provide the restoring tension due to the additional inertia added mass and hydrodynamic drag effects 3 3 2 heave imposed motion when the heave motion is imposed on the fairlead position the time histories of the tension at different motion periods and pretensions are presented in fig 9 as well as the corresponding power spectrum plots different from the cases for imposed surge motions the mooring line is occasionally lying down to form a slack configuration in the vertical direction and the lifting weight of the chain changes during the slack and taut circles at small pretension f 0 43 n in the offset h1 case the dynamic tension of the mooring line is almost dominated by its first and second harmonic components at different heave motion periods at t h 2 87 s the predominant peaks are observed at f 2f 3f and 4f the contributions of the third and forth harmonic components are small but could be detectable with increasing of the pretension to 0 85 n in the offset h3 cases the second harmonic component of the tension becomes to be dominated at small heave motion period t h 1 19 s with small contributions from the first third and fourth harmonic components in the offset h4 case at t h 2 87 s and 2 00 s a broadband of peak frequencies are observed from the first harmonic frequency f to the seventh harmonic frequency 7f the contribution of the first harmonic tension component is the largest little contributions to the dynamic tension are also performed by the other excitation frequencies the spike tension may be dominated by the second harmonic component force at t h 1 19 s the temporal variation of the tension becomes sinusoidal only a single predominant peak is observed from the power spectrum plot where the dynamic tension is dominated by the first harmonic component 3 3 3 extreme tension comparisons of the maximum and minimum tensions with variations of the surge and heave motion periods at the fairlead position are presented in fig 10 the extreme tension is obtained by averaging the maximum tension value in each forced oscillation cycle it can be seen that both the maximum and minimum tensions decrease slightly as the surge motion period increases and almost maintain at constant value for each pretension case both the maximum and minimum tensions decrease with increasing of the heave motion period the maximum dynamic tension for the offset s1 case with 1 77 s and 2 00 s of small surge excitation periods are 2 4 and 1 8 times of the values of the pretensions respectively moreover it is interesting to note that the minimum tensions are larger than the pretension at small excitation periods t s 1 77 s and 2 00 s at two highest excitation periods 2 99 s and 3 59 s the measured tension at the fairlead is close to sinusoidal in the time domain the maximum tension is about 1 4 times of the pretension the minimum tension is smaller than the pretension it is interesting to note that a sharp increase of the tension is observed in the offset s6 case with large pretension f 3 52 n where the maximum tension increases to 10 86 n about 7 8 times of the maximum values at small pretension for the offset s5 case and almost 18 times of those for the offset s1 case similar phenomenon is also observed in the cases of heave imposed motions the maximum tension for the offset h4 case is about 3 times of that for the offset h3 case for the large pretension cases the mooring line will be fully lifted to taut configuration the dynamic tension increases sharply which indicates that under the environmental load combinations the mooring dynamics may have a significant impact on the fatigue and extreme loads in order to explain the jump phenomenon of the extreme tension force the relationship between the extreme tension force and the non dimensional line length is investigated similar to the study of johanning and smith 2008 the non dimensional line length λ is defined as λ x 2 z 2 l where l represents the total unstretched mooring line length x and z indicates the horizontal distance and vertical distance from the fairlead position to the anchor position respectively the variations of the maximum and minimum tension forces with the non dimensional line length for t s 1 77 s are shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the non dimensional line lengths λ for all the examined cases are almost smaller than 1 due to the effects of the large stiffness and external tensile strength provided by the top end machine following johanning and smith 2008 the stretching ability value of the mooring line is calculated from the difference in tension and its related difference in vector length which is expressed as follows 2 k δ t a δ l where δ t a is defined as the average of the maximum and minimum tension of the mooring line for each oscillatory cycle δ l is the value corresponding to the maximum and minimum tension at λ 1 the geometry of the mooring line is in the slack configuration the restoring force of the mooring line is dominated by the weight of the lifted portion of the mooring line depending on the stretched length the stretching ability value of the mooring line is varied resulting into different dynamic tensions both the maximum and minimum tension forces increase slightly with the non dimensional line length for small pretensions it is assumed that there may exist a critical pretension for the occurrence of the sharp increase of the tension force when λ λ crit the linear relationship is observed between both the maximum and minimum tension with the non dimensional line length the variation of the restoring force is stable it is interesting to note that the jump phenomena of the maximum tension forces are observed at approximately λ 1 for the offset s6 case λ λ crit where the mooring chain is fully stretched another interesting phenomenon is observed that the increment of λ between the offset s5 and offset s6 cases is only 0 013 the additional submerged weights to the mooring chain change unremarkably however the tension force increases dramatically where the maximum and minimum tension forces for the offset s6 case are almost six times of those for the offset s5 case the jump phenomenon of the tension force may be contributed to the additional inertia added mass and hydrodynamic drag effects which have significant effects on the fatigue and extreme load of the mooring line it indicates that when the mooring line is in the taut configuration the variation of the tension force is mainly depended on the external load the increment of the tension forces for the mooring chain under the heave imposed motion is smaller than those under the surge motions 3 4 motion trajectory 3 4 1 surge imposed motion trajectory to further elucidate the dynamic behavior of the mooring line the motion trajectory of the mooring line is captured with a high speed camera reflecting marks m1 to m8 are distributed along the mooring line with an increment of 9 cm it should be mentioned that the position of mark m1 is located closest to the fairlead position in the view field of the camera to ensure the accuracy and repeatability of the experiment the motion trajectories of the mooring line are calculated based on several tens of imposed surge and heave motion periods the numbers of the markers are varied with the offset distances due to the different configuration shapes of the catenary mooring line to give a better understanding of the dynamic tension of the mooring line the snapshot views of the mooring line configuration under the imposed surge motion at different offset cases are presented in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 in the offset s1 case the horizontal distance between the fairlead position and the anchor point is short the mooring line is in the state of slack configuration with a remarkable touchdown segment in this configuration the dynamic tension appears to be small at all the examined motion periods in the offset s3 s4 s6 cases the mooring line is gradually lifted as the pretension increases the dynamic tension increases there is a significant transition process of the mooring line where the configuration changes from the slack configuration to the catenary configuration the elastic wave is observed especially for the offset s4 and s6 cases figs 13 16 show the motion trajectories of all the marks in the x z plane for the typical surge imposed motion test cases where the x and z coordinates represent the horizontal and vertical positions of the markers respectively it is worth noting that the origin of the coordinate system is the initial position of each marker when the mooring line is in the equilibrium position for each surge movement amplitude test the motion trajectories with four different offset distances and five motion periods are presented when a surge motion is imposed on the fairlead the motion trajectories of the markers near the fairlead are predominantly horizontal and as the offset distance between the fairlead and anchor position increases the motion trajectories of the markers in the lower side become almost vertical when the offset distance is small take the offset s1 case for instance the motion trajectories of the upper side markers behave as horizontal elliptical shapes and change to vertical in a close contour for the lower side markers finally change to almost a line for the markers close to the touchdown zone similar behavior is also found in the surge motion test cases with large movement amplitude the reason for the transformation of the surge motion trajectories may be contributed to that the tension of the mooring line decreases as the distance between the marker and fairlead position increases with increasing of the pretension such as in the offset s4 and s6 cases the motion trajectory of the marker near the fairlead position behaves as a curved loop with increasing of the distance between the markers and fairlead position the motion trajectory of the marker located in the lower side of the mooring line becomes smaller with significant reduced length in the z direction similar phenomenon is also observed by azcona et al 2017 to give a better understanding of the dynamic performance of the mooring line the variation of the dynamic tension with x position of the marker m1 the closest measured marker from the fairlead position at different imposed surge motion periods are further investigated fig 17 shows the tension and displacement curves for the offset s1 s6 cases with surge motion amplitude of 0 0375 m at small offset cases s1 s3 the mooring line behaves close to the quasi static the tension and displacement curves resemble horizontal elliptical loops except for the low excitation period t s 1 77 s similar phenomenon is also observed in azcona et al 2017 it is interesting to note that the tension and displacement curve exhibits a figure 8 shape at t s 1 77 s which may be contributed to the lag phenomenon between the tension and displacement for the large offset case s6 due to the dynamic effects the exhibition of the tension and displacement curve changes from the elliptical loop to raindrop shape and the maximum tension for each excitation period increases significantly compared with those small offset cases the dynamic behavior is found to have more significant effects on the fatigue and extreme load of the mooring line 3 4 2 heave imposed motion trajectory figs 18 19 show the motion trajectories of the markers undergoing the heave imposed motions it can be seen that when the heave motion is imposed on the fairlead position different motion trajectories are observed in the small offset cases similar to the surge motion the trajectories of the upper side markers are inclined elliptical shapes where an angle is existed between the x axis and trajectory centerline however due to the small tension transformed from the fairlead position the motion trajectories change from an elliptical shape to vertical lines for the lower side markers moreover the heave motion period has a limited effect on the motion trajectories with increasing of the heave motion period the angle between the x axis and trajectory centerline increases indicates that the trajectory tends to be more vertical with large motion period the trajectories of the markers appear to be rotated around the center of the trajectory path under the heave imposed motions however in the cases of surge imposed motions the motion trajectories tend to be rotated at the location near the bottom of the trajectory path similar phenomenon is also observed by barrera et al 2019 the results indicate that the motion trajectory is associated with the amount of energy absorbed by the mooring line during the repetition of each test depending on the motion amplitude and period in general the mooring line will absorb more energy with large amplitude and short period in the lower side of the mooring line at small period more energy is absorbed by the mooring line 4 conclusions a series of experiments were performed to investigate the dynamic response of a mooring line with different surge and heave imposed motions the effects of pretension and movement period on the dynamic tensions and motion trajectories were analysed the reason for the sharp increase of the dynamic tension was illustrated the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the dynamic tension of the mooring line appears to be strongly depended on the pretension and motion period for most of the surge and heave motion tests the dynamic tension at the fairlead consists of multiple harmonic contents the predominant harmonic tension will change with variations of the pretension and motion period 2 a jump phenomenon of the maximum tension force is observed at large pretensions for the mooring line under the surge and heave imposed motions the maximum tension of the mooring line with surge imposed motion at large pretension could approach to 18 times of those at small pretensions much larger than those observed for the cases with heave imposed motion 3 when the surge and heave motions are imposed on the fairlead the motion trajectories of the markers are predominantly horizontal near the fairlead change to almost vertical at the lower side of the mooring line with increasing of the pretension the motion trajectories of the markers change from the inclined elliptical shape to the

20816,a series of experiments were performed to investigate the dynamic response of a mooring line based on the catenary configuration with imposed surge and heave motions in a water flume with a considered model scale factor of 1 70 the surge and heave motions with different amplitudes and periods were driven by a programmable electrical motor at the fairlead position respectively the dynamic tensions and motion trajectories of the mooring line were measured to illustrate the effects of pretension and motion period on the predominant harmonic components in the dynamic response the results show that the pretension and motion period have significant effects on the dynamic tensions and nonlinear motion trajectories of the mooring line multiple harmonic components of the dynamic tension are observed at the fairlead and the predominant harmonic tensions are found to be changed with variations of the pretension and motion period a sharp increase of the maximum tension force is observed at large pretension for the mooring line with the surge and heave imposed motions such sharp tension increase may result in floating platform and mooring system breakage the results of this paper revel the foundation of the further studies on the transforming mechanism of the slack and taut state of the mooring line as well as for optimism of the engineering designs in floating offshore devices mooring installations keywords mooring line surge motion heave motion dynamic tension motion trajectory 1 introduction investigations on the mooring system have been performed extensively due to its wide application in the offshore and ocean engineering such as floating production storage and offloading systems fpso lyu et al 2019 tension leg platforms tlp chandrasekaran et al 2006 offshore floating wind turbines jeon et al 2013 etc the top end of the mooring system is attached to the floating structure by fairleads and the bottom end is anchored to the seabed to provide a restoring moment under the combined environment loads during the service period the mooring system will suffer cyclic loads zarandi and skallerud 2020 such as storm surges and huge waves for a long time which could easily cause the cumulative fatigue damage of mooring systems xu et al 2014 over the past few decades numerous accidents of the offshore floating structures have been reported caused by the fatigue failures of the mooring systems ma et al 2013 kvitrud 2014 especially for those occurred near the touch down zone most of the previous experimental and numerical studies have been focused on the motion patterns and load transfer mechanisms of the mooring lines using the static and dynamic analysis methods walton and polachek 1960 webster 1975 kim et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 the rapid or periodic motion of the mooring line will cause the additional dynamic load increase the dynamic tension and may exceed its breaking strength liu et al 2013 the imposed motion and force loads at the fairlead and touchdown point are found to be critical for the dynamic responses of the mooring line johanning et al 2007 azcona et al 2017 hsu et al 2018 the initial horizontal force at the top of the mooring line is found to have significant effects on the surge and heave motion responses agarwal and jain 2003 azcona et al 2017 investigated different dynamic conditions such as the harmonic response loss tension of the mooring lines especially the shape of the line and tension at the fairlead to predict the shape of the mooring line and tension force at the considered diverse positions gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 investigated the dynamics of catenary mooring lines surrounding the touch down point zone the results indicate that the snap load and slack tension are observed during the upward and downward motions of the mooring line respectively the extreme mooring tension is found to cause a shock on the mooring line material and increase the fatigue damage of the mooring system when the floating system exhibits large motions hsu et al 2017 2018 thies et al 2014 hann et al 2015 palm et al 2017 most of the existing studies of the extreme tension have been focused on the snap load where a spike in tension occurs over a very short duration hsu et al 2017 based on the experimental investigation on the tension of a taut slack case zhang et al 2012 found that the snap tension is 5 times of the static one due to slack due to the effect of snap loads the maximum tension values are reported to be 37 68 higher than the corresponding cyclic non snap tension maxima in the study of hsu et al 2017 the structural parameters and wave parameters are reported to have important effects on the predictions of the slack and snap phenomena cross 1992 guo et al 2016 however a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism for the extreme tension of the mooring line is urgently needed the relationships between the dynamic tension and the excitation frequency have not been revealed therefore the purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of the imposed surge and heave motion amplitudes and periods on the dynamic tensions and motion trajectories of the mooring line the tension and motion trajectories are measured to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the mooring line with different pretensions imposed motion amplitudes and periods by analyzing the experimental data a complete understanding of the fundamental features of the dynamic tension load for the mooring line with different geometry configurations is illustrated the paper is organized as follows the experimental set up is described in section 2 in section 3 the results obtained from the tension force motion trajectories are presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experimental set up the experiments for flow past a mooring line undergoing surge and heave periodic motions were performed in the open recirculation water flume at coastal laboratory in ocean college zhejiang university china the test section of the water flume is 25 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 5 m high the water depth is kept at 0 4 m both the sidewalls and the bottom of the water flume are made of transparent plexiglas to facilitate optical access fig 1 shows a schematic sketch of the experimental set up considering the typical mooring line in offshore floating wind turbine foundation and the water flume scales the model is scaled following froude s law with a scale factor of 1 70 to satisfy the relationship of the inertial and gravitational forces between the prototype and model scale mooring line modelling requires to scale the dominant hydrodynamic loads apart from the weight of the mooring line which provides the restoring force and the inertia loads as suggested in barrera et al 2019 the mooring chain used for the dynamic load test is made of stainless steel the diameter of the chain is d 2 mm and the length is l 1500 mm the length of the link t is 17 mm and the diameter of the chain link b is 8 mm the weight per unit length of the mooring line is 0 082 kg m a pendulum rig was used as a transmission device and an aluminum structure was designed to allow the surge and heave movements in the water flume the top end of the mooring line was connected to the aluminum structure and the lower end of the mooring line was anchored on a heavy steel plate placed at the bottom of the water flume where the rigid bottom was considered in the experiment the surge and heave motions of the mooring line could be driven by an electrical motor fixed in a frame placed on the upside of the water flume the range of the movement speed was from 10 mm s to 200 mm s the free stream velocity was uniform in the test section in order to ensure the uniformity of the flow the stilling chamber upstream of the contraction was fitted with perforated steel plates and honeycomb screen at the entrance of the water flume the flow velocity was measured by the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the flow velocity was u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s and the max flow turbulence intensity in the free stream was below 2 45 for u 0 0 20 m s the variations of the non dimensional flow velocity u u 0 profiles along the water depth at three different incoming flow velocities u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s for the test location are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the distribution of the flow velocity along the water depth is relatively uniform in the present study which is in good agreement with the results of keulegan 1938 kumbhakar and ghoshal 2016 kumbhakar et al 2020 and yang et al 2020 the static test of the mooring line without the surge and heave motions were performed at flow velocity u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s the dynamic tests of the imposed surge and heave motions of the mooring lines were performed with different amplitudes and periods at u 0 0 20 m s as shown in table 1 the surge motions are tested with two movement amplitudes a s 0 0375 m and 0 05 m corresponding to 2 625 m and 3 5 m with a 1 70 scale factor the surge movement period t s is varied from 1 77 s to 3 59 s a heave motion amplitude of a h 0 0225 m is imposed on the fairlead position with different movement periods t h varying from 1 19 s to 2 87 s a number of 84 dynamic tests were conducted for the surge and heave movements each case was performed for 300 s and repeated three times to ensure the accuracy the imposed top end surge and heave motions are sinusoidal motions as shown in fig 3 the description of motion is given by the following equation 1 xi ai cos 2 π t i t where x i represents the imposed motion a i and t i represent the imposed amplitude and period respectively the tension load of the mooring line was measured using a load cell klter 95736c which was installed at the fairlead position at the top end of the mooring line the measured range of the load cell was 0 500 n and the accuracy of the load cell was 0 20 the sampling rate of the load cell was 2000 hz as used in hennessey et al 2005 the time duration of the force measurement for each case was about 300 s in order to trace the motion trajectory of the mooring line black mark points were distributed with equal intervals along the mooring line the distance between two adjacent markers along the chain is approximately 0 09 m and the exact position of these markers is provided in table 2 a video camera canon eos7200 with a sampling rate of 50 frames per second was placed on the sidewall of the water flume to capture the dynamic motion of the mooring line 3 results and discussion 3 1 static tension at the fairlead in the static tests the pretension versus the offset distance from the origin point is shown in fig 4 the offset distance refers to the horizontal distance between the fairlead position and the anchor position which represents the different pretensions of the mooring line as the configuration changes from the catenary shape to fully taut shape the offset distance is gradually increased during the static load process to ensure the accuracy and repeatability of the static test each case is performed for five times under different pretensions the results indicate that the static test is highly repeatable when the offset distance changes from 110 cm to 140 cm the geometry of the mooring line is in the slack configuration a remarkable touchdown segment is observed the axial tension of the mooring line is small and shows a slight increase as the offset distance increases it is evident that when the offset distance increases to 140 cm the mooring line is lifted to the semi taut configuration accompanied with a slight stretching a jump increase of the axial load is observed when the offset distance increases to 143 cm the mooring line becomes fully taut and the results show that the pretension increases even sharply as the offset distance increasing the chain links segments of the mooring line on the bottom are gradually lifted up when the chain is fully lifted up the weight of the mooring line keeps constant the stretching of the mooring line becomes the dominant effect on the restoring behavior of the taut shape mooring line similar phenomenon is also observed in hsu et al 2018 the static test results are found to be remarkably repeatable in the present study 3 2 flow velocity effect the dynamic tests have been performed to investigate the effect of flow velocity on the tension force of the mooring line three different flow velocities u 0 0 10 m s 0 15 m s and 0 20 m s are chosen for the cases of the surge imposed movement with offset s3 a s 0 05 m t s 1 77s and heave imposed movement with offset case h2 a h 0 025 m t h 1 19s fig 5 shows the time histories of the tension forces and corresponding power spectra for the mooring line at different flow velocities it can be seen that the temporal variations of the tension forces appear to be similar for both the surge and heave imposed movement cases at three different velocities as well as the spectrum plots of the tension forces the dynamic tension at the fairlead consists of multiple harmonic components such as f 2f and 4f in the power spectra plots for the surge imposed movement cases and the power amplitudes of the three dominant harmonic components appear to be almost the same for the heave imposed movement cases a predominant peak at is observed in the power spectra plot at each flow velocity the variations of the maximum tension force mean tension force and minimum tension force with the flow velocity are presented in fig 6 and table 3 the tension force of the mooring line increases with increasing of the flow velocity the maximum discrepancies in the values of f max and f mean among different flow velocities are 4 76 and 3 45 for the offset s3 case respectively for the offset h2 case the maximum discrepancies in the values of f max and f mean among different flow velocities are 2 82 and 3 52 respectively the results indicate that the flow velocity has a slight effect on the tension force of the mooring line in the present experimental study therefore the flow velocity u 0 0 20 m s is chosen to investigate the dynamic responses of the mooring line in the following sections 3 3 dynamic tension at the fairlead 3 3 1 surge imposed motion figs 7 and 8 present the time histories of the tension forces and corresponding power spectra for the mooring line under the surge imposed motions the power spectra is obtained from the fast fourier transform fft analysis of the tension at the fairlead following guo et al 2016 the spectrum plot of the tension shows that the tension at 0 hz frequency is corresponding to the quasi static case for the small offset cases s1and s2 with the surge amplitude of a s 0 035 m the mooring line exhibits quasi static response due to the restoring effect the quasi static tension is larger compared with the dynamic value at the excitation frequency and it approaches to about 50 larger than the dynamic tension for the low frequency case t s 3 59s similar phenomenon is also observed in the surge amplitude of a s 0 05 m the effect caused by the dynamic behavior of the inertial and damping loads is about 50 of the total static value when the mooring line changes from the slack to taut configuration the dynamic behavior of the mooring line becomes predominant take the offset s4 and s5 cases for examples the dynamic tension is about 3 5 times the quasi static value as the pretension increases the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the mooring line is enhanced compared with the quasi static case the gravity force of the catenary mooring line could not provide the restoring tension due to the additional initial and damping effects the temporal variations of the tensions appear to be unstable due to the multiple excitation frequencies where the excitation frequencies represent different harmonic frequency components in the power spectrum obtained from the fast fourier transform fft analysis of the tension at the fairlead take the offset s1 and s2 cases with large imposed motion period t s 3 59 s for example it is interesting to note that multiple peak frequencies such as f 2f and 4f are observed in the power spectra plots indicating that the dynamic tension at the fairlead consists of multiple harmonic contents and the power amplitudes of the three dominant harmonic components appear to be almost the same the irregularity of the dynamic tension may be contributed to the superimposition of the three harmonic components under the combined effects of the excitation frequency and dynamic effect similar phenomenon is also observed in qiao et al 2020 as the pretension f increases to 0 85 n in the offset s3 case the dynamic tension is mostly dominated by the first and second harmonic components of the tension in the range of periods 2 39 s t s 3 59 s the tension spikes are observed near the valleys of the tension temporal process which may be caused by the elastic wave during the loading process similar to the case of offset s1 and s2 the dynamic tension is dominated by the second harmonic component at t s 1 77 s with increasing of f to 0 97 n in the offset s4 case it is interesting to note that the dynamic tension is generally dominated by the first harmonic component at all the examined five surge motion periods the spike tension observed may be dominated by the second harmonic component tension similar phenomenon is also observed in the offset s5 case as f increases to 3 52 n in the offset s6 case it is worth noting that the dynamic tension consists of multiple harmonic components such as f 2f 3f 4f 5f 6f 7f components observed at large surge motion period t s 3 59 s different from the small pretension cases the temporal variation of the tension shows that the crest appears to be flattened and the troughs become sharp at excitation periods 1 77 s t s 3 59 s in the offset s6 case with decreasing of the surge motion period the first second and third harmonic components become the dominant components of the dynamic tension when the surge motion amplitude a s increases to 0 05 m the temporal variations of the tension become more stable compared to those at a s 0 0375 m the dynamic tension is generally dominated by the first harmonic component at all the five surge motion periods at the pretension f 0 97 n in the offset s4 case similar to the cases at a s 0 0375 m in the offset s6 case the harmonic components of the dynamic tension change from seven predominant frequencies to three frequencies with decreasing of the motion period as the increasing of surge amplitude and decreasing of period the imposed motion at fairlead becomes violent the response becomes more complex due to the increased dynamic effect for t s 1 77 s in the offset s6 case the tension time series are not so smooth compared with large period case it may be owing to the complex dynamic effect under small period in the power spectrum plots the result changes from comprising all harmonic orders to lack of high order frequency components when the offset distance is small the mooring line is in a catenary configuration the restoring tension of the mooring line is dominated by the weight of the chain links the variation of the tension with the offset distance can be accurately described by the catenary equation for the small offset cases s1 and s2 the mooring line behaves quasi static response due to the restoring effect the quasi static tension value is larger compared with the dynamic value at the excitation frequency and it approaches to about 50 larger than the dynamic tension for the low frequency case t s 3 59 s the effect caused by the dynamic behavior of the inertial and damping loads is about 50 of the total static value as the offset distance increases the chain link segments of the mooring line on the bottom are gradually lifted up the configuration of the mooring line changes to the semi taut or fully taut shape the stretching of the mooring line will dominate the restoring effect with increase in the stretch of mooring line the tension is increased the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the mooring line is enhanced compared with the quasi static case the gravity force of the catenary mooring line could not provide the restoring tension due to the additional inertia added mass and hydrodynamic drag effects 3 3 2 heave imposed motion when the heave motion is imposed on the fairlead position the time histories of the tension at different motion periods and pretensions are presented in fig 9 as well as the corresponding power spectrum plots different from the cases for imposed surge motions the mooring line is occasionally lying down to form a slack configuration in the vertical direction and the lifting weight of the chain changes during the slack and taut circles at small pretension f 0 43 n in the offset h1 case the dynamic tension of the mooring line is almost dominated by its first and second harmonic components at different heave motion periods at t h 2 87 s the predominant peaks are observed at f 2f 3f and 4f the contributions of the third and forth harmonic components are small but could be detectable with increasing of the pretension to 0 85 n in the offset h3 cases the second harmonic component of the tension becomes to be dominated at small heave motion period t h 1 19 s with small contributions from the first third and fourth harmonic components in the offset h4 case at t h 2 87 s and 2 00 s a broadband of peak frequencies are observed from the first harmonic frequency f to the seventh harmonic frequency 7f the contribution of the first harmonic tension component is the largest little contributions to the dynamic tension are also performed by the other excitation frequencies the spike tension may be dominated by the second harmonic component force at t h 1 19 s the temporal variation of the tension becomes sinusoidal only a single predominant peak is observed from the power spectrum plot where the dynamic tension is dominated by the first harmonic component 3 3 3 extreme tension comparisons of the maximum and minimum tensions with variations of the surge and heave motion periods at the fairlead position are presented in fig 10 the extreme tension is obtained by averaging the maximum tension value in each forced oscillation cycle it can be seen that both the maximum and minimum tensions decrease slightly as the surge motion period increases and almost maintain at constant value for each pretension case both the maximum and minimum tensions decrease with increasing of the heave motion period the maximum dynamic tension for the offset s1 case with 1 77 s and 2 00 s of small surge excitation periods are 2 4 and 1 8 times of the values of the pretensions respectively moreover it is interesting to note that the minimum tensions are larger than the pretension at small excitation periods t s 1 77 s and 2 00 s at two highest excitation periods 2 99 s and 3 59 s the measured tension at the fairlead is close to sinusoidal in the time domain the maximum tension is about 1 4 times of the pretension the minimum tension is smaller than the pretension it is interesting to note that a sharp increase of the tension is observed in the offset s6 case with large pretension f 3 52 n where the maximum tension increases to 10 86 n about 7 8 times of the maximum values at small pretension for the offset s5 case and almost 18 times of those for the offset s1 case similar phenomenon is also observed in the cases of heave imposed motions the maximum tension for the offset h4 case is about 3 times of that for the offset h3 case for the large pretension cases the mooring line will be fully lifted to taut configuration the dynamic tension increases sharply which indicates that under the environmental load combinations the mooring dynamics may have a significant impact on the fatigue and extreme loads in order to explain the jump phenomenon of the extreme tension force the relationship between the extreme tension force and the non dimensional line length is investigated similar to the study of johanning and smith 2008 the non dimensional line length λ is defined as λ x 2 z 2 l where l represents the total unstretched mooring line length x and z indicates the horizontal distance and vertical distance from the fairlead position to the anchor position respectively the variations of the maximum and minimum tension forces with the non dimensional line length for t s 1 77 s are shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the non dimensional line lengths λ for all the examined cases are almost smaller than 1 due to the effects of the large stiffness and external tensile strength provided by the top end machine following johanning and smith 2008 the stretching ability value of the mooring line is calculated from the difference in tension and its related difference in vector length which is expressed as follows 2 k δ t a δ l where δ t a is defined as the average of the maximum and minimum tension of the mooring line for each oscillatory cycle δ l is the value corresponding to the maximum and minimum tension at λ 1 the geometry of the mooring line is in the slack configuration the restoring force of the mooring line is dominated by the weight of the lifted portion of the mooring line depending on the stretched length the stretching ability value of the mooring line is varied resulting into different dynamic tensions both the maximum and minimum tension forces increase slightly with the non dimensional line length for small pretensions it is assumed that there may exist a critical pretension for the occurrence of the sharp increase of the tension force when λ λ crit the linear relationship is observed between both the maximum and minimum tension with the non dimensional line length the variation of the restoring force is stable it is interesting to note that the jump phenomena of the maximum tension forces are observed at approximately λ 1 for the offset s6 case λ λ crit where the mooring chain is fully stretched another interesting phenomenon is observed that the increment of λ between the offset s5 and offset s6 cases is only 0 013 the additional submerged weights to the mooring chain change unremarkably however the tension force increases dramatically where the maximum and minimum tension forces for the offset s6 case are almost six times of those for the offset s5 case the jump phenomenon of the tension force may be contributed to the additional inertia added mass and hydrodynamic drag effects which have significant effects on the fatigue and extreme load of the mooring line it indicates that when the mooring line is in the taut configuration the variation of the tension force is mainly depended on the external load the increment of the tension forces for the mooring chain under the heave imposed motion is smaller than those under the surge motions 3 4 motion trajectory 3 4 1 surge imposed motion trajectory to further elucidate the dynamic behavior of the mooring line the motion trajectory of the mooring line is captured with a high speed camera reflecting marks m1 to m8 are distributed along the mooring line with an increment of 9 cm it should be mentioned that the position of mark m1 is located closest to the fairlead position in the view field of the camera to ensure the accuracy and repeatability of the experiment the motion trajectories of the mooring line are calculated based on several tens of imposed surge and heave motion periods the numbers of the markers are varied with the offset distances due to the different configuration shapes of the catenary mooring line to give a better understanding of the dynamic tension of the mooring line the snapshot views of the mooring line configuration under the imposed surge motion at different offset cases are presented in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 in the offset s1 case the horizontal distance between the fairlead position and the anchor point is short the mooring line is in the state of slack configuration with a remarkable touchdown segment in this configuration the dynamic tension appears to be small at all the examined motion periods in the offset s3 s4 s6 cases the mooring line is gradually lifted as the pretension increases the dynamic tension increases there is a significant transition process of the mooring line where the configuration changes from the slack configuration to the catenary configuration the elastic wave is observed especially for the offset s4 and s6 cases figs 13 16 show the motion trajectories of all the marks in the x z plane for the typical surge imposed motion test cases where the x and z coordinates represent the horizontal and vertical positions of the markers respectively it is worth noting that the origin of the coordinate system is the initial position of each marker when the mooring line is in the equilibrium position for each surge movement amplitude test the motion trajectories with four different offset distances and five motion periods are presented when a surge motion is imposed on the fairlead the motion trajectories of the markers near the fairlead are predominantly horizontal and as the offset distance between the fairlead and anchor position increases the motion trajectories of the markers in the lower side become almost vertical when the offset distance is small take the offset s1 case for instance the motion trajectories of the upper side markers behave as horizontal elliptical shapes and change to vertical in a close contour for the lower side markers finally change to almost a line for the markers close to the touchdown zone similar behavior is also found in the surge motion test cases with large movement amplitude the reason for the transformation of the surge motion trajectories may be contributed to that the tension of the mooring line decreases as the distance between the marker and fairlead position increases with increasing of the pretension such as in the offset s4 and s6 cases the motion trajectory of the marker near the fairlead position behaves as a curved loop with increasing of the distance between the markers and fairlead position the motion trajectory of the marker located in the lower side of the mooring line becomes smaller with significant reduced length in the z direction similar phenomenon is also observed by azcona et al 2017 to give a better understanding of the dynamic performance of the mooring line the variation of the dynamic tension with x position of the marker m1 the closest measured marker from the fairlead position at different imposed surge motion periods are further investigated fig 17 shows the tension and displacement curves for the offset s1 s6 cases with surge motion amplitude of 0 0375 m at small offset cases s1 s3 the mooring line behaves close to the quasi static the tension and displacement curves resemble horizontal elliptical loops except for the low excitation period t s 1 77 s similar phenomenon is also observed in azcona et al 2017 it is interesting to note that the tension and displacement curve exhibits a figure 8 shape at t s 1 77 s which may be contributed to the lag phenomenon between the tension and displacement for the large offset case s6 due to the dynamic effects the exhibition of the tension and displacement curve changes from the elliptical loop to raindrop shape and the maximum tension for each excitation period increases significantly compared with those small offset cases the dynamic behavior is found to have more significant effects on the fatigue and extreme load of the mooring line 3 4 2 heave imposed motion trajectory figs 18 19 show the motion trajectories of the markers undergoing the heave imposed motions it can be seen that when the heave motion is imposed on the fairlead position different motion trajectories are observed in the small offset cases similar to the surge motion the trajectories of the upper side markers are inclined elliptical shapes where an angle is existed between the x axis and trajectory centerline however due to the small tension transformed from the fairlead position the motion trajectories change from an elliptical shape to vertical lines for the lower side markers moreover the heave motion period has a limited effect on the motion trajectories with increasing of the heave motion period the angle between the x axis and trajectory centerline increases indicates that the trajectory tends to be more vertical with large motion period the trajectories of the markers appear to be rotated around the center of the trajectory path under the heave imposed motions however in the cases of surge imposed motions the motion trajectories tend to be rotated at the location near the bottom of the trajectory path similar phenomenon is also observed by barrera et al 2019 the results indicate that the motion trajectory is associated with the amount of energy absorbed by the mooring line during the repetition of each test depending on the motion amplitude and period in general the mooring line will absorb more energy with large amplitude and short period in the lower side of the mooring line at small period more energy is absorbed by the mooring line 4 conclusions a series of experiments were performed to investigate the dynamic response of a mooring line with different surge and heave imposed motions the effects of pretension and movement period on the dynamic tensions and motion trajectories were analysed the reason for the sharp increase of the dynamic tension was illustrated the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the dynamic tension of the mooring line appears to be strongly depended on the pretension and motion period for most of the surge and heave motion tests the dynamic tension at the fairlead consists of multiple harmonic contents the predominant harmonic tension will change with variations of the pretension and motion period 2 a jump phenomenon of the maximum tension force is observed at large pretensions for the mooring line under the surge and heave imposed motions the maximum tension of the mooring line with surge imposed motion at large pretension could approach to 18 times of those at small pretensions much larger than those observed for the cases with heave imposed motion 3 when the surge and heave motions are imposed on the fairlead the motion trajectories of the markers are predominantly horizontal near the fairlead change to almost vertical at the lower side of the mooring line with increasing of the pretension the motion trajectories of the markers change from the inclined elliptical shape to the

20817,high fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of ship airwakes are often performed with time accurate turbulence resolving methods such as large eddy simulation or detached eddy simulation in our review of the literature we find that the finite sample error in the results of these simulations is rarely expressed in terms of uncertainty in the statistics this makes it difficult to determine if any disagreement with experiment or other simulations can be attributed to finite sample time grid resolution or modelling approximations in this paper turbulence resolving simulations of the airwake over the sfs1 geometry are used to demonstrate a method for quantifying the uncertainty due to finite sample error with an estimated confidence interval based on this quantification a stopping criterion is then formulated so that the simulation time can be set by a predetermined requirement for the confidence in the statistics graphical abstract keywords simulation

region wod wind over deck 1 introduction velocity gradients and turbulence in the airwakes of ships and oil rigs have long been recognised as critical for the safe operating limits for helicopters and other aircraft at sea woomer and williams 1978 healey 1986 reliable prediction of these operating limits therefore requires accurate simulation or modelling of the airwake the major challenge of these airwake simulations is that of all high reynolds number incompressible external bluff body flows resolving the influence of turbulence navier stokes cfd methods which partially resolve the spectrum of turbulence such as large eddy simulation les and detached eddy simulation des currently represent the best option for high fidelity simulation of ship airwakes as long as direct numerical simulation dns remains out of computational reach however these methods bring with them the problem of finite sample error something not encountered when using steady state methods e g reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations and not as problematic when using methods that do not resolve turbulence e g unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans simulations each turbulence resolving simulation represents a finite sample from a continuous distribution characterised by the mean flow statistics any mean flow statistics computed from this finite sample are necessarily estimates with an associated uncertainty this uncertainty is often not quantified in the published literature on ship airwake simulations and industrial turbulent flows in general if simulation times are short this can lead to difficulty in determining if any disagreement with experiment or other simulations can be attributed to finite sample time grid resolution or modelling approximations quantifying the finite sample error can aid identification of grid dependence and enables a limit to be set on the simulation time based on a desired level of uncertainty in the mean flow statistics this paper is divided into two distinct parts a comprehensive review of the literature on ship airwake simulations section 2 and a study of finite sample error based on des of the sfs1 airwake sections 3 and 4 motivated by the points highlighted in the introduction and the findings of the literature review the finite sample error study leads to the proposal of a new stopping criterion for time accurate ship airwake simulations 2 literature review cfd simulations of ship airwakes have been performed since mahaffey et al 1986 and have proliferated since the late 1990s as computational methods and resources have evolved the following literature review breaks down ship airwake simulations into the elements of governing equations turbulence modelling time resolution and accuracy grid resolution inflow conditions domain size and simulation length grid based methods are the focus of this literature review although there have been several studies performed using grid free methods mckillip et al 2002 keller et al 2007 syms 2008 woodgate et al 2018 2 1 governing equations at least seven different sets of governing equations have been selected for the studies of ship airwakes just summarised here only the equations that would be solved absent any turbulence model and without considering time accuracy are considered the most commonly applied are the compressible euler equations the incompressible euler equations the compressible navier stokes equations and the incompressible navier stokes equations in pressure velocity form a handful of studies have alternatively used the incompressible navier stokes equations in vorticity velocity form the thin layer navier stokes equations or the non linear disturbance equations simulations using the euler equations have been presented in 13 different publications liu and long 1998 long et al 1998 tattersall et al 1998 bogstad et al 1999 guillot and walker 2000 sharma and long 2001 guillot 2002 bogstad et al 2002 sezer uzol et al 2005 alpman et al 2007 bridges et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 oruc et al 2016 2018 and the choice of euler equations in these studies was motivated primarily by computational cost the latest of these studies was published in 2009 with the exception of the work of oruc et al 2016 2018 which targeted real time performance with limited computational resources the euler equations were eventually abandoned in favour of the full navier stokes equations augmented with a turbulence modelling approach as it was recognised that turbulent dissipation must be included to predict both the mean flow structure and the unsteady flow field zhang et al 2009 oruc et al 2016 2018 the upwind biased numerical schemes typically used for these euler simulations produce an artificial viscosity by way of numerical dissipation akin to an implicit les grinstein et al 2007 as a result the distinction between viscous and inviscid formulations is not so clear cut on coarse grids where numerical dissipation dominates turbulent and molecular dissipation it is therefore only relatively recently as computational resources have allowed finer grid resolution and lower numerical dissipation that navier stokes simulations with explicit or implicit turbulence modelling have become ubiquitous for ship airwake simulations of the alternative governing equations the thin layer navier stokes and the non linear disturbance equations both sacrifice important aspects of the physics in exchange for reductions in computational cost consequently they have only been considered in very early work tai and carico 1995 tai 1995 liu and long 1998 long et al 1998 tai 1998 the latest example being in 1998 the vorticity velocity form of the navier stokes is of interest because of the ability to conserve vorticity a property that the pressure velocity form of the navier stokes equations lack in the far wake the vorticity velocity form has the potential to preserve the wake of the ship with lower grid resolution than the pressure velocity form quon et al 2014 simulation of the near body flow field is more challenging as solid surfaces produce singularities in the vorticity velocity formulation preventing the governing equations being solved down to the wall finer grid spacing is required in the near wake to accurately resolve smaller scale turbulence regardless of the form of the governing equations so the pressure velocity form of the navier stokes equations is more suited to the near body and near wake regions of the flow field the final consideration for governing equations is the choice between compressible and incompressible formulations many authors have solved the compressible governing equations often simply due to the availability of compressible codes one motivation for a compressible solver is the potential to include a grid resolved rotor in the simulation and treat both the high mach number regions near the rotor and the ship airwake with a single solver although this has rarely been done the ship airwake itself is at a very low mach number and incompressible governing equations are therefore a more natural choice compressible solvers suffer from two important problems when applied to essentially incompressible flow the time step is constrained by the acoustic wave speed which is far higher than convective wave speeds of interest and numerical dissipation increases as mach number decreases leading to increased grid resolution requirements to maintain accuracy with decreasing mach number volpe 1993 by scaling the freestream velocity to mach 0 3 essentially incompressible flow can be maintained but the convective time scales are moved closer to the acoustic time scales alleviating the time step constraint mach scaling also ensures that low mach dissipation is not excessive for larger scale structures although thornber et al 2010 point out that the instabilities which trigger turbulence will still occur at low mach numbers and be damped by excessive dissipation mach scaling has been used for many ship airwake simulations polsky and bruner 2000 polsky 2002 2003 thornber et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 further increases in the time step in compressible solvers can be achieved with implicit numerics and solution algorithms employing sub iterations pre conditioning zhang et al 2009 polsky et al 2016 and low mach correction schemes thornber et al 2010 are two additional options which have been used to resolve the problem of low mach dissipation with the modifications just described compressible solvers can be applied to ship airwake simulations without sacrificing any of the physics of the problem the compressible and incompressible navier stokes are therefore both suitable choices for the simulation of ship airwakes and this is reflected in their common use in the literature 2 2 turbulence modelling rans urans des and les have all been applied as turbulence modelling methodologies for ship airwakes urans models are predicated on the assumption that all turbulent motions are modelled and the resolved unsteady motions are coherent deterministic features of the flow distinct in scale from the turbulent motions the validity of this assumption is questionable for important aspects of ship airwakes particularly massively separated flows in which there is no distinct separation of scales the ability of urans simulations to predict turbulent spectra is also a cause for concern if more than a time averaged flow field is desired nevertheless a number of urans simulations have been performed toffoletto et al 2002 roper et al 2006 forrest et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 huang et al 2012 lawson et al 2012 crozon et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 forrest et al 2007 compared urans and des directly to experimental data they found that urans was generally able to capture mean velocities as well as des but underpredicted the spectra lawson et al 2012 and crozon et al 2014 also compared urans and des and came to the same conclusion as forrest et al these studies support the theoretical shortcomings of urans models and together are a strong indication that they should not be applied unless only mean quantities are required and even then should be used with caution partially averaged ns pans is a variant of les which has been applied to ship airwake simulations by zhang et al 2018 pans differs from standard les in that the sub filter turbulence model is explicitly a function of the ratio of unresolved to total kinetic energy pans is formulated to consistently transition from urans to dns as this ratio changes from one to zero in the simulations of zhang et al pans exhibited significantly fewer small scale features on the same grid when compared to les there were no significant differences between mean velocity and pressures from the pans simulations and les except on the coarsest grids when the pans model essentially acted as a urans model and failed to accurately predict the mean flow no comparison of spectra were made so it is not apparent whether the pans simulations were able to better resolve the scales of motion in the closed loop pilot response band on a coarser grid than les visualisations indicate that this may not be the case contrary to what may be expected les and iles have been used for ship airwake studies from early on polsky and bruner 2000 ramamurti and sandberg 2002 although given the coarse resolution of these grids it is unlikely that a significant range of velocity fluctuations were resolved in fact it is likely that many if not all subsequent ship airwake les have also not met the 80 resolved kinetic energy heuristic often quoted for a strict les pope 2000 certainly simulations often fail to produce a distinct inertial range in spectra and visualisations often reveal a lack of small scale features these observations are to be expected as the computational cost of a wall resolved les at reynolds numbers of several hundred million would be impractical even a wall modelled les or des would be unwieldy were an attempt made to resolve 80 of the kinetic energy over the entire flight deck of an aircraft carrier and its near wake for these reasons the validity of ship airwake les des has generally been evaluated from an empirical standpoint the critical question being are the spectra across the frequency band of interest generally the closed loop pilot response band resolved this is a question that is best answered by a combination of a grid convergence study and comparison against experimental data both implicit and explicit sgs models have been used successfully for ship airwake les the former is exemplified by the work of polsky et al 2016 and others using the cobalt cfd code at navair and the latter by the work of forrest and owen 2009 and others at the university of liverpool thornber et al 2010 is an example of a higher resolution iles performed with high order accurate numerics which showed good agreement with spectra across a wide frequency band while the recent high resolution simulations of dooley et al 2019 and thedin et al 2019b are examples of standard les with significant resolution of small scale turbulence properly applied there is no reason to believe either method holds any particular advantage over the other except that iles may be faster as no additional equations are solved however it should be noted that although iles may be coupled with a wall function islam and thornber 2018 such an option has not yet been explored 2 3 time resolution and accuracy although the necessity of time accurate simulations for predicting turbulent fluctuations is obvious there is still the question of whether or not steady state simulations are able to capture the mean flow potentially providing an efficient way to compute a lot of information about the airwake van muijden et al 2013 directly compared steady state rans simulations using an algebraic stress model to high fidelity les and found significant differences between the rans results and the time averaged les results zhao et al 2015 and polsky 2002 performed similar comparisons to des and monotone integrated les miles a variant of iles and came to the same conclusion this is not entirely unexpected as there are regions of flow dominated by vortex shedding and bistable modes have been observed herry and van der vorst 2011 both of these flow features violate the assumption of the existence of a steady state perturbed only by turbulent fluctuations on which rans models are based evidence and theory therefore both indicate that time accuracy is critical not only for capturing unsteady flow but also for predicting the mean flow when it comes to time accurate simulations the time resolution chosen must be derived from two considerations stability and accuracy stability requirements vary from code to code and depend on the numerical schemes where stability requirements are present they are usually stricter than the accuracy requirements however implicit numerical schemes and iterative time stepping algorithms can extend the time step to essentially arbitrary lengths the problem then becomes one of choosing a time step for sufficient accuracy simply considering the need to generate information about the entire closed loop pilot control band suggests that the maximum allowable time step frequency is at least double the highest frequency in this band i e 4 hz or 0 25 s in a full scale simulation this would be a large time step for a les and would likely entail a significant loss of information about the smaller scales of motion that determine the dissipation of the larger scales in the closed loop pilot control band such a large time step would also effectively produce an implicit filter with a cutoff frequency very close to the frequencies of interest partially filtering some of the scales in the frequency band of interest as a consequence time accurate ship airwake simulations use smaller time steps a convective time scale t l l u is often defined in terms of ship length and freestream velocity at deck height this is a useful reference for isolated ship studies and has great physical relevance when considering simulation run time and the length of the initialisation period however for the purpose of comparing time steps in terms of accuracy another relevant reference is proposed for dynamic interface studies t r s f m a x where f m a x 2 hz is the highest frequency in the closed loop pilot control band s is a scale factor derived from the assumption of constant strouhal number between model and full scale 1 s l m l f u f u m with l m l f a geometric scale factor from model to full scale and u f u m a velocity scale factor the advantage of t r is that the non dimensional time step δ τ r δ t t r is now referred to a time scale of more significance for the problem of ship helicopter dynamic interface simulation one which is constant for all full scale ships and scales appropriately for model ships the maximum allowable time step which was calculated previously becomes δ τ m a x 0 5 using this non dimensionalisation and retains the same physical relevance across all scales based on the combined experience at navair and a time step sensitivity study polsky et al 2016 recommended a time step of δ τ r 0 02 for accuracy forrest and owen 2009 also arrived at δ τ r 0 02 based on des recommendations from spalart 2001 and showed reasonable agreement with experimental spectra over the frequency band of interest thornber et al 2010 chose the same δ τ r 0 02 as well based purely on stability requirements and again demonstrated agreement with experimental spectra others have opted for smaller time steps van muijden et al 2013 directly considered δ τ m a x when selecting an appropriate time step eventually settling on δ τ r 0 015 as a compromise between an optimal time step for the accuracy of their numerical schemes and run time considerations zhao et al 2015 used an even smaller time step of δ τ r 0 006 given that δ τ r 0 02 has proven to provide sufficient resolution for a wide range of geometries and solution methods it seems reasonable to conclude that there is no advantage to be gained by reducing the time step further except to meet stability criteria 2 4 grid resolution the design and resolution of the grid strongly influences which flow features can be captured and the degree to which they are resolved in different regions of the domain for les and des there are fairly well established guidelines for grid parameters spalart 2001 although a grid convergence study is always the ultimate arbiter the reynolds number of ship airwakes generally precludes wall resolving les adhering to the strictest guidelines for grid resolution this has led to the adoption of wall modelling as well as des and other rans les hybrids which relax grid spacing requirements in the wall region relatively few grid sensitivity studies have been published for ship airwake simulations and convergence studies for les and des are even more rare polsky 2003 compared simulation results from grids with two levels of refinement 4 1 0 6 cells and 6 4 1 0 6 cells seeking better agreement with experimental data but none was found shipman et al 2005 investigated the sensitivity of miles to the presence of a viscous boundary layer resolving grid and found that the influence of a viscous boundary condition was restricted to regions close to deck edges and mast structures however no formal grid convergence study was performed and a maximum of 10 1 0 6 cells were used in any of the aircraft carrier grids polsky et al 2016 summarised the findings of an earlier study that found adequate agreement with velocity spectra across the closed loop pilot control band using a grid spacing of 0 76 m this study also only compared two levels of grid refinement 4 1 0 6 and 8 1 0 6 cells so grid convergence cannot be implied forrest and owen 2009 did perform a full grid independence study with three different levels of grid refinement for des of the sfs2 geometry 3 3 1 0 6 5 8 1 0 6 and 10 4 1 0 6 tetrahedral cells finding little change between them in terms of mean velocities and turbulence intensity the subsequent simulations by forrest and owen used the medium grid with spacing of 0 36 m at full scale and found reasonable agreement with experimental spectra however grid independence of the spectra was not presented subsequent studies by forrest et al 2016 employed far higher grid resolutions with up to 20 3 1 0 6 cells zhang et al 2018 also performed a grid independence study for les of the sfs2 using almost double the number of cells of forrest and owen 5 87 1 0 6 9 93 1 0 6 and 21 25 1 0 6 and a structured grid topology reasonable convergence of mean velocity and pressure was obtained for the medium and fine grids although the total sampling time was only 13 t l so it is likely that finite sample error was relatively large and spectra were not compared thedin et al 2018 performed a third grid independence study for les of the sfs2 with full scale near deck grid resolutions of 0 16 m 0 31 m and 0 62 m 50 1 0 6 16 5 1 0 6 and 3 1 0 6 thedin et al obtained reasonable convergence of mean velocity profiles across all three grids but also did not compare spectra as part of the independence study the consensus from these studies appears to be that mean flow field properties are reasonably well converged for full scale grid spacings below 0 75 m in the flight deck region although most authors have opted for higher resolutions there appear to be no studies of grid convergence of velocity spectra across the closed loop pilot control band published in the open literature grid resolution in the near wall region has varied from y 1 with appropriate growth rates for fully resolved viscous boundary layers zhang et al 2018 to y based on wall model requirements dooley et al 2019 all the way to completely unresolved boundary layers with the wake grid spacing extended all the way to the wall thornber et al 2010 thedin et al 2018 examples of good agreement with mean and fluctuating velocities from experiments can be found for all three approaches suggesting that the sharp edged separation that dominates the majority of ship airwakes produces wake structures that are largely insensitive to the boundary layer resolution a conclusion supported by the work of shipman et al 2005 2 5 inflow conditions three varieties of inflow conditions have been used for ship airwake simulations uniform inflow conditions a steady abl profile and an unsteady abl uniform inflow conditions are generally chosen for studies replicating wind tunnel experiments or conditions where the relative wind is purely generated by the ship motion steady abl profiles have typically been used for simulations attempting to replicate at sea conditions thornber et al 2010 polsky et al 2016 these profiles are typically of the form 2 u u 0 z z 0 β where z 0 and u 0 are a reference height and a velocity at the reference height respectively accounting for the uniform contribution from ship motion has also been shown to be important when using an abl profile polsky et al 2016 thedin et al 2018 2019a have demonstrated the effect of an unsteady turbulent abl on the ship airwake and how this can lead to increased pilot control activity dooley et al 2019 came to the same conclusion with their simulations using an unsteady abl for the inflow these results suggest that steady abl profiles may not be sufficient for prediction of shol in some real world conditions it also introduces the additional expense of adopting sufficient resolution to resolve the turbulent fluctuations from the inflow to the region of interest or create turbulent fluctuations at a plane closer to the ship 2 6 domain size the choices of domain size for ship airwake studies have generally been made by simply selecting a distance sufficiently large that the influence of the boundary conditions on the wake near the ship is likely to be inconsequential navair recommendations polsky et al 2016 are a minimum of three ship lengths to the lateral and longitudinal boundaries and 300 m to the upper boundary at full scale others have placed inflow and lateral boundaries as close as one ship length away dooley et al 2019 and upper boundaries as close as 0 75 ship lengths forrest and owen 2009 yuan et al 2018 outflow boundaries are typically placed at least two ship lengths away only polsky et al 2007 have published a study of the influence of domain size after identifying potential pollution from boundary conditions in the results of a simulation using an extremely short domain extending the inflow from less than 0 25 ship lengths to approximately two ship lengths away and moving the outflow from less than 0 5 ship lengths to more than three ship lengths away resolved the problem however no intermediate domain sizes were tested so a minimum domain size was not established overall there is no evidence that ship airwake simulations are sensitive to the location of boundaries if there is more than one ship length to the inflow more than two ship lengths to the outflow and more than 0 75 ship lengths to the upper boundary 2 7 simulation length any time accurate simulations of turbulent flow must collect data over a sampling period to calculate flow statistics such as mean values and spectra the longer the sample period and the greater the number of independent samples the greater the confidence that the sample statistics are close to those of the underlying distribution the difference between the sample statistics and those of the underlying distribution from which the samples are taken is the finite sample error the length of the sample period must therefore be sufficient to reduce the finite sample error to an acceptable level finite sample error has been addressed explicitly by a couple of authors van muijden et al 2013 thornber et al 2010 although to date there have been no known studies that attempt to quantify or bound the finite sample error with the exception of an earlier study linton et al 2016 which included an estimate of the confidence intervals a comprehensive analysis of the finite sample error for a ship airwake that builds on this earlier study is the focus of the following sections of this paper without a quantitative measure of the finite sample error the simulation times used by authors have varied widely statistics have been presented from simulations with sampling periods as short as 1 4 t l watson et al 2019a and as long as 8 2 t l van muijden et al 2013 the most common simulation time is around 30 s at full scale which often reflects the requirements of manned flight simulators rather than statistical convergence another factor in total simulation length is the time allowed for the initial transient to pass and the flow to reach a statistical steady state no published studies have attempted to quantify a criterion for identifying the initialisation period instead opting for visual inspection of flow data and a safe estimate again a lack of quantitative criterion has led to a wide range of initialisation periods from 2 5 t l kelly et al 2016 to 12 t l polsky et al 2016 best practice is to examine simulation data on a case by case basis and eliminate all data showing any traces of an initial transient 2 8 reynolds number dependence reynolds number independence of the flow topology around sharp edged bluff bodies at high reynolds numbers is a hypothesis that is often invoked for ship airwake simulations and experiments this hypothesis is difficult to test experimentally because of the limited range of reynolds numbers that can be achieved in wind and water tunnels and the challenge of performing extensive well controlled and repeatable full scale measurements full scale geometries often also have features which are curved or approximately spherical thus may be sensitive to reynolds number effects cfd simulations offer an alternative means of assessing the validity of this hypothesis and a number of studies have addressed exactly this problem all reynolds numbers in the following discussion are expressed in terms of maximum ship beam at waterline and the uniform freestream velocity none of the cases for which the reynolds numbers are quoted below used an abl polsky and bruner 2000 and polsky 2002 performed an early study of reynolds number dependence with a lha and concluded that a factor of two change in reynolds number at full scale produced no important changes in the flow forrest and owen 2009 confirmed that only minor changes in the flow topology occurred between model r e 6 58 1 0 5 and full scale r e 2 26 1 0 7 reynolds numbers for the sfs2 a factor of 34 yuan et al 2018 also examined the sfs2 with des at model and full scale reynolds numbers comparing spectra as well as different wod angles and concluding that reynolds number has little impact on the form of spectra or the mean flow thornber et al 2010 compared velocity spectra for a full scale wave class ao across a reynolds number range spanning a factor of five and found that the spectra also scaled linearly with the strouhal number buchholz et al 2018 recently performed experiments and simulations on the onr tumblehome at reynolds numbers of 3900 1 22 1 0 5 and 15 9 1 0 6 they found that between r e 1 22 1 0 5 and r e 15 9 1 0 6 the mean flow field remained substantially the same at r e 3900 the dominant flow features were similar but locations of vortices and separated regions were altered significantly these studies provide strong evidence that both the structure of the mean flow and the form of the velocity spectra are independent of reynolds number for reynolds numbers of at least 1 22 1 0 5 2 9 summary in brief the simplified cfd methods of earlier simulations have given way to three dimensional time accurate full navier stokes simulations and turbulence modelling approaches shifted from rans and urans to varieties of les and des structured unstructured and overset grid topologies have all seen use with the last two enabling more complex geometries to be simulated with greater ease higher order accurate numerics have been adopted by some and grid free methods have also been investigated the full navier stokes equations supplemented with a turbulence model are required for an accurate solution and les and des are superior to rans and urans simulations the influences of many parameters that go into a ship airwake simulation have been well established including time resolution grid resolution with respect to mean values domain size inflow conditions and dependence on reynolds number questions remain about the grid convergence of spectra across the frequency band of interest as well as the simulation time required to bound the finite sample error within a predefined range an overview of values used in recent ship airwake studies for many of the parameters discussed in this literature review is provided by table 1 where a grid refinement study was performed only the size of the finest grid is listed the simulation length is the full simulation including both initialisation and sampling periods 3 sfs1 detached eddy simulation 3 1 numerical methods the incompressible filtered navier stokes equations eqs 3 and 4 were solved using the openfoam cfd code weller et al 1998 in the following equations u and p are the filtered velocity and pressure τ r is the residual stress tensor 3 u t u u p ν 2 u τ r 4 u 0 the piso algorithm of issa 1986 was used to resolve the coupling between the velocity and pressure fields the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes approach of shur et al 2008 was used for turbulence closure a hybrid numerical scheme using the blending function proposed by spalart et al 2012 for des is used to discretise the convective terms in the governing equations this hybrid scheme blends between a second order accurate upwind scheme in rans regions and a second order accurate centred scheme in les regions a second order accurate centred scheme is applied to non convective terms and a second order accurate implicit scheme is used to discretise the time derivative 3 2 sfs1 geometry and grid 3 2 1 ship geometry and measurement locations the geometry of the sfs1 is shown in fig 1 and the values of the various dimensions at both full and model scale are listed in table 2 cheney and zan 1999 measured time averaged pressure from 224 pressure taps covering the top and sides of the superstructure flight deck funnel and the face of the hangar at a range of wod conditions with a wind tunnel velocity of 60 m s the locations of these pressure taps are shown by the blue surface grid in fig 2 the velocity is sampled at a number of points on the symmetry plane of the sfs1 in the simulation in addition to pressure sampling at the location of the pressure taps the velocity probe points are marked in red in fig 2 numerical labels are given to the longitudinal coordinates of the sample points and alphabetical labels to the vertical coordinates so that each point may be referenced by a number letter pair the values of these coordinates are recorded in table 2 the final measurement locations defined in table 2 are a set of sample lines marked in green and running laterally across the flight deck level with the top edge of the hangar the grids of pressure tap locations are laid flat and contoured by pressure coefficient in fig 2 to give a concise visual representation of the pressure measurements from the experiments see fig 3 3 2 2 grid generation and boundary conditions a set of des grids of increasing resolution were generated based on the guidelines given by spalart 2001 the viscous rans region resolution in the wall normal direction was kept the same for each of these grids with a y value less than one at the wall verified in post processing refinement for the grid convergence study was restricted to the focus region where cells were kept as close to cubic as possible the wall normal spacing was adapted in the rans outer regions to match the rans viscous region and focus region grids the focus region was defined with some experimentation to encompass a sufficient portion of the domain such that it would be unlikely for a streamline exiting the focus region to return to the region of interest the flight deck fig 4 contains cross sections through the medium grid shown from the top and the port side of the ship the parameters of each of the grids used for the convergence study are listed in table 3 for the two rans regions denoted by rr vr for the viscous region and rr or for the outer region γ is the growth rate in the wall normal direction and δ y is the wall normal edge length cell closest to the wall in the les focus region lr fr δ is the grid spacing in all directions in the les departure region lr dr γ is the growth rate normal to the outer boundary of the focus region and δ y is the grid spacing in the cells bounding the focus region the domain itself is a rectangular prism with 3 l from the bow to the forward boundary 4 8 l from the stern to the aft boundary 3 l from the sides to the lateral boundaries and 1 5 l from the top of the funnel to the upper boundary all dimensions well within the limits of what has been used successfully in the studies reviewed earlier a fixed uniform velocity was used for the inflow boundary condition with no synthetic turbulent velocity fluctuations a neumann condition was applied to the pressure at the inflow and a dirichlet condition at the outflow 3 3 flowfield characteristics instantaneous isosurfaces of q criterion are shown in fig 5 for all wod conditions at 0 wod the flow separates over the top and sides of the bow forming a region of velocity deficit enclosing the entire ship the downwind edges of the ship are sheltered from the freestream velocity and as a result the strength of the vorticity is reduced in the downstream region of the wake at 45 wod far more of the ship s edges are exposed to the freestream generating stronger vorticity across the entire ship including the flight deck the windward corner of the bow directs the flow into two strong vortices which run along the front and side of the superstructure the windward edges of the hangar and the flight deck as well as the top edge of hangar all generate strong vortices which are shed across the flight deck also interacting with the superstructure edge vortex which runs over the top of the hangar into the wake the flow over the flight deck is split diagonally into two reasonably distinct halves on the leeward side the flow is dominated by a broad corner vortex which stretches across the flight deck in the direction of the freestream while the flow on the windward side is relatively clean at 90 wod the flow over the windward flight deck and superstructure edges resembles the flow over the bow at 0 wod the flow across the superstructure and the flight deck is characterised by strong vortices aligned normal to the freestream at both 45 and 90 the edges of the focus region are clearly marked by rapid dissipation of the vortices in the wake 3 4 grid convergence the three levels of grid refinement were used to establish grid convergence of both mean and fluctuating quantities at all three wod angles for brevity only the results for 0 wod are presented here with a comment on the results at 45 and 90 the time averaged pressure across the surface of the sfs1 is plotted in fig 6 these results have been resampled at the locations of the surface pressure taps in the experiments of cheney and zan shown in fig 2 all three grids produce reasonably similar c p contours across most of the surfaces the coarse grid results in contours of slightly different shape to the medium and fine grids over the flight deck and across the face of the hangar between the medium and fine grids the differences are less significant the only region with a notable difference being the bow where the pressure in the recirculation region decreases in the fine grid simulation results are compared to the experimental results by taking the absolute difference between the two this difference is plotted for the three grid resolutions in fig 7 there is no obvious improvement in the prediction of surface c p with increasing grid resolution and indeed the l 2 norms of the differences plotted in fig 7 are 0 039 0 044 and 0 042 for the coarse medium and fine grids respectively illustrating the lack of convergence towards the experimental results this is not terribly surprising as the agreement with the experimental data is already good on the coarse grid cheney and zan estimated individual probe c p accuracy at 0 03 except at the probes on top of the funnel where 0 1 was estimated the majority of the simulated pressure tap c p values fall within this range of experimental uncertainty although the discrepancy on the superstructure in front of the funnel is clearly outside this range the time averaged velocity profiles across the flight deck in fig 8 reveal a difference between grid resolutions not visible in the surface pressure results across most of the flight deck from fd3 to fd7 the grids are in reasonable agreement with closer agreement between the medium and fine grids but towards the hangar door at fd1 and fd2 there are large differences between the three grids these discrepancies are larger than can be accounted for by finite sample error and point to a strong sensitivity to grid resolution in this region most prominently at fd1 fd1 is located immediately behind the top edge of the hangar on the edge of the recirculation region over the flight deck small changes in the predicted location of the shear layer at the edge of this recirculation region can therefore produce relatively large changes in velocity profile aside from this particularly sensitive region the mean velocities across the flight deck appear to be well converged figs 9 and 10 show the psd of the vertical w component of velocity at the probe locations in fig 2 the spectra obtained from the three different grid resolutions are plotted and kolmogorov s s k f 5 3 spectrum in the inertial subrange is shown for reference the shaded frequency band on these plots indicates the scaled closed loop pilot response band the scaling is performed assuming that the strouhal number remains constant between model and full scale on the coarsest grid the cutoff frequency appears to fall within the pilot response band causing the psd to drop off rapidly after around 100 hz on the medium and fine grids this drop off occurs outside the pilot response band the spectra within the pilot response band generally agree well for the medium and fine grid with a consistent shape and magnitude in contrast the coarse grid spectra are substantially different in both form and magnitude from these observations it appears that the medium grid is of sufficient resolution to capture the turbulent fluctuations across the pilot response band for the 0 wod condition over the flight deck the psds over the superstructure at probes 1c and 2c show peaks associated with coherent vortex shedding which are not present in the fine grid results in the case of 45 and 90 wod the differences between the three grid refinement levels are more exaggerated for example mean velocities along the sample lines are shown for the 90 wod case in fig 11 mean values and spectra show consistent trends with grid refinement however the results from the medium grid are not as closely aligned with the results from the fine grid as at 0 wod a fourth grid level would help to clarify whether the finest grid is well converged however the level of uncertainty was not deemed sufficient to justify the additional computational expense importantly the velocity psds indicate that the medium grid is insufficient to resolve the closed loop pilot control band at 45 and 90 wod this is in contrast with the results from 0 wod which suggested the medium grid may be acceptable these results reflect the need to study a range of wod angles when verifying and validating ship airwakes a point that has been raised by others zan 2003 3 5 timestep convergence a normalised time step can be defined as δ τ r δ t t r representing the time step relative to the shortest period of the pilot closed loop control band scaled appropriately with geometry and velocity for model scale airwakes using this non dimensionalisation it was found that several authors polsky et al 2016 forrest and owen 2009 thornber et al 2010 had coincidentally all chosen δ τ r 0 02 and shown agreement with experimental spectra for a variety of ship geometries and wod conditions to confirm this finding for the present simulations a time step dependence study was performed for the 0 wod condition the simulations were repeated with three different time steps corresponding to δ τ r 0 0175 8 75 1 0 3 and 4 375 1 0 3 these simulations were each run for a total time of 40 t l the mean velocity across the flight deck is plotted in fig 12 for the three time steps the velocities from each sample line are offset on the y axis by 0 1 as indicated the results from the three simulations are not in perfect alignment however some variance should be expected due to the small but still present finite sample error minor asymmetries across the centre line of the flight deck are apparent for all time steps due to this finite sample error and the discrepancies between the simulations are of a similar scale to these asymmetries suggesting that these results do not imply a strong dependence on time step size the psds of the velocities over the flight deck from the simulations with different time steps are plotted in fig 13 the only consistent change with time step increase is a very minor shift in the apparent cut off frequency for δ τ r 0 0175 there is no indication of dependence on time step size across the closed loop pilot control band the variability between simulations with different time step sizes is similar to the variability seen between sampling windows w 1 and w 2 seen in fig 26 which were of similar length to the sample period in the time dependence simulations altogether these results and the simulations reported in the literature indicate that a time step of δ τ r 0 02 is sufficiently accurate for ship airwake simulations intended for ship helicopter di applications 4 statistical analysis 4 1 uncertainty quantification simulations performed over a finite time i e time accurate simulations generate finite samples from the pdfs which characterise the point statistics of the flow field statistical parameters such as the mean and the standard deviation which are calculated from these finite samples are therefore estimates of the parameters of the true pdfs which would be obtained from an infinite time simulation the convergence of these estimates can be quantified through an estimate of confidence intervals or the error variance defined as 5 var ϵ n var x n e x where x t is a time series process x n is the mean of a correlated sample generated by x t and e x is the true mean or expectation of x error variance and confidence intervals have been calculated for the mean velocities at each of the velocity probe locations to assess the simulation time required to give a reasonably converged mean there are two factors which complicate the calculation of these values from the cfd results correlation in the samples and transience during the flow initialisation period these factors are not unique to cfd simulations and proposals for dealing with them in a generic fashion can be found in the statistical literature for example heidelberger and welch 1981 1983 formulated an automated method for identifying initialisation transience and calculating confidence intervals of mean values for simulations exhibiting initial transience and significant autocorrelation heidelberger and welch s method for detecting and removing the initial transient was applied to the probe measurements from the wod 0 case but it was found to be unreliable for these data instead the data is simply eliminated based on visual inspection an example of a typical velocity trace exhibiting initial transience is shown in fig 14 the longest observed initial transient disappeared by t t l τ l 5 where t l l u is a convective time scale data from τ l 5 were eliminated from all probes and all subsequent simulations before statistical analysis was performed this is a shorter warm up period than some authors use and a longer period than others use for example polsky et al 2016 suggested 12 convective time scales while kelly et al 2016 used 2 5 as a rule of thumb and thedin et al 2019b discarded 4 5 convective time scales standard methods for estimating error variance or confidence intervals rely on the assumption that the data from which these values are to be constructed are random samples from a stationary distribution with unknown parameters kreyszig 2006 in this case the velocity samples were recorded at each time step so there is considerable autocorrelation in each time series an example of an autocorrelation function estimate for the raw data from one of the probes is shown in fig 15 the correlation in the signal is large even at a lag of k 800 time steps corresponding to a lag in time of t k 0 04 s estimation of sampling error is not common in the field of cfd the work of oliver et al 2014 being one example oliver et al 2014 adopted a method for estimating the sampling error from dns data accounting for correlation in the data following the example of trenberth 1984 and broerson 2006 the idea for dealing with correlation is to define a decorrelation separation distance t 0 which in turn defines an effective sample size n e f f 6 t 0 1 2 k 1 n 1 1 k n ρ ˆ k and 7 n e f f n t 0 where n is the total sample size and ρ ˆ k is the autocorrelation function estimate for lag k an alternative expression for the decorrelation distance in terms of an estimated spectral density s ˆ at zero frequency is von storch and zwiers 1999 8 t 0 s ˆ 0 σ ˆ n 2 where σ ˆ n 2 is the sample variance and n assumed to be large note that t 0 in both these definitions is non dimensionalised by the physical time step the error variance can then be estimated from the decorrelation separation distance and the sample variance by 9 var ϵ n σ ˆ n 2 t 0 n s ˆ 0 n eqs 6 and 7 are widely used heuristics for analysing correlated time series data they are derived by comparing the variances of correlated and uncorrelated series von storch and zwiers 1999 under the assumption that a correlated series of n samples contains the same information as an uncorrelated series with n e f f samples other expressions for the same concept can be derived by comparing different aspects of correlated and uncorrelated series thiébaux and zwiers 1984 the key difficulty in evaluating eq 6 is the estimate of ρ ˆ k thiébaux and zwiers 1984 compared estimates of the effective sample size based on ρ ˆ k obtained with direct computations from the data fitted autoregressive time series models and a third method utilising an estimate of the spectral density at zero frequency they found that directly computing ρ ˆ k from the data and the definition of the autocorrelation function produced an unreliable estimate which could be somewhat improved by truncating ρ ˆ k the autoregressive model and the spectral techniques were both effective provided a long sample is available and the spectra varied slowly near the origin both of these conditions are met by the data collected here oliver et al 2014 adopted the autoregressive time series approach for their analysis of dns and fitted models to the data using a fairly involved technique a somewhat simpler approach is taken for the spectral estimate relying on the unbiased estimator for the spectral density at the origin developed by heidelberger and welch 1981 results from a truncated direct calculation of ρ ˆ k have also been calculated thiébaux and zwiers 1984 caution against interpreting the effective sample size as the number of degrees of freedom for the purpose of constructing confidence intervals several key assumptions required for the use of student s t distribution in the calculation of confidence intervals are violated by this interpretation valid t statistics can be constructed for correlated series based on the heuristics of eqs 6 and 7 and thiébaux and zwiers 1984 show how although the form of these statistics are dependent on the method used to estimate the autocorrelation function or spectral density fortunately heidelberger and welch 1981 provide an expression for the confidence interval half width based on t statistics that are consistent with their method for estimating s 0 10 d 1 α t m 1 α 2 s ˆ 0 n where α is the desired significance and t m 1 α 2 is the value of a t distribution with m degrees of freedom corresponding to a significance of α s ˆ 0 is heidelberger and welch s estimate of the spectral density at the origin and m is a function of the parameters used to produce this estimate eqs 10 and 11 define the interval which contains e x with likelihood p 1 α 11 conf p x n d p e x x n d p the details of heidelberger and welch s method have been omitted for brevity suffice to say that a polynomial is fitted to the transformed periodogram near the origin and the intercept of this curve at f 0 is taken as an estimate of s 0 two parameters can be varied using this approach the order of the polynomial and the upper limit of the frequency band used to fit the polynomial the second parameter is specified in terms of the number of discrete frequencies used for the fit heidelberger and welch suggest using a second order polynomial fitted across k 50 discrete frequencies for large sample sizes the appropriateness of a second order polynomial for the data generated from the sfs1 was verified by inspecting the form of the transformed spectral density near the origin fig 16 shows the effective sample size and error variance as estimated by four different methods from probe data generated by a 0 wod simulation on the finest grid fig 14 is an example of one of the data sets processed probe 6b the first two methods denoted d 1 and d 2 use a direct calculation of ρ ˆ k truncated at k 1 0 4 and k 2 1 0 4 respectively the second two methods s 1 and s 2 are based on heidelberger and welch s spectral method using k 50 and k 100 discrete frequencies to fit the second order polynomial the higher k 100 was chosen for this test because the sample size in the current study is far larger than the examples presented by heidelberger and welch also shown in fig 16 are the 95 confidence interval half widths from s 1 and s 2 the effective sample size shows considerable variability between methods and this transfers directly to the error variance results in general the direct methods are more conservative in their estimates of the effective sample size and error variance and at some points the estimates are very sensitive to the truncation point chosen the spectral methods exhibit sensitivity in the effective sample size and error variance to the number of discrete frequencies although not to the degree of the direct methods the confidence interval estimates from the spectral methods are quite consistent in comparison and hence are adopted as a means of monitoring convergence in addition to being insensitive to model parameters a good confidence interval estimator should produce similar confidence intervals for independent sample sets of the same length generated from the same distribution provided the sample sets are sufficiently large a second test of the spectral method was performed to check this property the data used to compute the results in fig 16 with initial transience removed was split into two equal size and non overlapping sample sets labelled w 1 for the data in the window 0 n n 2 and w 2 for the data in the window n 2 n n these two sample sets are not completely independent but the correlation around n n 2 is not significant the s 2 method was used to compute confidence interval half widths for both windows and the results of this study are shown in fig 17 the s 2 method is clearly consistent in its predictions for all probes the data presented in figs 16 and 17 show that heidelberger and welch s spectral estimator generates robust and consistent confidence intervals based on these results the s 2 method is recommended for producing valid confidence interval estimates for ship airwake point statistics 4 2 stopping criterion with a good confidence interval estimate the simulation run time can be controlled by placing a stopping criterion on the size of the confidence interval half width this helps to ensure a consistent and quantifiable level of certainty in results by restricting the sampling error to an acceptable level heidelberger and welch 1983 proposed a confidence interval stopping criterion defined by a fraction of the mean this definition works well when the mean is large compared to the variance but for probes located in recirculation zones and velocity components normal to the freestream the mean velocity can be close to zero with large variance in these cases such a stopping criterion is overly restrictive instead the following criterion is proposed 12 d 0 9 max 0 025 x n 0 1 σ ˆ n which has better behaviour in regions with large fluctuations relative to the mean and retains a relevant physical interpretation the significance level and the fractions of the sample mean and standard deviation are chosen to represent an acceptable level of sampling error and can be traded off against simulation time eq 12 is evaluated every 2 1 2 5 n convective time scales after the initialisation period is completed where n 0 1 2 this again follows heidelberger and welch although they chose to evaluate less frequently using 1 5 n instead of 1 2 5 n the convergence times for all probes and velocity components from this procedure are plotted in fig 18 using the data from window w 1 and in fig 19 using the data from window w 2 the initialisation time has been included in these values so that the convergence times represent total simulation time if the data from the two windows are treated as independent realisations of the same process then the procedure should for a large enough sample size produce the same estimated convergence time for both windows overall the procedure is reasonably consistent there is minor variability in the estimated convergence times between the two windows with the exception of probe 2c this highlights the importance of monitoring a number of probes repeating the procedure for 45 and 90 wod angles also produces reasonable convergence times as shown in figs 20 and 21 the shifting distribution of convergence times between the probes reflects the changing characteristics of the airwake with wod angle the final piece of analysis presented to support this procedure is comparison to a common method for analysing temporal convergence of ship airwake data plotting the cumulative mean over time the cumulative means for the simulation until τ l 30 are shown for probes 2c 7b and 6a in figs 22 23 and 24 the cumulative means are overlaid on the raw probe data with the d 0 9 confidence interval plotted at each evaluation time the end of the raw data and the last confidence interval indicate the point at which the stopping criterion is met the results in figs 22 23 and 24 show that the method identifies stopping points where visual inspection would also conclude the mean was converged it is perhaps a little hasty in identifying convergence for the u component at probe 2c and a little conservative for all the components at probe 6a the estimated means for each velocity component at the convergence times indicated in fig 18 are plotted as bars in fig 25 capped error bars are used to indicate the d 0 9 confidence intervals at these convergence times for comparison the velocity component means from the full sampling period of the simulation approximately 60 t l with the initial transient period removed are shown on the same figure as black dots the grey uncapped error bars indicate one standard deviation calculated over the full sampling period the results in fig 25 show that of the 39 probe velocity components monitored 28 are within the d 0 9 confidence interval of the full sample mean when the stopping criterion is met if the probe velocity signals were uncorrelated then around 35 of the velocity component means at the convergence times would be expected to be within the d 0 9 confidence interval of the true mean considering the comparison in fig 25 is made to the full sample mean instead of the true mean and that there is correlation between the signals the performance of the criterion of eq 12 and the confidence interval estimation is quite satisfactory if the convergence time for each of the signals is set to the maximum convergence time indicated in fig 18 instead of the individual signal convergence time then the number of convergence time means within d 0 9 of the full sample means improves to 33 out of 39 this is more indicative of the performance of the method when used to halt a simulation after all monitored signals have met the stopping criterion 4 3 convergence of fluctuating values so far a method for quantitatively assessing the time convergence of mean values has been presented and this method has been used to objectively determine the simulation time required to meet convergence criteria for ship airwake simulations it is not just convergence of the mean that is desired but also of the fluctuating values a similar method could potentially be created for quantitatively assessing the convergence of spectra but for these simulations the observed convergence of the mean appears sufficient to indicate convergence of spectra to an acceptable level this is to be expected as the mean is dependent on the longest wavelengths which are the slowest to converge while the range of interest on the spectrum is at higher frequencies which converge more rapidly due to the larger number of independent samples from these wavelengths converging the mean is therefore likely to be sufficient in general to support this claim the u velocity psd at the probes located over the flight deck in fig 26 as computed using data from windows of varying length are shown very similar results are obtained for all velocity components and for the probes over the superstructure the w 1 and w 2 windows are as defined previously and the w 0 window encompasses the entire signal length the n 4 windows are a set of four non overlapping windows of length n 4 the shaded region indicates the closed loop pilot control band the close agreement with the w 0 spectra indicates that the fluctuating velocities are well converged for the w 1 and w 2 windows which span approximately 30 t l and are reasonably well converged even for the n 4 windows which span approximately 15 t l the convergence times in fig 18 indicate convergence of all probes by τ l 28 which leaves a sampling window of 23 t l once initialisation times are removed given the results in fig 26 the spectra obtained from a window spanning 23 t l would be acceptably converged 5 conclusions the literature on cfd simulations of ship airwakes contains answers to many of the questions that could be asked about the influence of the governing equations turbulence modelling time resolution and accuracy grid resolution inflow conditions simulation length and reynolds number however there is a lack of studies addressing the uncertainty due to finite sample error as well as grid dependence studies that consider convergence of spectra these two shortcomings have been addressed in this paper a statistical method for estimating confidence intervals on the mean of correlated time series data has been adapted and tested on velocity probe data from the sfs1 airwake the estimated confidence intervals are robust and consistent for a range of velocity probe locations and wod angles the stopping criterion defined in eq 12 can be used in conjunction with the estimated confidence intervals to restrict simulation time to the minimum required to meet an quantified level of convergence results from the sfs1 study at three wod angles indicate that a simulation time of approximately 30 to 40 t l is generally required after the initial transient has passed to reach a reasonable level of statistical convergence width of 90 confidence interval less than 2 5 of the mean or 10 of the variance whichever is greater convergence of the mean to this criterion was also found to be sufficient for convergence of the velocity psd in summary recommendations for ship airwake studies based on the sensitivity studies of the sfs1 are an initialisation period of 5 t l a simulation sampling period of at least 30 t l for collection of airwake statistics a time step up to 0 2 t r and a grid resolution equivalent to 0 2 m at full scale to ensure adequate resolution of

20817,high fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of ship airwakes are often performed with time accurate turbulence resolving methods such as large eddy simulation or detached eddy simulation in our review of the literature we find that the finite sample error in the results of these simulations is rarely expressed in terms of uncertainty in the statistics this makes it difficult to determine if any disagreement with experiment or other simulations can be attributed to finite sample time grid resolution or modelling approximations in this paper turbulence resolving simulations of the airwake over the sfs1 geometry are used to demonstrate a method for quantifying the uncertainty due to finite sample error with an estimated confidence interval based on this

region wod wind over deck 1 introduction velocity gradients and turbulence in the airwakes of ships and oil rigs have long been recognised as critical for the safe operating limits for helicopters and other aircraft at sea woomer and williams 1978 healey 1986 reliable prediction of these operating limits therefore requires accurate simulation or modelling of the airwake the major challenge of these airwake simulations is that of all high reynolds number incompressible external bluff body flows resolving the influence of turbulence navier stokes cfd methods which partially resolve the spectrum of turbulence such as large eddy simulation les and detached eddy simulation des currently represent the best option for high fidelity simulation of ship airwakes as long as direct numerical simulation dns remains out of computational reach however these methods bring with them the problem of finite sample error something not encountered when using steady state methods e g reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations and not as problematic when using methods that do not resolve turbulence e g unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans simulations each turbulence resolving simulation represents a finite sample from a continuous distribution characterised by the mean flow statistics any mean flow statistics computed from this finite sample are necessarily estimates with an associated uncertainty this uncertainty is often not quantified in the published literature on ship airwake simulations and industrial turbulent flows in general if simulation times are short this can lead to difficulty in determining if any disagreement with experiment or other simulations can be attributed to finite sample time grid resolution or modelling approximations quantifying the finite sample error can aid identification of grid dependence and enables a limit to be set on the simulation time based on a desired level of uncertainty in the mean flow statistics this paper is divided into two distinct parts a comprehensive review of the literature on ship airwake simulations section 2 and a study of finite sample error based on des of the sfs1 airwake sections 3 and 4 motivated by the points highlighted in the introduction and the findings of the literature review the finite sample error study leads to the proposal of a new stopping criterion for time accurate ship airwake simulations 2 literature review cfd simulations of ship airwakes have been performed since mahaffey et al 1986 and have proliferated since the late 1990s as computational methods and resources have evolved the following literature review breaks down ship airwake simulations into the elements of governing equations turbulence modelling time resolution and accuracy grid resolution inflow conditions domain size and simulation length grid based methods are the focus of this literature review although there have been several studies performed using grid free methods mckillip et al 2002 keller et al 2007 syms 2008 woodgate et al 2018 2 1 governing equations at least seven different sets of governing equations have been selected for the studies of ship airwakes just summarised here only the equations that would be solved absent any turbulence model and without considering time accuracy are considered the most commonly applied are the compressible euler equations the incompressible euler equations the compressible navier stokes equations and the incompressible navier stokes equations in pressure velocity form a handful of studies have alternatively used the incompressible navier stokes equations in vorticity velocity form the thin layer navier stokes equations or the non linear disturbance equations simulations using the euler equations have been presented in 13 different publications liu and long 1998 long et al 1998 tattersall et al 1998 bogstad et al 1999 guillot and walker 2000 sharma and long 2001 guillot 2002 bogstad et al 2002 sezer uzol et al 2005 alpman et al 2007 bridges et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 oruc et al 2016 2018 and the choice of euler equations in these studies was motivated primarily by computational cost the latest of these studies was published in 2009 with the exception of the work of oruc et al 2016 2018 which targeted real time performance with limited computational resources the euler equations were eventually abandoned in favour of the full navier stokes equations augmented with a turbulence modelling approach as it was recognised that turbulent dissipation must be included to predict both the mean flow structure and the unsteady flow field zhang et al 2009 oruc et al 2016 2018 the upwind biased numerical schemes typically used for these euler simulations produce an artificial viscosity by way of numerical dissipation akin to an implicit les grinstein et al 2007 as a result the distinction between viscous and inviscid formulations is not so clear cut on coarse grids where numerical dissipation dominates turbulent and molecular dissipation it is therefore only relatively recently as computational resources have allowed finer grid resolution and lower numerical dissipation that navier stokes simulations with explicit or implicit turbulence modelling have become ubiquitous for ship airwake simulations of the alternative governing equations the thin layer navier stokes and the non linear disturbance equations both sacrifice important aspects of the physics in exchange for reductions in computational cost consequently they have only been considered in very early work tai and carico 1995 tai 1995 liu and long 1998 long et al 1998 tai 1998 the latest example being in 1998 the vorticity velocity form of the navier stokes is of interest because of the ability to conserve vorticity a property that the pressure velocity form of the navier stokes equations lack in the far wake the vorticity velocity form has the potential to preserve the wake of the ship with lower grid resolution than the pressure velocity form quon et al 2014 simulation of the near body flow field is more challenging as solid surfaces produce singularities in the vorticity velocity formulation preventing the governing equations being solved down to the wall finer grid spacing is required in the near wake to accurately resolve smaller scale turbulence regardless of the form of the governing equations so the pressure velocity form of the navier stokes equations is more suited to the near body and near wake regions of the flow field the final consideration for governing equations is the choice between compressible and incompressible formulations many authors have solved the compressible governing equations often simply due to the availability of compressible codes one motivation for a compressible solver is the potential to include a grid resolved rotor in the simulation and treat both the high mach number regions near the rotor and the ship airwake with a single solver although this has rarely been done the ship airwake itself is at a very low mach number and incompressible governing equations are therefore a more natural choice compressible solvers suffer from two important problems when applied to essentially incompressible flow the time step is constrained by the acoustic wave speed which is far higher than convective wave speeds of interest and numerical dissipation increases as mach number decreases leading to increased grid resolution requirements to maintain accuracy with decreasing mach number volpe 1993 by scaling the freestream velocity to mach 0 3 essentially incompressible flow can be maintained but the convective time scales are moved closer to the acoustic time scales alleviating the time step constraint mach scaling also ensures that low mach dissipation is not excessive for larger scale structures although thornber et al 2010 point out that the instabilities which trigger turbulence will still occur at low mach numbers and be damped by excessive dissipation mach scaling has been used for many ship airwake simulations polsky and bruner 2000 polsky 2002 2003 thornber et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 further increases in the time step in compressible solvers can be achieved with implicit numerics and solution algorithms employing sub iterations pre conditioning zhang et al 2009 polsky et al 2016 and low mach correction schemes thornber et al 2010 are two additional options which have been used to resolve the problem of low mach dissipation with the modifications just described compressible solvers can be applied to ship airwake simulations without sacrificing any of the physics of the problem the compressible and incompressible navier stokes are therefore both suitable choices for the simulation of ship airwakes and this is reflected in their common use in the literature 2 2 turbulence modelling rans urans des and les have all been applied as turbulence modelling methodologies for ship airwakes urans models are predicated on the assumption that all turbulent motions are modelled and the resolved unsteady motions are coherent deterministic features of the flow distinct in scale from the turbulent motions the validity of this assumption is questionable for important aspects of ship airwakes particularly massively separated flows in which there is no distinct separation of scales the ability of urans simulations to predict turbulent spectra is also a cause for concern if more than a time averaged flow field is desired nevertheless a number of urans simulations have been performed toffoletto et al 2002 roper et al 2006 forrest et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 huang et al 2012 lawson et al 2012 crozon et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 forrest et al 2007 compared urans and des directly to experimental data they found that urans was generally able to capture mean velocities as well as des but underpredicted the spectra lawson et al 2012 and crozon et al 2014 also compared urans and des and came to the same conclusion as forrest et al these studies support the theoretical shortcomings of urans models and together are a strong indication that they should not be applied unless only mean quantities are required and even then should be used with caution partially averaged ns pans is a variant of les which has been applied to ship airwake simulations by zhang et al 2018 pans differs from standard les in that the sub filter turbulence model is explicitly a function of the ratio of unresolved to total kinetic energy pans is formulated to consistently transition from urans to dns as this ratio changes from one to zero in the simulations of zhang et al pans exhibited significantly fewer small scale features on the same grid when compared to les there were no significant differences between mean velocity and pressures from the pans simulations and les except on the coarsest grids when the pans model essentially acted as a urans model and failed to accurately predict the mean flow no comparison of spectra were made so it is not apparent whether the pans simulations were able to better resolve the scales of motion in the closed loop pilot response band on a coarser grid than les visualisations indicate that this may not be the case contrary to what may be expected les and iles have been used for ship airwake studies from early on polsky and bruner 2000 ramamurti and sandberg 2002 although given the coarse resolution of these grids it is unlikely that a significant range of velocity fluctuations were resolved in fact it is likely that many if not all subsequent ship airwake les have also not met the 80 resolved kinetic energy heuristic often quoted for a strict les pope 2000 certainly simulations often fail to produce a distinct inertial range in spectra and visualisations often reveal a lack of small scale features these observations are to be expected as the computational cost of a wall resolved les at reynolds numbers of several hundred million would be impractical even a wall modelled les or des would be unwieldy were an attempt made to resolve 80 of the kinetic energy over the entire flight deck of an aircraft carrier and its near wake for these reasons the validity of ship airwake les des has generally been evaluated from an empirical standpoint the critical question being are the spectra across the frequency band of interest generally the closed loop pilot response band resolved this is a question that is best answered by a combination of a grid convergence study and comparison against experimental data both implicit and explicit sgs models have been used successfully for ship airwake les the former is exemplified by the work of polsky et al 2016 and others using the cobalt cfd code at navair and the latter by the work of forrest and owen 2009 and others at the university of liverpool thornber et al 2010 is an example of a higher resolution iles performed with high order accurate numerics which showed good agreement with spectra across a wide frequency band while the recent high resolution simulations of dooley et al 2019 and thedin et al 2019b are examples of standard les with significant resolution of small scale turbulence properly applied there is no reason to believe either method holds any particular advantage over the other except that iles may be faster as no additional equations are solved however it should be noted that although iles may be coupled with a wall function islam and thornber 2018 such an option has not yet been explored 2 3 time resolution and accuracy although the necessity of time accurate simulations for predicting turbulent fluctuations is obvious there is still the question of whether or not steady state simulations are able to capture the mean flow potentially providing an efficient way to compute a lot of information about the airwake van muijden et al 2013 directly compared steady state rans simulations using an algebraic stress model to high fidelity les and found significant differences between the rans results and the time averaged les results zhao et al 2015 and polsky 2002 performed similar comparisons to des and monotone integrated les miles a variant of iles and came to the same conclusion this is not entirely unexpected as there are regions of flow dominated by vortex shedding and bistable modes have been observed herry and van der vorst 2011 both of these flow features violate the assumption of the existence of a steady state perturbed only by turbulent fluctuations on which rans models are based evidence and theory therefore both indicate that time accuracy is critical not only for capturing unsteady flow but also for predicting the mean flow when it comes to time accurate simulations the time resolution chosen must be derived from two considerations stability and accuracy stability requirements vary from code to code and depend on the numerical schemes where stability requirements are present they are usually stricter than the accuracy requirements however implicit numerical schemes and iterative time stepping algorithms can extend the time step to essentially arbitrary lengths the problem then becomes one of choosing a time step for sufficient accuracy simply considering the need to generate information about the entire closed loop pilot control band suggests that the maximum allowable time step frequency is at least double the highest frequency in this band i e 4 hz or 0 25 s in a full scale simulation this would be a large time step for a les and would likely entail a significant loss of information about the smaller scales of motion that determine the dissipation of the larger scales in the closed loop pilot control band such a large time step would also effectively produce an implicit filter with a cutoff frequency very close to the frequencies of interest partially filtering some of the scales in the frequency band of interest as a consequence time accurate ship airwake simulations use smaller time steps a convective time scale t l l u is often defined in terms of ship length and freestream velocity at deck height this is a useful reference for isolated ship studies and has great physical relevance when considering simulation run time and the length of the initialisation period however for the purpose of comparing time steps in terms of accuracy another relevant reference is proposed for dynamic interface studies t r s f m a x where f m a x 2 hz is the highest frequency in the closed loop pilot control band s is a scale factor derived from the assumption of constant strouhal number between model and full scale 1 s l m l f u f u m with l m l f a geometric scale factor from model to full scale and u f u m a velocity scale factor the advantage of t r is that the non dimensional time step δ τ r δ t t r is now referred to a time scale of more significance for the problem of ship helicopter dynamic interface simulation one which is constant for all full scale ships and scales appropriately for model ships the maximum allowable time step which was calculated previously becomes δ τ m a x 0 5 using this non dimensionalisation and retains the same physical relevance across all scales based on the combined experience at navair and a time step sensitivity study polsky et al 2016 recommended a time step of δ τ r 0 02 for accuracy forrest and owen 2009 also arrived at δ τ r 0 02 based on des recommendations from spalart 2001 and showed reasonable agreement with experimental spectra over the frequency band of interest thornber et al 2010 chose the same δ τ r 0 02 as well based purely on stability requirements and again demonstrated agreement with experimental spectra others have opted for smaller time steps van muijden et al 2013 directly considered δ τ m a x when selecting an appropriate time step eventually settling on δ τ r 0 015 as a compromise between an optimal time step for the accuracy of their numerical schemes and run time considerations zhao et al 2015 used an even smaller time step of δ τ r 0 006 given that δ τ r 0 02 has proven to provide sufficient resolution for a wide range of geometries and solution methods it seems reasonable to conclude that there is no advantage to be gained by reducing the time step further except to meet stability criteria 2 4 grid resolution the design and resolution of the grid strongly influences which flow features can be captured and the degree to which they are resolved in different regions of the domain for les and des there are fairly well established guidelines for grid parameters spalart 2001 although a grid convergence study is always the ultimate arbiter the reynolds number of ship airwakes generally precludes wall resolving les adhering to the strictest guidelines for grid resolution this has led to the adoption of wall modelling as well as des and other rans les hybrids which relax grid spacing requirements in the wall region relatively few grid sensitivity studies have been published for ship airwake simulations and convergence studies for les and des are even more rare polsky 2003 compared simulation results from grids with two levels of refinement 4 1 0 6 cells and 6 4 1 0 6 cells seeking better agreement with experimental data but none was found shipman et al 2005 investigated the sensitivity of miles to the presence of a viscous boundary layer resolving grid and found that the influence of a viscous boundary condition was restricted to regions close to deck edges and mast structures however no formal grid convergence study was performed and a maximum of 10 1 0 6 cells were used in any of the aircraft carrier grids polsky et al 2016 summarised the findings of an earlier study that found adequate agreement with velocity spectra across the closed loop pilot control band using a grid spacing of 0 76 m this study also only compared two levels of grid refinement 4 1 0 6 and 8 1 0 6 cells so grid convergence cannot be implied forrest and owen 2009 did perform a full grid independence study with three different levels of grid refinement for des of the sfs2 geometry 3 3 1 0 6 5 8 1 0 6 and 10 4 1 0 6 tetrahedral cells finding little change between them in terms of mean velocities and turbulence intensity the subsequent simulations by forrest and owen used the medium grid with spacing of 0 36 m at full scale and found reasonable agreement with experimental spectra however grid independence of the spectra was not presented subsequent studies by forrest et al 2016 employed far higher grid resolutions with up to 20 3 1 0 6 cells zhang et al 2018 also performed a grid independence study for les of the sfs2 using almost double the number of cells of forrest and owen 5 87 1 0 6 9 93 1 0 6 and 21 25 1 0 6 and a structured grid topology reasonable convergence of mean velocity and pressure was obtained for the medium and fine grids although the total sampling time was only 13 t l so it is likely that finite sample error was relatively large and spectra were not compared thedin et al 2018 performed a third grid independence study for les of the sfs2 with full scale near deck grid resolutions of 0 16 m 0 31 m and 0 62 m 50 1 0 6 16 5 1 0 6 and 3 1 0 6 thedin et al obtained reasonable convergence of mean velocity profiles across all three grids but also did not compare spectra as part of the independence study the consensus from these studies appears to be that mean flow field properties are reasonably well converged for full scale grid spacings below 0 75 m in the flight deck region although most authors have opted for higher resolutions there appear to be no studies of grid convergence of velocity spectra across the closed loop pilot control band published in the open literature grid resolution in the near wall region has varied from y 1 with appropriate growth rates for fully resolved viscous boundary layers zhang et al 2018 to y based on wall model requirements dooley et al 2019 all the way to completely unresolved boundary layers with the wake grid spacing extended all the way to the wall thornber et al 2010 thedin et al 2018 examples of good agreement with mean and fluctuating velocities from experiments can be found for all three approaches suggesting that the sharp edged separation that dominates the majority of ship airwakes produces wake structures that are largely insensitive to the boundary layer resolution a conclusion supported by the work of shipman et al 2005 2 5 inflow conditions three varieties of inflow conditions have been used for ship airwake simulations uniform inflow conditions a steady abl profile and an unsteady abl uniform inflow conditions are generally chosen for studies replicating wind tunnel experiments or conditions where the relative wind is purely generated by the ship motion steady abl profiles have typically been used for simulations attempting to replicate at sea conditions thornber et al 2010 polsky et al 2016 these profiles are typically of the form 2 u u 0 z z 0 β where z 0 and u 0 are a reference height and a velocity at the reference height respectively accounting for the uniform contribution from ship motion has also been shown to be important when using an abl profile polsky et al 2016 thedin et al 2018 2019a have demonstrated the effect of an unsteady turbulent abl on the ship airwake and how this can lead to increased pilot control activity dooley et al 2019 came to the same conclusion with their simulations using an unsteady abl for the inflow these results suggest that steady abl profiles may not be sufficient for prediction of shol in some real world conditions it also introduces the additional expense of adopting sufficient resolution to resolve the turbulent fluctuations from the inflow to the region of interest or create turbulent fluctuations at a plane closer to the ship 2 6 domain size the choices of domain size for ship airwake studies have generally been made by simply selecting a distance sufficiently large that the influence of the boundary conditions on the wake near the ship is likely to be inconsequential navair recommendations polsky et al 2016 are a minimum of three ship lengths to the lateral and longitudinal boundaries and 300 m to the upper boundary at full scale others have placed inflow and lateral boundaries as close as one ship length away dooley et al 2019 and upper boundaries as close as 0 75 ship lengths forrest and owen 2009 yuan et al 2018 outflow boundaries are typically placed at least two ship lengths away only polsky et al 2007 have published a study of the influence of domain size after identifying potential pollution from boundary conditions in the results of a simulation using an extremely short domain extending the inflow from less than 0 25 ship lengths to approximately two ship lengths away and moving the outflow from less than 0 5 ship lengths to more than three ship lengths away resolved the problem however no intermediate domain sizes were tested so a minimum domain size was not established overall there is no evidence that ship airwake simulations are sensitive to the location of boundaries if there is more than one ship length to the inflow more than two ship lengths to the outflow and more than 0 75 ship lengths to the upper boundary 2 7 simulation length any time accurate simulations of turbulent flow must collect data over a sampling period to calculate flow statistics such as mean values and spectra the longer the sample period and the greater the number of independent samples the greater the confidence that the sample statistics are close to those of the underlying distribution the difference between the sample statistics and those of the underlying distribution from which the samples are taken is the finite sample error the length of the sample period must therefore be sufficient to reduce the finite sample error to an acceptable level finite sample error has been addressed explicitly by a couple of authors van muijden et al 2013 thornber et al 2010 although to date there have been no known studies that attempt to quantify or bound the finite sample error with the exception of an earlier study linton et al 2016 which included an estimate of the confidence intervals a comprehensive analysis of the finite sample error for a ship airwake that builds on this earlier study is the focus of the following sections of this paper without a quantitative measure of the finite sample error the simulation times used by authors have varied widely statistics have been presented from simulations with sampling periods as short as 1 4 t l watson et al 2019a and as long as 8 2 t l van muijden et al 2013 the most common simulation time is around 30 s at full scale which often reflects the requirements of manned flight simulators rather than statistical convergence another factor in total simulation length is the time allowed for the initial transient to pass and the flow to reach a statistical steady state no published studies have attempted to quantify a criterion for identifying the initialisation period instead opting for visual inspection of flow data and a safe estimate again a lack of quantitative criterion has led to a wide range of initialisation periods from 2 5 t l kelly et al 2016 to 12 t l polsky et al 2016 best practice is to examine simulation data on a case by case basis and eliminate all data showing any traces of an initial transient 2 8 reynolds number dependence reynolds number independence of the flow topology around sharp edged bluff bodies at high reynolds numbers is a hypothesis that is often invoked for ship airwake simulations and experiments this hypothesis is difficult to test experimentally because of the limited range of reynolds numbers that can be achieved in wind and water tunnels and the challenge of performing extensive well controlled and repeatable full scale measurements full scale geometries often also have features which are curved or approximately spherical thus may be sensitive to reynolds number effects cfd simulations offer an alternative means of assessing the validity of this hypothesis and a number of studies have addressed exactly this problem all reynolds numbers in the following discussion are expressed in terms of maximum ship beam at waterline and the uniform freestream velocity none of the cases for which the reynolds numbers are quoted below used an abl polsky and bruner 2000 and polsky 2002 performed an early study of reynolds number dependence with a lha and concluded that a factor of two change in reynolds number at full scale produced no important changes in the flow forrest and owen 2009 confirmed that only minor changes in the flow topology occurred between model r e 6 58 1 0 5 and full scale r e 2 26 1 0 7 reynolds numbers for the sfs2 a factor of 34 yuan et al 2018 also examined the sfs2 with des at model and full scale reynolds numbers comparing spectra as well as different wod angles and concluding that reynolds number has little impact on the form of spectra or the mean flow thornber et al 2010 compared velocity spectra for a full scale wave class ao across a reynolds number range spanning a factor of five and found that the spectra also scaled linearly with the strouhal number buchholz et al 2018 recently performed experiments and simulations on the onr tumblehome at reynolds numbers of 3900 1 22 1 0 5 and 15 9 1 0 6 they found that between r e 1 22 1 0 5 and r e 15 9 1 0 6 the mean flow field remained substantially the same at r e 3900 the dominant flow features were similar but locations of vortices and separated regions were altered significantly these studies provide strong evidence that both the structure of the mean flow and the form of the velocity spectra are independent of reynolds number for reynolds numbers of at least 1 22 1 0 5 2 9 summary in brief the simplified cfd methods of earlier simulations have given way to three dimensional time accurate full navier stokes simulations and turbulence modelling approaches shifted from rans and urans to varieties of les and des structured unstructured and overset grid topologies have all seen use with the last two enabling more complex geometries to be simulated with greater ease higher order accurate numerics have been adopted by some and grid free methods have also been investigated the full navier stokes equations supplemented with a turbulence model are required for an accurate solution and les and des are superior to rans and urans simulations the influences of many parameters that go into a ship airwake simulation have been well established including time resolution grid resolution with respect to mean values domain size inflow conditions and dependence on reynolds number questions remain about the grid convergence of spectra across the frequency band of interest as well as the simulation time required to bound the finite sample error within a predefined range an overview of values used in recent ship airwake studies for many of the parameters discussed in this literature review is provided by table 1 where a grid refinement study was performed only the size of the finest grid is listed the simulation length is the full simulation including both initialisation and sampling periods 3 sfs1 detached eddy simulation 3 1 numerical methods the incompressible filtered navier stokes equations eqs 3 and 4 were solved using the openfoam cfd code weller et al 1998 in the following equations u and p are the filtered velocity and pressure τ r is the residual stress tensor 3 u t u u p ν 2 u τ r 4 u 0 the piso algorithm of issa 1986 was used to resolve the coupling between the velocity and pressure fields the improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes approach of shur et al 2008 was used for turbulence closure a hybrid numerical scheme using the blending function proposed by spalart et al 2012 for des is used to discretise the convective terms in the governing equations this hybrid scheme blends between a second order accurate upwind scheme in rans regions and a second order accurate centred scheme in les regions a second order accurate centred scheme is applied to non convective terms and a second order accurate implicit scheme is used to discretise the time derivative 3 2 sfs1 geometry and grid 3 2 1 ship geometry and measurement locations the geometry of the sfs1 is shown in fig 1 and the values of the various dimensions at both full and model scale are listed in table 2 cheney and zan 1999 measured time averaged pressure from 224 pressure taps covering the top and sides of the superstructure flight deck funnel and the face of the hangar at a range of wod conditions with a wind tunnel velocity of 60 m s the locations of these pressure taps are shown by the blue surface grid in fig 2 the velocity is sampled at a number of points on the symmetry plane of the sfs1 in the simulation in addition to pressure sampling at the location of the pressure taps the velocity probe points are marked in red in fig 2 numerical labels are given to the longitudinal coordinates of the sample points and alphabetical labels to the vertical coordinates so that each point may be referenced by a number letter pair the values of these coordinates are recorded in table 2 the final measurement locations defined in table 2 are a set of sample lines marked in green and running laterally across the flight deck level with the top edge of the hangar the grids of pressure tap locations are laid flat and contoured by pressure coefficient in fig 2 to give a concise visual representation of the pressure measurements from the experiments see fig 3 3 2 2 grid generation and boundary conditions a set of des grids of increasing resolution were generated based on the guidelines given by spalart 2001 the viscous rans region resolution in the wall normal direction was kept the same for each of these grids with a y value less than one at the wall verified in post processing refinement for the grid convergence study was restricted to the focus region where cells were kept as close to cubic as possible the wall normal spacing was adapted in the rans outer regions to match the rans viscous region and focus region grids the focus region was defined with some experimentation to encompass a sufficient portion of the domain such that it would be unlikely for a streamline exiting the focus region to return to the region of interest the flight deck fig 4 contains cross sections through the medium grid shown from the top and the port side of the ship the parameters of each of the grids used for the convergence study are listed in table 3 for the two rans regions denoted by rr vr for the viscous region and rr or for the outer region γ is the growth rate in the wall normal direction and δ y is the wall normal edge length cell closest to the wall in the les focus region lr fr δ is the grid spacing in all directions in the les departure region lr dr γ is the growth rate normal to the outer boundary of the focus region and δ y is the grid spacing in the cells bounding the focus region the domain itself is a rectangular prism with 3 l from the bow to the forward boundary 4 8 l from the stern to the aft boundary 3 l from the sides to the lateral boundaries and 1 5 l from the top of the funnel to the upper boundary all dimensions well within the limits of what has been used successfully in the studies reviewed earlier a fixed uniform velocity was used for the inflow boundary condition with no synthetic turbulent velocity fluctuations a neumann condition was applied to the pressure at the inflow and a dirichlet condition at the outflow 3 3 flowfield characteristics instantaneous isosurfaces of q criterion are shown in fig 5 for all wod conditions at 0 wod the flow separates over the top and sides of the bow forming a region of velocity deficit enclosing the entire ship the downwind edges of the ship are sheltered from the freestream velocity and as a result the strength of the vorticity is reduced in the downstream region of the wake at 45 wod far more of the ship s edges are exposed to the freestream generating stronger vorticity across the entire ship including the flight deck the windward corner of the bow directs the flow into two strong vortices which run along the front and side of the superstructure the windward edges of the hangar and the flight deck as well as the top edge of hangar all generate strong vortices which are shed across the flight deck also interacting with the superstructure edge vortex which runs over the top of the hangar into the wake the flow over the flight deck is split diagonally into two reasonably distinct halves on the leeward side the flow is dominated by a broad corner vortex which stretches across the flight deck in the direction of the freestream while the flow on the windward side is relatively clean at 90 wod the flow over the windward flight deck and superstructure edges resembles the flow over the bow at 0 wod the flow across the superstructure and the flight deck is characterised by strong vortices aligned normal to the freestream at both 45 and 90 the edges of the focus region are clearly marked by rapid dissipation of the vortices in the wake 3 4 grid convergence the three levels of grid refinement were used to establish grid convergence of both mean and fluctuating quantities at all three wod angles for brevity only the results for 0 wod are presented here with a comment on the results at 45 and 90 the time averaged pressure across the surface of the sfs1 is plotted in fig 6 these results have been resampled at the locations of the surface pressure taps in the experiments of cheney and zan shown in fig 2 all three grids produce reasonably similar c p contours across most of the surfaces the coarse grid results in contours of slightly different shape to the medium and fine grids over the flight deck and across the face of the hangar between the medium and fine grids the differences are less significant the only region with a notable difference being the bow where the pressure in the recirculation region decreases in the fine grid simulation results are compared to the experimental results by taking the absolute difference between the two this difference is plotted for the three grid resolutions in fig 7 there is no obvious improvement in the prediction of surface c p with increasing grid resolution and indeed the l 2 norms of the differences plotted in fig 7 are 0 039 0 044 and 0 042 for the coarse medium and fine grids respectively illustrating the lack of convergence towards the experimental results this is not terribly surprising as the agreement with the experimental data is already good on the coarse grid cheney and zan estimated individual probe c p accuracy at 0 03 except at the probes on top of the funnel where 0 1 was estimated the majority of the simulated pressure tap c p values fall within this range of experimental uncertainty although the discrepancy on the superstructure in front of the funnel is clearly outside this range the time averaged velocity profiles across the flight deck in fig 8 reveal a difference between grid resolutions not visible in the surface pressure results across most of the flight deck from fd3 to fd7 the grids are in reasonable agreement with closer agreement between the medium and fine grids but towards the hangar door at fd1 and fd2 there are large differences between the three grids these discrepancies are larger than can be accounted for by finite sample error and point to a strong sensitivity to grid resolution in this region most prominently at fd1 fd1 is located immediately behind the top edge of the hangar on the edge of the recirculation region over the flight deck small changes in the predicted location of the shear layer at the edge of this recirculation region can therefore produce relatively large changes in velocity profile aside from this particularly sensitive region the mean velocities across the flight deck appear to be well converged figs 9 and 10 show the psd of the vertical w component of velocity at the probe locations in fig 2 the spectra obtained from the three different grid resolutions are plotted and kolmogorov s s k f 5 3 spectrum in the inertial subrange is shown for reference the shaded frequency band on these plots indicates the scaled closed loop pilot response band the scaling is performed assuming that the strouhal number remains constant between model and full scale on the coarsest grid the cutoff frequency appears to fall within the pilot response band causing the psd to drop off rapidly after around 100 hz on the medium and fine grids this drop off occurs outside the pilot response band the spectra within the pilot response band generally agree well for the medium and fine grid with a consistent shape and magnitude in contrast the coarse grid spectra are substantially different in both form and magnitude from these observations it appears that the medium grid is of sufficient resolution to capture the turbulent fluctuations across the pilot response band for the 0 wod condition over the flight deck the psds over the superstructure at probes 1c and 2c show peaks associated with coherent vortex shedding which are not present in the fine grid results in the case of 45 and 90 wod the differences between the three grid refinement levels are more exaggerated for example mean velocities along the sample lines are shown for the 90 wod case in fig 11 mean values and spectra show consistent trends with grid refinement however the results from the medium grid are not as closely aligned with the results from the fine grid as at 0 wod a fourth grid level would help to clarify whether the finest grid is well converged however the level of uncertainty was not deemed sufficient to justify the additional computational expense importantly the velocity psds indicate that the medium grid is insufficient to resolve the closed loop pilot control band at 45 and 90 wod this is in contrast with the results from 0 wod which suggested the medium grid may be acceptable these results reflect the need to study a range of wod angles when verifying and validating ship airwakes a point that has been raised by others zan 2003 3 5 timestep convergence a normalised time step can be defined as δ τ r δ t t r representing the time step relative to the shortest period of the pilot closed loop control band scaled appropriately with geometry and velocity for model scale airwakes using this non dimensionalisation it was found that several authors polsky et al 2016 forrest and owen 2009 thornber et al 2010 had coincidentally all chosen δ τ r 0 02 and shown agreement with experimental spectra for a variety of ship geometries and wod conditions to confirm this finding for the present simulations a time step dependence study was performed for the 0 wod condition the simulations were repeated with three different time steps corresponding to δ τ r 0 0175 8 75 1 0 3 and 4 375 1 0 3 these simulations were each run for a total time of 40 t l the mean velocity across the flight deck is plotted in fig 12 for the three time steps the velocities from each sample line are offset on the y axis by 0 1 as indicated the results from the three simulations are not in perfect alignment however some variance should be expected due to the small but still present finite sample error minor asymmetries across the centre line of the flight deck are apparent for all time steps due to this finite sample error and the discrepancies between the simulations are of a similar scale to these asymmetries suggesting that these results do not imply a strong dependence on time step size the psds of the velocities over the flight deck from the simulations with different time steps are plotted in fig 13 the only consistent change with time step increase is a very minor shift in the apparent cut off frequency for δ τ r 0 0175 there is no indication of dependence on time step size across the closed loop pilot control band the variability between simulations with different time step sizes is similar to the variability seen between sampling windows w 1 and w 2 seen in fig 26 which were of similar length to the sample period in the time dependence simulations altogether these results and the simulations reported in the literature indicate that a time step of δ τ r 0 02 is sufficiently accurate for ship airwake simulations intended for ship helicopter di applications 4 statistical analysis 4 1 uncertainty quantification simulations performed over a finite time i e time accurate simulations generate finite samples from the pdfs which characterise the point statistics of the flow field statistical parameters such as the mean and the standard deviation which are calculated from these finite samples are therefore estimates of the parameters of the true pdfs which would be obtained from an infinite time simulation the convergence of these estimates can be quantified through an estimate of confidence intervals or the error variance defined as 5 var ϵ n var x n e x where x t is a time series process x n is the mean of a correlated sample generated by x t and e x is the true mean or expectation of x error variance and confidence intervals have been calculated for the mean velocities at each of the velocity probe locations to assess the simulation time required to give a reasonably converged mean there are two factors which complicate the calculation of these values from the cfd results correlation in the samples and transience during the flow initialisation period these factors are not unique to cfd simulations and proposals for dealing with them in a generic fashion can be found in the statistical literature for example heidelberger and welch 1981 1983 formulated an automated method for identifying initialisation transience and calculating confidence intervals of mean values for simulations exhibiting initial transience and significant autocorrelation heidelberger and welch s method for detecting and removing the initial transient was applied to the probe measurements from the wod 0 case but it was found to be unreliable for these data instead the data is simply eliminated based on visual inspection an example of a typical velocity trace exhibiting initial transience is shown in fig 14 the longest observed initial transient disappeared by t t l τ l 5 where t l l u is a convective time scale data from τ l 5 were eliminated from all probes and all subsequent simulations before statistical analysis was performed this is a shorter warm up period than some authors use and a longer period than others use for example polsky et al 2016 suggested 12 convective time scales while kelly et al 2016 used 2 5 as a rule of thumb and thedin et al 2019b discarded 4 5 convective time scales standard methods for estimating error variance or confidence intervals rely on the assumption that the data from which these values are to be constructed are random samples from a stationary distribution with unknown parameters kreyszig 2006 in this case the velocity samples were recorded at each time step so there is considerable autocorrelation in each time series an example of an autocorrelation function estimate for the raw data from one of the probes is shown in fig 15 the correlation in the signal is large even at a lag of k 800 time steps corresponding to a lag in time of t k 0 04 s estimation of sampling error is not common in the field of cfd the work of oliver et al 2014 being one example oliver et al 2014 adopted a method for estimating the sampling error from dns data accounting for correlation in the data following the example of trenberth 1984 and broerson 2006 the idea for dealing with correlation is to define a decorrelation separation distance t 0 which in turn defines an effective sample size n e f f 6 t 0 1 2 k 1 n 1 1 k n ρ ˆ k and 7 n e f f n t 0 where n is the total sample size and ρ ˆ k is the autocorrelation function estimate for lag k an alternative expression for the decorrelation distance in terms of an estimated spectral density s ˆ at zero frequency is von storch and zwiers 1999 8 t 0 s ˆ 0 σ ˆ n 2 where σ ˆ n 2 is the sample variance and n assumed to be large note that t 0 in both these definitions is non dimensionalised by the physical time step the error variance can then be estimated from the decorrelation separation distance and the sample variance by 9 var ϵ n σ ˆ n 2 t 0 n s ˆ 0 n eqs 6 and 7 are widely used heuristics for analysing correlated time series data they are derived by comparing the variances of correlated and uncorrelated series von storch and zwiers 1999 under the assumption that a correlated series of n samples contains the same information as an uncorrelated series with n e f f samples other expressions for the same concept can be derived by comparing different aspects of correlated and uncorrelated series thiébaux and zwiers 1984 the key difficulty in evaluating eq 6 is the estimate of ρ ˆ k thiébaux and zwiers 1984 compared estimates of the effective sample size based on ρ ˆ k obtained with direct computations from the data fitted autoregressive time series models and a third method utilising an estimate of the spectral density at zero frequency they found that directly computing ρ ˆ k from the data and the definition of the autocorrelation function produced an unreliable estimate which could be somewhat improved by truncating ρ ˆ k the autoregressive model and the spectral techniques were both effective provided a long sample is available and the spectra varied slowly near the origin both of these conditions are met by the data collected here oliver et al 2014 adopted the autoregressive time series approach for their analysis of dns and fitted models to the data using a fairly involved technique a somewhat simpler approach is taken for the spectral estimate relying on the unbiased estimator for the spectral density at the origin developed by heidelberger and welch 1981 results from a truncated direct calculation of ρ ˆ k have also been calculated thiébaux and zwiers 1984 caution against interpreting the effective sample size as the number of degrees of freedom for the purpose of constructing confidence intervals several key assumptions required for the use of student s t distribution in the calculation of confidence intervals are violated by this interpretation valid t statistics can be constructed for correlated series based on the heuristics of eqs 6 and 7 and thiébaux and zwiers 1984 show how although the form of these statistics are dependent on the method used to estimate the autocorrelation function or spectral density fortunately heidelberger and welch 1981 provide an expression for the confidence interval half width based on t statistics that are consistent with their method for estimating s 0 10 d 1 α t m 1 α 2 s ˆ 0 n where α is the desired significance and t m 1 α 2 is the value of a t distribution with m degrees of freedom corresponding to a significance of α s ˆ 0 is heidelberger and welch s estimate of the spectral density at the origin and m is a function of the parameters used to produce this estimate eqs 10 and 11 define the interval which contains e x with likelihood p 1 α 11 conf p x n d p e x x n d p the details of heidelberger and welch s method have been omitted for brevity suffice to say that a polynomial is fitted to the transformed periodogram near the origin and the intercept of this curve at f 0 is taken as an estimate of s 0 two parameters can be varied using this approach the order of the polynomial and the upper limit of the frequency band used to fit the polynomial the second parameter is specified in terms of the number of discrete frequencies used for the fit heidelberger and welch suggest using a second order polynomial fitted across k 50 discrete frequencies for large sample sizes the appropriateness of a second order polynomial for the data generated from the sfs1 was verified by inspecting the form of the transformed spectral density near the origin fig 16 shows the effective sample size and error variance as estimated by four different methods from probe data generated by a 0 wod simulation on the finest grid fig 14 is an example of one of the data sets processed probe 6b the first two methods denoted d 1 and d 2 use a direct calculation of ρ ˆ k truncated at k 1 0 4 and k 2 1 0 4 respectively the second two methods s 1 and s 2 are based on heidelberger and welch s spectral method using k 50 and k 100 discrete frequencies to fit the second order polynomial the higher k 100 was chosen for this test because the sample size in the current study is far larger than the examples presented by heidelberger and welch also shown in fig 16 are the 95 confidence interval half widths from s 1 and s 2 the effective sample size shows considerable variability between methods and this transfers directly to the error variance results in general the direct methods are more conservative in their estimates of the effective sample size and error variance and at some points the estimates are very sensitive to the truncation point chosen the spectral methods exhibit sensitivity in the effective sample size and error variance to the number of discrete frequencies although not to the degree of the direct methods the confidence interval estimates from the spectral methods are quite consistent in comparison and hence are adopted as a means of monitoring convergence in addition to being insensitive to model parameters a good confidence interval estimator should produce similar confidence intervals for independent sample sets of the same length generated from the same distribution provided the sample sets are sufficiently large a second test of the spectral method was performed to check this property the data used to compute the results in fig 16 with initial transience removed was split into two equal size and non overlapping sample sets labelled w 1 for the data in the window 0 n n 2 and w 2 for the data in the window n 2 n n these two sample sets are not completely independent but the correlation around n n 2 is not significant the s 2 method was used to compute confidence interval half widths for both windows and the results of this study are shown in fig 17 the s 2 method is clearly consistent in its predictions for all probes the data presented in figs 16 and 17 show that heidelberger and welch s spectral estimator generates robust and consistent confidence intervals based on these results the s 2 method is recommended for producing valid confidence interval estimates for ship airwake point statistics 4 2 stopping criterion with a good confidence interval estimate the simulation run time can be controlled by placing a stopping criterion on the size of the confidence interval half width this helps to ensure a consistent and quantifiable level of certainty in results by restricting the sampling error to an acceptable level heidelberger and welch 1983 proposed a confidence interval stopping criterion defined by a fraction of the mean this definition works well when the mean is large compared to the variance but for probes located in recirculation zones and velocity components normal to the freestream the mean velocity can be close to zero with large variance in these cases such a stopping criterion is overly restrictive instead the following criterion is proposed 12 d 0 9 max 0 025 x n 0 1 σ ˆ n which has better behaviour in regions with large fluctuations relative to the mean and retains a relevant physical interpretation the significance level and the fractions of the sample mean and standard deviation are chosen to represent an acceptable level of sampling error and can be traded off against simulation time eq 12 is evaluated every 2 1 2 5 n convective time scales after the initialisation period is completed where n 0 1 2 this again follows heidelberger and welch although they chose to evaluate less frequently using 1 5 n instead of 1 2 5 n the convergence times for all probes and velocity components from this procedure are plotted in fig 18 using the data from window w 1 and in fig 19 using the data from window w 2 the initialisation time has been included in these values so that the convergence times represent total simulation time if the data from the two windows are treated as independent realisations of the same process then the procedure should for a large enough sample size produce the same estimated convergence time for both windows overall the procedure is reasonably consistent there is minor variability in the estimated convergence times between the two windows with the exception of probe 2c this highlights the importance of monitoring a number of probes repeating the procedure for 45 and 90 wod angles also produces reasonable convergence times as shown in figs 20 and 21 the shifting distribution of convergence times between the probes reflects the changing characteristics of the airwake with wod angle the final piece of analysis presented to support this procedure is comparison to a common method for analysing temporal convergence of ship airwake data plotting the cumulative mean over time the cumulative means for the simulation until τ l 30 are shown for probes 2c 7b and 6a in figs 22 23 and 24 the cumulative means are overlaid on the raw probe data with the d 0 9 confidence interval plotted at each evaluation time the end of the raw data and the last confidence interval indicate the point at which the stopping criterion is met the results in figs 22 23 and 24 show that the method identifies stopping points where visual inspection would also conclude the mean was converged it is perhaps a little hasty in identifying convergence for the u component at probe 2c and a little conservative for all the components at probe 6a the estimated means for each velocity component at the convergence times indicated in fig 18 are plotted as bars in fig 25 capped error bars are used to indicate the d 0 9 confidence intervals at these convergence times for comparison the velocity component means from the full sampling period of the simulation approximately 60 t l with the initial transient period removed are shown on the same figure as black dots the grey uncapped error bars indicate one standard deviation calculated over the full sampling period the results in fig 25 show that of the 39 probe velocity components monitored 28 are within the d 0 9 confidence interval of the full sample mean when the stopping criterion is met if the probe velocity signals were uncorrelated then around 35 of the velocity component means at the convergence times would be expected to be within the d 0 9 confidence interval of the true mean considering the comparison in fig 25 is made to the full sample mean instead of the true mean and that there is correlation between the signals the performance of the criterion of eq 12 and the confidence interval estimation is quite satisfactory if the convergence time for each of the signals is set to the maximum convergence time indicated in fig 18 instead of the individual signal convergence time then the number of convergence time means within d 0 9 of the full sample means improves to 33 out of 39 this is more indicative of the performance of the method when used to halt a simulation after all monitored signals have met the stopping criterion 4 3 convergence of fluctuating values so far a method for quantitatively assessing the time convergence of mean values has been presented and this method has been used to objectively determine the simulation time required to meet convergence criteria for ship airwake simulations it is not just convergence of the mean that is desired but also of the fluctuating values a similar method could potentially be created for quantitatively assessing the convergence of spectra but for these simulations the observed convergence of the mean appears sufficient to indicate convergence of spectra to an acceptable level this is to be expected as the mean is dependent on the longest wavelengths which are the slowest to converge while the range of interest on the spectrum is at higher frequencies which converge more rapidly due to the larger number of independent samples from these wavelengths converging the mean is therefore likely to be sufficient in general to support this claim the u velocity psd at the probes located over the flight deck in fig 26 as computed using data from windows of varying length are shown very similar results are obtained for all velocity components and for the probes over the superstructure the w 1 and w 2 windows are as defined previously and the w 0 window encompasses the entire signal length the n 4 windows are a set of four non overlapping windows of length n 4 the shaded region indicates the closed loop pilot control band the close agreement with the w 0 spectra indicates that the fluctuating velocities are well converged for the w 1 and w 2 windows which span approximately 30 t l and are reasonably well converged even for the n 4 windows which span approximately 15 t l the convergence times in fig 18 indicate convergence of all probes by τ l 28 which leaves a sampling window of 23 t l once initialisation times are removed given the results in fig 26 the spectra obtained from a window spanning 23 t l would be acceptably converged 5 conclusions the literature on cfd simulations of ship airwakes contains answers to many of the questions that could be asked about the influence of the governing equations turbulence modelling time resolution and accuracy grid resolution inflow conditions simulation length and reynolds number however there is a lack of studies addressing the uncertainty due to finite sample error as well as grid dependence studies that consider convergence of spectra these two shortcomings have been addressed in this paper a statistical method for estimating confidence intervals on the mean of correlated time series data has been adapted and tested on velocity probe data from the sfs1 airwake the estimated confidence intervals are robust and consistent for a range of velocity probe locations and wod angles the stopping criterion defined in eq 12 can be used in conjunction with the estimated confidence intervals to restrict simulation time to the minimum required to meet an quantified level of convergence results from the sfs1 study at three wod angles indicate that a simulation time of approximately 30 to 40 t l is generally required after the initial transient has passed to reach a reasonable level of statistical convergence width of 90 confidence interval less than 2 5 of the mean or 10 of the variance whichever is greater convergence of the mean to this criterion was also found to be sufficient for convergence of the velocity psd in summary recommendations for ship airwake studies based on the sensitivity studies of the sfs1 are an initialisation period of 5 t l a simulation sampling period of at least 30 t l for collection of airwake statistics a time step up to 0 2 t r and a grid resolution equivalent to 0 2 m at full scale to ensure adequate resolution of

investigated in klinger et al 2017 and moving path following problem was discussed in zheng 2020 regardless of developing new designs for autonomous surface vessels there are still a wide variety of open problems in this active field of study one isolated case of these open problems concerns with underactuated fast surface vessels ufsvs these kinds of vehicles have not been studied enough in the literature in fact high speed or fast surface vessels belong to a class of surface vehicles whose actuator dynamics is not negligible function at high speeds and they are highly maneuverable by considering the fact that fast ships suffer from high linear and angular maneuvers large and highly time varying centripetal and coriolis forces and torques are imposed to their body this situation results in a highly nonlinear dynamics for the fast surface vessels which has negative effects like load displacement structural damages and navigation risks on the other side when ships function at high speeds the following serious problems occur that greatly influence on the control system i the resistance increases so rapidly at higher speeds ii the pressure under the hull is decreased that causes the ship to squat which results in increasing wetted surface area and increasing frictional resistance iii the faster moving water increases the viscous resistance on the hull iv there exist an increased possibility of running aground v at high speeds the wavelength increases and the water shipping phenomenon may become more severe that effects the ship s stability benmansour et al 2016 esteban et al 2005 from this perspective each kind of external disturbances waves and winds nonlinearities unmodeled dynamics actuators dynamics and saturation nonlinearities of the actuators have remarkable effects on motions control of these naval vehicles in contrast to the proposed control algorithms in the literature that neglect the dynamics of the actuators and consider a simple dynamic model for marine vehicles designing high performance controllers for ufsvs definitely requires a full dynamic model by taking actuator dynamics into account to obtain an accurate steering system since ufsvs are fast their actuators easily can be saturated that influence their tracking and maneuverability performance dramatically on the other side actuator saturation phenomenon may harm the actuators or may lead to mechanical failure of the actuators so it is of importance to design a control law that can generate limited control signals to prevent actuator saturation the two most important approaches that can prevent the actuator saturation phenomenon are 1 the use of saturation functions like hyperbolic tangent function to bound the amplitude of the tracking errors elhaki and shojaei 2020a and 2 compensating the actuator saturation nonlinearity elhaki and shojaei 2020b an integration of the aforementioned two items leads to a strong saturated tracking controller which is one of the main contributions of this paper from the controller design viewpoint the mathematical development and stability analysis of a saturated controller is a challenging problem via conventional nonlinear control approaches like backstepping and dynamic surface control methods that motivates our research so in order to overcome this defect a new inequality is designed and strongly proved in this paper to manage the stability analysis by the lyapunov stability principle from another point of view external disturbances in kinematics dynamics and actuator subsystems as the unwanted inputs to these subsystems can pervert the desired directions for the kinematics dynamics and actuators accordingly these external disturbances can simply impact the closed loop system negatively and may cause instability of the system eventually therefore designing a robust controller that can deal with kinematic dynamic and actuator disturbances is an important control problem based on the above background the novelties and core contributions of this paper are clearly expressed as follows the trajectory tracking problem of underactuated fast surface vessels including actuator dynamics is addressed for the first time mathematical properties are utilized and developed to deal with challenging problems of the saturated nonlinear controller design hyperbolic tangent function is heuristically involved into the multi loop design procedure of the dynamic surface control method to propose saturated controllers for the kinematic dynamic and actuator models the risk of the vehicle actuators saturation is effectively reduced by compensating the actuator saturation nonlinearity via neural networks by an affective compensation of the actuator saturation nonlinearity and using the hyperbolic tangent function as a saturated stabilizer term the limited input control signals to the actuators are guaranteed projection type adaptive neural networks and saturation type robust controllers are combined to compensate all kinds of uncertainties nn approximation errors external environmental disturbances including waves wind and ocean currents acting on kinematics and dynamics of ufsvs the remainder of this paper is arranged in the following sequence in the next section some initial topics are provided the control design method and its closed loop stability study are given in section 3 computer simulations are performed in section 4 and the final section concludes the paper 2 preliminaries 2 1 surface vessels kinematic and dynamic models consider the following kinematic equations of surface vessels do and pan 2009 fossen 2002 x u cos ψ v sin ψ δ x y u sin ψ v cos ψ δ y 1 ψ r δ ψ where δ x δ y δ ψ ℜ are unknown bounded kinematic disturbances remark 1 the kinematic model of rigid bodies such as ufsvs in this paper is concerned with the physical relation between the robot positions and orientations with its velocities as the inputs therefore the kinematic disturbances δ x δ y and δ ψ in eq 1 are unwanted velocity inputs to the kinematic equation due to the unwanted ocean currents winds and waves that lead to unwanted changes and drifts in the desired position and orientation of the vehicle the kinematic disturbances degrade the automatic controller performance in practice in this respect it is important to consider and compensate the effects of kinematic disturbances that can ruin the controller s performance especially for the case of ufsvs that operate at high speeds such disturbances can easily deflect the desired kinematic motion of these vehicles the complete nonlinear dynamics of ufsvs is given by m 11 u c 13 r d 11 u τ u τ w u m 22 v m 23 r c 23 r d 22 v d 23 r 0 τ w v 2 m 32 v m 33 r c 13 u c 23 v d 32 v d 33 r τ r τ w r

to a vicinity of the origin inside the bounded area this problem will be discussed in the controller design section by designing a robust controller and the corresponding stability analysis will be performed by the lyapunov stability examination 3 control strategy in this section a saturated nonlinear controller is designed based on the dynamic surface control dsc method swaroop et al 2000 to reduce the complexity of the overall control system compared with the traditional backstepping method by using the presented properties and lemmas in section 2 3 the corresponding controller can generate saturated control signals in comparison with the traditional dsc strategy the block diagram of the proposed control system is given in fig 3 finally the stability of the proposed closed loop control system will be examined by the well known lyapunov theory 3 1 error dynamics based on fig 2 the controller should be designed so that the following errors in polar coordinates converge to a

remark 3 actuator dynamics is an inseparable and important part of robotic systems some particular cases of robots operate at high velocity motion and face highly varying loads for example unmanned ufsvs that are studied in this paper in this respect the dynamics of the motors which can be electrical mechanical electromechanical etc should be considered in the controller design method to handle such a high speed motion and extremely varying loads park et al 2009 since ufsvs function at high speeds their actuators dynamics are not negligible and they can be easily saturated due to their high maneuvers and there always exist environmental disturbances for example ocean currents waves winds and etc it is of paramount importance to design a robust steering control system for these naval vehicles with limited inputs to protect their actuators thus to address these important problems we designed a robust saturated multi loop controller for ufsv robotic systems including the actuator dynamics the proposed method has three control loops including the kinematic controller 18 the dynamic controller 31 and the actuator controller 45 these contributions are addressed for the first time and to the authors best knowledge it is the first attempt to deal with the aforesaid problems for ufsvs simultaneously the following update rules are designed for the actuator controller 46 v ˆ proj v

depicted in fig 7 c which are unsaturated and acceptable in the presence of kinematic disturbances and other bounded closed loop variables are shown in figs 7 d 8 therefore simulation results verify the contributions of the proposed method in the presence of actuator saturation and kinematics dynamics and actuators disturbances 4 3 comparative simulation studies in this section different comparative simulations under different conditions are performed to challenge the proposed method and to clarify the innovation of the proposed method 4 3 1 comparative case study 1 comparison with a simplified version of the proposed controller in this case a comparative simulation study is performed between vehicle 1 which is equipped with the proposed controller and vehicle 2 that is equipped with a controller based on the design of the proposed controller without using t a n h function in control laws and without employing actuator nonlinearity compensation technique this simulation aims to show how the new design influences the dsc strategy and verifies contributions and superiority of the proposed design to this end the initial positions of both vehicles are set similar to each other so that q 1 0 q 2 0 40 40 60 π 180 t and the control parameters and the desired trajectory variables are same as scenario 1 simulations are shown in fig 9 vehicle 2 that is equipped with a simple dynamic surface controller fulfilled the tracking mission that is clear in fig 9 a but the generated control signals of vehicle 2 are large saturated and faced the chattering phenomenon in fig 9 b on the other side since t a n h function is employed in the design of the proposed control methodology to improve the traditional dynamic surface control design the control signals of the proposed controller are bounded really well without facing the chattering phenomenon moreover for a precise study between two controllers some quantitative comparisons are performed in tables 1 2 by using the following standard performance index r m s t 1 t f 0 t f t 2 d t is the root mean square of the system variables where t f is the final time where tables 1 2 show the superiority and potential for the proposed control algorithm since the tracking errors z 1 and z 2 and z 3 are well bounded by the proposed control structure smooth low amplitude control inputs are resulted which are clear in tables 1 2 numerically 4 3 2 comparative case study 2 comparison with the controller in shojaei 2015 to investigate the contributions of this research work and to show the advantages of the proposed controller over other proposed controllers a new comparison simulation is performed to this end ufsv 1 is equipped with the proposed controller in this paper and ufsv 2 is equipped with the controller in shojaei 2015 a same large initial condition is set for both vessels as q 1 0 q 2 0 60 40 0 t and the control parameters and the desired trajectory variables are same as scenario 2 simulation results are shown in fig 10 in fig 10 a it is clear that the ufsv 1 equipped with the proposed controller has a much better transient performance than ufsv 2 equipped with the controller in shojaei 2015 which is not able to compensate the effects of kinematic disturbances posture and relative errors are depicted in figs 10 b c respectively the control signals are shown in fig 10 d which implies that ufsv 2 suffers from actuator saturation and chattering phenomenon so it is evident that the novel proposed control framework surpasses other saturated controllers in the literature due to its remarkable capability of generating limited control action this significantly contributes to the existing literature for a more accurate comparison between two vessels a numerical comparison is provided by table 3 4 3 3 comparative case study 3 employing a fast desired trajectory in order to show the contributions of the proposed method a fast desired trajectory is chosen with v d 3 m s and other parameters of the reference trajectory are similar to case 2 to perform the comparative study ufsv 1 is equipped with the proposed controller and ufsv 2 is equipped with controller shojaei 2015 the initial position of the vessels set as q 1 0 q 2 0 20 20 0 t the simulation results are shown in fig 11 as it is clear in fig 11 a the proposed controller has forced ufsv 1 to track the desired trajectory with smooth control signals which are shown in fig 11 d the posture errors converge to zero as well as the relative tracking errors which are illustrated in figs 11 b and 11 c however ufsv 2 equipped with the controller in shojaei 2015 failed to track the desired trajectory which is clear in fig 11 this failure happened for ufsv 2 because the controller of shojaei 2015 is not basically designed for high speed trajectory tracking missions and the actuator dynamics is not considered in the controller of shojaei 2015 in the controller design procedure 4 3 4 comparative case study 4 considering time varying centripetal and coriolis forces and torques with time varying damping in the last simulation not only the fast desired trajectory is considered but also the variations of the ufsvs nonlinearities are examined during the simulation the following changes for both ufsvs are taken into account to investigate the performance of the both controllers with varying uncertainties and nonlinearities m 11 t m 11 δ m 11 t m 22 t m 22 δ m 22 t m 33 t m 33 δ m 33 t m 23 t m 32 t m 32 δ m 32 t d 11 t d 11 δ d 11 t d 22 t d 22 δ d 22 t d 33 t d 33 δ d 33 t d 23 t d 23 δ d 23 t d 32 t d 32 δ d 32 t where δ m 11 t 3 2 sin 0 5 t π 3 δ m 22 t 3 cos t δ m 33 t sin 2 t π 2 δ m 32 t 0 5 cos 0 75 t π 6 δ d 11 t 0 2 sin 0 5 t π 3 δ d 22 t 0 5 cos t δ d 33 t 0 3 sin 2 t π 2 δ d 23 t δ d 32 t 0 1 cos 0 75 t π 6 and the other dynamic parameters are same as section 4 1 these changes can be considered as linear and angular maneuvers that lead to high time varying centripetal and coriolis forces and torques to the vessel body as reflected in fig 12 the proposed controller is capable of tracking the fast desired trajectory with time varying nonlinearities however controller shojaei 2015 is unstable facing a fast desired trajectory and time varying nonlinearities since the dynamics of the actuators is considered in the control design procedure ufsv 1 equipped with the proposed controller can perform the fast trajectory tracking mission with time varying uncertainties which was stated in remark 3 therefore this study clarifies the significance of the proposed methodology which strongly contributes to the existing literature 5 conclusion in this paper a successful tracking controller was proposed for fast surface vessels subjected to kinematic dynamic and actuator disturbances and actuator saturation the performance of the dynamic surface control approach was improved by applying hyperbolic tangent function at every step in the design procedure furthermore to ameliorate the closed loop performance adaptive projection type neural networks and robust controllers were employed uncertain system dynamics and external disturbances were compensated at the same time during the tracking mission lyapunov stability examination was taken into consideration for stability of the entire closed loop system and simulations were performed to illustrate the

can be bounded in a part of the workspace such that z b z in a compact set ω z where ω z ℜ n ω z z z b z z ω z and b z ℜ is a constant by expanding λ min k t a n h z 2 using taylor series expansion one has a 1 λ min k t a n h z 2 λ min k z o z 2 e o z z ω z where o z is the vector of higher order terms in taylor series expansion and e o z is the expansion error due to the drift between taylor series expansion and t a n h function which can be bounded over the compact set ω z so that e o z b e o z b e o z ℜ now eq a 1 is rewritten as follows a 2 λ min k z o z 2 e o z λ min k z o z t z o z e o z by employing vector multiplication one arrives at a 3 λ min k z o z t z o z e o z λ min k z t z 2 z t o z o z t o z e o z λ min k z o z t z o z e o z λ min k z 2 2 λ min k z t o z λ min k o z 2 e o z since z b z in the compact set ω z then o z z o next one has a 4 2 λ min k z t o z z 1 2 z 2 λ min k o 2 1 2 z 2 b h finally by considering that e o z is upper bounded in the compact set ω z so that e o z b e o z b e o z ℜ and the fact that λ min k o z 2 0 one has a 5 λ min k t a n h z 2 λ min k z o z t z o z e o z λ min k 1 2 z 2 b e o z b h and the proof is finished at this point remark a 1 a related point to be considered is that from the control viewpoint although b e o z and b h increase the final bound in the lyapunov function the term λ min k o z 2 in a 3 confronts with increasing the final bound in the lyapunov function on the other side since λ min k o z 2 0 it can be ignored during the stability examination in the lyapunov function

investigated in klinger et al 2017 and moving path following problem was discussed in zheng 2020 regardless of developing new designs for autonomous surface vessels there are still a wide variety of open problems in this active field of study one isolated case of these open problems concerns with underactuated fast surface vessels ufsvs these kinds of vehicles have not been studied enough in the literature in fact high speed or fast surface vessels belong to a class of surface vehicles whose actuator dynamics is not negligible function at high speeds and they are highly maneuverable by considering the fact that fast ships suffer from high linear and angular maneuvers large and highly time varying centripetal and coriolis forces and torques are imposed to their body this situation results in a highly nonlinear dynamics for the fast surface vessels which has negative effects like load displacement structural damages and navigation risks on the other side when ships function at high speeds the following serious problems occur that greatly influence on the control system i the resistance increases so rapidly at higher speeds ii the pressure under the hull is decreased that causes the ship to squat which results in increasing wetted surface area and increasing frictional resistance iii the faster moving water increases the viscous resistance on the hull iv there exist an increased possibility of running aground v at high speeds the wavelength increases and the water shipping phenomenon may become more severe that effects the ship s stability benmansour et al 2016 esteban et al 2005 from this perspective each kind of external disturbances waves and winds nonlinearities unmodeled dynamics actuators dynamics and saturation nonlinearities of the actuators have remarkable effects on motions control of these naval vehicles in contrast to the proposed control algorithms in the literature that neglect the dynamics of the actuators and consider a simple dynamic model for marine vehicles designing high performance controllers for ufsvs definitely requires a full dynamic model by taking actuator dynamics into account to obtain an accurate steering system since ufsvs are fast their actuators easily can be saturated that influence their tracking and maneuverability performance dramatically on the other side actuator saturation phenomenon may harm the actuators or may lead to mechanical failure of the actuators so it is of importance to design a control law that can generate limited control signals to prevent actuator saturation the two most important approaches that can prevent the actuator saturation phenomenon are 1 the use of saturation functions like hyperbolic tangent function to bound the amplitude of the tracking errors elhaki and shojaei 2020a and 2 compensating the actuator saturation nonlinearity elhaki and shojaei 2020b an integration of the aforementioned two items leads to a strong saturated tracking controller which is one of the main contributions of this paper from the controller design viewpoint the mathematical development and stability analysis of a saturated controller is a challenging problem via conventional nonlinear control approaches like backstepping and dynamic surface control methods that motivates our research so in order to overcome this defect a new inequality is designed and strongly proved in this paper to manage the stability analysis by the lyapunov stability principle from another point of view external disturbances in kinematics dynamics and actuator subsystems as the unwanted inputs to these subsystems can pervert the desired directions for the kinematics dynamics and actuators accordingly these external disturbances can simply impact the closed loop system negatively and may cause instability of the system eventually therefore designing a robust controller that can deal with kinematic dynamic and actuator disturbances is an important control problem based on the above background the novelties and core contributions of this paper are clearly expressed as follows the trajectory tracking problem of underactuated fast surface vessels including actuator dynamics is addressed for the first time mathematical properties are utilized and developed to deal with challenging problems of the saturated nonlinear controller design hyperbolic tangent function is heuristically involved into the multi loop design procedure of the dynamic surface control method to propose saturated controllers for the kinematic dynamic and actuator models the risk of the vehicle actuators saturation is effectively reduced by compensating the actuator saturation nonlinearity via neural networks by an affective compensation of the actuator saturation nonlinearity and using the hyperbolic tangent function as a saturated stabilizer term the limited input control signals to the actuators are guaranteed projection type adaptive neural networks and saturation type robust controllers are combined to compensate all kinds of uncertainties nn approximation errors external environmental disturbances including waves wind and ocean currents acting on kinematics and dynamics of ufsvs the remainder of this paper is arranged in the following sequence in the next section some initial topics are provided the control design method and its closed loop stability study are given in section 3 computer simulations are performed in section 4 and the final section concludes the paper 2 preliminaries 2 1 surface vessels kinematic and dynamic models consider the following kinematic equations of surface vessels do and pan 2009 fossen 2002 x u cos ψ v sin ψ δ x y u sin ψ v cos ψ δ y 1 ψ r δ ψ where δ x δ y δ ψ ℜ are unknown bounded kinematic disturbances remark 1 the kinematic model of rigid bodies such as ufsvs in this paper is concerned with the physical relation between the robot positions and orientations with its velocities as the inputs therefore the kinematic disturbances δ x δ y and δ ψ in eq 1 are unwanted velocity inputs to the kinematic equation due to the unwanted ocean currents winds and waves that lead to unwanted changes and drifts in the desired position and orientation of the vehicle the kinematic disturbances degrade the automatic controller performance in practice in this respect it is important to consider and compensate the effects of kinematic disturbances that can ruin the controller s performance especially for the case of ufsvs that operate at high speeds such disturbances can easily deflect the desired kinematic motion of these vehicles the complete nonlinear dynamics of ufsvs is given by m 11 u c 13 r d 11 u τ u τ w u m 22 v m 23 r c 23 r d 22 v d 23 r 0 τ w v 2 m 32 v m 33 r c 13 u c 23 v d 32 v d 33 r τ r τ w r where q x y ψ t is the vector of vehicle coordinates ν t u v r t stands for the vector of system velocities m 11 m 22 m 23 m 32 and m 33 are the inertia parameters of the vessel including the mass c

5 χ s i sign χ a i χ m i χ a i χ m i i 1 2 m i χ a i χ a i χ m i where χ s χ a and χ m denote the vectors of saturated control inputs non saturated control inputs and maximum limit of the actuators respectively and the variable m i is a proportion between χ s i and χ a i the vector of saturation nonlinearity d s χ a χ s χ a that cannot be tolerated by the actuators is defined as follows gao and selmic 2006 6 d s i sign χ a i χ m i χ a i χ a i χ m i i 1 2 m i 1 χ a i χ a i χ m i consequently eq 4 can be rewritten as 7 τ b τ 1 τ ψ χ a ψ d s χ a τ d2 where the term ψ d s χ a can be compensated

z z b z 8 λ min k t a n h z 2 λ min k 0 5 z 2 b e o z b h z ω z where z is a variable vector in the workspace and b e o z and b h are positive upper bounds proof see appendix remark 2 as a side note since it is assumed that z is bounded in a section of the workspace inside the compact set ω z it can be easily guaranteed that the closed loop system is also stable and the tracking errors converge to a vicinity of the origin inside the bounded area this problem will be discussed in the controller design section by designing a robust controller and the corresponding stability analysis will be performed by the lyapunov stability examination 3 control strategy in this section a saturated nonlinear controller is designed based on the dynamic surface control dsc method swaroop et al 2000 to reduce the complexity of the overall control system compared with the traditional backstepping method by using the presented properties and lemmas in section 2 3 the corresponding controller can generate saturated control signals in comparison with the traditional dsc strategy the block diagram of the proposed control system is given in fig 3 finally the stability of the proposed closed loop control system will be examined by the well known lyapunov theory 3 1 error dynamics based on fig 2 the controller should be designed so that the following errors in polar coordinates converge to a neighborhood of the origin 9 ρ t x e 2 t y e 2 t ψ e t ψ d t ψ t where x e t x d t x t y e t y d t y t and ψ e t ψ d t ψ t according to fig 2 the following relations are employed 10 x e t ρ t cos ψ d

remark 3 actuator dynamics is an inseparable and important part of robotic systems some particular cases of robots operate at high velocity motion and face highly varying loads for example unmanned ufsvs that are studied in this paper in this respect the dynamics of the motors which can be electrical mechanical electromechanical etc should be considered in the controller design method to handle such a high speed motion and extremely varying loads park et al 2009 since ufsvs function at high speeds their actuators dynamics are not negligible and they can be easily saturated due to their high maneuvers and there always exist environmental disturbances for example ocean currents waves winds and etc it is of paramount importance to design a robust steering control system for these naval vehicles with limited inputs to protect their actuators thus to address these important problems we designed a robust saturated multi loop controller for ufsv robotic systems including the actuator dynamics the proposed method has three control loops including the kinematic controller 18 the dynamic controller 31 and the actuator controller 45 these contributions are addressed for the first time and to the authors best knowledge it is the first attempt to deal with the aforesaid problems for ufsvs simultaneously the following update rules are designed for the actuator controller 46 v ˆ proj v

e c x 2 θ c e t λ u θ by solving 56 along 51 one obtains that 57 e t λ u θ c e t 0 λ u θ c e c t λ u where 57 implies that e t max e t 0 λ u θ c as t accordingly from 51 and 57 one may find that e t

ultimately bounded so the tracking errors nn weight matrices errors system error variables and the disturbances upper bound approximation errors are uub i e x l therefore by employing assumptions 3

finished here theorem 2 the sway dynamics in the second equation of 2 is passive bounded proof form the results of theorem 1 we have u u r r u u r r where u r u r ℜ and from section 2 1 it is assumed that the dynamic disturbances are also bounded so that τ w i b i i u v r now by using 2 one has 59 m 22 v m 23 r c 23 r d 22 v d 23 r τ w v 60 v d 22 m 22 v d v where d v m 23 r c 23 r d 23 r b v m 22

bounded by the virtual controllers 18 31 and the actual controller 45 with the adaptive laws 19 32 33 46 and 47 the proof is completed here 4 simulations to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed

condition of the vessel is q 0 40 40 60 π 180 t simulation results are shown in figs 4 6 fig 4 a implies that the surface vessel tracked the desired trajectory well and fig 4 b shows that the tracking errors ρ and ψ e converged to a vicinity of zero smoothly actual input control signal χ a is plotted in fig 5 a that is well bounded and acceptable and evolved within the actuator limits other bounded system signals are depicted in fig 5 b c and d in fig 6 a it is shown that the piston movement errors have converged to a vicinity of origin and in fig 6 b the bounded norms of errors z 1 z 2 and z 3

depicted in fig 7 c which are unsaturated and acceptable in the presence of kinematic disturbances and other bounded closed loop variables are shown in figs 7 d 8 therefore simulation results verify the contributions of the proposed method in the presence of actuator saturation and kinematics dynamics and actuators disturbances 4 3 comparative simulation studies in this section different comparative simulations under different conditions are performed to challenge the proposed method and to clarify the innovation of the proposed method 4 3 1 comparative case study 1 comparison with a simplified version of the proposed controller in this case a comparative simulation study is performed between vehicle 1 which is equipped with the proposed controller and vehicle 2 that is equipped with a controller based on the design of the proposed controller without using t a n h function in control laws and without employing actuator nonlinearity compensation technique this simulation aims to show how the new design influences the dsc strategy and verifies contributions and superiority of the proposed design to this end the initial positions of both vehicles are set similar to each other so that q 1 0 q 2 0 40 40 60 π 180 t and the control parameters and the desired trajectory variables are same as scenario 1 simulations are shown in fig 9 vehicle 2 that is equipped with a simple dynamic surface controller fulfilled the tracking mission that is clear in fig 9 a but the generated control signals of vehicle 2 are large saturated and faced the chattering phenomenon in fig 9 b on the other side since t a n h function is employed in the design of the proposed control methodology to improve the traditional dynamic surface control design the control signals of the proposed controller are bounded really well without facing the chattering phenomenon moreover for a precise study between two controllers some quantitative comparisons are performed in tables 1 2 by using the following standard performance index r m s t 1 t f 0 t f t 2 d t is the root mean square of the system variables where t f is the final time where tables 1 2 show the superiority and potential for the proposed control algorithm since the tracking errors z 1 and z 2 and z 3 are well bounded by the proposed control structure smooth low amplitude control inputs are resulted which are clear in tables 1 2 numerically 4 3 2 comparative case study 2 comparison with the controller in shojaei 2015 to investigate the contributions of this research work and to show the advantages of the proposed controller over other proposed controllers a new comparison simulation is performed to this end ufsv 1 is equipped with the proposed controller in this paper and ufsv 2 is equipped with the controller in shojaei 2015 a same large initial condition is set for both vessels as q 1 0 q 2 0 60 40 0 t and the control parameters and the desired trajectory variables are same as scenario 2 simulation results are shown in fig 10 in fig 10 a it is clear that the ufsv 1 equipped with the proposed controller has a much better transient performance than ufsv 2 equipped with the controller in shojaei 2015 which is not able to compensate the effects of kinematic disturbances posture and relative errors are depicted in figs 10 b c respectively the control signals are shown in fig 10 d which implies that ufsv 2 suffers from actuator saturation and chattering phenomenon so it is evident that the novel proposed control framework surpasses other saturated controllers in the literature due to its remarkable capability of generating limited control action this significantly contributes to the existing literature for a more accurate comparison between two vessels a numerical comparison is provided by table 3 4 3 3 comparative case study 3 employing a fast desired trajectory in order to show the contributions of the proposed method a fast desired trajectory is chosen with v d 3 m s and other parameters of the reference trajectory are similar to case 2 to perform the comparative study ufsv 1 is equipped with the proposed controller and ufsv 2 is equipped with controller shojaei 2015 the initial position of the vessels set as q 1 0 q 2 0 20 20 0 t the simulation results are shown in fig 11 as it is clear in fig 11 a the proposed controller has forced ufsv 1 to track the desired trajectory with smooth control signals which are shown in fig 11 d the posture errors converge to zero as well as the relative tracking errors which are illustrated in figs 11 b and 11 c however ufsv 2 equipped with the controller in shojaei 2015 failed to track the desired trajectory which is clear in fig 11 this failure happened for ufsv 2 because the controller of shojaei 2015 is not basically designed for high speed trajectory tracking missions and the actuator dynamics is not considered in the controller of shojaei 2015 in the controller design procedure 4 3 4 comparative case study 4 considering time varying centripetal and coriolis forces and torques with time varying damping in the last simulation not only the fast desired trajectory is considered but also the variations of the ufsvs nonlinearities are examined during the simulation the following changes for both ufsvs are taken into account to investigate the performance of the both controllers with varying uncertainties and nonlinearities m 11 t m 11 δ m 11 t m 22 t m 22 δ m 22 t m 33 t m 33 δ m 33 t m 23 t m 32 t m 32 δ m 32 t d 11 t d 11 δ d 11 t d 22 t d 22 δ d 22 t d 33 t d 33 δ d 33 t d 23 t d 23 δ d 23 t d 32 t d 32 δ d 32 t where δ m 11 t 3 2 sin 0 5 t π 3 δ m 22 t 3 cos t δ m 33 t sin 2 t π 2 δ m 32 t 0 5 cos 0 75 t π 6 δ d 11 t 0 2 sin 0 5 t π 3 δ d 22 t 0 5 cos t δ d 33 t 0 3 sin 2 t π 2 δ d 23 t δ d 32 t 0 1 cos 0 75 t π 6 and the other dynamic parameters are same as section 4 1 these changes can be considered as linear and angular maneuvers that lead to high time varying centripetal and coriolis forces and torques to the vessel body as reflected in fig 12 the proposed controller is capable of tracking the fast desired trajectory with time varying nonlinearities however controller shojaei 2015 is unstable facing a fast desired trajectory and time varying nonlinearities since the dynamics of the actuators is considered in the control design procedure ufsv 1 equipped with the proposed controller can perform the fast trajectory tracking mission with time varying uncertainties which was stated in remark 3 therefore this study clarifies the significance of the proposed methodology which strongly contributes to the existing literature 5 conclusion in this paper a successful tracking controller was proposed for fast surface vessels subjected to kinematic dynamic and actuator disturbances and actuator saturation the performance of the dynamic surface control approach was improved by applying hyperbolic tangent function at every step in the design procedure furthermore to ameliorate the closed loop performance adaptive projection type neural networks and robust controllers were employed uncertain system dynamics and external disturbances were compensated at the same time during the tracking mission lyapunov stability examination was taken into consideration for stability of the entire closed loop system and simulations were performed to illustrate the

can be bounded in a part of the workspace such that z b z in a compact set ω z where ω z ℜ n ω z z z b z z ω z and b z ℜ is a constant by expanding λ min k t a n h z 2 using taylor series expansion one has a 1 λ min k t a n h z 2 λ min k z o z 2 e o z z ω z where o z is the vector of higher order terms in taylor series expansion and e o z is the expansion error due to the drift between taylor series expansion and t a n h function which can be bounded over the compact set ω z so that e o z b e o z b e o z ℜ now eq a 1 is rewritten as follows a 2 λ min k z o z 2 e o z λ min k z o z t z o z e o z by employing vector multiplication one arrives at a 3 λ min k z o z t z o z e o z λ min k z t z 2 z t o z o z t o z e o z λ min k z o z t z o z e o z λ min k z 2 2 λ min k z t o z λ min k o z 2 e o z since z b z in the compact set ω z then o z z o next one has a 4 2 λ min k z t o z z 1 2 z 2 λ min k o 2 1 2 z 2 b h finally by considering that e o z is upper bounded in the compact set ω z so that e o z b e o z b e o z ℜ and the fact that λ min k o z 2 0 one has a 5 λ min k t a n h z 2 λ min k z o z t z o z e o z λ min k 1 2 z 2 b e o z b h and the proof is finished at this point remark a 1 a related point to be considered is that from the control viewpoint although b e o z and b h increase the final bound in the lyapunov function the term λ min k o z 2 in a 3 confronts with increasing the final bound in the lyapunov function on the other side since λ min k o z 2 0 it can be ignored during the stability examination in the lyapunov function

hung and kim 2012 zhou et al 2013 2016 zou et al 2018 the young s modulus of soil is set to be 500 s u while the young s modulus of steel is 220 gpa considering the difference between young s modulus of clay and steel the caisson can be treated as a rigid body the soil domain is set to be 10d in horizontal and vertical directions to avoid the influence of boundary effect to the modelling results 2

025 d is adopted for the skirt and the soil around the caisson following a convergence study all the free surfaces are restrained by displacement boundary except the top surface i e the facade of the soil cylinder is fixed in lateral direction and the bottom surface is fixed in all three degree of freedom as mentioned above considering the suction force during the installation following previous studies bransby and yun 2009 hung and kim 2014 taiebat and carter 2000 vulpe et al 2013 yun and bransby 2007a 2007b zou et al 2018 the soil foundation interface is assumed to be fully rough i e bonded contact where no detachment is allowed such an interface helps to improve the simulation stability despite it would lead to unconservative evaluations of bearing capacities nevertheless it is to note that if cracks occur accidently the bearing capacity reported in this study would be weaken however gaps along the soil skirt interface are not expected to form in layered uniform soft clays vulpe 2015 2 3 loading methods all the external loads are applied through a reference point rp that located at the central bottom of the skirt this is the typical rp for modelling the behavior of shallow foundations i e skirted foundations and skirted spudcan foundations cassidy et al 2004 vulpe et al 2013 which was proven to be suitable for capturing the bearing capacities of skirted foundations gourvenec and barnett 2011 hung and kim 2014 vulpe 2015 based on comparative studies between the rp locations at the skirt tip and the bottom of the top plate it is found that the rp location has no effect on vertical and moment bearing capacities but only slight influence on the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity within 7 for uniaxial and combined loadings v h m v h v m and h m displacement controlled probes are exerted directly on it for a general inclined loading v h m two steps are conducted i e i applying the vertical load using force method which is defined as a proportion the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of 0 5v 0 0 75v 0 and 0 9v 0 and ii applying the horizontal displacement u and rotational displacement θ to the rp the displacement controlled loading method which increases the displacement at a fixed displacement ratio e g u dθ constant is employed for the application of horizontal and rotational displacements the failure envelope of the caisson in different soil conditions could be obtained by numerically modelling different loading conditions with different combination of vertical loading horizontal and rotational displacements 2 4 validation the ultimate bearing capacities of caissons are determined by the tangent intersection method al mhaidib 2006 hung and kim 2014 as shown in fig 3 a load displacement curve is drawn with two tangential lines along its initial and final portions the load corresponding to the intersection point is regarded as the ultimate bearing capacity of the foundation the above generated numerical model is validated with previous analyses results and experimental data as listed at group ⅰ in table 2 as shown in fig 4 a the results form hung and kim 2014 for combined v h results dash lines is numerically modelled solid lines with kd s um 2 and s um 6 25 kpa a reasonably close match can be found to further validate the current numerical approach yun and bransby 2007a s centrifuge test on the undrained bearing capacity of skirted strip foundations in normally consolidated clay is also employed and compared it is worth noting that despite this test was for skirted strip foundations rather than circular skirted foundation the numerical modelling method have much similarity rough interaction and no detachment was allowed etc so the results are still believed to give good indication a comparison of the vertical bearing capacities from the centrifuge test and numerical modelling in this study is plotted in fig 4 b it can be found that the numerical model could reasonably predict the bearing capacity of the foundation as that in the centrifuge test with an acceptable error the difference can be attributed to that the real soil properties from t bar tests used in the experiment was not coincident with s u kz k 1 1 kpa m and z is the depth from the mudline at the shallow layer the above validation studies demonstrate that the numerical modelling method used in this study could reasonably capture the behavior of caissons in clays with accurate prediction of its bearing capacity it is therefore used for the following parametric study 3 results and discussion parametric analyses are performed with varying ⅰ the ratio of the skirt length to the caisson diameter i e the embedment ratio d d ⅱ the ratio of the thickness of top layer to the caisson diameter t t d ⅲ the ratio of the shear strength of the stiff layer to the shear strength of the soft layer s u t s u b and ⅳ the mobilization of vertical loads v v 0 3 1 uniaxial bearing capacities in general for foundations in stiff over soft clay more soils are mobilized which provides the bearing capacities because of the presence of the top stiff clay the differences between soil flow in the situations with and without the upper stiff layer at yield points under vertical horizontal and moment loadings are shown in fig 5 a 5 b and 5 c respectively apparently in stiff over soft clay almost all soils under the caisson in the upper layer are pushed downwards while in uniform clay only soils trapped in the caisson and a few soils beneath the skirt tip are motivated the difference of the range of mobilized soil could be observed in the contour plots which clearly indicates the failure surfaces as shown in fig 5 a for horizontal bearing capacity the soil flows in the stiff layer and in the soft layer are different at the interface and soils around the skirt tip flow back which could be observed distinctly in the contour plots nonetheless without the stiff clay layer no such phenomenon could be found meanwhile the rotation center moves up which means that the upper soil also contributes to resisting the horizontal load as shown in fig 5 b similar soil flows can be found in fig 5 c for the foundation in uniform clay and stiff over soft clay subjected to moment loads with lower rotation centers compared to those for horizontal loads fig 5 d summarizes the remarkable increment of uniaxial bearing capacities 3 1 1 uniaxial bearing capacities in uniform clay a series of analyses with skirt length varying from 0 25d to 1 0d are conducted to quantify the uniaxial bearing capacity of foundation in uniform clay fig 6 shows the bearing capacity under different d d ratio where previous results by hung and kim 2014 are also included for comparison which are found consistent the values v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 refer to normalized ultimate bearing capacity i e v 0 tt 0 v 0 tt 0 as u b h 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 as u b m 0 tt 0 m 0 tt 0 as u b where v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 represent the ultimate limit state under uniaxial vertical horizontal and moment loadings and the cross section area a πd 2 4 it could be found that the curve of v 0 tt 0 is well bracketed by the upper and lower bounds reported by martin 2001 the trend of v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 m 0 tt 0 could be expressed by 1 v 0 tt 0 2 58 d d 2 9 66 d d 6 62 2 h 0 tt 0 4 82 d d 1 86 3 m 0 tt 0 2 6 d d 2 0 1 d d 0 9 3 1 2 effect of s u t s u b t t d and d d on uniaxial bearing capacities to explore the uniaxial bearing capacity of caissons in stiff over soft clay a series of analyses are conducted the variables are the thickness ratio of upper layer t t d and the skirt length ratio d d both of which varied between 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 and s u t s u b is defined to be 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 group ⅱ in table 2 fig 7 shows the bearing capacity of the foundation from which it can be found that the ultimate bearing capacities grow with increasing t t d d d and s u t s u b for the vertical bearing capacity the failure envelops are approximately linear however failure envelopes of horizontal and moment bearing capacities could be divided into two stages i e an increasing stage and a constant stage the partition of the two stages represent the depth of the affected range and the constant stage represent the maximum resistance provided by the top stiff layer as shown in fig 7 b and 7 c the affected range is irrelevant to the shear strength ratio s u t s u b therefore the depth of the affected range is a function of d d and t t d data points of horizontal and moment bearing capacities with s u t s u b 4 1 are integrated into two single envelopes in fig 8 b and 8 c only the increasing segments are plotted to reveal the depth of affected range the values of h 0 and m 0 for various t t d and d d are normalized by the corresponding h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 and then plotted against x t t d d d α unique trends can be observed where h 0 and m 0 are the ultimate normalized vertical bearing capacity in stiff over soft clay and h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 are the ultimate normalized bearing capacity in uniform clay these two unique trends could be expressed by 4 h 0 h o t t 0 1 84 x 3 4 08 x 2 0 125 x 1 x 2 4 178 x 2 where x t t d d d 0 75 for horizontal bearing capacity and 5 m 0 m 0 t t 0 0 43 x 2 1 96 x 1 x 1 16 3 84 x 1 16 where x t t d d d 0 45 for moment bearing capacity these two expressions reveal the depth of ranges affected by horizontal and moment loads 3 1 3 approximate expression of uniaxial bearing capacity the increments of the normalized uniaxial bearing capacities caused by the top stiff clay are presented as amplification factors defined as η of the normalized bearing capacity with the absence of the upper layer typical results of η under vertical horizontal and moment loads are shown in fig 9 a 9 b and 9 c respectively in general these curves emanate from the point of s u t s u b 1 η 1 which refers to the bearing capacities with the absence of the top stiff layer the factor grows linearly with the increase of s u t s u b under an identical combination of d d and t t d both d d and t t d contribute to the increments of bearing capacities η under vertical horizontal and moment loads could be concluded as below 6 η v v 0 v 0 t t 0 a v s u t s u b b v where a v 0 324 d d 0 367 t t d 0 97 and b v 0 85 0 41 d d 0 3 d d 2 0 18 t t d 0 08 t t d 2 for vertical bearing capacities and 7 η h h 0 h 0 t t 0 a h d d s u t s u b b h t t d 1 where a h 3 03 4 06 d d 1 91 d d 2 0 15 t t d and b h 2 76 3 23 d d 1 4 d d 2 0 22 t t d for horizontal bearing capacities and 8 η m m m 0 a t t d s u t s u b b t t d 1 where a m 1 37 0 67 d d 0 03 t t d and b m 1 48 0 78 d d 0 01 t t d for moment bearing capacities with these curves the uniaxial bearing capacities of caissons in stiff over soft clay expressed as functions of s u t s u b d d and t t d can be obtained by multiplying η and the bearing capacities of caissons in uniform clay following investigations are based on the results above 3 2 bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains previous studies supachawarote et al 2005 zou et al 2018 show that the swipe tests proposed by tan 1990 may seriously underestimate the bearing capacities therefore in this study the probe tests are employed to determine the failure envelopes in the v h v m and v h m spaces 3 2 1 effect of s u t s u b t t d and d d to examine the effect of soil properties on the bearing capacities of caissons a series of numerical modelling with varying s u t s u b at 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 as well as d d and t t d varying between 0 25 and 1 0 as group ⅲ in table 2 are conducted with consideration of the affected range x in equations 4 and 5 fig 10 shows typical results of dimensionless v h and v m bearing capacities with various s u t s u b d d and t t d apparently the failure envelopes in each figure are practically parallel and irrespective with s u t s u b d d and t t d similar results are reported by other researchers gourvenec and barnett 2011 hung and kim 2014 caissons subjected in normally consolidated clay in general a thin upper stiff clay has a little effect on the ultimate bearing capacities as the failure envelopes in both the v h and v m spaces expand marginally when t t d 0 25 see fig 10 c and 10 d where the star markers indicate the ultimate capacities in uniform clay however when the upper layer is thick enough i e t t d 0 25 the failure envelopes expend rapidly with the increase of t t d zou et al 2018 reported similar findings for caissons in sand over clay soil conditions in other words the shapes of the normalized failure envelopes in the v h and v m domains are unique and insensitive to s u t s u b t t d and d d while the absolute values are controlled by the uniaxial bearing capacities with relative s u t s u b t t d and d d 3 2 2 approximate expression of the v h and v m capacities to calculate the coupled bearing capacities it is necessary to generate a normalized failure envelope it is worth noting that the normalize here refers to the ratio of the bearing capacities in probe tests to the relative ultimate uniaxial bearing capacities the normalized bearing capacities in the v h v m domains are depicted in fig 11 a and 11 b respectively unique trends irrespective to the shear strength ratio the embedment ratio and the thickness ratio of the upper layer could be seen which could be approximated by 9 h h 0 v v 0 v v 0 v v 0 2 6 0 6 10 m m 0 v v 0 v v 0 v v 0 3 0 7 the exponential constants i e 2 6 and 0 6 for equation 9 3 and 0 7 for equation 10 show the coupling effects of the vertical load on the horizontal and moment loads as the exponential constants of the v m function are larger than those in the v h function it could be concluded that the vertical load is more relevant on the moment than on the horizontal load it is to note that in fig 11 a and 11 b the normalized failure envelopes of caissons in normally consolidated clay reported by hung and kim 2014 also agree well with the approximated expressions derived above in design multiplying equations 9 and 10 with relative v 0 h 0 and m 0 could estimate the failure envelopes of caissons in the v h and v m spaces 3 3 bearing capacity in the v h m domain 3 3 1 effect of v v 0 s u t s u b t t d and d d to quantify the influences of the vertical load soil properties thickness ratios of upper layer and skirt length ratios on the bearing capacity in the v h m domain a series of fe tests are conducted group ⅴ in table 2 fig 12 a shows the effect of soil properties on the bearing capacities in the v h m domain with varying s u t s u b being similar to the bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains the failure envelopes are basically the same shape but different in asymptotes therefore it could be concluded that soil properties have little influence on the shape of the normalized bearing capacities of foundation in the v h m domain as depicted in fig 12 b in the h m domain the growth rate of the peak bearing capacity gradually decreases given a constant d d the peak bearing capacities increase as the upper layer clay becomes thicker analogously a thin layer of top stiff clay makes less contribution to the resistance but it will dominate the bearing capacities when it is thick enough fig 12 c presents the effect of vertical load on the bearing capacities in the h m domain failure envelopes shrink with the increase of the vertical load which reduces more severely when vertical loads are larger than 0 5v 0 similar observations were also reported by gourvenec 2011 3 3 2 approximate expression of bearing capacity in the v h m domain to estimate the bearing capacities in the v h m domain more conveniently failure envelopes are normalized by the corresponding h 0 and m 0 as shown in fig 13 the normalized envelopes are basically overlapped but with higher vertical mobilization a slightly larger failure envelope could be obtained similar findings were reported for caissons in normally consolidated clay by hung and kim 2014 and caissons in sand over clay by zou et al 2018 gourvenec 2011 proposed the following equation to represent the bearing capacity of foundation in the v h m domain 11 h α m α 2 β h m 1 where α and β are parameters depending on d d t t d and v v 0 based on the numerical results in this study constants for skirt foundation in stiff over soft clay are derived and tabulated in table 3 which can be used to depict the failure envelope of caissons in the v h m domain fig 14 depicts the normalized horizontal load and moment bearing capacities against the normalized vertical load the mobilization of the vertical load is set at 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 0 9 these two figures are can be expressed by 12 h 0 h 0 v 0 0 1 1 exp 8 34 0 36 v v 0 13 m 0 m 0 v 0 0 1 1 exp 10 03 0 27 v v 0 4 empirical design procedure to estimate the bearing capacities of caissons embedded in stiff over soft clays a suggested empirical design procedure is outlined here as shown in fig 15 this procedure is mainly based on parameters as d d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and t t d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 in practice the undrained shear strength of soft marine clay is about 5 kpa 20 kpa gourvenec et al 2009 mana et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 thus the empirical formula out of this study is applicable to s u t s u b of 4 1 3 1 and 2 1 this procedure could be interpolated for other soil properties and foundation geometries 1 determine geometry parameters d d to get uniaxial bearing capacities in uniform clay v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 using equations 1 3 2 determine soil parameters including s u t s u b and t t d to derive soil property amplification factor η v η h and η m according to equations 6 8 therefore v 0 h 0 and m 0 are calculated 3 establish failure envelops in the v h and v m domains using equations 9 and 10 and with h 0 and m 0 the absolute values of the bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains could be obtained 4 establish the bearing capacity in the v h m domain use equation 11 and table 3 to determine the shapes of v h m failure envelopes and then combine v 0 h 0 and m 0 and equations 12 and 13 to calculate the absolute values of the bearing capacity in the v h m domain 5 concluding remarks in this study a series of small strain fe analyses are conducted to determine the bearing capacities of caissons in stiff over soft clay soil based on numerical results the bearing capacities can be expressed in the functions of the foundation skirt length ratio d d upper stiff clay thickness ratio t t d cohesion ratio s u t s u b and vertical load mobilization v v 0 the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 for uniaxial bearing capacities the influence of soil properties can be regarded as a scale factor equation 6 7 and 8 the ultimate bearing capacities normalized by those in uniform clay present unique trend against t t d d d α which can be expressed by equations 4 and 5 2 for the bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains soil properties make little differences on the shape of the dimensionless uniaxial bearing capacities of the foundation but it controls the absolute values when normalized against the corresponding ultimate bearing capacities the failure envelopes are nearly overlapped thus a unique trend could be derived which could be estimated by equations 9 and 10 respectively 3 for the bearing capacity in the v h m domain the mobilization of vertical load on the normalized bearing capacity is small equation 11 proposes a practical method to

modelled solid lines with kd s um 2 and s um 6 25 kpa a reasonably close match can be found to further validate the current numerical approach yun and bransby 2007a s centrifuge test on the undrained bearing capacity of skirted strip foundations in normally consolidated clay is also employed and compared it is worth noting that despite this test was for skirted strip foundations rather than circular skirted foundation the numerical modelling method have much similarity rough interaction and no detachment was allowed etc so the results are still believed to give good indication a comparison of the vertical bearing capacities from the centrifuge test and numerical modelling in this study is plotted in fig 4 b it can be found that the numerical model could reasonably predict the bearing capacity of the foundation as that in the centrifuge test with an acceptable error the difference can be attributed to that the real soil properties from t bar tests used in the experiment was not coincident with s u kz k 1 1 kpa m and z is the depth from the mudline at the shallow layer the above validation studies demonstrate that the numerical modelling method used in this study could reasonably capture the behavior of caissons in clays with accurate prediction of its bearing capacity it is therefore used for the following parametric study 3 results and discussion parametric analyses are performed with varying ⅰ the ratio of the skirt length to the caisson diameter i e the embedment ratio d d ⅱ the ratio of the thickness of top layer to the caisson diameter t t d ⅲ the ratio of the shear strength of the stiff layer to the shear strength of the soft layer s u t s u b and ⅳ the mobilization of vertical loads v v 0 3 1 uniaxial bearing capacities in general for foundations in stiff over soft clay more soils are mobilized which provides the bearing capacities because of the presence of the top stiff clay the differences between soil flow in the situations with and without the upper stiff layer at yield points under vertical horizontal and moment loadings are shown in fig 5 a 5 b and 5 c respectively apparently in stiff over soft clay almost all soils under the caisson in the upper layer are pushed downwards while in uniform clay only soils trapped in the caisson and a few soils beneath the skirt tip are motivated the difference of the range of mobilized soil could be observed in the contour plots which clearly indicates the failure surfaces as shown in fig 5 a for horizontal bearing capacity the soil flows in the stiff layer and in the soft layer are different at the interface and soils around the skirt tip flow back which could be observed distinctly in the contour plots nonetheless without the stiff clay layer no such phenomenon could be found meanwhile the rotation center moves up which means that the upper soil also contributes to resisting the horizontal load as shown in fig 5 b similar soil flows can be found in fig 5 c for the foundation in uniform clay and stiff over soft clay subjected to moment loads with lower rotation centers compared to those for horizontal loads fig 5 d summarizes the remarkable increment of uniaxial bearing capacities 3 1 1 uniaxial bearing capacities in uniform clay a series of analyses with skirt length varying from 0 25d to 1 0d are conducted to quantify the uniaxial bearing capacity of foundation in uniform clay fig 6 shows the bearing capacity under different d d ratio where previous results by hung and kim 2014 are also included for comparison which are found consistent the values v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 refer to normalized ultimate bearing capacity i e v 0 tt 0 v 0 tt 0 as u b h 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 as u b m 0 tt 0 m 0 tt 0 as u b where v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 represent the ultimate limit state under uniaxial vertical horizontal and moment loadings and the cross section area a πd 2 4 it could be found that the curve of v 0 tt 0 is well bracketed by the upper and lower bounds reported by martin 2001 the trend of v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 m 0 tt 0 could be expressed by 1 v 0 tt 0 2 58 d d 2 9 66 d d 6 62 2 h 0 tt 0 4 82 d d 1 86 3 m 0 tt 0 2 6 d d 2 0 1 d d 0 9 3 1 2 effect of s u t s u b t t d and d d on uniaxial bearing capacities to explore the uniaxial bearing capacity of caissons in stiff over soft clay a series of analyses are conducted the variables are the thickness ratio of upper layer t t d and the skirt length ratio d d both of which varied between 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 and s u t s u b is defined to be 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 group ⅱ in table 2 fig 7 shows the bearing capacity of the foundation from which it can be found that the ultimate bearing capacities grow with increasing t t d d d and s u t s u b for the vertical bearing capacity the failure envelops are approximately linear however failure envelopes of horizontal and moment bearing capacities could be divided into two stages i e an increasing stage and a constant stage the partition of the two stages represent the depth of the affected range and the constant stage represent the maximum resistance provided by the top stiff layer as shown in fig 7 b and 7 c the affected range is irrelevant to the shear strength ratio s u t s u b therefore the depth of the affected range is a function of d d and t t d data points of horizontal and moment bearing capacities with s u t s u b 4 1 are integrated into two single envelopes in fig 8 b and 8 c only the increasing segments are plotted to reveal the depth of affected range the values of h 0 and m 0 for various t t d and d d are normalized by the corresponding h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 and then plotted against x t t d d d α unique trends can be observed where h 0 and m 0 are the ultimate normalized vertical bearing capacity in stiff over soft clay and h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 are the ultimate normalized bearing capacity in uniform clay these two unique trends could be expressed by 4 h 0 h o t t 0 1 84 x 3 4 08 x 2 0 125 x 1 x 2 4 178 x 2 where x t t d d d 0 75 for horizontal bearing capacity and 5 m 0 m 0 t t 0 0 43 x 2 1 96 x 1 x 1 16 3 84 x 1 16 where x t t d d d 0 45 for moment bearing capacity these two expressions reveal the depth of ranges affected by horizontal and moment loads 3 1 3 approximate expression of uniaxial bearing capacity the increments of the normalized uniaxial bearing capacities caused by the top stiff clay are presented as amplification factors defined as η of the normalized bearing capacity with the absence of the upper layer typical results of η under vertical horizontal and moment loads are shown in fig 9 a 9 b and 9 c respectively in general these curves emanate from the point of s u t s u b 1 η 1 which refers to the bearing capacities with the absence of the top stiff layer the factor grows linearly with the increase of s u t s u b under an identical combination of d d and t t d both d d and t t d contribute to the increments of bearing capacities η under vertical horizontal and moment loads could be concluded as below 6 η v v 0 v 0 t t 0 a v s u t s u b b v where a v 0 324 d d 0 367 t t d 0 97 and b v 0 85 0 41 d d 0 3 d d 2 0 18 t t d 0 08 t t d 2 for vertical bearing capacities and 7 η h h 0 h 0 t t 0 a h d d s u t s u b b h t t d 1 where a h 3 03 4 06 d d 1 91 d d 2 0 15 t t d and b h 2 76 3 23 d d 1 4 d d 2 0 22 t t d for horizontal bearing capacities and 8 η m m m 0 a t t d s u t s u b b t t d 1 where a m 1 37 0 67 d d 0 03 t t d and b m 1 48 0 78 d d 0 01 t t d for moment bearing capacities with these curves the uniaxial bearing capacities of caissons in stiff over soft clay expressed as functions of s u t s u b d d and t t d can be obtained by multiplying η and the bearing capacities of caissons in uniform clay following investigations are based on the results above 3 2 bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains previous studies supachawarote et al 2005 zou et al 2018 show that the swipe tests proposed by tan 1990 may seriously underestimate the bearing capacities therefore in this study the probe tests are employed to determine the failure envelopes in the v h v m and v h m spaces 3 2 1 effect of s u t s u b t t d and d d to examine the effect of soil properties on the bearing capacities of caissons a series of numerical modelling with varying s u t s u b at 2 1 3 1 and 4 1 as well as d d and t t d varying between 0 25 and 1 0 as group ⅲ in table 2 are conducted with consideration of the affected range x in equations 4 and 5 fig 10 shows typical results of dimensionless v h and v m bearing capacities with various s u t s u b d d and t t d apparently the failure envelopes in each figure are practically parallel and irrespective with s u t s u b d d and t t d similar results are reported by other researchers gourvenec and barnett 2011 hung and kim 2014 caissons subjected in normally consolidated clay in general a thin upper stiff clay has a little effect on the ultimate bearing capacities as the failure envelopes in both the v h and v m spaces expand marginally when t t d 0 25 see fig 10 c and 10 d where the star markers indicate the ultimate capacities in uniform clay however when the upper layer is thick enough i e t t d 0 25 the failure envelopes expend rapidly with the increase of t t d zou et al 2018 reported similar findings for caissons in sand over clay soil conditions in other words the shapes of the normalized failure envelopes in the v h and v m domains are unique and insensitive to s u t s u b t t d and d d while the absolute values are controlled by the uniaxial bearing capacities with relative s u t s u b t t d and d d 3 2 2 approximate expression of the v h and v m capacities to calculate the coupled bearing capacities it is necessary to generate a normalized failure envelope it is worth noting that the normalize here refers to the ratio of the bearing capacities in probe tests to the relative ultimate uniaxial bearing capacities the normalized bearing capacities in the v h v m domains are depicted in fig 11 a and 11 b respectively unique trends irrespective to the shear strength ratio the embedment ratio and the thickness ratio of the upper layer could be seen which could be approximated by 9 h h 0 v v 0 v v 0 v v 0 2 6 0 6 10 m m 0 v v 0 v v 0 v v 0 3 0 7 the exponential constants i e 2 6 and 0 6 for equation 9 3 and 0 7 for equation 10 show the coupling effects of the vertical load on the horizontal and moment loads as the exponential constants of the v m function are larger than those in the v h function it could be concluded that the vertical load is more relevant on the moment than on the horizontal load it is to note that in fig 11 a and 11 b the normalized failure envelopes of caissons in normally consolidated clay reported by hung and kim 2014 also agree well with the approximated expressions derived above in design multiplying equations 9 and 10 with relative v 0 h 0 and m 0 could estimate the failure envelopes of caissons in the v h and v m spaces 3 3 bearing capacity in the v h m domain 3 3 1 effect of v v 0 s u t s u b t t d and d d to quantify the influences of the vertical load soil properties thickness ratios of upper layer and skirt length ratios on the bearing capacity in the v h m domain a series of fe tests are conducted group ⅴ in table 2 fig 12 a shows the effect of soil properties on the bearing capacities in the v h m domain with varying s u t s u b being similar to the bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains the failure envelopes are basically the same shape but different in asymptotes therefore it could be concluded that soil properties have little influence on the shape of the normalized bearing capacities of foundation in the v h m domain as depicted in fig 12 b in the h m domain the growth rate of the peak bearing capacity gradually decreases given a constant d d the peak bearing capacities increase as the upper layer clay becomes thicker analogously a thin layer of top stiff clay makes less contribution to the resistance but it will dominate the bearing capacities when it is thick enough fig 12 c presents the effect of vertical load on the bearing capacities in the h m domain failure envelopes shrink with the increase of the vertical load which reduces more severely when vertical loads are larger than 0 5v 0 similar observations were also reported by gourvenec 2011 3 3 2 approximate expression of bearing capacity in the v h m domain to estimate the bearing capacities in the v h m domain more conveniently failure envelopes are normalized by the corresponding h 0 and m 0 as shown in fig 13 the normalized envelopes are basically overlapped but with higher vertical mobilization a slightly larger failure envelope could be obtained similar findings were reported for caissons in normally consolidated clay by hung and kim 2014 and caissons in sand over clay by zou et al 2018 gourvenec 2011 proposed the following equation to represent the bearing capacity of foundation in the v h m domain 11 h α m α 2 β h m 1 where α and β are parameters depending on d d t t d and v v 0 based on the numerical results in this study constants for skirt foundation in stiff over soft clay are derived and tabulated in table 3 which can be used to depict the failure envelope of caissons in the v h m domain fig 14 depicts the normalized horizontal load and moment bearing capacities against the normalized vertical load the mobilization of the vertical load is set at 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 0 9 these two figures are can be expressed by 12 h 0 h 0 v 0 0 1 1 exp 8 34 0 36 v v 0 13 m 0 m 0 v 0 0 1 1 exp 10 03 0 27 v v 0 4 empirical design procedure to estimate the bearing capacities of caissons embedded in stiff over soft clays a suggested empirical design procedure is outlined here as shown in fig 15 this procedure is mainly based on parameters as d d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and t t d 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 in practice the undrained shear strength of soft marine clay is about 5 kpa 20 kpa gourvenec et al 2009 mana et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 thus the empirical formula out of this study is applicable to s u t s u b of 4 1 3 1 and 2 1 this procedure could be interpolated for other soil properties and foundation geometries 1 determine geometry parameters d d to get uniaxial bearing capacities in uniform clay v 0 tt 0 h 0 tt 0 and m 0 tt 0 using equations 1 3 2 determine soil parameters including s u t s u b and t t d to derive soil property amplification factor η v η h and η m according to equations 6 8 therefore v 0 h 0 and m 0 are calculated 3 establish failure envelops in the v h and v m domains using equations 9 and 10 and with h 0 and m 0 the absolute values of the bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains could be obtained 4 establish the bearing capacity in the v h m domain use equation 11 and table 3 to determine the shapes of v h m failure envelopes and then combine v 0 h 0 and m 0 and equations 12 and 13 to calculate the absolute values of the bearing capacity in the v h m domain 5 concluding remarks in this study a series of small strain fe analyses are conducted to determine the bearing capacities of caissons in stiff over soft clay soil based on numerical results the bearing capacities can be expressed in the functions of the foundation skirt length ratio d d upper stiff clay thickness ratio t t d cohesion ratio s u t s u b and vertical load mobilization v v 0 the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 for uniaxial bearing capacities the influence of soil properties can be regarded as a scale factor equation 6 7 and 8 the ultimate bearing capacities normalized by those in uniform clay present unique trend against t t d d d α which can be expressed by equations 4 and 5 2 for the bearing capacities in the v h and v m domains soil properties make little differences on the shape of the dimensionless uniaxial bearing capacities of the foundation but it controls the absolute values when normalized against the corresponding ultimate bearing capacities the failure envelopes are nearly overlapped thus a unique trend could be derived which could be estimated by equations 9 and 10 respectively 3 for the bearing capacity in the v h m domain the mobilization of vertical load on the normalized bearing capacity is small equation 11 proposes a practical method to
