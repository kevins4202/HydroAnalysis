9420,high sediment water in drip irrigation hswdi technology offers the opportunity to alleviate water shortages in agricultural irrigation emitter clogging caused by active suspended particles salt ions and microorganisms present in water with high sediment load poses considerable technical challenges to hswdi to date emitter blockage of hswdi is attributed to physical clogging little is known about the physical chemical and biological clogging behaviors and their interactions for hswdi here x ray diffraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing were applied to determine the physicochemical minerals and microbial community structure of the foulants for hswdi using three types of flat emitters and two fertilization modes no fertigation and fertigation with ammonium polyphosphate app results indicated that hswdi emitter clogging was not only caused by physical clogging induced by particulates but also caused by chemical clogging i e precipitates and biological clogging i e biofilms the main particulates in hswdi were found to be quartz accounting for 41 8 56 3 of total clogging foulants and feldspar 13 6 21 1 while the precipitates that contained calcite dolomite and aragonite contributed 14 6 26 7 the dominant flora in foulants were proteobacteria relative abundance ranged 41 7 53 9 and bacteroidetes 13 6 17 3 moreover the coupling effect of three types of fouling was the main reason affecting clogging accounting for 36 3 while the effect of two or single fouling was less accounting for 14 4 25 3 and 0 7 2 6 in addition app application caused the increase in microbial diversity and the proliferation of microorganisms resulting in the interactions between biofilm and other two foulants i e precipitates and particulates were exacerbated thus aggravating emitter clogging this study opens a frontier for the investigation of physical chemical and biological clogging behavior in depth clogging mechanisms and anti clogging measures for hswdi which will facilitate the utilization of high sediment water in agricultural irrigation keywords composite fouling particulate precipitate biofilm ammonium polyphosphate 1 introduction one of the major constraints to sustainable agricultural production is a lack of irrigation water supplies qin et al 2019 at present the development of alternative water sources and the application of irrigation water saving technologies are two key strategies to alleviate the scarcity of agricultural water resources high sediment water hsw is widely distributed around the world such as northwest china southwest europe and southeast africa puertes et al 2021 duker et al 2020a duker et al 2020b niu et al 2013 and has the potential to become an alternative water source for agricultural irrigation irrigation with hsw has numerous advantages including saving conventional water resources ensuring irrigation water consumption and reducing irrigation costs meanwhile drip irrigation is considered to be the most water efficient irrigation technology nakayama and bucks 1991 with water use efficiency greater than 0 9 wang et al 2018a thus the combination of hsw with drip irrigation technology is a viable solution to irrigation water scarcity the greatest barrier to the adoption and extensive use of high sediment water drip irrigation hswdi is emitter clogging which can significantly reduce irrigation system uniformity currently literature ascribes emitter clogging in hswdi systems to physical blockage caused by suspended particle deposition bounoua et al 2016 li et al 2019a niu et al 2013 thus filtration has become the most common approach for controlling clogging in hswdi however the control is not always satisfactory in fact active salt ions and microorganisms are also present in hsw li et al 2019b even in facilities with a proper filtration system fine particles soluble salt ions and microorganisms can pass through the filters and be conveyed into the emitter duran ros et al 2009 therefore in addition to physical clogging hsw irrigation may lead to chemical and biological clogging due to chemical precipitates and biofilm formation current research related to the clogging of hswdi is focused on physical clogging while chemical and biological clogging characteristics are still poorly understood it is noted that there may be interactions among various types of foulants zan et al 2010 for instance umar and saaid 2013 reported that the presence of carbonate precipitates could provide nucleation sites for silicate particulate thereby speeding up silicate growth in addition biofilm can induce calcium carbonate precipitation xiao et al 2020a which adsorbs and traps suspended particles zhou et al 2016 therefore the relationship among various foulants may alter clogging behavior in hswdi systems moreover drip irrigation systems are used not only for irrigation but increasingly for fertilization to improve the utilization efficiency of fertilizers and reduce soil and water pollution yang et al 2011 wang et al 2018b the clogging behavior in hswdi systems may be more complicated when fertilizers are applied thus this study assumed that the clogging process and interactions among various foulants would change noticeably with fertilizer application ammonium polyphosphate app is a novel water soluble fertilizer with high nitrogen and phosphate content better solubility and ease of storage studies have shown that phosphate fertilizers directly affect the growth of microorganisms and the production of precipitates muhammad et al 2022 xiao et al 2020b moreover it has also been demonstrated to reduce the likelihood of emitter clogging ma et al 2020 accordingly an in situ experiment for assessing emitter clogging for hswdi was conducted the internal physical chemical and biological components of emitters were clarified using 16s rrna high throughput sequencing technology and x ray diffraction xrd three distinct types of emitters and two fertigation modes no fertilizer and app application were selected for our study the study s aims were as follows 1 determine whether the emitter clogging of hswdi contains chemical precipitation and biological fouling in addition to physical fouling 2 if contains two or three foulants how do they cause the emitter clogging such as what is their composition what is the relationship between foulants 3 clarify the impacts of app on composite fouling in hswdi and provide useful practices for inhibiting clogging for hswdi technology 2 material and methods 2 1 basic operating conditions the experimental site was located in dengkou bayannaoer inner mongolia autonomous region s north ulan buhe sand region china the experiment was carried out from june 2 to august 4 2017 the experimental hsw source was yellow river water in the wu shen canal which is a common irrigation water source in the area table 1 shows the yellow river s average water quality characteristics the concentration of suspended particles in the experimental hsw was ranged 260 410 mg l and the median particle size was 10 1 µm fig 1a in addition the x ray diffraction xrd pattern revealed that the dominant minerals of the suspended particles were silicate accounting for 82 2 and caco3 4 7 fig 1b the emitter performance testing system was an independent designed platform fig 2 the drip irrigation system s filter device was a combination of a sand filter internal diameter 101 6 mm with filter media of particle size between 1 3 and 2 75 mm and a disc filter filtration level 150 mesh the system consisted of two sets of working devices each stacked in four levels with eight drip irrigation pipes of the same type arranged on each tier the system water flow had an operating pressure of 0 1 mpa different types of emitters have different structural parameters and different hydraulic characteristics li et al 2006 particularly the cross sectional average velocity v of emitter flow channel may directly affect the mineral composition and microbial community of clogging substances feng et al 2019 found that the cross sectional average velocity could affect the speed of fouling accumulation in emitters meanwhile due to the advantages of long service life and low cost flat emitters have become a widely used type in farmland thus three types of flat emitters were selected to construct different hydraulic conditions with 30 cm spacing between emitters in this experiment table 2 displays the primary emitter parameters the fertilization treatment used in this investigation was ammonium polyphosphate app at 0 3 g l 1 based on p2o5 concentration the test had four treatments e1 e2 e3 and e3 app in previous studies the different content of clogging substances was found in different type emitters but the types of clogging substances did not show significant differences li et al 2019b so only one type of emitter e3 was selected for app application the system employed an accelerated method to run once per day han et al 2019 which was equivalent to the actual irrigation or fertilization in the farmland once the system ran for 10 h every day 8 00 18 00 accumulatively for 64 days the flow rate of the emitters was 0 375 m3 d 1 and the fertilizer rate was 25 g d 1 the system used the yellow river water fertilization water yellow river water alternate operation with fertilization occurring near the middle of the total running time recorded by the company supplementary materials table s1 li et al 2007 to flush the drip irrigation pipe the system activated the tail flushing valve every 64 h the flushing velocity was set to 0 40 m s 1 and the flushing time was set to five min by regulating the system pressure 2 2 the performance evaluation index of emitters emitter performance was assessed using the average discharge variation rate dra and the christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu the emitters average discharge variation rate can be expressed by formula 1 zhou et al 2015 1 dra i 1 n q i t q i 0 n 100 where q i 0 represents the starting flow rate of the emitter i in l h 1 q i t represents the flow rate of the emitter i at t days in l h 1 n represents the number of all emitters along a drip irrigation pipe the emitters christiansen coefficient of uniformity can be expressed by formula 2 christiansen 1942 2 cu 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t where q t represents the average flow rate of all emitters along the drip irrigation pipe at t time in l h 1 2 3 extraction and treatment of emitter clogging content 2 3 1 extraction of clogging substances every eight days the dry weight dw of clogging substances was measured from five emitters which were randomly chosen at the head emitters 1 30 middle 31 60 and tail 61 90 of each drip irrigation tape there were three repeatability tests in one sampling process three drip irrigation laterals were arranged for one treatment in a sampling and were removed from the experiment system after sampling the 15 emitter samples were mixed and dried at 60 c for 20 min the dried emitters and those containing foulants were weighed the clogging substances in emitter samples were washed using an ultrasonic cleaner frequency 100 hz and the washed emitters were dried and weighed dw was calculated using the weight differential 2 3 2 the mineral makeup and morphology analysis of fouling in emitters mineral composition of fouling was tested every 16 days the clogging substance suspension previously separated in the dry weight test was centrifuged at 4000 rpm the supernatant was discarded after centrifugation to collect the bottom solid phase to obtain dry weight of clogging substances the bottom solid phase material was oven dried mineral makeup was determined using an x ray diffractometer brand bruker germany work conditions were 40 kv voltage 40 ma current cu target and 1 5406 å wavelength the surface morphology of the fouling in emitters at the end of the experiment was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem the specific operation steps are as follows the sample is fixed on the sample stage by a conductive tape and is placed in a vacuum chamber to spray the conductive gold film before scanning machine conditions were acceleration voltage 30 kv magnification 2000 2 3 3 16s rrna based microbial community analysis genomic dna extraction from samples was by sodium dodecyl sulfate sds method the purity and concentration of dna were checked using agarose gel electrophoresis ultrapure water was added to dilute the resulting genomic dna to 1 ng l 1 diluted genomic dna serves as a template barcode s specific primers and enzymes manufacturer new england biolabs product name phusion high fidelity pcr master mix with gc buffer were applied for pcr amplification after detection and purification of pcr products a library kit brand thermo fisher was used for gene library construction after the test was qualified the pcr products of the sample were subjected to high throughput sequencing on the ions5 xl platform dna sequencing system manufacturer thermo fisher scientific the obtained data were filtered by cutadapt software for species classification analysis of operational taxonomic units otus species annotation and abundance assessment were performed for each otus based on the analysis results qiime software version 1 9 1 was used to analyze the microbial diversity index ace and chao the higher the index the more abundant the flora in the sample 2 4 statistical analysis the significant changes in mineral content among the four treatments e1 e2 e3 and e3 app were analyzed by paired t test the difference in microbial diversity index across groups was analyzed using the wilcoxon rank sum test the differences in microbial community structure across different treatments were determined using similarity analysis anosim linear discriminant analysis effect size lda effect size lefse was chosen to assess and identify species biomarkers that varied significantly between treatments the differences in the microbial communities were illustrated by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds structural equation modeling analysis sema was applied to describe the interaction between fouling and the effect on system clogging variance partitioning analysis vpa was employed to describe the contribution of single fouling and coupling between fouling to system clogging spearman analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the clogging parameters of the emitters dra cu dw and various mineral components and the different species p 0 05 was the maximum level in the significance analysis 3 results 3 1 emitter performance and clogging substances content in hswdi the emitters average discharge variation rate dra and christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu representing the emitter performance level both exhibited a gradual drop from 0 to 32 days and a fast decline from 32 to 64 days fig 3 different descending speed may be related to the accumulation law of the clogging substances in emitters there were some differences in dra and cu between different emitter treatments the e2 emitter showed higher dra and cu and therefore was less prone to clogging compared with e2 the dra in e1 and e3 emitters were decreased by 1 5 14 7 and 0 9 3 7 respectively while the cu in e1 and e3 emitters was decreased by 1 3 17 1 and 0 8 9 9 when app was used as fertilizer clogging was exacerbated app reduced dra and cu by 0 8 19 1 and 2 0 21 4 respectively when compared to e3 the clogging substance dry weight dw results demonstrated a gradual increase at first then after 40 days they had a quick upward trend similar to the results of dra and cu the dw of the e2 emitter was the lowest the dw of e1 and e3 emitters increased by 21 6 83 6 and 6 7 19 6 respectively as contrasted to e2 app accelerated the accumulation of dw increasing by 42 2 123 1 the dw of emitter clogging substances in e3 app as compared to e3 scanning electron microscope sem shows the real morphology of fouling at the end of the experiment fig 4 different types of fouling were intertwined indicating that there were more than just particulates in the hswdi emitter clogging substances 3 2 influence of hswdi on particulates and precipitates in the emitters the mineral composition information of particulates and precipitates found inside emitters are shown in fig 5 calcite dolomite aragonite feldspar muscovite chlorite and quartz were determined to be the most common minerals found inside emitters calcite feldspar and quartz make up the bulk of emitters clogging substances contributing 5 8 16 6 13 6 21 1 and 41 8 56 3 of total clogging content respectively particulates quartz feldspar muscovite chlorite and precipitates calcite dolomite aragonite were responsible for 73 3 85 4 and 14 6 26 7 of the total there was no significant difference in the mineral ratio of the three emitters without fertilization mineral proportions were altered when app was applied app increased the calcite and dolomite levels in precipitates in comparison to e3 the relative quantities of calcite and dolomite in e3 app increased by 4 3 5 8 and 0 6 3 0 respectively quartz decreased by 4 9 12 0 as a relative proportion of app the contents of particulates and precipitates fig 6 were 16 3 20 2 mg cm 2 and 5 2 9 3 mg cm 2 respectively when system operation ended results showed that quartz was the most abundant in the three emitter treatments e1 e2 e3 and e1 had the greatest number of particulates and precipitates compared with e3 the content of particulates and precipitates rose considerably after the app treatment p 0 05 table s2 in supplementary materials the concentrations of particulates and precipitates in the e3 app treatment increased by 0 4 2 6 mg cm 2 and 0 6 3 7 mg cm 2 the content of precipitates in the e3 app was considerably higher than other treatments among the three minerals representing precipitates calcite dolomite and aragonite in fig 6 rapid accumulation of calcite increase 0 3 1 9 mg cm 2 compared to three treatments without ammonium polyphosphate may be the main reason for this result 3 3 microbial community diversities and intergroup difference analysis figs 7a and 7b depict the differences in the diversity indices i e ace and chao microbial diversity for foulants of e2 and e1 emitter were always the lowest and the highest respectively throughout the experiment the other two diversity indexes are shown in supplementary materials fig s1 the microbial community s diversity was significantly p 0 05 boosted by app supplementary materials table s4 fig 7d shows the taxonomic dendrogram of the detected bacterial communities taxonomic dendrogram of e3 app is shown in the fig s2 of supplementary materials after the samples were subjected to 16 s rrna gene sequencing a total of 933 492 clean reads and 2243 otus were detected only a few otus 33 129 had significant differences in relative abundance between e1 e2 and e3 while most otus did not show significant statistical differences the different otus were mainly found between proteobacteria bacteroides and acidobacteria the microbial community structure at the phylum level top10 and the clustering abundance information of species at the genus level top35 are shown in fig 7c and fig 7e the relative abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroides were higher in the three treatments without fertilization being 41 7 53 9 and 13 6 17 3 respectively these two types of bacteria accounted for more than 68 5 of the total species the different types of emitters e1 e2 and e3 showed relatively minor changes in genus level species and the abundance variation area was focused between top14 and top21 streptococcus rheinhermera bacteroides relative abundance increased by 22 4 after applying app but conversely proteobacteria relative abundance declined by 14 9 the species abundance heatmap revealed that app had a considerable impact on microbial community structure app increased the abundance of 13 main species top1 top13 terrimonas cytophaga while reducing the proportion of some species top22 top35 sphingomonas llumatobacter to identify bacterial taxa with significant differences between different treatments lda effect size lefse analysis cladogram and lda histogram and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were used to classify biomarkers fig 8 proteobacteria and bacteroides were the most important microbial communities in different treatments according to the cladogram fig 8a lda histogram fig 8b depicted 19 significantly different species e1 e2 e3 and e3 app had seven three two and seven significantly different species respectively the nmds clearly reflected differences between and within different treatment groups sample points of different emitters were relatively close with e3 app being far away from the e1 e2 and e3 sample points after fertilization indicating that the difference in microbial community structure between different emitters was relatively minor p 0 05 fig s3 in supplementary materials 3 4 interactions and clogging contribution of composite fouling the link between biofouling particles and precipitates was demonstrated by spearman analysis fig 9a dra and cu exhibited a significant negative relationship with the diversity index while dw had a highly significant positive relationship p 0 01 table s5 in supplementary materials particulates precipitates and microbiological diversity had little positive connection whereas calcite in precipitates had a highly significant positive association p 0 01 table s5 in supplementary materials almost all bacteria had a positive or negative correlation with certain indicators fig 9b shows the relationship between fouling and emitter clogging while fig 9c reveals the contribution of fouling to clogging precipitates and particulates were found in significant correlation with dw γ 0 828 p 0 01 γ 0 453 p 0 05 accelerating emitter clogging by directly affecting dw biofouling had a weak negative effect on dw γ 0 105 p 0 01 however biofouling and precipitates as well as biofouling and particulates had a strong relationship with clogging γ 0 771 p 0 01 γ 0 413 p 0 05 biological fouling promoted the formation of chemical precipitation and particle precipitation to reduce the dra and cu of the emitters for the result of variance partitioning analysis vpa particulates precipitates and biofouling alone contributed little to the formation of total dry weight but the three together contributed 36 3 to the formation of total dry weight among them particulates and precipitates and biofouling and precipitates contributed 25 3 and 14 4 respectively to the formation of total dry weight of clogging substances 4 discussion 4 1 clogging of high sediment water drip irrigation was not caused by physical clogging alone clogging caused by high sediment loaded water in the drip irrigation system is often attributed to deposition of particulates bove et al 2017 duran ros et al 2009 in this study in addition to particulates a large number of precipitates i e calcite muscovite and aragonite were found in hswdi contributing to more than 25 of clogging substances moreover a great number of different microorganisms were found present in the clogging substances by 16 s rrna sequencing technology and further contributed to composite fouling of emitters zhou et al 2019 reported that the microbial content in high sediment water was 2 3 times that in reclaimed effluents moreover numerous ions were present in the high sediment water easily interacting to produce a precipitate li et al 2019b it was found the water source particles were mainly silicate 82 2 with only a small amount of calcite precipitation 4 7 fig 1b while the precipitates calcite dolomite and aragonite accounted for 14 6 26 7 of the total clogging substances indicating the deposition of suspended solids in the water source contributed less to the formation of precipitates in fact massive accumulation of precipitates often occurs after the drip irrigation system has finished irrigation after the undischarged water is evaporated by sunlight the crystallization caused by the saturation of the internal salt is the main factor for the formation of the precipitates thus the clogging problem of hswdi emitters in this study can not be simply attributed to the physical clogging caused by conventional particulates mineral induced chemical clogging and biological fouling caused by microorganisms must both be considered in fact the different types of fouling identified did not act independently in hswdi only less than 5 of the contribution to the decline of the system dra could be explained by single fouling however the contribution of three types of fouling coupling were 36 3 almost all biomarkers were related to precipitates or particulates fig 9a and interactions were evidenced among particulates precipitates and biofouling fig 9b and fig 9c the physical chemical particulates precipitates interaction contributed 25 3 to system clogging lioliou et al 2007 indicated that silicate could reduce the time for carbonate to induce nucleation by reducing surface energy meanwhile the generated calcium carbonate might absorb silicon ions on the crystal surface culminating in a combination of silicate and carbonate solids john et al 2018 garrault gauffinet and nonat 1999 the biological chemical biofouling precipitates interaction contributed 14 4 to system blockage in this study several researches had proven that bacteria could generate biological macromolecules through metabolic processes and deposited inorganic ions in the surrounding environment guo et al 2020 pasquale et al 2019 song et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition microorganisms could also promote the deposition of carbonates by increasing the co3 2 content in the solution and lowering the ph of the surrounding environment schwantes cezario et al 2017 zheng 2021 this phenomenon demonstrates that hswdi blockage is frequently the consequence of two or three types of fouling and that no one form of fouling has a dominant role 4 2 the effects of app on emitter clogging in hswdi system there were some differences in the relative content proportions of fouling microbial diversity indexes and community structure abundance in the three types of emitters selected in the experiment p 0 05 fig s3 in supplementary materials this indicated that different hydraulic conditions will influence on the particle precipitates and microbial conditions in emitters app altered the microbial community structure present in the e3 emitter greatly promoting the deposition of particulates and precipitates with regard to biofouling app increased microorganism growth resulting in an increase in the microbial diversity index increase diversity might be connected to the high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in app since nitrogen and phosphorus play a major role in microbial metabolism supporting bacterial proliferation lu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 under app application additional biomarkers were discovered biofouling on the other hand had a highly significant positive association with the overall quantity of clogging substances in the structural equation modeling analysis sema p 0 01 the correlation of biofouling with clogging suggests that the newly created biomarkers likely speed up the development of precipitates and particulates leading to a cascade of biomineralization processes that clog emitters chen et al 2019 gong et al 2009 thompson et al 2012 compared with precipitates in the e3 emitter the application of app the corresponding treatment is e3 app resulted in a 60 6 185 8 rise in this study however ma et al 2020 discovered that app lowered carbonate levels in drip irrigation systems however similar results were not observed in the present study the variation in microbiological conditions between the two different studies could cause this difference the water source used by ma et al 2020 was a high salinity water consequently high concentration of salt ions hindered the growth of bacteria resulting in decreased microbial levels thus the application of app would not cause a large number of microbes to multiply fu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 besides biological factors app itself developed a chain structure after a breakdown the chelating ability of chain phosphates on calcium ions was weaker than that of magnesium and iron ions making it easier to disperse calcium ions in the solution and carbonate ions were easier to capture surrounding calcium ions rashchi and finch 2000 van wazer and callis 1958 although the increase in particulate content was less than the rise in carbonate content app did produce an 8 6 39 5 increase in particulate content the flocculation of microorganisms and their metabolites capturing suspended particles in the surrounding environment seemed the more likely source of this phenomenon wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 4 3 practical application method of hswdi drip irrigation technology particulates are currently considered to be the most direct cause of clogging in hswdi however this investigation discovered that clogging compounds contained a noticeable number of precipitates and biofouling thus in the application of high sediment water biofouling and precipitates also need to be considered to controll the performance of drip irrigation systems microorganisms that act as accelerators of both precipitates and particulates should be prioritized for removal to better regulate precipitates and particulates in emitters targeted microbial control measures are the key to reducing the adhesion and growth of microorganisms in emitters the hypochlorous acid formed by chlorine in contact with water has strong oxidizing properties so it is often used to kill water borne pathogens chlorine is regularly added to drip irrigation systems to reduce the activity of the flora or even inactivate thereby controlling the colonization and growth of microorganisms pressman et al 2012 however chlorination can result in negative issues such as soil contamination agricultural yield decrease and water pollution recently an eco friendly method using microbial antagonism technology has gained increasing interest for controlling emitter biofouling by secreting bactericidal chemicals that vie for space and nutrition exogenous bacteria can suppress or even kill existing germs wen et al 2021 discovered that bacillus amyloliquefaciens could prevent biofouling in drip irrigation systems by generating a range of antibiotics this bacterial treatment is a possible biofouling control approach for the hswdi system carbonate was regarded as a typical chemical fouling contributor in hswdi systems the conventional method of control is to add acid regularly to the drip irrigation system kreij et al 2003 yuan et al 1998 however similar to chlorination acidification also brings environmental risks reducing the concentration of salt segregants in the water source was found to be the most effective way to alleviate carbonate precipitation in hsw water softeners effectively reduce precipitation of carbonate and inhibit scale brastad and he 2013 water softeners on the other hand pollute irrigation water by injecting distinctive kinds of ions for this reason dosage should be monitored through use and content of introduced ions filters are widely utilized in agriculture due to the high amount of quartz and silicate in high sediment water however despite the presence of a competent multi stage filtering system i e sand filter and disc filter in this test system the hswdi system still contained a significant quantity of quartz and silicate this is due to the fact that the filtration system had an effective filtering on coarse particles but a poor filtering ability on fine particles li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 thus fine particles may directly enter the system through filter pores current filter designs frequently allow more fine particles to pass to obtain maximum economic benefit extending filtering cycles or lowering the number of backwashes to minimize energy consumption hou et al 2022 however fine particles can also exacerbate the clogging of drip irrigation systems particle size distribution of the high sediment water used in this study is similar to the normal distribution with x 10 as the central axis as a result we recommend that the filter filtration level should be greater than 10 µm 1340 mesh when choosing a filtration system for hswdi and the filtering efficiency of fine particles should be prioritized over energy consumption 5 conclusions 1 high sediment water drip irrigation hswdi emitter clogging was not only caused by physical clogging particulates precipitates and biofouling were discovered in the clogging substances 2 quartz feldspar and calcite had the largest proportions in the clogging substances accounting for 41 8 56 3 13 6 21 1 and 5 8 16 6 of clogging substances respectively at the level of the phylum in

obvious mutual promotion effect the coupling of three fouling was the main reason affecting clogging accounting for 36 3 while the effect of two or single fouling was less accounting for 14 4 25 3 and 0 7 2 6 4 ammonium polyphosphate app increased the generation of precipitates and particulates and affected the microbial diversity and community structure dramatically the precipitates and particulates caused by app increased by 60 6 185 8 and 8 6 39 5 respectively over no app e3 and e3 app a same emitter type without or with app the different species produced after the application of app were mainly bacteroidetes sphingobacteriales saccharibacteria terrimonas and betaproteobacteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9420,high sediment water in drip irrigation hswdi technology offers the opportunity to alleviate water shortages in agricultural irrigation emitter clogging caused by active suspended particles salt ions and microorganisms present in water with high sediment load poses considerable technical challenges to hswdi to date emitter blockage of hswdi is attributed to physical clogging little is known about the physical chemical and biological clogging behaviors and their interactions for hswdi here x ray diffraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing were applied to determine the physicochemical minerals and microbial community structure of the foulants for hswdi using three types of flat emitters and two fertilization modes no fertigation and fertigation with ammonium polyphosphate app results indicated that hswdi emitter clogging was not only caused by physical clogging induced by particulates but also caused by chemical clogging i e precipitates and biological clogging i e biofilms the main particulates in hswdi were found to be quartz accounting for 41 8 56 3 of total clogging foulants and feldspar 13 6 21 1 while the precipitates that contained calcite dolomite and aragonite contributed 14 6 26 7 the dominant flora in foulants were proteobacteria relative abundance ranged 41 7 53 9 and bacteroidetes 13 6 17 3 moreover the coupling effect of three types of fouling was the main reason affecting clogging accounting for 36 3 while the effect of two or single fouling was less accounting for 14 4 25 3 and 0 7 2 6 in addition app application caused the increase in microbial diversity and the proliferation of microorganisms resulting in the interactions between biofilm and other two foulants i e precipitates and particulates were exacerbated thus aggravating emitter clogging this study opens a frontier for the investigation of physical chemical and biological clogging behavior in depth clogging mechanisms and anti clogging measures for hswdi which will facilitate the utilization of high sediment water in agricultural irrigation keywords composite fouling particulate precipitate biofilm ammonium polyphosphate 1 introduction one of the major constraints to sustainable agricultural production is a lack of irrigation water supplies qin et al 2019 at present the development of alternative water sources and the application of irrigation water saving technologies are two key strategies to alleviate the scarcity of agricultural water resources high sediment water hsw is widely distributed around the world such as northwest china southwest europe and southeast africa puertes et al 2021 duker et al 2020a duker et al 2020b niu et al 2013 and has the potential to become an alternative water source for agricultural irrigation irrigation with hsw has numerous advantages including saving conventional water resources ensuring irrigation water consumption and reducing irrigation costs meanwhile drip irrigation is considered to be the most water efficient irrigation technology nakayama and bucks 1991 with water use efficiency greater than 0 9 wang et al 2018a thus the combination of hsw with drip irrigation technology is a viable solution to irrigation water scarcity the greatest barrier to the adoption and extensive use of high sediment water drip irrigation hswdi is emitter clogging which can significantly reduce irrigation system uniformity currently literature ascribes emitter clogging in hswdi systems to physical blockage caused by suspended particle deposition bounoua et al 2016 li et al 2019a niu et al 2013 thus filtration has become the most common approach for controlling clogging in hswdi however the control is not always satisfactory in fact active salt ions and microorganisms are also present in hsw li et al 2019b even in facilities with a proper filtration system fine particles soluble salt ions and microorganisms can pass through the filters and be conveyed into the emitter duran ros et al 2009 therefore in addition to physical clogging hsw irrigation may lead to chemical and biological clogging due to chemical precipitates and biofilm formation current research related to the clogging of hswdi is focused on physical clogging while chemical and biological clogging characteristics are still poorly understood it is noted that there may be interactions among various types of foulants zan et al 2010 for instance umar and saaid 2013 reported that the presence of carbonate precipitates could provide nucleation sites for silicate particulate thereby speeding up silicate growth in addition biofilm can induce calcium carbonate precipitation xiao et al 2020a which adsorbs and traps suspended particles zhou et al 2016 therefore the relationship among various foulants may alter clogging behavior in hswdi systems moreover drip irrigation systems are used not only for irrigation but increasingly for fertilization to improve the utilization efficiency of fertilizers and reduce soil and water pollution yang et al 2011 wang et al 2018b the clogging behavior in hswdi systems may be more complicated when fertilizers are applied thus this study assumed that the clogging process and interactions among various foulants would change noticeably with fertilizer application ammonium polyphosphate app is a novel water soluble fertilizer with high nitrogen and phosphate content better solubility and ease of storage studies have shown that phosphate fertilizers directly affect the growth of microorganisms and the production of precipitates muhammad et al 2022 xiao et al 2020b moreover it has also been demonstrated to reduce the likelihood of emitter clogging ma et al 2020 accordingly an in situ experiment for assessing emitter clogging for hswdi was conducted the internal physical chemical and biological components of emitters were clarified using 16s rrna high throughput sequencing technology and x ray diffraction xrd three distinct types of emitters and two fertigation modes no fertilizer and app application were selected for our study the study s aims were as follows 1 determine whether the emitter clogging of hswdi contains chemical precipitation and biological fouling in addition to physical fouling 2 if contains two or three foulants how do they cause the emitter clogging such as what is their composition what is the relationship between foulants 3 clarify the impacts of app on composite fouling in hswdi and provide useful practices for inhibiting clogging for hswdi technology 2 material and methods 2 1 basic operating conditions the experimental site was located in dengkou bayannaoer inner mongolia autonomous region s north ulan buhe sand region china the experiment was carried out from june 2 to august 4 2017 the experimental hsw source was yellow river water in the wu shen canal which is a common irrigation water source in the area table 1 shows the yellow river s average water quality characteristics the concentration of suspended particles in the experimental hsw was ranged 260 410 mg l and the median particle size was 10 1 µm fig 1a in addition the x ray diffraction xrd pattern revealed that the dominant minerals of the suspended particles were silicate accounting for 82 2 and caco3 4 7 fig 1b the emitter performance testing system was an independent designed platform fig 2 the drip irrigation system s filter device was a combination of a sand filter internal diameter 101 6 mm with filter media of particle size between 1 3 and 2 75 mm and a disc filter filtration level 150 mesh the system consisted of two sets of working devices each stacked in four levels with eight drip irrigation pipes of the same type arranged on each tier the system water flow had an operating pressure of 0 1 mpa different types of emitters have different structural parameters and different hydraulic characteristics li et al 2006 particularly the cross sectional average velocity v of emitter flow channel may directly affect the mineral composition and microbial community of clogging substances feng et al 2019 found that the cross sectional average velocity could affect the speed of fouling accumulation in emitters meanwhile due to the advantages of long service life and low cost flat emitters have become a widely used type in farmland thus three types of flat emitters were selected to construct different hydraulic conditions with 30 cm spacing between emitters in this experiment table 2 displays the primary emitter parameters the fertilization treatment used in this investigation was ammonium polyphosphate app at 0 3 g l 1 based on p2o5 concentration the test had four treatments e1 e2 e3 and e3 app in previous studies the different content of clogging substances was found in different type emitters but the types of clogging substances did not show significant differences li et al 2019b so only one type of emitter e3 was selected for app application the system employed an accelerated method to run once per day han et al 2019 which was equivalent to the actual irrigation or fertilization in the farmland once the system ran for 10 h every day 8 00 18 00 accumulatively for 64 days the flow rate of the emitters was 0 375 m3 d 1 and the fertilizer rate was 25 g d 1 the system used the yellow river water fertilization water yellow river water alternate operation with fertilization occurring near the middle of the total running time recorded by the company supplementary materials table s1 li et al 2007 to flush the drip irrigation pipe the system activated the tail flushing valve every 64 h the flushing velocity was set to 0 40 m s 1 and the flushing time was set to five min by regulating the system pressure 2 2 the performance evaluation index of emitters emitter performance was assessed using the average discharge variation rate dra and the christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu the emitters average discharge variation rate can be expressed by formula 1 zhou et al 2015 1 dra i 1 n q i t q i 0 n 100 where q i 0 represents the starting flow rate of the emitter i in l h 1 q i t represents the flow rate of the emitter i at t days in l h 1 n represents the number of all emitters along a drip irrigation pipe the emitters christiansen coefficient of uniformity can be expressed by formula 2 christiansen 1942 2 cu 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t where q t represents the average flow rate of all emitters along the drip irrigation pipe at t time in l h 1 2 3 extraction and treatment of emitter clogging content 2 3 1 extraction of clogging substances every eight days the dry weight dw of clogging substances was measured from five emitters which were randomly chosen at the head emitters 1 30 middle 31 60 and tail 61 90 of each drip irrigation tape there were three repeatability tests in one sampling process three drip irrigation laterals were arranged for one treatment in a sampling and were removed from the experiment system after sampling the 15 emitter samples were mixed and dried at 60 c for 20 min the dried emitters and those containing foulants were weighed the clogging substances in emitter samples were washed using an ultrasonic cleaner frequency 100 hz and the washed emitters were dried and weighed dw was calculated using the weight differential 2 3 2 the mineral makeup and morphology analysis of fouling in emitters mineral composition of fouling was tested every 16 days the clogging substance suspension previously separated in the dry weight test was centrifuged at 4000 rpm the supernatant was discarded after centrifugation to collect the bottom solid phase to obtain dry weight of clogging substances the bottom solid phase material was oven dried mineral makeup was determined using an x ray diffractometer brand bruker germany work conditions were 40 kv voltage 40 ma current cu target and 1 5406 å wavelength the surface morphology of the fouling in emitters at the end of the experiment was observed using a scanning electron microscope sem the specific operation steps are as follows the sample is fixed on the sample stage by a conductive tape and is placed in a vacuum chamber to spray the conductive gold film before scanning machine conditions were acceleration voltage 30 kv magnification 2000 2 3 3 16s rrna based microbial community analysis genomic dna extraction from samples was by sodium dodecyl sulfate sds method the purity and concentration of dna were checked using agarose gel electrophoresis ultrapure water was added to dilute the resulting genomic dna to 1 ng l 1 diluted genomic dna serves as a template barcode s specific primers and enzymes manufacturer new england biolabs product name phusion high fidelity pcr master mix with gc buffer were applied for pcr amplification after detection and purification of pcr products a library kit brand thermo fisher was used for gene library construction after the test was qualified the pcr products of the sample were subjected to high throughput sequencing on the ions5 xl platform dna sequencing system manufacturer thermo fisher scientific the obtained data were filtered by cutadapt software for species classification analysis of operational taxonomic units otus species annotation and abundance assessment were performed for each otus based on the analysis results qiime software version 1 9 1 was used to analyze the microbial diversity index ace and chao the higher the index the more abundant the flora in the sample 2 4 statistical analysis the significant changes in mineral content among the four treatments e1 e2 e3 and e3 app were analyzed by paired t test the difference in microbial diversity index across groups was analyzed using the wilcoxon rank sum test the differences in microbial community structure across different treatments were determined using similarity analysis anosim linear discriminant analysis effect size lda effect size lefse was chosen to assess and identify species biomarkers that varied significantly between treatments the differences in the microbial communities were illustrated by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds structural equation modeling analysis sema was applied to describe the interaction between fouling and the effect on system clogging variance partitioning analysis vpa was employed to describe the contribution of single fouling and coupling between fouling to system clogging spearman analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the clogging parameters of the emitters dra cu dw and various mineral components and the different species p 0 05 was the maximum level in the significance analysis 3 results 3 1 emitter performance and clogging substances content in hswdi the emitters average discharge variation rate dra and christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu representing the emitter performance level both exhibited a gradual drop from 0 to 32 days and a fast decline from 32 to 64 days fig 3 different descending speed may be related to the accumulation law of the clogging substances in emitters there were some differences in dra and cu between different emitter treatments the e2 emitter showed higher dra and cu and therefore was less prone to clogging compared with e2 the dra in e1 and e3 emitters were decreased by 1 5 14 7 and 0 9 3 7 respectively while the cu in e1 and e3 emitters was decreased by 1 3 17 1 and 0 8 9 9 when app was used as fertilizer clogging was exacerbated app reduced dra and cu by 0 8 19 1 and 2 0 21 4 respectively when compared to e3 the clogging substance dry weight dw results demonstrated a gradual increase at first then after 40 days they had a quick upward trend similar to the results of dra and cu the dw of the e2 emitter was the lowest the dw of e1 and e3 emitters increased by 21 6 83 6 and 6 7 19 6 respectively as contrasted to e2 app accelerated the accumulation of dw increasing by 42 2 123 1 the dw of emitter clogging substances in e3 app as compared to e3 scanning electron microscope sem shows the real morphology of fouling at the end of the experiment fig 4 different types of fouling were intertwined indicating that there were more than just particulates in the hswdi emitter clogging substances 3 2 influence of hswdi on particulates and precipitates in the emitters the mineral composition information of particulates and precipitates found inside emitters are shown in fig 5 calcite dolomite aragonite feldspar muscovite chlorite and quartz were determined to be the most common minerals found inside emitters calcite feldspar and quartz make up the bulk of emitters clogging substances contributing 5 8 16 6 13 6 21 1 and 41 8 56 3 of total clogging content respectively particulates quartz feldspar muscovite chlorite and precipitates calcite dolomite aragonite were responsible for 73 3 85 4 and 14 6 26 7 of the total there was no significant difference in the mineral ratio of the three emitters without fertilization mineral proportions were altered when app was applied app increased the calcite and dolomite levels in precipitates in comparison to e3 the relative quantities of calcite and dolomite in e3 app increased by 4 3 5 8 and 0 6 3 0 respectively quartz decreased by 4 9 12 0 as a relative proportion of app the contents of particulates and precipitates fig 6 were 16 3 20 2 mg cm 2 and 5 2 9 3 mg cm 2 respectively when system operation ended results showed that quartz was the most abundant in the three emitter treatments e1 e2 e3 and e1 had the greatest number of particulates and precipitates compared with e3 the content of particulates and precipitates rose considerably after the app treatment p 0 05 table s2 in supplementary materials the concentrations of particulates and precipitates in the e3 app treatment increased by 0 4 2 6 mg cm 2 and 0 6 3 7 mg cm 2 the content of precipitates in the e3 app was considerably higher than other treatments among the three minerals representing precipitates calcite dolomite and aragonite in fig 6 rapid accumulation of calcite increase 0 3 1 9 mg cm 2 compared to three treatments without ammonium polyphosphate may be the main reason for this result 3 3 microbial community diversities and intergroup difference analysis figs 7a and 7b depict the differences in the diversity indices i e ace and chao microbial diversity for foulants of e2 and e1 emitter were always the lowest and the highest respectively throughout the experiment the other two diversity indexes are shown in supplementary materials fig s1 the microbial community s diversity was significantly p 0 05 boosted by app supplementary materials table s4 fig 7d shows the taxonomic dendrogram of the detected bacterial communities taxonomic dendrogram of e3 app is shown in the fig s2 of supplementary materials after the samples were subjected to 16 s rrna gene sequencing a total of 933 492 clean reads and 2243 otus were detected only a few otus 33 129 had significant differences in relative abundance between e1 e2 and e3 while most otus did not show significant statistical differences the different otus were mainly found between proteobacteria bacteroides and acidobacteria the microbial community structure at the phylum level top10 and the clustering abundance information of species at the genus level top35 are shown in fig 7c and fig 7e the relative abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroides were higher in the three treatments without fertilization being 41 7 53 9 and 13 6 17 3 respectively these two types of bacteria accounted for more than 68 5 of the total species the different types of emitters e1 e2 and e3 showed relatively minor changes in genus level species and the abundance variation area was focused between top14 and top21 streptococcus rheinhermera bacteroides relative abundance increased by 22 4 after applying app but conversely proteobacteria relative abundance declined by 14 9 the species abundance heatmap revealed that app had a considerable impact on microbial community structure app increased the abundance of 13 main species top1 top13 terrimonas cytophaga while reducing the proportion of some species top22 top35 sphingomonas llumatobacter to identify bacterial taxa with significant differences between different treatments lda effect size lefse analysis cladogram and lda histogram and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were used to classify biomarkers fig 8 proteobacteria and bacteroides were the most important microbial communities in different treatments according to the cladogram fig 8a lda histogram fig 8b depicted 19 significantly different species e1 e2 e3 and e3 app had seven three two and seven significantly different species respectively the nmds clearly reflected differences between and within different treatment groups sample points of different emitters were relatively close with e3 app being far away from the e1 e2 and e3 sample points after fertilization indicating that the difference in microbial community structure between different emitters was relatively minor p 0 05 fig s3 in supplementary materials 3 4 interactions and clogging contribution of composite fouling the link between biofouling particles and precipitates was demonstrated by spearman analysis fig 9a dra and cu exhibited a significant negative relationship with the diversity index while dw had a highly significant positive relationship p 0 01 table s5 in supplementary materials particulates precipitates and microbiological diversity had little positive connection whereas calcite in precipitates had a highly significant positive association p 0 01 table s5 in supplementary materials almost all bacteria had a positive or negative correlation with certain indicators fig 9b shows the relationship between fouling and emitter clogging while fig 9c reveals the contribution of fouling to clogging precipitates and particulates were found in significant correlation with dw γ 0 828 p 0 01 γ 0 453 p 0 05 accelerating emitter clogging by directly affecting dw biofouling had a weak negative effect on dw γ 0 105 p 0 01 however biofouling and precipitates as well as biofouling and particulates had a strong relationship with clogging γ 0 771 p 0 01 γ 0 413 p 0 05 biological fouling promoted the formation of chemical precipitation and particle precipitation to reduce the dra and cu of the emitters for the result of variance partitioning analysis vpa particulates precipitates and biofouling alone contributed little to the formation of total dry weight but the three together contributed 36 3 to the formation of total dry weight among them particulates and precipitates and biofouling and precipitates contributed 25 3 and 14 4 respectively to the formation of total dry weight of clogging substances 4 discussion 4 1 clogging of high sediment water drip irrigation was not caused by physical clogging alone clogging caused by high sediment loaded water in the drip irrigation system is often attributed to deposition of particulates bove et al 2017 duran ros et al 2009 in this study in addition to particulates a large number of precipitates i e calcite muscovite and aragonite were found in hswdi contributing to more than 25 of clogging substances moreover a great number of different microorganisms were found present in the clogging substances by 16 s rrna sequencing technology and further contributed to composite fouling of emitters zhou et al 2019 reported that the microbial content in high sediment water was 2 3 times that in reclaimed effluents moreover numerous ions were present in the high sediment water easily interacting to produce a precipitate li et al 2019b it was found the water source particles were mainly silicate 82 2 with only a small amount of calcite precipitation 4 7 fig 1b while the precipitates calcite dolomite and aragonite accounted for 14 6 26 7 of the total clogging substances indicating the deposition of suspended solids in the water source contributed less to the formation of precipitates in fact massive accumulation of precipitates often occurs after the drip irrigation system has finished irrigation after the undischarged water is evaporated by sunlight the crystallization caused by the saturation of the internal salt is the main factor for the formation of the precipitates thus the clogging problem of hswdi emitters in this study can not be simply attributed to the physical clogging caused by conventional particulates mineral induced chemical clogging and biological fouling caused by microorganisms must both be considered in fact the different types of fouling identified did not act independently in hswdi only less than 5 of the contribution to the decline of the system dra could be explained by single fouling however the contribution of three types of fouling coupling were 36 3 almost all biomarkers were related to precipitates or particulates fig 9a and interactions were evidenced among particulates precipitates and biofouling fig 9b and fig 9c the physical chemical particulates precipitates interaction contributed 25 3 to system clogging lioliou et al 2007 indicated that silicate could reduce the time for carbonate to induce nucleation by reducing surface energy meanwhile the generated calcium carbonate might absorb silicon ions on the crystal surface culminating in a combination of silicate and carbonate solids john et al 2018 garrault gauffinet and nonat 1999 the biological chemical biofouling precipitates interaction contributed 14 4 to system blockage in this study several researches had proven that bacteria could generate biological macromolecules through metabolic processes and deposited inorganic ions in the surrounding environment guo et al 2020 pasquale et al 2019 song et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition microorganisms could also promote the deposition of carbonates by increasing the co3 2 content in the solution and lowering the ph of the surrounding environment schwantes cezario et al 2017 zheng 2021 this phenomenon demonstrates that hswdi blockage is frequently the consequence of two or three types of fouling and that no one form of fouling has a dominant role 4 2 the effects of app on emitter clogging in hswdi system there were some differences in the relative content proportions of fouling microbial diversity indexes and community structure abundance in the three types of emitters selected in the experiment p 0 05 fig s3 in supplementary materials this indicated that different hydraulic conditions will influence on the particle precipitates and microbial conditions in emitters app altered the microbial community structure present in the e3 emitter greatly promoting the deposition of particulates and precipitates with regard to biofouling app increased microorganism growth resulting in an increase in the microbial diversity index increase diversity might be connected to the high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in app since nitrogen and phosphorus play a major role in microbial metabolism supporting bacterial proliferation lu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 under app application additional biomarkers were discovered biofouling on the other hand had a highly significant positive association with the overall quantity of clogging substances in the structural equation modeling analysis sema p 0 01 the correlation of biofouling with clogging suggests that the newly created biomarkers likely speed up the development of precipitates and particulates leading to a cascade of biomineralization processes that clog emitters chen et al 2019 gong et al 2009 thompson et al 2012 compared with precipitates in the e3 emitter the application of app the corresponding treatment is e3 app resulted in a 60 6 185 8 rise in this study however ma et al 2020 discovered that app lowered carbonate levels in drip irrigation systems however similar results were not observed in the present study the variation in microbiological conditions between the two different studies could cause this difference the water source used by ma et al 2020 was a high salinity water consequently high concentration of salt ions hindered the growth of bacteria resulting in decreased microbial levels thus the application of app would not cause a large number of microbes to multiply fu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 besides biological factors app itself developed a chain structure after a breakdown the chelating ability of chain phosphates on calcium ions was weaker than that of magnesium and iron ions making it easier to disperse calcium ions in the solution and carbonate ions were easier to capture surrounding calcium ions rashchi and finch 2000 van wazer and callis 1958 although the increase in particulate content was less than the rise in carbonate content app did produce an 8 6 39 5 increase in particulate content the flocculation of microorganisms and their metabolites capturing suspended particles in the surrounding environment seemed the more likely source of this phenomenon wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 4 3 practical application method of hswdi drip irrigation technology particulates are currently considered to be the most direct cause of clogging in hswdi however this investigation discovered that clogging compounds contained a noticeable number of precipitates and biofouling thus in the application of high sediment water biofouling and precipitates also need to be considered to controll the performance of drip irrigation systems microorganisms that act as accelerators of both precipitates and particulates should be prioritized for removal to better regulate precipitates and particulates in emitters targeted microbial control measures are the key to reducing the adhesion and growth of microorganisms in emitters the hypochlorous acid formed by chlorine in contact with water has strong oxidizing properties so it is often used to kill water borne pathogens chlorine is regularly added to drip irrigation systems to reduce the activity of the flora or even inactivate thereby controlling the colonization and growth of microorganisms pressman et al 2012 however chlorination can result in negative issues such as soil contamination agricultural yield decrease and water pollution recently an eco friendly method using microbial antagonism technology has gained increasing interest for controlling emitter biofouling by secreting bactericidal chemicals that vie for space and nutrition exogenous bacteria can suppress or even kill existing germs wen et al 2021 discovered that bacillus amyloliquefaciens could prevent biofouling in drip irrigation systems by generating a range of antibiotics this bacterial treatment is a possible biofouling control approach for the hswdi system carbonate was regarded as a typical chemical fouling contributor in hswdi systems the conventional method of control is to add acid regularly to the drip irrigation system kreij et al 2003 yuan et al 1998 however similar to chlorination acidification also brings environmental risks reducing the concentration of salt segregants in the water source was found to be the most effective way to alleviate carbonate precipitation in hsw water softeners effectively reduce precipitation of carbonate and inhibit scale brastad and he 2013 water softeners on the other hand pollute irrigation water by injecting distinctive kinds of ions for this reason dosage should be monitored through use and content of introduced ions filters are widely utilized in agriculture due to the high amount of quartz and silicate in high sediment water however despite the presence of a competent multi stage filtering system i e sand filter and disc filter in this test system the hswdi system still contained a significant quantity of quartz and silicate this is due to the fact that the filtration system had an effective filtering on coarse particles but a poor filtering ability on fine particles li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 thus fine particles may directly enter the system through filter pores current filter designs frequently allow more fine particles to pass to obtain maximum economic benefit extending filtering cycles or lowering the number of backwashes to minimize energy consumption hou et al 2022 however fine particles can also exacerbate the clogging of drip irrigation systems particle size distribution of the high sediment water used in this study is similar to the normal distribution with x 10 as the central axis as a result we recommend that the filter filtration level should be greater than 10 µm 1340 mesh when choosing a filtration system for hswdi and the filtering efficiency of fine particles should be prioritized over energy consumption 5 conclusions 1 high sediment water drip irrigation hswdi emitter clogging was not only caused by physical clogging particulates precipitates and biofouling were discovered in the clogging substances 2 quartz feldspar and calcite had the largest proportions in the clogging substances accounting for 41 8 56 3 13 6 21 1 and 5 8 16 6 of clogging substances respectively at the level of the phylum in biological fouling proteobacteria bacteroidetes and acidobacteria were predominant accounting for 41 7 53 9 13 6 17 3 and 8 9 13 8 respectively 3 particulates precipitates and biofouling had an obvious mutual promotion effect the coupling of three fouling was the main reason affecting clogging accounting for 36 3 while the effect of two or single fouling was less accounting for 14 4 25 3 and 0 7 2 6 4 ammonium polyphosphate app increased the generation of precipitates and particulates and affected the microbial diversity and community structure dramatically the precipitates and particulates caused by app increased by 60 6 185 8 and 8 6 39 5 respectively over no app e3 and e3 app a same emitter type without or with app the different species produced after the application of app were mainly bacteroidetes sphingobacteriales saccharibacteria terrimonas and betaproteobacteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9421,drought can cause large yield losses of rapeseed brassica napus l particularly during the flowering stage effective methods of crop management are required to improve the resistance to drought film antitranspirants at as an effective method of crop management can reduce water loss by forming a waterproof layer to block stomata mechanically in our study three pot experiments were conducted in the glasshouse at harper adams university in 2019 2020 to investigate the effect of two levels of irrigation well watered ww and water stressed ws and at at five concentrations 0 water 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 at flowering stage on spring rapeseed results showed that water stress during the flowering stage depressed gas exchange significantly seed dry weight per plant reduced by an average of 70 compared to ww control following at application stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate were linearly associated with the concentration of at for ww and ws plants in two of three experiments with increasing at concentrations stomatal conductance was predicted to decrease 1 4fold faster than photosynthesis rate some yield components showed an increase by at application however the compensatory trade off between pod number and seed number per pod accounted for the lack of a significant improvement in seed yield from at treated plants our results indicate that application of at at flowering stage may be a potential method of mitigating the drought damage to rapeseed by blocking stomata thereby sustaining seed yield as at induced restrictions on leaf gas exchange are related to the concentrations higher concentrations of film at than those tested may be needed in future studies keywords canola oilseed rape grain yield intrinsic water use efficiency water stress dose response 1 introduction with climate projections indicating more frequency and intensity of regional extreme events such as droughts negative impacts from drought on the yield of crops are more likely to take place in the future ipcc et al 2014 drought is usually defined as the period when the water uptake by the plants exceeds the water attained by precipitation during the growing season from an agricultural point of view tuberosa 2012 great impacts of drought on the crops are leading to a large loss of crop production in arid and semi arid regions around the world lesk et al 2016 rapeseed brassica napus l also known as canola or oilseed rape has become the third most essential crop globally for edible oil fodder and biofuel production after soybean and palm oil faostat 2020 previous studies have reported that rapeseed can be highly affected by water stress during the flowering stage in terms of seed yield and yield components such as pod number and seed number per pod johnston et al 2002 istanbulluoglu et al 2010 hess et al 2015 ahmadi and bahrani 2009 compared the effect of water stress imposed at three different growth stages flowering pod development and seed filling stage on rapeseed it showed that plants under drought during the flowering stage experienced the largest reduction of seed yield and oil yield by 29 5 and 31 7 respectively likewise tesfamariam et al 2010 observed that seed yield was reduced by 30 and 51 over two growing seasons respectively when water stress occurred at flowering stage compared to well watered control treatments therefore improving the resistance of rapeseed to drought especially at flowering stage is crucial in sustaining the seed yield when plants are subjected to water stress it is important to optimize water use efficiency by reducing water loss while sustaining the yield under drought conditions abdallah et al 2018 film antitranspirants at are emulsions sprayed on the surface of leaves that create a waterproof layer to block stomata and thereby decreasing the diffusion of water vapor gale and poljakoff mayber 1967 kettlewell 2014 abdullah et al 2015 the reduction of water loss from at application is usually accompanied by the limitation on photosynthesis due to the low permeability of films to co2 entering the leaf accordingly film at are mainly applied on ornamental species in which photosynthesis is less important than the reduction of transpiration das and raghavendra 1979 there is increasing evidence that the application of at regulates plant water status and gas exchange to sustain the growth and yield of crops exposed to drought such as tomato abdallah et al 2018 pea aldasoro et al 2019 and sweet pepper del amor et al 2010 there are only a few previous published papers investigating the mechanism of at applied around the sensitive growth stage that can mitigate the damage of drought on the yield when compared to unsprayed droughted plants kettlewell et al 2010 for example at application relative to an unsprayed droughted control gave a rise in the grain yield of winter rapeseed by 39 faralli et al 2016 and wheat by 11 16 weerasinghe et al 2016 mphande et al 2021 based on previous studies however the mechanism of how film at mitigates the drought damage to crops during the critical growth stage still merits further investigation in rapeseed the correlations between gas exchange leaf water status and yield components under drought conditions have not been widely explored furthermore to our knowledge effects of film at applied at different concentrations on the yield and yield components of rapeseed under drought has not been reported in the literature therefore three pot experiments were carried out in our study with the aim of understanding the physiological mechanism of film at applied on rapeseed plants at flowering stage and its effects on the final seed yield the null hypothesis we tested is that there is no concentration response of rapeseed to film at on gas exchange seed yield and yield components when plants are subjected to drought during the flowering stage 2 materials and methods 2 1 planting material and research environment spring

tank and sprayed water only without plants in the chamber prior to sprays water was always sprayed first for the 0at treatment followed by at solutions from the lowest to highest concentrations to avoid cross contamination between sprays of at solutions we washed the tank thoroughly with the brush until residues were removed given the high solubility of at product there was no need to use detergent 2 5 gas exchange measurements stomatal conductance g s mol m 2 s 1 and photosynthesis rate a µmol m 2 s 1 were measured on the youngest fully expanded leaf of the top canopy n 3 using the

by using a 0 0001 g precision resolution balance seed number per plant was counted using analyse particles programme in image j software by taking photos of seeds spread out on white paper seed number

of variance two way analysis of variance anova was employed to explore the at concentration responses of plants to gas exchange and yield related parameters with irrigation and at as two factors with quadratic contrasts in expt 1 yield data excluded and expt 2 while with linear contrasts in expt 3 multiple comparisons were performed to compare the significant difference between treatments according to tukey s test p 0 05 where there was significant interaction between irrigation and at linear regression with groups analysis was used to test the relationships in g s and a against at concentrations and between seed yield and yield components 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the environmental conditions in the compartment of glasshouse varied among three experiments the daily mean air temperature for the growing season was 16 19 and 14 on average in expts 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 1 a b c it showed similar patterns in terms of maximum rh with an average of 87 for expts 1 and 2 and 91 for expt 3 whereas the mean of minimum rh differed slightly which was 52 48 and 65 in expts 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 1 a b c plants received the same supplementation from artificial light however daily solar radiation sr differed substantially between experiments the average of sr was 11 mj m 2 in expt 1 and 16 mj m 2 in expt 2 while only 4 2 mj m 2 in expt 3 fig 1 d e f the flowering started early in expt 2 with the accumulation of 549 gdd base 5 before onset compared to expts 1 and 3 741 and 897 gdd respectively concurrently the duration of flowering stage varied which was 20 days in expts 1 and 2 and more than a month in expt 3 table 2 despite these differences the duration of whole growing season was similar between experiments with the range of 1713 1781 gdd 3 2 soil water status soil vwc and soil matric potential smp as converted according to swrc were shown in fig 2 in expt 1 soil vwc smp in the ww pots was maintained at the level of 42 smp 0 02 mpa over the period of drought whereas the average of soil vwc in ws was 11 1 mpa with substantial fluctuations around 8 14 i e a smp of between 1 48 0 70 mpa it returned to the similar level as ww immediately after rewatering fig 2 a d ws plants experienced less severe drought in expts 2 and 3 when compared to expt 1 means of soil vwc smp in ww were 34 0 05 mpa and 38 0 03 mpa in expts 2 and 3 respectively vwc in ws was 16 0 58 mpa and 20 0 34 mpa before rewatering and after rewatering soil vwc increased to 35 0 05 mpa and 44 0 01 mpa in expts 2 fig 2 b d and 3 fig 2 c f respectively 3 3 gas exchange across all experiments ir at flowering stage had significant effects on g s a and wuei the significant interaction ir at was observed in g s in expt 1 wuei in expt 2 and a in expt 3 table 3 however the difference between ww and ws was substantially larger than that between at concentrations and the interactions did not affect the very large mean effect of ws compared with ww thus means of gas exchange between ww and ws groups were logically comparable in expts 1 3 g s in ww was 0 33 0 34 and 0 36 mol m 2 s 1 respectively ws plants exhibited a reduction in g s by 89 63 and 62 as compared to ww plants fig 3 a b c the a in ww was 14 7 15 1 and 16 3 µmol m 2 s 1 in expts 1 3 respectively when compared to ww plants a in ws decreased by 72 23 and 21 in expts 1 3 respectively fig 3 d e f wuei was 45 9 47 6 and 46 0 µmol co2 mol h2o 1 under ww conditions in expts 1 3 water deficit increased wuei of ws plants by 145 90 and 107 when compared to ww control fig 3 g h i for these respective experiments averaging ww and ws groups the average g s of unsprayed plants was 0 3 mol m 2 s 1 in expts 2 and 3 there was a linear relationship between g s and at concentrations and g s decreased by 12 19 and 9 24 relative to the control when at was applied at the concentrations of 0 25 1 in expt 2 and 0 5 1 in expt 3 respectively with a 1 increase in at g s and a were predicted to decrease by 16 and 13 and by 25 and 17 in expt 2 fig 3 b e and expt 3 fig 3 c f respectively as compared to corresponding mean of ww and ws control 0at for expt 3 there was a significant linear interaction between ir and at in g s and a where g s of ww declined greatly with increasing concentrations of at whereas ws only decreased slightly as at concentrations increased fig 3 c f table 3 a similar trend was concurrently observed in a in expt 2 the interaction irxat was significant for wuei primarily accounted for the large deviation in 0 25at and 1at fig 3 h table 3 except that there appeared to be no significant impacts from at or ir at in other two experiments fig 3 g i 3 4 yield and yield components at maturity no reliable seed yield data were available from expt 1 due to the low quantity of pods across expts 2 and 3 water deficit showed significantly negative impacts on seed yield and yield components except for tsw in expt 3 table 4 in expt 2 plants grown under ww conditions had a production of 19 g seeds and 274 pods per plant with 22 seeds per pod and 3 3 g in tsw table 5 when compared to ww control water deficit resulted in a reduction of 59 and 37 in seed dry weight and pod number respectively and to a lesser extent 23 and 17 in seed number per pod and tsw respectively fig 4 a c e g compared to expt 2 seed yield and yield components were numerally lower in expt 3 plants under ww conditions produced 16 g of seeds and 405 pods per plant as well as 8 seeds per pod and 5 g regarding tsw table 5 there was a consistent but greater reduction caused by water deficit in seed dry weight pod number and seed number per pod by 81 77 and 38 respectively while the change in tsw was negligible fig 4 b d f h averaging all concentrations of at consistent results from both experiments showed that there were no significant at or irxat effects in seed dry weight table 4 however responses in yield components were observed albeit in varying degrees in expt 2 at application decreased pod number significantly while increased tsw with borderline significance by 4 and 5 respectively table 5 further there was a significant linear interaction irxat in pod number per plant and tsw table 4 with an increase in at concentrations from 0 to 1 pod number of ww plants increased greatly but it decreased slightly for ws fig 4 c on the contrary tsw in ww decreased marginally from 0 to 1 concentration of at and the opposite was true in ws fig 4 g in expt 3 borderline significances of at and irxat interaction were observed in seed number per pod table 4 taking ww and ws as groups in regression seed yield was highly associated with both pod number per plant and seed number per pod in expts 2 and 3 fig 5 there was a positive linear relationship of seed yield with pod number explaining 64 of the variation with irrigation as a significant factor in expt 2 fig 5 a while 87 in expt 3 across ww and ws groups fig 5 b similarly seed yield was less positively but still significantly correlated to the number of seeds per pod in expt 2 r2 0 82 and expt 3 r2 0 65 taking differences between ww and ws plants into account fig 5 c d 4 discussion 4 1 water stress depressed stomatal conductance with concomitant decrease in photosynthesis rate large variations between three experiments in gas exchange and thereby final seed yield production were accounted for by both the size of pots and various environmental conditions compared to 7 5 l pots used in expts 2 and 3 1 l pots exhibited large constraints on the root access to water resulting in drastic fluctuations in soil water content smp during the period of drought fig 2 despite daily air temperature and solar radiation varied slightly between expts 1 and 2 plants in expt 3 experienced a substantial reduction in both temperature and radiation during the growing season fig 1 given incident radiation and temperature having large effects on assimilation rate and the duration of flowering stage weymann et al 2015 the difference of both factors in expt 3 resulted in an elongation of the flowering stage i e duration of drought imposed being longer than the former two experiments fig 1 table 2 in addition water stress in expt 3 appeared to be less severe compared to expts 1 and 2 fig 2 c previous studies have shown that water stress can have detrimental effects on rapeseed plants and it is most pronounced during the flowering stage followed by vegetative and seed filling stages tesfamariam et al 2010 this is also supported by our studies involved with spring rapeseed gas exchange was consistently affected by water stress of varying degrees across three experiments when compared to ww water stress reduced g s and a by 89 and 72 respectively in expt 1 11 vwc and to a lesser extent by 62 5 and 22 respectively for expts 2 and 3 on average 18 vwc the larger reduction of g s and a which occurred in expt 1 compared to the other two experiments was mainly attributed to the greater severity of water stress fig 3 with the same type of compost john innes no 2 faralli et al 2017 found that g s and a of winter rapeseed reduced by 77 2 and 64 4 under severe water stress 10 vwc while under less severe water deficit 20 vwc there was a reduction of 48 5 and 41 0 in g s and a respectively the difference in the reduction of a compared to our study particularly under 20 vwc 41 vs 22 might be explained by different species and or the size of pots with restrictions on the root volume poorter et al 2012 across three experiments wuei from ws plants was 2 2 5 times higher than that from ww plants regardless of at treatments fig 3 g h i this indicates that assimilation rate to certain degree can be sustained with reduced water loss through stomata as a result of the higher proportional limitation of g s compared to a as widely reported in the literature palliotti et al 2013 4 2 the concentration response of rapeseed to at application under water stress in gas exchange film at inhibits the diffusion of gas by forming a film on the leaf to block the stomata physically and thereby decreasing water loss from stomata as well as reducing photosynthetic efficiency gale and hagan 1966 in the present study at treated plants showed a greater reduction in g s than a fig 3 thereby increasing wuei which is in agreement with findings of faralli et al 2016 on winter rapeseed and abdullah et al 2015 on wheat besides g s and a across ww and ws were linearly and negatively associated with the concentration of at in two of three experiments in our study table 3 the g s was projected to decrease 1 4 times faster than a with increasing concentrations of at fig 3 b c e f those observations indicate that the suppression on gas exchange induced by at was highly associated with the concentration of at despite the significant effects from at on wuei was found only in expt 2 fig 3 h gale and poljakoff mayber 1967 reported that films formed by polyethylene were distributed with unevenly varying thickness and within some gaps as well as micropores there is no doubt that the area covered by at i e leaf coverage has direct impacts on the performance of at that is the increase of leaf coverage induced by an increasing concentration of at may result in further inhibition of gas exchange xiang et al 2021 faralli et al 2017 compared three dose rates of at 1 2 and 4 l ha i e 1 2 and 4 on winter rapeseed in the field conditions there was no additional reduction at higher dose rates 2 and 4 l ha compared to 1 l ha however whether at beyond 1 would inhibit gas exchange further still needs further investigation in specific crop varieties and under specific environmental conditions the g s and a increased at some concentrations after at application in ww groups of expt 1 fig 3 a d which is contrary to the general view about film at that partial stomata blocked by at physically would increase the resistance to diffusion of water vapor from stomata and consequently reduce a as discussed previously the increased g s could be caused in part by wider stomatal apertures induced by increasing leaf water potential as a result of at application davenport et al 1972 further work is still needed to explore the stomatal size after application of at with specific concentrations and the interaction between stomatal blockage by at and the gas exchange processes involved 4 3 effects of water stress and at application on seed yield and yield components compared to the corresponding ww control a great yield loss occurred in ws plants 59 and 81 in expts 2 and 3 respectively when water deficit was imposed during the flowering stage table 5 the decrease in seed dry weight was associated with a reduction in seed number per plant data not shown related to both pod number and seed number per pod this is also supported by strong correlations between seed dry weight and pod number per plant fig 5 a b and seed number per pod fig 5 c d rapeseed is most susceptible to water stress over the flowering stage during which pollen development can be restricted by water stress and its effects lead to pod abortion by preventing flowers from developing into pods as well as pod abscission ahmadi and bahrani 2009 concurrently the decline of the assimilate availability caused by drought shown in a great reduction in a fig 3 e could have had detrimental effects on the development of pods and in turn seeds during the seed filling stage istanbulluoglu et al 2010 however very few pods formed from rapeseed plants grown in 1 l pots may be primarily accounted for by the small size of pots as discussed earlier limited rooting volume could accelerate the severity of soil water deficit developed by withholding irrigation for ws plants as seen that soil vwc on two occasions approached pwp 1 5 mpa fig 2 a d which could have resulted in a large quantity of pod abortion poorter et al 2012 water stress at the critical stage particularly at late flowering has multiple impacts on the assimilate supply of pods and concurrently it also restricts the capacity of surviving pods and seeds for compensatory growth kirkegaard et al 2018 in the current work yield components showed different responses to at across two experiments that make it difficult to interpret because of multiple variabilities from the individual plant environmental conditions etc however we failed to identify statistically significant relationship between irrigation and at in seed yield although improvements not significant were observed from at treated ws plants this implies that the compensation of yield components occurred following at application during late flowering stage and or seed filling stage by altering number of seeds and individual seed weight labra et al 2017 labra et al 2017 stressed that rapeseed has the plasticity to adjust its potential seed number and size according to the assimilates produced at different stages one possible hypothesis to explain the lack of effect of at application is that the concentration of at may not be high enough to detect the yield benefits significantly on rapeseed due to the limitation of leaf coverage which is highly related to the concentration of at the leaf coverage from at application at 1 was estimated to be up to 19 depending on the growth of plants xiang et al 2021 the duration intensity and timing of water stress would affect crop yield müller et al 2012 those factors are also highly associated with the response of crops to at application extremely severe or mild water stress may prevent the efficacy from at application on rapeseed faralli et al 2017 faralli et al 2017 the water stress in our experiments was imposed over a short timescale and rapeseed plants would exhibit isohydric behaviors at gas exchange level with tight control of leaf water potential when subjected to this type of water stress although irreversible damage still can be caused by prolonged and or intense water deficit bodner et al 2015 moreover rapeseed can show different adaptations if water stress is imposed progressively ilami and contour ansel 1997 future work should therefore compare different timescales and severities of drought imposition and in addition as abscisic acid plays a role in mitigating drought damage to crops following at application mphande et al 2021 it is worth assessing the efficacy of at on crops in terms of the synergistic effects of hydraulic and hormone signals 5 conclusions we showed that the range of water stress during the flowering stage as indicated by soil matric potential 1 0 34 mpa across three experiments depressed gas exchange of rapeseed plants consequently water stress resulted in a substantial reduction in seed dry weight of rapeseed with the largest effects on pod number compared to other two yield components seed number per pod and thousand seed weight application of film at inhibited gas exchange of both well watered and water stressed plants in two out of three experiments furthermore the magnitude of inhibition was linearly related to at concentration that stomatal conductance decreased 1 4 times faster than photosynthesis rate with a 1 increase in at concentrations irrespective of irrigation the increases induced by at application in some yield components were observed at some concentrations however the compensating trade off between pod number and seed number per pod resulted in the lack of significant improvement in seed yield from at in water stressed or well watered plants therefore the response of rapeseed treated with higher concentration 1 of at under both glasshouse and field conditions with different stress scenarios requires further investigation to identify an optimum dose rate and to understand the situations when at has the highest efficacy to mitigate drought damage credit author contributions jie xiang methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing

9421,drought can cause large yield losses of rapeseed brassica napus l particularly during the flowering stage effective methods of crop management are required to improve the resistance to drought film antitranspirants at as an effective method of crop management can reduce water loss by forming a waterproof layer to block stomata mechanically in our study three pot experiments were conducted in the glasshouse at harper adams university in 2019 2020 to investigate the effect of two levels of irrigation well watered ww and water stressed ws and at at five concentrations 0 water 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 at flowering stage on spring rapeseed results showed that water stress during the flowering stage depressed gas exchange significantly seed dry weight per plant reduced by an average of 70 compared to ww control following at application stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate were linearly associated with the concentration of at for ww and ws plants in two of three experiments with increasing at concentrations stomatal conductance was predicted to decrease 1 4fold faster than photosynthesis rate some yield components showed an increase by at application however the compensatory trade off between pod number and seed number per pod accounted for the lack of a significant improvement in seed yield from at treated plants our results indicate that application of at at flowering stage may be a potential method of mitigating the drought damage to rapeseed by blocking stomata thereby sustaining seed yield as at induced restrictions on leaf gas exchange are related to the concentrations higher concentrations of film at than those tested may be needed in future studies keywords canola oilseed rape grain yield intrinsic water use efficiency water stress dose response 1 introduction with climate projections indicating more frequency and intensity of regional extreme events such as droughts negative impacts from drought on the yield of crops are more likely to take place in the future ipcc et al 2014 drought is usually defined as the period when the water uptake by the plants exceeds the water attained by precipitation during the growing season from an agricultural point of view tuberosa 2012 great impacts of drought on the crops are leading to a large loss of crop production in arid and semi arid regions around the world lesk et al 2016 rapeseed brassica napus l also known as canola or oilseed rape has become the third most essential crop globally for edible oil fodder and biofuel production after soybean and palm oil faostat 2020 previous studies have reported that rapeseed can be highly affected by water stress during the flowering stage in terms of seed yield and yield components such as pod number and seed number per pod johnston et al 2002 istanbulluoglu et al 2010 hess et al 2015 ahmadi and bahrani 2009 compared the effect of water stress imposed at three different growth stages flowering pod development and seed filling stage on rapeseed it showed that plants under drought during the flowering stage experienced the largest reduction of seed yield and oil yield by 29 5 and 31 7 respectively likewise tesfamariam et al 2010 observed that seed yield was reduced by 30 and 51 over two growing seasons respectively when water stress occurred at flowering stage compared to well watered control treatments therefore improving the resistance of rapeseed to drought especially at flowering stage is crucial in sustaining the seed yield when plants are subjected to water stress it is important to optimize water use efficiency by reducing water loss while sustaining the yield under drought conditions abdallah et al 2018 film antitranspirants at are emulsions sprayed on the surface of leaves that create a waterproof layer to block stomata and thereby decreasing the diffusion of water vapor gale and poljakoff mayber 1967 kettlewell 2014 abdullah et al 2015 the reduction of water loss from at application is usually accompanied by the limitation on photosynthesis due to the low permeability of films to co2 entering the leaf accordingly film at are mainly applied on ornamental species in which photosynthesis is less important than the reduction of transpiration das and raghavendra 1979 there is increasing evidence that the application of at regulates plant water status and gas exchange to sustain the growth and yield of crops exposed to drought such as tomato abdallah et al 2018 pea aldasoro et al 2019 and sweet pepper del amor et al 2010 there are only a few previous published papers investigating the mechanism of at applied around the sensitive growth stage that can mitigate the damage of drought on the yield when compared to unsprayed droughted plants kettlewell et al 2010 for example at application relative to an unsprayed droughted control gave a rise in the grain yield of winter rapeseed by 39 faralli et al 2016 and wheat by 11 16 weerasinghe et al 2016 mphande et al 2021 based on previous studies however the mechanism of how film at mitigates the drought damage to crops during the critical growth stage still merits further investigation in rapeseed the correlations between gas exchange leaf water status and yield components under drought conditions have not been widely explored furthermore to our knowledge effects of film at applied at different concentrations on the yield and yield components of rapeseed under drought has not been reported in the literature therefore three pot experiments were carried out in our study with the aim of understanding the physiological mechanism of film at applied on rapeseed plants at flowering stage and its effects on the final seed yield the null hypothesis we tested is that there is no concentration response of rapeseed to film at on gas exchange seed yield and yield components when plants are subjected to drought during the flowering stage 2 materials and methods 2 1 planting material and research environment spring

of variance two way analysis of variance anova was employed to explore the at concentration responses of plants to gas exchange and yield related parameters with irrigation and at as two factors with quadratic contrasts in expt 1 yield data excluded and expt 2 while with linear contrasts in expt 3 multiple comparisons were performed to compare the significant difference between treatments according to tukey s test p 0 05 where there was significant interaction between irrigation and at linear regression with groups analysis was used to test the relationships in g s and a against at concentrations and between seed yield and yield components 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the environmental conditions in the compartment of glasshouse varied among three experiments the daily mean air temperature for the growing season was 16 19 and 14 on average in expts 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 1 a b c it showed similar patterns in terms of maximum rh with an average of 87 for expts 1 and 2 and 91 for expt 3 whereas the mean of minimum rh differed slightly which was 52 48 and 65 in expts 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 1 a b c plants received the same supplementation from artificial light however daily solar radiation sr differed substantially between experiments the average of sr was 11 mj m 2 in expt 1 and 16 mj m 2 in expt 2 while only 4 2 mj m 2 in expt 3 fig 1 d e f the flowering started early in expt 2 with the accumulation of 549 gdd base 5 before onset compared to expts 1 and 3 741 and 897 gdd respectively concurrently the duration of flowering stage varied which was 20 days in expts 1 and 2 and more than a month in expt 3 table 2 despite these differences the duration of whole growing season was similar between experiments with the range of 1713 1781 gdd 3 2 soil water status soil vwc and soil matric potential smp as converted according to swrc were shown in fig 2 in expt 1 soil vwc smp in the ww pots was maintained at the level of 42 smp 0 02 mpa over the period of drought whereas the average of soil vwc in ws was 11 1 mpa with substantial fluctuations around 8 14 i e a smp of between 1 48 0 70 mpa it returned to the similar level as ww immediately after rewatering fig 2 a d ws plants experienced less severe drought in expts 2 and 3 when compared to expt 1 means of soil vwc smp in ww were 34 0 05 mpa and 38 0 03 mpa in expts 2 and 3 respectively vwc in ws was 16 0 58 mpa and 20 0 34 mpa before rewatering and after rewatering soil vwc increased to 35 0 05 mpa and 44 0 01 mpa in expts 2 fig 2 b d and 3 fig 2 c f respectively 3 3 gas exchange across all experiments ir at flowering stage had significant effects on g s a and wuei the significant interaction ir at was observed in g s in expt 1 wuei in expt 2 and a in expt 3 table 3 however the difference between ww and ws was substantially larger than that between at concentrations and the interactions did not affect the very large mean effect of ws compared with ww thus means of gas exchange between ww and ws groups were logically comparable in expts 1 3 g s in ww was 0 33 0 34 and 0 36 mol m 2 s 1 respectively ws plants exhibited a reduction in g s by 89 63 and 62 as compared to ww plants fig 3 a b c the a in ww was 14 7 15 1 and 16 3 µmol m 2 s 1 in expts 1 3 respectively when compared to ww plants a in ws decreased by 72 23 and 21 in expts 1 3 respectively fig 3 d e f wuei was 45 9 47 6 and 46 0 µmol co2 mol h2o 1 under ww conditions in expts 1 3 water deficit increased wuei of ws plants by 145 90 and 107 when compared to ww control fig 3 g h i for these respective experiments averaging ww and ws groups the average g s of unsprayed plants was 0 3 mol m 2 s 1 in expts 2 and 3 there was a linear relationship between g s and at concentrations and g s decreased by 12 19 and 9 24 relative to the control when at was applied at the concentrations of 0 25 1 in expt 2 and 0 5 1 in expt 3 respectively with a 1 increase in at g s and a were predicted to decrease by 16 and 13 and by 25 and 17 in expt 2 fig 3 b e and expt 3 fig 3 c f respectively as compared to corresponding mean of ww and ws control 0at for expt 3 there was a significant linear interaction between ir and at in g s and a where g s of ww declined greatly with increasing concentrations of at whereas ws only decreased slightly as at concentrations increased fig 3 c f table 3 a similar trend was concurrently observed in a in expt 2 the interaction irxat was significant for wuei primarily accounted for the large deviation in 0 25at and 1at fig 3 h table 3 except that there appeared to be no significant impacts from at or ir at in other two experiments fig 3 g i 3 4 yield and yield components at maturity no reliable seed yield data were available from expt 1 due to the low quantity of pods across expts 2 and 3 water deficit showed significantly negative impacts on seed yield and yield components except for tsw in expt 3 table 4 in expt 2 plants grown under ww conditions had a production of 19 g seeds and 274 pods per plant with 22 seeds per pod and 3 3 g in tsw table 5 when compared to ww control water deficit resulted in a reduction of 59 and 37 in seed dry weight and pod number respectively and to a lesser extent 23 and 17 in seed number per pod and tsw respectively fig 4 a c e g compared to expt 2 seed yield and yield components were numerally lower in expt 3 plants under ww conditions produced 16 g of seeds and 405 pods per plant as well as 8 seeds per pod and 5 g regarding tsw table 5 there was a consistent but greater reduction caused by water deficit in seed dry weight pod number and seed number per pod by 81 77 and 38 respectively while the change in tsw was negligible fig 4 b d f h averaging all concentrations of at consistent results from both experiments showed that there were no significant at or irxat effects in seed dry weight table 4 however responses in yield components were observed albeit in varying degrees in expt 2 at application decreased pod number significantly while increased tsw with borderline significance by 4 and 5 respectively table 5 further there was a significant linear interaction irxat in pod number per plant and tsw table 4 with an increase in at concentrations from 0 to 1 pod number of ww plants increased greatly but it decreased slightly for ws fig 4 c on the contrary tsw in ww decreased marginally from 0 to 1 concentration of at and the opposite was true in ws fig 4 g in expt 3 borderline significances of at and irxat interaction were observed in seed number per pod table 4 taking ww and ws as groups in regression seed yield was highly associated with both pod number per plant and seed number per pod in expts 2 and 3 fig 5 there was a positive linear relationship of seed yield with pod number explaining 64 of the variation with irrigation as a significant factor in expt 2 fig 5 a while 87 in expt 3 across ww and ws groups fig 5 b similarly seed yield was less positively but still significantly correlated to the number of seeds per pod in expt 2 r2 0 82 and expt 3 r2 0 65 taking differences between ww and ws plants into account fig 5 c d 4 discussion 4 1 water stress depressed stomatal conductance with concomitant decrease in photosynthesis rate large variations between three experiments in gas exchange and thereby final seed yield production were accounted for by both the size of pots and various environmental conditions compared to 7 5 l pots used in expts 2 and 3 1 l pots exhibited large constraints on the root access to water resulting in drastic fluctuations in soil water content smp during the period of drought fig 2 despite daily air temperature and solar radiation varied slightly between expts 1 and 2 plants in expt 3 experienced a substantial reduction in both temperature and radiation during the growing season fig 1 given incident radiation and temperature having large effects on assimilation rate and the duration of flowering stage weymann et al 2015 the difference of both factors in expt 3 resulted in an elongation of the flowering stage i e duration of drought imposed being longer than the former two experiments fig 1 table 2 in addition water stress in expt 3 appeared to be less severe compared to expts 1 and 2 fig 2 c previous studies have shown that water stress can have detrimental effects on rapeseed plants and it is most pronounced during the flowering stage followed by vegetative and seed filling stages tesfamariam et al 2010 this is also supported by our studies involved with spring rapeseed gas exchange was consistently affected by water stress of varying degrees across three experiments when compared to ww water stress reduced g s and a by 89 and 72 respectively in expt 1 11 vwc and to a lesser extent by 62 5 and 22 respectively for expts 2 and 3 on average 18 vwc the larger reduction of g s and a which occurred in expt 1 compared to the other two experiments was mainly attributed to the greater severity of water stress fig 3 with the same type of compost john innes no 2 faralli et al 2017 found that g s and a of winter rapeseed reduced by 77 2 and 64 4 under severe water stress 10 vwc while under less severe water deficit 20 vwc there was a reduction of 48 5 and 41 0 in g s and a respectively the difference in the reduction of a compared to our study particularly under 20 vwc 41 vs 22 might be explained by different species and or the size of pots with restrictions on the root volume poorter et al 2012 across three experiments wuei from ws plants was 2 2 5 times higher than that from ww plants regardless of at treatments fig 3 g h i this indicates that assimilation rate to certain degree can be sustained with reduced water loss through stomata as a result of the higher proportional limitation of g s compared to a as widely reported in the literature palliotti et al 2013 4 2 the concentration response of rapeseed to at application under water stress in gas exchange film at inhibits the diffusion of gas by forming a film on the leaf to block the stomata physically and thereby decreasing water loss from stomata as well as reducing photosynthetic efficiency gale and hagan 1966 in the present study at treated plants showed a greater reduction in g s than a fig 3 thereby increasing wuei which is in agreement with findings of faralli et al 2016 on winter rapeseed and abdullah et al 2015 on wheat besides g s and a across ww and ws were linearly and negatively associated with the concentration of at in two of three experiments in our study table 3 the g s was projected to decrease 1 4 times faster than a with increasing concentrations of at fig 3 b c e f those observations indicate that the suppression on gas exchange induced by at was highly associated with the concentration of at despite the significant effects from at on wuei was found only in expt 2 fig 3 h gale and poljakoff mayber 1967 reported that films formed by polyethylene were distributed with unevenly varying thickness and within some gaps as well as micropores there is no doubt that the area covered by at i e leaf coverage has direct impacts on the performance of at that is the increase of leaf coverage induced by an increasing concentration of at may result in further inhibition of gas exchange xiang et al 2021 faralli et al 2017 compared three dose rates of at 1 2 and 4 l ha i e 1 2 and 4 on winter rapeseed in the field conditions there was no additional reduction at higher dose rates 2 and 4 l ha compared to 1 l ha however whether at beyond 1 would inhibit gas exchange further still needs further investigation in specific crop varieties and under specific environmental conditions the g s and a increased at some concentrations after at application in ww groups of expt 1 fig 3 a d which is contrary to the general view about film at that partial stomata blocked by at physically would increase the resistance to diffusion of water vapor from stomata and consequently reduce a as discussed previously the increased g s could be caused in part by wider stomatal apertures induced by increasing leaf water potential as a result of at application davenport et al 1972 further work is still needed to explore the stomatal size after application of at with specific concentrations and the interaction between stomatal blockage by at and the gas exchange processes involved 4 3 effects of water stress and at application on seed yield and yield components compared to the corresponding ww control a great yield loss occurred in ws plants 59 and 81 in expts 2 and 3 respectively when water deficit was imposed during the flowering stage table 5 the decrease in seed dry weight was associated with a reduction in seed number per plant data not shown related to both pod number and seed number per pod this is also supported by strong correlations between seed dry weight and pod number per plant fig 5 a b and seed number per pod fig 5 c d rapeseed is most susceptible to water stress over the flowering stage during which pollen development can be restricted by water stress and its effects lead to pod abortion by preventing flowers from developing into pods as well as pod abscission ahmadi and bahrani 2009 concurrently the decline of the assimilate availability caused by drought shown in a great reduction in a fig 3 e could have had detrimental effects on the development of pods and in turn seeds during the seed filling stage istanbulluoglu et al 2010 however very few pods formed from rapeseed plants grown in 1 l pots may be primarily accounted for by the small size of pots as discussed earlier limited rooting volume could accelerate the severity of soil water deficit developed by withholding irrigation for ws plants as seen that soil vwc on two occasions approached pwp 1 5 mpa fig 2 a d which could have resulted in a large quantity of pod abortion poorter et al 2012 water stress at the critical stage particularly at late flowering has multiple impacts on the assimilate supply of pods and concurrently it also restricts the capacity of surviving pods and seeds for compensatory growth kirkegaard et al 2018 in the current work yield components showed different responses to at across two experiments that make it difficult to interpret because of multiple variabilities from the individual plant environmental conditions etc however we failed to identify statistically significant relationship between irrigation and at in seed yield although improvements not significant were observed from at treated ws plants this implies that the compensation of yield components occurred following at application during late flowering stage and or seed filling stage by altering number of seeds and individual seed weight labra et al 2017 labra et al 2017 stressed that rapeseed has the plasticity to adjust its potential seed number and size according to the assimilates produced at different stages one possible hypothesis to explain the lack of effect of at application is that the concentration of at may not be high enough to detect the yield benefits significantly on rapeseed due to the limitation of leaf coverage which is highly related to the concentration of at the leaf coverage from at application at 1 was estimated to be up to 19 depending on the growth of plants xiang et al 2021 the duration intensity and timing of water stress would affect crop yield müller et al 2012 those factors are also highly associated with the response of crops to at application extremely severe or mild water stress may prevent the efficacy from at application on rapeseed faralli et al 2017 faralli et al 2017 the water stress in our experiments was imposed over a short timescale and rapeseed plants would exhibit isohydric behaviors at gas exchange level with tight control of leaf water potential when subjected to this type of water stress although irreversible damage still can be caused by prolonged and or intense water deficit bodner et al 2015 moreover rapeseed can show different adaptations if water stress is imposed progressively ilami and contour ansel 1997 future work should therefore compare different timescales and severities of drought imposition and in addition as abscisic acid plays a role in mitigating drought damage to crops following at application mphande et al 2021 it is worth assessing the efficacy of at on crops in terms of the synergistic effects of hydraulic and hormone signals 5 conclusions we showed that the range of water stress during the flowering stage as indicated by soil matric potential 1 0 34 mpa across three experiments depressed gas exchange of rapeseed plants consequently water stress resulted in a substantial reduction in seed dry weight of rapeseed with the largest effects on pod number compared to other two yield components seed number per pod and thousand seed weight application of film at inhibited gas exchange of both well watered and water stressed plants in two out of three experiments furthermore the magnitude of inhibition was linearly related to at concentration that stomatal conductance decreased 1 4 times faster than photosynthesis rate with a 1 increase in at concentrations irrespective of irrigation the increases induced by at application in some yield components were observed at some concentrations however the compensating trade off between pod number and seed number per pod resulted in the lack of significant improvement in seed yield from at in water stressed or well watered plants therefore the response of rapeseed treated with higher concentration 1 of at under both glasshouse and field conditions with different stress scenarios requires further investigation to identify an optimum dose rate and to understand the situations when at has the highest efficacy to mitigate drought damage credit author contributions jie xiang methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing

9422,greenhouse tomato cropping with under mulch drip irrigation is common in arid and semi arid northwest china to investigate the influence of drip line layout and irrigation amount on yield fruit quality irrigation water use efficiency and comprehensive benefit of tomato production the experiment was conducted during two cropping seasons of spring to summer in 2015 and winter in 2015 to spring in 2016 in these two cropping seasons two drip line layout types were conducted including a one drip line for each plant row and a one drip line for two plant rows with four levels of irrigation amount i e 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 times of accumulated evaporation of a 20 cm standard pan the results showed that one drip line for two plant rows outperformed one drip line for each plant row in achieving higher yield and irrigation water use efficiency with the same irrigation amount in these two drip line layouts tomato yield increased at first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount while irrigation water use efficiency decreased all the way with the increase of irrigation amount a principal component analysis demonstrated that the combination of one drip line for each plant row and 1 0 times of pan evaporation obtained the highest comprehensive fruit nutritional quality among all combinations of drip line layout and irrigation amount in spring summer season while the combination of one drip line for two plant rows and 0 8 times of pan evaporation had the highest comprehensive fruit quality in winter spring season to purse high comprehensive benefits combinations of one drip line for two plant rows and 0 8 times of pan evaporation and one drip line for each plant row and 0 6 times of pan evaporation should be recommended for spring summer and winter spring cropping seasons respectively the findings of this study can provide irrigation guidance for greenhouse tomato growing in northwest china keywords greenhouse drip irrigation comprehensive quality comprehensive benefits tradeoff northwest china 1 introduction tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill is among the most popular vegetables and one of the most important horticultural crops in solar greenhouse in china given tomato is a highly water demanding crop while water resource is scarce in northwest china chen et al 2013 wang et al 2011a zheng et al 2013 water management has become crucial in tomato cropping as greenhouse tomato is widely grown and has been proven as a good way to guarantee farmers income in this region wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2013 a scientific but practical water management strategy that improves tomato quality maintains yield and optimizes irrigation water use efficiency is greatly needed drip irrigation is an efficient irrigation technique which has been used worldwide to convey water to the root zone of vegetables orchards and horticultural crops çetin and uygan 2008 singandhupe et al 2003 it does not cause surface soil and water losses which makes new plantations possible for more lands such as foot slopes with shallow soil layers cerdà et al 2022 it also performs well at uniformly distributing water and fertilizer during irrigation process while simultaneously reducing soil evaporation karlberg et al 2007 marino et al 2014 combined with mulch drip irrigation has potential to achieve a higher yield and irrigation water use efficiency than conventional irrigation systems biswas et al 2015 kere et al 2003 in drip irrigation practice the drip line layout is critical not only because it determines the investment on the drip pipe but also it has potential to affect irrigation water distribution in the root zone which further influences yield one drip line delivering water for one plant row has been utilized for greenhouse tomato kuscu et al 2014 liu et al 2013 and for green beans in the field sezen et al 2008 meanwhile the practice of one drip line servicing water for two plant rows have also been used for tomato cucumber and muskmelon in greenhouse li et al 2012 singandhupe et al 2003 wang et al 2009 zeng et al 2009 zheng et al 2013 and for broccoli and chili pepper in fields erdem et al 2010 liu et al 2012 however it is hard to find studies comparing effects of these two drip line layouts despite their importance in greenhouse tomato production irrigation amount is also critical in irrigation practice previous studies indicated that appropriate increase in irrigation amount facilitates tomato yield maximizes irrigation water use efficiency iwue and obtains good fruit quality but over irrigation would pose negative effects on them and vice versa when deficit irrigation is practiced chen et al 2013 costa et al 2007 patanè and cosentino 2010 patanè et al 2011 however it is hard to find studies specifying optimal irrigation amounts prioritizing yield irrigation water use efficiency and fruit quality respectively tomato fruit quality is a sum of different individual quality attributes such as firmness appearance fruit diameter single fruit weight total soluble solids soluble sugars organic acid and lycopene and thus is a comprehensive concept in fruit quality assessment wang et al 2011b while from the perspective of customers the nutritional quality also a sum of different nutritional quality attributes such as total soluble solids soluble sugars organic acid and lycopene has higher priority compared with other quality attributes such as storage and appearance indices there are numerous studies evaluating the comprehensive quality of tomato wang et al 2011b wang et al 2015 yang et al 2019 however it is hard to find a study solely focusing on the nutritional quality of greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation no matter its importance in addition to the comprehensive nutritional quality the comprehensive benefit is also important in tomato production because farmers want to maximize their profits through pursing high yield using less water but not at the expense of fruit quality wang et al 2015 did a comprehensive benefit assessment by investigating tradeoffs between yield and fruit comprehensive quality and demonstrated that the best management of irrigation and fertilizer in local tomato production can be obtained with drip irrigation li et al 2016 also evaluated the comprehensive benefit as a tradeoff of yield comprehensive quality and irrigation water use efficiency in tomato production with furrow irrigation however we have not found any study assessing the response of the comprehensive benefit as a tradeoff among comprehensive nutritional quality yield and irrigation water use efficiency in tomato cropping to the drip irrigation management combining the drip line layout and irrigation amount especially in northwest china where water resource is a main limiting element in tomato cropping considering present trends for the adoption of under mulch drip irrigation in greenhouse tomato production and insufficient knowledge on effects of drip irrigation management on tomato yield irrigation water use efficiency comprehensive nutritional quality and comprehensive benefit in semiarid regions of northwest china objectives of present study were 1 to determine a better drip line layout for the two main tomato growing seasons 2 to determine the optimum irrigation amount for greenhouse tomato planting and 3 to find a best combination of drip line layout and irrigation amount with the highest comprehensive benefit as a tradeoff of yield fruit quality and irrigation water use efficiency in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site in arid and semi arid region northwest china spring summer and winter spring are two main planting seasons for greenhouse tomato these two planting seasons have notably different meteorological conditions such as solar radiation and temperature which tend to lead different yield and probably also pose different effects on tomato quality and irrigation water use efficiency in current research the tomato irrigation experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse in two consecutive growth seasons i e spring to summer in 2015 i e ss tomato and winter in 2015 to spring in 2016 i e ws tomato at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of ministry of education at northwest a f university shaanxi china latitude 34 17 n longitude 108 01 e altitude 521 m the agronomic measures were the same in the two seasons the site is in a typical continental monsoon climate zone with hot summer and mildly cold winter the long term annual mean precipitation is about 630 mm mean temperature is 12 8 mean sunshine duration is 2165 h and frost free period is more than 213 days the solar greenhouse is built with soil brick walls without a heating system and the inside environment is controlled by a straw mulch placed at the top of the greenhouse and a narrow ventilation system on the roof more details about the solar greenhouse can be found in chen et al 2014 and wang et al 2009 the greenhouse used for this experiment is 75 m long and 8 m wide with total planting area of 460 m2 with an east west orientation and crop rows are aligned north south the predominant soil texture is clay loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 35 g cm3 mean field water capacity of 23 6 mass water content mean permanent wilting point of 7 8 mass water content and an organic matter content of 16 06 g kg the total nitrogen was 1 54 g kg total phosphorus was 0 56 g kg and total potassium was 18 6 g kg in the 0 60 cm soil layer before planting of the spring summer cropping season in 2015 2 2 experimental design two drip line layouts and four irrigation levels were applied which led to eight different treatments these eight treatments were consistent between the two growing seasons table 1 each treatment consisted of one planting plot and had three replicates leading to twenty four planting plots in total each planting plot consisted of two plant units and each plant unit consisted of one wide row also named as ridge and one narrow row also named as furrow with two rows of plant were planted fig 1 the tomato plant was evenly transplanted along each edge of the ridge as shown in fig 1 which is a common practice in solar greenhouse tomato planting in northwest china wang et al 2015 the planting space was 0 35 cm within the plant row all experimental plots were arranged using a randomized complete block design a polyethylene film was buried to a depth of 60 cm between two planting plots to prevent water interaction between adjacent plots the two drip line layouts were one drip line for one plant row one drip line was located beside each plant row i e g1 and one drip line serving two planting rows the drip line was located in the middle of two planting rows i e g2 fig 1 drip line layouts and planting geography are depicted in fig 1 four irrigation levels i e four plant pan coefficients 0 6 k1 0 8 k2 1 0 k3 and 1 2 k4 were set in the experiment table 1 lists the details of the experimental treatment to guarantee plant establishment at transplanting all plots were irrigated up to 90 of field capacity after transplanting a 20 cm standard evaporation pan ϕ 20 was placed on a platform in the center of the greenhouse the height of the platform was adjusted with the growth of the tomato and pan evaporation was measured at 8 am each day irrigation time and amounts were determined by the accumulative evaporation of the ϕ 20 pan the soil moisture was measured by the gravimetric sampling at an interval of 10 cm depth in the middle of two plants with a depth 0 60 cm every two days before applying different irrigation levels the first irrigation after plant tranplanting was practiced when the soil moisture of rootzone reached 75 2 of field capacity chen et al 2013 wang et al 2015 for ease of irrigation operation we sought to build the relationship between accumulative pan evaporation and root zone soil moisture depletion the 20 cm pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m in depth is recommended in china for measuring evaporation as a reference although it is not a standard pan worldwide gong et al 2020 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2019 we found that starting from the transplanting irrigation when ϕ 20 pan evaporation cumulated to 21 2 mm the soil moisture of root zone the top 0 60 cm layer soil decreased to 75 2 of field capacity basing on this finding during the rest period of spring summer growth season and whole winter spring season the irrigation was supplied when cumulative evaporation of the ϕ 20 reached 21 2 mm we should note that the relationship between accumulative evaporation of 20 cm standard pan and soil moisture content measured with the gravimetric sampling was established at early stage of spring summer planting season however there may exist different relationships between accumulative evaporation of 20 cm standard pan and root zone soil moisture content at different growing stages of tomato plants and different growing seasons which needs to be investigated in the future research the amount of irrigation was calculated based on the equation given below 1 i a e p k i p er 1000 where i is the volume of irrigation water m3 a is the area of plot m2 e p is cumulative evaporation of ϕ 20 cm standard evaporation pan mm between two consecutive irrigation events k i is the pan coefficient corresponding four irrigation levels 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 times of ϕ 20 evaporation and p er is the wetted area percent which was set to 80 basd on the technical standard of micro irrigation project 1995 the irrigation water was pumped from a deep well and delivered to each plot with pe pipes of 40 mm in diameter the drip line in the planting plot was the pe pipe of 15 mm in diameter which had in line pressure compensating emitters which discharged 2 5 l h at an operating pressure of 1 atm the emitter spacing was 0 40 m a valve and a water meter were installed at the inlet of each plot to control the irrigation amount to reduce disturbance from other agricultural practices no crop had been planted in the experimental greenhouse for several seasons and thus at the beginning of the spring summer planting season in 2015 the soil moisture content for all plots was relatively uniform not reported here as a result all plots received the same amount of water at transplanting time of the spring summer tomato however at the beginning of the winter spring growing season due to the different irrigation treatments in preceding season and short time gap between end of the spring summer tomato and the start of the winter spring growing season the plots showed slightly different soil moisture conditions not reported here and thus slightly different amounts of water were irrigated to different plots at the transplanting 2 3 crop management tomato plants lycopersicon esculenturn mill cv hl2109 were transplanted on april 15 2015 and uprooted on july 10 2015 and transplanted on october 19 2015 and uprooted on april 12 2016 for the spring summer and winter spring planting seasons respectively after 7 10 days of transplanting white polyethylene mulch 0 005 mm in thickness and 1 2 m in width was placed over the bed except the irrigation management other agronomic measures such as pollination pruning pest control and fertilization were same for all the treatments following the local recommended practices 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 yield and irrigation water use efficiency tomatoes were harvested when approximately 95 of the fruit became red to avoid border effects only plants in the middle part of each planting plot were used for yield estimation and subsequent quality measurements irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg m3 was defined as fresh fruit weight t ha obtained per unit volume of irrigation water applied m3 it was calculated using the below equation 2 iwue y i 100 where y means fruits yield t ha and i refers to the amount of applied irrigation water mm in the whole growing season 2 4 2 tomato fruit nutritional quality measurement tomato fruit quality was measured two times for each planting season for the spring summer tomato the quality measurement was done when the second and third cluster of fruits were red ripened respectively while for the winter spring tomato the fruit quality measurement was done when the first and second cluster of fruits were red ripened respectively three tomato fruits from each plot with similar size maturity and no external defects were selected for measurement of quality the fruit was squeezed to juice in a blender before further bio chemical measurements were taken five quality indexes i e total soluble solids tss total soluble sugar concentration tssc vitamin c vc organic acid oa and lycopene ly were measured based on the method reported by wang et al 2015 the average quality value of individual quality indicator was adopted for further analysis 3 comprehensive nutritional quality and benefit 3 1 comprehensive nutritional quality assessment the principal component analysis pca embedded in many widespread used standard statistical software packages lan et al 2014 is powerful in feature extraction and data reduction with the source of variance being accurately identified lan et al 2014 zabalza et al 2014 it has been proven as an idea appraisement method to evaluate the tomato fruit comprehensive quality jiang et al 2019 li et al 2016 li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 in present study we used the pca to evaluate the tomato fruit nutritional quality and to pick out the best irrigation treatments the details about how to use pca were reported in these studies hao et al 2019 li et al 2016 wang et al 2011a wang et al 2015 the brief procedure is described as follows 3 1 1 making original multiple quality parameter matrix 3 x x 1 i x 1 n x m 1 x mn where x ij is the specific value of corresponding treatment and i 1 2 m j 1 2 n m is the number of the treatment n is the number of the fruit quality parameter 3 1 2 normalizing fruit quality parameters for some parameters the higher value the better quality we normalized using eq 4 to reduce the influence of units 4 zij xij xmax j 100 xij xmax j while for other parameters the lower value the better quality we normalized using eq 5 to reduce the influence of units 5 z ij x min x ij 100 x ij x min j where x ij is indicator j of the treatment i and x max j and x min j are the maximum and minimum values of indicator j among all treatments respectively after this step we get a new multiple quality parameter matrix i e the normalized matrix 6 z z 11 z 1 n z m 1 z mn where z ij is normalized parameter i 1 2 m j 1 2 n m is the number of the treatment n is the number of the fruit parameter 3 1 3 calculating the correlative coefficient matrix 7 r r 11 r 1 n r m 1 r mn where r mn is the correlative coefficient between the evaluating parameter z m and z n 3 1 4 determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined from the correlation

determination representing the weight of the principal component fik is defined as ck 9 c k λ k n k 1 2 n 10 f mk k 1 n z i k v ik the first principal component fm1 accounts for most variance in the data 3 1 6 determining the comprehensive quality index for each treatment the comprehensive score of each treatment fi compre was calculated with eqs 11 14 11 f i compre j 1 n f i j 12 f j az i b j 13 a uc 14 b uc r i t where f i compre is the comprehensive score of the treatment i f j is the comprehensive score of the primary component j for each treatment u is the transpose of the eigenvector matrix c is a diagonal matrix which is achieved by using a unit matrix which has the same size with the correlation coefficient matrix to divide the standard deviation of the corresponding column of correlation coefficient matrix r is the correlative coefficient matrix and t refers to the function of transpose in matrix operation 3 2 comprehensive benefit assessment the comprehensive benefit evaluation can be achieved through various methods such as the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis the combinational evaluation method the gray relational analysis method and the principal component analysis method among all of them the topsis method is simple and the result is easy to understand it has been commonly used to solve many complicated decision making problems amiri 2010 and also been used in evaluating tomato comprehensive quality liu et al 2019 luo and li 2018 wang et al 2011b and in assessing comprehensive benefit in tomato production under furrow irrigation li et al 2016 in present study we used the topsis to evaluate the comprehensive benefit and to pick out the best irrigation treatments the details about how to use topsis can be found in these studies li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2011b to use topsis weights of evaluation indicators need to be determined first they can be determined with the coefficient of variation method cvm with eqs 15 and 16 details about the procedure of calculation of the weight by using the coefficient of variation method was reported by liu et al 2014 15 w i cv i i 1 n cv i 16 cv i std i mean i where w i is the weight of evaluation indicator i cv i is the variation coefficient of indicator i std i is the standard deviation of evaluation indicator i and mean i is the average of the evaluation indicator i the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis was used to calculate the index value for all treatments and further to determine the comprehensive rank of these treatments details about how to use topsis can be found from liu et al 2014 and wang et al 2011b the brief procedure is described as follows 3 2 1 making weighted matrix 17 q q 11 q 1 n q m 1 q mn where n is the evaluation indicator and m is the treatment 18 q ij w j x ij i 1 m x ij x ij where i 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 n 3 2 2 calculation of weighted euclidean distances the weighted euclidean distance di between qi and positive ideal solution q is given by the below equation 19 d i j 1 n q maxj q ij 2 where i 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 n q maxj is the maximum value of indicator j similarly the weighted euclidean distance di between qi and negative ideal solution q is given by the below equation 20 d i j 1 n q minj q ij 2 where i 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 n q minj is the minimum value of indicator j 3 2 3 calculation the comprehensive benefit for different treatments the relative closeness of comprehensive economic benefit vector of each treatment to the positive ideal solution is defined as the comprehensive quality index ti and it is calculated with eq 21 21 t i d i d i d i note that 0 t i 1 q i q when q i 0 and q i 1 when q i q when q i is close to 1 tomato under the corresponding treatment has better comprehensive benefit i e a better tradeoff of yield comprehensive quality and irrigation water use efficiency 3 3 data analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed with spss 28 published by ibm corp the pca was performed with matlab r2021a the averaged values of all indicators including yield iwue and quality indicators for all treatments were compared for any significant differences among treatments through the duncan s multiple range tests at a significance of 0 05 4 results and discussion 4 1 responses of yield the total irrigation amount for each treatment during two growing seasons are presented in table 1 in the spring summer planting season tomato yields responded significantly to the drip line layout irrigation level and their interactions while in the winter spring planting season tomato yield only responded significantly to the drip line layout irrigation level but not to the interactions between them table 2 in the spring summer planting season the treatment of g2k2 had the highest yield 155 53 t hm and the g1k1 had the lowest yield 91 78 t hm among all treatments while in the winter spring season g2k3 had the highest yield 58 97 t hm and g1k4 had the lowest yield 51 41 t hm among all treatments fig 2 in both experiment seasons under the same drip line layout the yield increased at first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 2 and thus our experiments revealed a phenomenon that there is a threshold for the irrigation amount which means that too little or too much irrigation was not conducive to high yield this finding is in line with li et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 that appropriate irrigation amount is critical in harvesting high tomato yield under the same irrigation level treatments under g2 tended to have higher yield in these two growing seasons this finding is conditionally agree with li and zhang 2010 that the drip irrigation pattern as governed by the drip line layout can significantly affected cotton seed yield they revealed that different drip irrigation patterns could lead to different soil moisture distribution in the root zone which further may affect the water and nutrition uptake of cotton plants and eventually led to different seed yields the postulation of li and zhang 2010 can also be used to explain the yield differences between these two drip line layouts in current study in the present study compared with g1 the g2 drip line layout may promote deeper infiltration into the root zone which would encourage the tomato roots to stretch to deeper soil profile and further facilitate the nutrition uptake and eventually facilitate the yield formation we did collect root data including the mass of root and its distribution within root zone however investigating the effect of drip line layout on roots is beyond the scope of present study and will be investigated in a subsequent paper additionally the g2 drip line layout may result in a smaller proportion of water being lost through soil evaporation which would leave more soil water for the plant and inevitably increase yield the tomato yield gap between the two cropping seasons was obvious the yield of spring summer tomato was significantly higher than that of winter spring tomato at 0 05 significant level this finding is consistent with the report of wang et al 2015 and zotarelli et al 2009 this may be due to the higher temperature and more solar radiation in the spring summer growing season compared with the winter spring growing season and these two meteorological elements favor the yield formation when they are in appropriate ranges our speculation is validated by zotarelli et al 2009 who demonstrated that differences in tomato yield in different cropping seasons can be attributed to substantial differences in temperature and solar radiation coyago cruz et al 2019 also reported that the response of tomato yield to the irrigation treatment was affected by the cropping seasons autumn and spring 4 2 responses of iwue like yield in the spring summer planting season iwue responded significantly to the drip line layout irrigation level and their interactions however while in the winter spring planting season iwue only responded significantly to the drip line layout and irrigation level but not to the interactions between them table 2 for the spring summer planting season the treatment g2k1 had the highest iwue 135 48 kg m3 and the g2k4 had the lowest iwue 69 76 kg m3 while for the winter spring planting season g2k1 had the highest iwue 68 28 kg m3 and g1k4 had the lowest iwue 31 85 kg m3 fig 3 in these two seasons under the same drip line layout the iwue showed decreasing trends with the increase of irrigation amount fig 3 this result is consistent with li et al 2016 who revealed that iwue decreased with the increase of irrigation amount for greenhouse tomato under furrow irrigation in the same region this may be explained as the yield increase did not match the increase of irrigation amount which led to the decrease of iwue under the same irrigation level treatments under g2 tended to have higher iwue except for the k4 treatments in spring summer planting season this may be because that with the same irrigation amount g2 treatments tended to achieve higher yield compared with g1 and thus have the higher iwue like yield the iwue gap between these two cropping seasons were also obvious the iwue of spring summer tomato was significantly higher than that of winter spring tomato at 0 05 significant level this is because that higher temperature and more solar radiation in the spring summer growing season favored the yield formation which led to higher irrigation water productivity or in other words per volume of irrigation water tended to formate more yield under the planting condition of spring summer season compared with the winter spring growing season 4 3 responses of single quality attributes the effects of drip line layout and irrigation amount on individual fruit quality attributes are presented in table 2 and fig 4a e in these two cropping seasons under the same drip line layout the tss tssc and vc tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation levels with some exceptions in the ss season under the same drip line layout the oa tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation levels excepted for g1k2 while for ws season it showed different characteristics for g1 and g2 treatments for the former the oa content did not show a specific trend while for the latter the oa tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation amounts in these two cropping seasons the lycopene content of g1 treatments tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation levels while for g2 treatments it decreased with the increase of irrigation amount all the way the different response of quality attributes to irrigation amount may be due to their formation processes have various sensitivities to irrigation amount our results of fruit quality analyses such as tss and tssc are partly consistent with findings in existing researches ozbahce and tari 2010 patanè et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 the trend for vc in the winter spring tomato is in line with li et al 2016 and wu et al 2018 the content of some quality attributes decrease with the increase of irrigation amount was explained by mitchell et al 1991 and zheng et al 2013 they demonstrated that appropriate increase in irrigation amount facilitates the accumulation of substances in the fruit while water has a diluting effect on the dry biomasses in the fruit after overpass a threshold li et al 2016 reported that the content of total soluble solid and total soluble sugar increased at first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount which validated the explanation of mitchell et al 1991 and zheng et al 2013 we also find that with the same irrigation amount four out of five quality attributes responded differently to the drip line layout with seasonal variations for example the g2 treatments tended to obtain more tss than g1 treatments except for k4 treatments in the ss season the g2 treatments tended to have higher oa than g1 treatments except for k1 treatments in these two cropping seasons the g1 tended to obtain higher vc in ss season while g2 treatments harvested higher vc in the ws season unfortunately the mechanisms behind the effects of drip line layout on tomato fruit nutritional quality are still unknown additionally we find that fruit nutritional qualities responded differently to these two distinct cropping seasons for example the ws season obtained significantly higher tss oa and lycopene than the ss season under same irrigation treatment this may be due to that ws season obtained lower yield where the concentration of nutritional quality attributes was higher 4 4 responses of comprehensive nutritional quality based on a pca analysis the cumulative variance contribution of the first three principal components was 94 for the spring summer tomato and 97 for the winter spring tomato table 3 which contained most of the variance information of fruit quality thus we selected the first three principal components as main principal components in this study the comprehensive quality ranked with pca are shown in table 4 the pca evaluation demonstrated that the g1k3 had the highest and g1k4 had the lowest comprehensive quality for the ss tomato ranked first with a score of 570 46 and ranked eighth with a score of 397 98 respectively while g2k2 had the highest and g1k1 had the lowest comprehensive quality for the ws tomato ranked first with score of 634 57 and ranked eighth with a score of 519 14 respectively there was an obvious tradeoff among different nutritional quality attributes thus to pursue high nutritional quality the g1k3 and g2k2 were the best drip irrigation managements for greenhouse tomato cropping during the spring summer and winter spring seasons respectively 4 5 comprehensive benefit of tomato production in addition to yield and quality farmers in water scarcity regions also want to maximize the irrigation water use efficiency thus the comprehensive fruit quality yield and iwue were used for the comprehensive benefit evaluation in present study the comprehensive benefit ranks by topsis were presented in table 5 g2k2 showed the highest and g1k4 showed the lowest comprehensive benefit in the ss season ranked first with a score of 0 8388 and ranked eighth with a score of 0 2428 respectively while g1k1 showed the highest and g1k4 showed the lowest comprehensive benefit in the ws season ranked first with score of 0 7607 and ranked eighth with a score of 0 0023 respectively the different response of comprehensive benefit to the irrigation treatment in two seasons may be because of different weights of these three indices in two seasons table 6 for the ss tomato the weight of comprehensive quality yield and iwue were 0 24 0 32 and 0 44 respectively while for the ws tomato the weight of comprehensive quality yield and iwue were 0 41 0 28 and 0 32 respectively there were obvious tradeoffs among the fruit nutritional quality yield irrigation water use efficiency in these two cropping seasons this is vital in guiding tomato production to pursue different cropping objectives corresponding irrigation practices should be practiced to be specific to obtain higher yield and iwue in the spring summer season g2 should be chosen to achieve a compromise among fruit quality yield and iwue g2k2 was recommended for the spring summer season while g1k1 was recommended for the winter spring season these insights demonstrate that findings of current study are meaningful not only in fulfilling specific research gaps but also in guiding greenhouse tomato production in northwest china 5 conclusions compared with one drip line irrigating each plant row one drip line servicing two plant rows was a better drip line layout practice for achieving higher tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency to obtain the highest yield irrigation amount should be 0 8 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan while to maximize the highest irrigation water use efficiency irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 0 6 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan to pursue high comprehensive nutritional quality irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 1 0 and 0 8 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan in the spring summer and winter spring cropping seasons respectively different irrigation practices should be practiced obtaining the highest comprehensive benefit a tradeoff of yield comprehensive quality and irrigation water use efficiency in two cropping seasons spring summer and winter spring season for the former one drip line for two planting rows should be adopted and irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 0 8 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan while for the latter one drip line for each planting row should be adopted and irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 0 6 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan proposed future research should deeply dig mechanisms behind responses of tomato to different drip line layouts 1 does the drip line layout affect tomato root distribution in root zone soil profile through affecting irrigation water distribution 2 does the drip line layout affect tomato yield and fruit quality through affecting tomato plant growth indicators such as plant height stem diameter

9422,greenhouse tomato cropping with under mulch drip irrigation is common in arid and semi arid northwest china to investigate the influence of drip line layout and irrigation amount on yield fruit quality irrigation water use efficiency and comprehensive benefit of tomato production the experiment was conducted during two cropping seasons of spring to summer in 2015 and winter in 2015 to spring in 2016 in these two cropping seasons two drip line layout types were conducted including a one drip line for each plant row and a one drip line for two plant rows with four levels of irrigation amount i e 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 times of accumulated evaporation of a 20 cm standard pan the results showed that one drip line for two plant rows outperformed one drip line for each plant row in achieving higher yield and irrigation water use efficiency with the same irrigation amount in these two drip line layouts tomato yield increased at first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount while irrigation water use efficiency decreased all the way with the increase of irrigation amount a principal component analysis demonstrated that the combination of one drip line for each plant row and 1 0 times of pan evaporation obtained the highest comprehensive fruit nutritional quality among all combinations of drip line layout and irrigation amount in spring summer season while the combination of one drip line for two plant rows and 0 8 times of pan evaporation had the highest comprehensive fruit quality in winter spring season to purse high comprehensive benefits combinations of one drip line for two plant rows and 0 8 times of pan evaporation and one drip line for each plant row and 0 6 times of pan evaporation should be recommended for spring summer and winter spring cropping seasons respectively the findings of this study can provide irrigation guidance for greenhouse tomato growing in northwest china keywords greenhouse drip irrigation comprehensive quality comprehensive benefits tradeoff northwest china 1 introduction tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill is among the most popular vegetables and one of the most important horticultural crops in solar greenhouse in china given tomato is a highly water demanding crop while water resource is scarce in northwest china chen et al 2013 wang et al 2011a zheng et al 2013 water management has become crucial in tomato cropping as greenhouse tomato is widely grown and has been proven as a good way to guarantee farmers income in this region wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2013 a scientific but practical water management strategy that improves tomato quality maintains yield and optimizes irrigation water use efficiency is greatly needed drip irrigation is an efficient irrigation technique which has been used worldwide to convey water to the root zone of vegetables orchards and horticultural crops çetin and uygan 2008 singandhupe et al 2003 it does not cause surface soil and water losses which makes new plantations possible for more lands such as foot slopes with shallow soil layers cerdà et al 2022 it also performs well at uniformly distributing water and fertilizer during irrigation process while simultaneously reducing soil evaporation karlberg et al 2007 marino et al 2014 combined with mulch drip irrigation has potential to achieve a higher yield and irrigation water use efficiency than conventional irrigation systems biswas et al 2015 kere et al 2003 in drip irrigation practice the drip line layout is critical not only because it determines the investment on the drip pipe but also it has potential to affect irrigation water distribution in the root zone which further influences yield one drip line delivering water for one plant row has been utilized for greenhouse tomato kuscu et al 2014 liu et al 2013 and for green beans in the field sezen et al 2008 meanwhile the practice of one drip line servicing water for two plant rows have also been used for tomato cucumber and muskmelon in greenhouse li et al 2012 singandhupe et al 2003 wang et al 2009 zeng et al 2009 zheng et al 2013 and for broccoli and chili pepper in fields erdem et al 2010 liu et al 2012 however it is hard to find studies comparing effects of these two drip line layouts despite their importance in greenhouse tomato production irrigation amount is also critical in irrigation practice previous studies indicated that appropriate increase in irrigation amount facilitates tomato yield maximizes irrigation water use efficiency iwue and obtains good fruit quality but over irrigation would pose negative effects on them and vice versa when deficit irrigation is practiced chen et al 2013 costa et al 2007 patanè and cosentino 2010 patanè et al 2011 however it is hard to find studies specifying optimal irrigation amounts prioritizing yield irrigation water use efficiency and fruit quality respectively tomato fruit quality is a sum of different individual quality attributes such as firmness appearance fruit diameter single fruit weight total soluble solids soluble sugars organic acid and lycopene and thus is a comprehensive concept in fruit quality assessment wang et al 2011b while from the perspective of customers the nutritional quality also a sum of different nutritional quality attributes such as total soluble solids soluble sugars organic acid and lycopene has higher priority compared with other quality attributes such as storage and appearance indices there are numerous studies evaluating the comprehensive quality of tomato wang et al 2011b wang et al 2015 yang et al 2019 however it is hard to find a study solely focusing on the nutritional quality of greenhouse tomato under drip irrigation no matter its importance in addition to the comprehensive nutritional quality the comprehensive benefit is also important in tomato production because farmers want to maximize their profits through pursing high yield using less water but not at the expense of fruit quality wang et al 2015 did a comprehensive benefit assessment by investigating tradeoffs between yield and fruit comprehensive quality and demonstrated that the best management of irrigation and fertilizer in local tomato production can be obtained with drip irrigation li et al 2016 also evaluated the comprehensive benefit as a tradeoff of yield comprehensive quality and irrigation water use efficiency in tomato production with furrow irrigation however we have not found any study assessing the response of the comprehensive benefit as a tradeoff among comprehensive nutritional quality yield and irrigation water use efficiency in tomato cropping to the drip irrigation management combining the drip line layout and irrigation amount especially in northwest china where water resource is a main limiting element in tomato cropping considering present trends for the adoption of under mulch drip irrigation in greenhouse tomato production and insufficient knowledge on effects of drip irrigation management on tomato yield irrigation water use efficiency comprehensive nutritional quality and comprehensive benefit in semiarid regions of northwest china objectives of present study were 1 to determine a better drip line layout for the two main tomato growing seasons 2 to determine the optimum irrigation amount for greenhouse tomato planting and 3 to find a best combination of drip line layout and irrigation amount with the highest comprehensive benefit as a tradeoff of yield fruit quality and irrigation water use efficiency in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site in arid and semi arid region northwest china spring summer and winter spring are two main planting seasons for greenhouse tomato these two planting seasons have notably different meteorological conditions such as solar radiation and temperature which tend to lead different yield and probably also pose different effects on tomato quality and irrigation water use efficiency in current research the tomato irrigation experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse in two consecutive growth seasons i e spring to summer in 2015 i e ss tomato and winter in 2015 to spring in 2016 i e ws tomato at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering in arid and semiarid areas of ministry of education at northwest a f university shaanxi china latitude 34 17 n longitude 108 01 e altitude 521 m the agronomic measures were the same in the two seasons the site is in a typical continental monsoon climate zone with hot summer and mildly cold winter the long term annual mean precipitation is about 630 mm mean temperature is 12 8 mean sunshine duration is 2165 h and frost free period is more than 213 days the solar greenhouse is built with soil brick walls without a heating system and the inside environment is controlled by a straw mulch placed at the top of the greenhouse and a narrow ventilation system on the roof more details about the solar greenhouse can be found in chen et al 2014 and wang et al 2009 the greenhouse used for this experiment is 75 m long and 8 m wide with total planting area of 460 m2 with an east west orientation and crop rows are aligned north south the predominant soil texture is clay loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 35 g cm3 mean field water capacity of 23 6 mass water content mean permanent wilting point of 7 8 mass water content and an organic matter content of 16 06 g kg the total nitrogen was 1 54 g kg total phosphorus was 0 56 g kg and total potassium was 18 6 g kg in the 0 60 cm soil layer before planting of the spring summer cropping season in 2015 2 2 experimental design two drip line layouts and four irrigation levels were applied which led to eight different treatments these eight treatments were consistent between the two growing seasons table 1 each treatment consisted of one planting plot and had three replicates leading to twenty four planting plots in total each planting plot consisted of two plant units and each plant unit consisted of one wide row also named as ridge and one narrow row also named as furrow with two rows of plant were planted fig 1 the tomato plant was evenly transplanted along each edge of the ridge as shown in fig 1 which is a common practice in solar greenhouse tomato planting in northwest china wang et al 2015 the planting space was 0 35 cm within the plant row all experimental plots were arranged using a randomized complete block design a polyethylene film was buried to a depth of 60 cm between two planting plots to prevent water interaction between adjacent plots the two drip line layouts were one drip line for one plant row one drip line was located beside each plant row i e g1 and one drip line serving two planting rows the drip line was located in the middle of two planting rows i e g2 fig 1 drip line layouts and planting geography are depicted in fig 1 four irrigation levels i e four plant pan coefficients 0 6 k1 0 8 k2 1 0 k3 and 1 2 k4 were set in the experiment table 1 lists the details of the experimental treatment to guarantee plant establishment at transplanting all plots were irrigated up to 90 of field capacity after transplanting a 20 cm standard evaporation pan ϕ 20 was placed on a platform in the center of the greenhouse the height of the platform was adjusted with the growth of the tomato and pan evaporation was measured at 8 am each day irrigation time and amounts were determined by the accumulative evaporation of the ϕ 20 pan the soil moisture was measured by the gravimetric sampling at an interval of 10 cm depth in the middle of two plants with a depth 0 60 cm every two days before applying different irrigation levels the first irrigation after plant tranplanting was practiced when the soil moisture of rootzone reached 75 2 of field capacity chen et al 2013 wang et al 2015 for ease of irrigation operation we sought to build the relationship between accumulative pan evaporation and root zone soil moisture depletion the 20 cm pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m in depth is recommended in china for measuring evaporation as a reference although it is not a standard pan worldwide gong et al 2020 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2019 we found that starting from the transplanting irrigation when ϕ 20 pan evaporation cumulated to 21 2 mm the soil moisture of root zone the top 0 60 cm layer soil decreased to 75 2 of field capacity basing on this finding during the rest period of spring summer growth season and whole winter spring season the irrigation was supplied when cumulative evaporation of the ϕ 20 reached 21 2 mm we should note that the relationship between accumulative evaporation of 20 cm standard pan and soil moisture content measured with the gravimetric sampling was established at early stage of spring summer planting season however there may exist different relationships between accumulative evaporation of 20 cm standard pan and root zone soil moisture content at different growing stages of tomato plants and different growing seasons which needs to be investigated in the future research the amount of irrigation was calculated based on the equation given below 1 i a e p k i p er 1000 where i is the volume of irrigation water m3 a is the area of plot m2 e p is cumulative evaporation of ϕ 20 cm standard evaporation pan mm between two consecutive irrigation events k i is the pan coefficient corresponding four irrigation levels 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 times of ϕ 20 evaporation and p er is the wetted area percent which was set to 80 basd on the technical standard of micro irrigation project 1995 the irrigation water was pumped from a deep well and delivered to each plot with pe pipes of 40 mm in diameter the drip line in the planting plot was the pe pipe of 15 mm in diameter which had in line pressure compensating emitters which discharged 2 5 l h at an operating pressure of 1 atm the emitter spacing was 0 40 m a valve and a water meter were installed at the inlet of each plot to control the irrigation amount to reduce disturbance from other agricultural practices no crop had been planted in the experimental greenhouse for several seasons and thus at the beginning of the spring summer planting season in 2015 the soil moisture content for all plots was relatively uniform not reported here as a result all plots received the same amount of water at transplanting time of the spring summer tomato however at the beginning of the winter spring growing season due to the different irrigation treatments in preceding season and short time gap between end of the spring summer tomato and the start of the winter spring growing season the plots showed slightly different soil moisture conditions not reported here and thus slightly different amounts of water were irrigated to different plots at the transplanting 2 3 crop management tomato plants lycopersicon esculenturn mill cv hl2109 were transplanted on april 15 2015 and uprooted on july 10 2015 and transplanted on october 19 2015 and uprooted on april 12 2016 for the spring summer and winter spring planting seasons respectively after 7 10 days of transplanting white polyethylene mulch 0 005 mm in thickness and 1 2 m in width was placed over the bed except the irrigation management other agronomic measures such as pollination pruning pest control and fertilization were same for all the treatments following the local recommended practices 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 yield and irrigation water use efficiency tomatoes were harvested when approximately 95 of the fruit became red to avoid border effects only plants in the middle part of each planting plot were used for yield estimation and subsequent quality measurements irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg m3 was defined as fresh fruit weight t ha obtained per unit volume of irrigation water applied m3 it was calculated using the below equation 2 iwue y i 100 where y means fruits yield t ha and i refers to the amount of applied irrigation water mm in the whole growing season 2 4 2 tomato fruit nutritional quality measurement tomato fruit quality was measured two times for each planting season for the spring summer tomato the quality measurement was done when the second and third cluster of fruits were red ripened respectively while for the winter spring tomato the fruit quality measurement was done when the first and second cluster of fruits were red ripened respectively three tomato fruits from each plot with similar size maturity and no external defects were selected for measurement of quality the fruit was squeezed to juice in a blender before further bio chemical measurements were taken five quality indexes i e total soluble solids tss total soluble sugar concentration tssc vitamin c vc organic acid oa and lycopene ly were measured based on the method reported by wang et al 2015 the average quality value of individual quality indicator was adopted for further analysis 3 comprehensive nutritional quality and benefit 3 1 comprehensive nutritional quality assessment the principal component analysis pca embedded in many widespread used standard statistical software packages lan et al 2014 is powerful in feature extraction and data reduction with the source of variance being accurately identified lan et al 2014 zabalza et al 2014 it has been proven as an idea appraisement method to evaluate the tomato fruit comprehensive quality jiang et al 2019 li et al 2016 li et al 2021 wang et al 2015 in present study we used the pca to evaluate the tomato fruit nutritional quality and to pick out the best irrigation treatments the details about how to use pca were reported in these studies hao et al 2019 li et al 2016 wang et al 2011a wang et al 2015 the brief procedure is described as follows 3 1 1 making original multiple quality parameter matrix 3 x x 1 i x 1 n x m 1 x mn where x ij is the specific value of corresponding treatment and i 1 2 m j 1 2 n m is the number of the treatment n is the number of the fruit quality parameter 3 1 2 normalizing fruit quality parameters for some parameters the higher value the better quality we normalized using eq 4 to reduce the influence of units 4 zij xij xmax j 100 xij xmax j while for other parameters the lower value the better quality we normalized using eq 5 to reduce the influence of units 5 z ij x min x ij 100 x ij x min j where x ij is indicator j of the treatment i and x max j and x min j are the maximum and minimum values of indicator j among all treatments respectively after this step we get a new multiple quality parameter matrix i e the normalized matrix 6 z z 11 z 1 n z m 1 z mn where z ij is normalized parameter i 1 2 m j 1 2 n m is the number of the treatment n is the number of the fruit parameter 3 1 3 calculating the correlative coefficient matrix 7 r r 11 r 1 n r m 1 r mn where r mn is the correlative coefficient between the evaluating parameter z m and z n 3 1 4 determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are determined from the correlation

eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue λ k 3 1 5 determining the principal components the fk is defined as the kth principal component corresponding to the eigenvalue λ k the coefficient of determination representing the weight of the principal component fik is defined as ck 9 c k λ k n k 1 2 n 10 f mk k 1 n z i k v ik the first principal component fm1 accounts for most variance in the data 3 1 6 determining the comprehensive quality index for each treatment the comprehensive score of each treatment fi compre was calculated with eqs 11 14 11 f i compre j 1 n f i j 12 f j az i b j 13 a uc 14 b uc r i t where f i compre is the comprehensive score of the treatment i f j is the comprehensive score of the primary component j for each treatment u is the transpose of the eigenvector matrix c is a diagonal matrix which is achieved by using a unit matrix which has the same size with the correlation coefficient matrix to divide the standard deviation of the corresponding column of correlation coefficient matrix r is the correlative coefficient matrix and t refers to the function of transpose in matrix operation 3 2 comprehensive benefit assessment the comprehensive benefit evaluation can be achieved through various methods such as the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis the combinational evaluation method the gray relational analysis method and the principal component analysis method among all of them the topsis method is simple and the result is easy to understand it has been commonly used to solve many complicated decision making problems amiri 2010 and also been used in evaluating tomato comprehensive quality liu et al 2019 luo and li 2018 wang et al 2011b and in assessing comprehensive benefit in tomato production under furrow irrigation li et al 2016 in present study we used the topsis to evaluate the comprehensive benefit and to pick out the best irrigation treatments the details about how to use topsis can be found in these studies li et al 2016 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2011b to use topsis weights of evaluation indicators need to be determined first they can be determined with the coefficient of variation method cvm with eqs 15 and 16 details about the procedure of calculation of the weight by using the coefficient of variation method was reported by liu et al 2014 15 w i cv i i 1 n cv i 16 cv i std i mean i where w i is the weight of evaluation indicator i cv i is the variation coefficient of indicator i std i is the standard deviation of evaluation indicator i and mean i is the average of the evaluation indicator i the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis was used to calculate the index value for all treatments and further to determine the comprehensive rank of these treatments details about how to use topsis can be found from liu et al 2014 and wang et al 2011b the brief procedure is described as follows 3 2 1 making weighted matrix 17 q q 11 q 1 n q m 1 q mn where n is the evaluation indicator and m is the treatment 18 q ij w j x ij i 1 m x ij x ij where i 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 n 3 2 2 calculation of weighted euclidean distances the weighted euclidean distance di between qi and positive ideal solution q is given by the below equation 19 d i j 1 n q maxj q ij 2 where i 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 n q maxj is the maximum value of indicator j similarly the weighted euclidean distance di between qi and negative ideal solution q is given by the below equation 20 d i j 1 n q minj q ij 2 where i 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 n q minj is the minimum value of indicator j 3 2 3 calculation the comprehensive benefit for different treatments the relative closeness of comprehensive economic benefit vector of each treatment to the positive ideal solution is defined as the comprehensive quality index ti and it is calculated with eq 21 21 t i d i d i d i note that 0 t i 1 q i q when q i 0 and q i 1 when q i q when q i is close to 1 tomato under the corresponding treatment has better comprehensive benefit i e a better tradeoff of yield comprehensive quality and irrigation water use efficiency 3 3 data analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed with spss 28 published by ibm corp the pca was performed with matlab r2021a the averaged values of all indicators including yield iwue and quality indicators for all treatments were compared for any significant differences among treatments through the duncan s multiple range tests at a significance of 0 05 4 results and discussion 4 1 responses of yield the total irrigation amount for each treatment during two growing seasons are presented in table 1 in the spring summer planting season tomato yields responded significantly to the drip line layout irrigation level and their interactions while in the winter spring planting season tomato yield only responded significantly to the drip line layout irrigation level but not to the interactions between them table 2 in the spring summer planting season the treatment of g2k2 had the highest yield 155 53 t hm and the g1k1 had the lowest yield 91 78 t hm among all treatments while in the winter spring season g2k3 had the highest yield 58 97 t hm and g1k4 had the lowest yield 51 41 t hm among all treatments fig 2 in both experiment seasons under the same drip line layout the yield increased at first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 2 and thus our experiments revealed a phenomenon that there is a threshold for the irrigation amount which means that too little or too much irrigation was not conducive to high yield this finding is in line with li et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 that appropriate irrigation amount is critical in harvesting high tomato yield under the same irrigation level treatments under g2 tended to have higher yield in these two growing seasons this finding is conditionally agree with li and zhang 2010 that the drip irrigation pattern as governed by the drip line layout can significantly affected cotton seed yield they revealed that different drip irrigation patterns could lead to different soil moisture distribution in the root zone which further may affect the water and nutrition uptake of cotton plants and eventually led to different seed yields the postulation of li and zhang 2010 can also be used to explain the yield differences between these two drip line layouts in current study in the present study compared with g1 the g2 drip line layout may promote deeper infiltration into the root zone which would encourage the tomato roots to stretch to deeper soil profile and further facilitate the nutrition uptake and eventually facilitate the yield formation we did collect root data including the mass of root and its distribution within root zone however investigating the effect of drip line layout on roots is beyond the scope of present study and will be investigated in a subsequent paper additionally the g2 drip line layout may result in a smaller proportion of water being lost through soil evaporation which would leave more soil water for the plant and inevitably increase yield the tomato yield gap between the two cropping seasons was obvious the yield of spring summer tomato was significantly higher than that of winter spring tomato at 0 05 significant level this finding is consistent with the report of wang et al 2015 and zotarelli et al 2009 this may be due to the higher temperature and more solar radiation in the spring summer growing season compared with the winter spring growing season and these two meteorological elements favor the yield formation when they are in appropriate ranges our speculation is validated by zotarelli et al 2009 who demonstrated that differences in tomato yield in different cropping seasons can be attributed to substantial differences in temperature and solar radiation coyago cruz et al 2019 also reported that the response of tomato yield to the irrigation treatment was affected by the cropping seasons autumn and spring 4 2 responses of iwue like yield in the spring summer planting season iwue responded significantly to the drip line layout irrigation level and their interactions however while in the winter spring planting season iwue only responded significantly to the drip line layout and irrigation level but not to the interactions between them table 2 for the spring summer planting season the treatment g2k1 had the highest iwue 135 48 kg m3 and the g2k4 had the lowest iwue 69 76 kg m3 while for the winter spring planting season g2k1 had the highest iwue 68 28 kg m3 and g1k4 had the lowest iwue 31 85 kg m3 fig 3 in these two seasons under the same drip line layout the iwue showed decreasing trends with the increase of irrigation amount fig 3 this result is consistent with li et al 2016 who revealed that iwue decreased with the increase of irrigation amount for greenhouse tomato under furrow irrigation in the same region this may be explained as the yield increase did not match the increase of irrigation amount which led to the decrease of iwue under the same irrigation level treatments under g2 tended to have higher iwue except for the k4 treatments in spring summer planting season this may be because that with the same irrigation amount g2 treatments tended to achieve higher yield compared with g1 and thus have the higher iwue like yield the iwue gap between these two cropping seasons were also obvious the iwue of spring summer tomato was significantly higher than that of winter spring tomato at 0 05 significant level this is because that higher temperature and more solar radiation in the spring summer growing season favored the yield formation which led to higher irrigation water productivity or in other words per volume of irrigation water tended to formate more yield under the planting condition of spring summer season compared with the winter spring growing season 4 3 responses of single quality attributes the effects of drip line layout and irrigation amount on individual fruit quality attributes are presented in table 2 and fig 4a e in these two cropping seasons under the same drip line layout the tss tssc and vc tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation levels with some exceptions in the ss season under the same drip line layout the oa tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation levels excepted for g1k2 while for ws season it showed different characteristics for g1 and g2 treatments for the former the oa content did not show a specific trend while for the latter the oa tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation amounts in these two cropping seasons the lycopene content of g1 treatments tended to increase at first and then decrease with the increase of irrigation levels while for g2 treatments it decreased with the increase of irrigation amount all the way the different response of quality attributes to irrigation amount may be due to their formation processes have various sensitivities to irrigation amount our results of fruit quality analyses such as tss and tssc are partly consistent with findings in existing researches ozbahce and tari 2010 patanè et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 the trend for vc in the winter spring tomato is in line with li et al 2016 and wu et al 2018 the content of some quality attributes decrease with the increase of irrigation amount was explained by mitchell et al 1991 and zheng et al 2013 they demonstrated that appropriate increase in irrigation amount facilitates the accumulation of substances in the fruit while water has a diluting effect on the dry biomasses in the fruit after overpass a threshold li et al 2016 reported that the content of total soluble solid and total soluble sugar increased at first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount which validated the explanation of mitchell et al 1991 and zheng et al 2013 we also find that with the same irrigation amount four out of five quality attributes responded differently to the drip line layout with seasonal variations for example the g2 treatments tended to obtain more tss than g1 treatments except for k4 treatments in the ss season the g2 treatments tended to have higher oa than g1 treatments except for k1 treatments in these two cropping seasons the g1 tended to obtain higher vc in ss season while g2 treatments harvested higher vc in the ws season unfortunately the mechanisms behind the effects of drip line layout on tomato fruit nutritional quality are still unknown additionally we find that fruit nutritional qualities responded differently to these two distinct cropping seasons for example the ws season obtained significantly higher tss oa and lycopene than the ss season under same irrigation treatment this may be due to that ws season obtained lower yield where the concentration of nutritional quality attributes was higher 4 4 responses of comprehensive nutritional quality based on a pca analysis the cumulative variance contribution of the first three principal components was 94 for the spring summer tomato and 97 for the winter spring tomato table 3 which contained most of the variance information of fruit quality thus we selected the first three principal components as main principal components in this study the comprehensive quality ranked with pca are shown in table 4 the pca evaluation demonstrated that the g1k3 had the highest and g1k4 had the lowest comprehensive quality for the ss tomato ranked first with a score of 570 46 and ranked eighth with a score of 397 98 respectively while g2k2 had the highest and g1k1 had the lowest comprehensive quality for the ws tomato ranked first with score of 634 57 and ranked eighth with a score of 519 14 respectively there was an obvious tradeoff among different nutritional quality attributes thus to pursue high nutritional quality the g1k3 and g2k2 were the best drip irrigation managements for greenhouse tomato cropping during the spring summer and winter spring seasons respectively 4 5 comprehensive benefit of tomato production in addition to yield and quality farmers in water scarcity regions also want to maximize the irrigation water use efficiency thus the comprehensive fruit quality yield and iwue were used for the comprehensive benefit evaluation in present study the comprehensive benefit ranks by topsis were presented in table 5 g2k2 showed the highest and g1k4 showed the lowest comprehensive benefit in the ss season ranked first with a score of 0 8388 and ranked eighth with a score of 0 2428 respectively while g1k1 showed the highest and g1k4 showed the lowest comprehensive benefit in the ws season ranked first with score of 0 7607 and ranked eighth with a score of 0 0023 respectively the different response of comprehensive benefit to the irrigation treatment in two seasons may be because of different weights of these three indices in two seasons table 6 for the ss tomato the weight of comprehensive quality yield and iwue were 0 24 0 32 and 0 44 respectively while for the ws tomato the weight of comprehensive quality yield and iwue were 0 41 0 28 and 0 32 respectively there were obvious tradeoffs among the fruit nutritional quality yield irrigation water use efficiency in these two cropping seasons this is vital in guiding tomato production to pursue different cropping objectives corresponding irrigation practices should be practiced to be specific to obtain higher yield and iwue in the spring summer season g2 should be chosen to achieve a compromise among fruit quality yield and iwue g2k2 was recommended for the spring summer season while g1k1 was recommended for the winter spring season these insights demonstrate that findings of current study are meaningful not only in fulfilling specific research gaps but also in guiding greenhouse tomato production in northwest china 5 conclusions compared with one drip line irrigating each plant row one drip line servicing two plant rows was a better drip line layout practice for achieving higher tomato yield and irrigation water use efficiency to obtain the highest yield irrigation amount should be 0 8 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan while to maximize the highest irrigation water use efficiency irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 0 6 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan to pursue high comprehensive nutritional quality irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 1 0 and 0 8 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan in the spring summer and winter spring cropping seasons respectively different irrigation practices should be practiced obtaining the highest comprehensive benefit a tradeoff of yield comprehensive quality and irrigation water use efficiency in two cropping seasons spring summer and winter spring season for the former one drip line for two planting rows should be adopted and irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 0 8 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan while for the latter one drip line for each planting row should be adopted and irrigation amount at each irrigation event should be 0 6 times of accumulated evaporation from the 20 cm standard pan proposed future research should deeply dig mechanisms behind responses of tomato to different drip line layouts 1 does the drip line layout affect tomato root distribution in root zone soil profile through affecting irrigation water distribution 2 does the drip line layout affect tomato yield and fruit quality through affecting tomato plant growth indicators such as plant height stem diameter

9423,saline sodic soils are often too saline and alkaline for plant survival these soils are prone to dispersing and eroding after high rainfall events when salinity is reduced before the sodicity cost effective and water efficient methods are needed to leach salts while maintaining sufficient ionic strength of the soil solution we tested the ability of gypsum both alone and combined with elemental sulfur and organic matter to remediate the upper 15 cm of a strongly saline sodic alkaline vertosol when leached with deionised water in repacked columns prior to leaching all amendment combinations reduced soil alkalinity by 80 and dispersion by 47 by displacing exchangeable sodium na after leaching with 600 mm of deionised water electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecss decreased from an average of 38 4 8 ds m 1 at 8 cm depth importantly structure was maintained in all amended soils despite this decrease in ecss in contrast for the control treatment there was a concomitant loss of soil structural stability as ecss decreased this decrease in stability also occurred in the subsoils of all treatments which were not amended because the applied calcium ca precipitated before it could be leached to remediate the deeper layers this study demonstrated that it was critical to first apply amendments as deep in the soil profile as possible to prevent the development of a non saline sodic soil leaching the soil with low ionic strength water removed excess soluble salts from the plant root zone we estimated that 300 mm of water rainfall or irrigation

plants can establish in order to reduce erosion and thereby stabilise the landscape li and kang 2020 this step requires leaching with good quality i e low ionic strength water to reduce salinity and alkalinity in the root zone fig 1 however using water with low ionic strength can cause clay colloids to rapidly disperse clog soil pores and degrade soil structural stability particularly at the surface van olphen 1977 agassi et al 1981 shainberg et al 1992 regions with intense and sporadic rainfall present an additional challenge because rainwater further dilutes the ionic strength of soil solution suarez et al 2008 tirado corbalá et al 2019 a non saline sodic soil may develop in the topsoil after prolonged leaching making the soil more susceptible to water erosion and restricting air and water movement qadir et al 2005 this limits plant growth and the potential for further leaching in the subsoil furthermore soils with vertic properties of 2 1 clay minerals promote swelling

caco3 elemental s fine powder 1 mm was added in some treatments to reduce the ph of the topsoil to 8 2 2 mg g 1 soil at 15 cm depth equivalent to 3 5 t ha 1 the amount of s required to reduce the soil to ph 8 was determined by the soil alkalinity titration table 1 in the other treatments no s was added but gypsum was added at a higher rate of 81 mg g 1 soil equivalent to 126 t ha 1 with this increased rate of gypsum sufficient to not only precipitate alkalinity as insoluble caco3 in the top 15 cm of the soil but also supply ca to lower the sar finally om cut grass hay residue was investigated for its potential to improve soil structure and thereby assist in the leaching of salinity and limiting soil structural degradation an application rate of ca 10 20 t ha 1 has previously been found to be effective for improving vegetation growth in saline and sodic soils tejada et al 2006 gill et al 2008 wong et al 2009 locally sourced para grass hay urochloa mutica forssk stapf was

referred to as i control ii g iii gs iv gom v gsom and vi gsom h changes in soil properties during the experimental period were assessed using hollow fibre soil solution samplers and measurements of dispersion indices in solid phase samples progressive assessment of changes in solid phase soil structural stability was made by three destructive harvests of soil columns during the experimental period the experiment consisted of six treatments with each treatment having 12 columns four replicates each for three destructive harvests for a total of 72 experimental units the experiment was arranged in a randomised block design 2 4 column preparation and irrigation columns were prepared using pvc pipes 150 mm internal diameter 600 mm high packed with topsoil 0 15 cm and subsoil 15 50 cm using field bulk density values of 1 0 g cm 3 for topsoil and 1 3 g cm 3 for subsoil soil amendments were mixed into the topsoil during packing to pack the soil it was divided into six equal volumes and sufficient water added to achieve ca 33 gravimetric water content g g a 33 water content was determined as the highest water content possible to retain coherence and consistency upon packing progressively after packing each individual layer to the correct depth ca 8 3 cm the top 2 cm was re disturbed to limit the formation of distinct boundaries within the profile in one set of columns i e the set which would be the last to be destructively harvested a total of 10 poly acrylonitrile hollow fibre soil solution samplers were inserted at five depths 8 15 25 35 and 45 cm with two samplers per depth menzies and guppy 2000 the columns were placed inside a facility where they were shaded and protected from rain but were at ambient temperature with daily minimum temperatures ranging between 14 and 24 c and daily maximum temperatures ranging between 27 and 34 c the columns were left to equilibrate for 3 6 d before leaching to allow for dissolution of gypsum and exchange of ca2 on the soil exchange surface fig 2 in this experiment we were interested in the effects of volume of low ionic strength water rather than the rate of water infiltration therefore the application of infiltration water was staggered to allow for the lagging treatments to catch up avoid the development of anoxic conditions and maintain field capacity for consistency in soil solution extraction columns were leached with approximately 575 ml 33 mm deionised water applied to the columns for 7 d every 1 2 weeks via a mariotte bottle system head of 5 mm during irrigation soil water content ranged from field capacity 0 41 g g to saturation 0 56 g g and were equilibrated back to field capacity when soil solution was extracted surface evaporation was calculated as 2 mm d 1 december to march and 0 7 mm d 1 april to august based on pan evaporation and outdoor evaporation data the experiment ran for 40 weeks in total table s2 2 5 collection and analysis of soil solution samples soil solution extracts were collected using centrifuge drainage gillman 1976 from duplicate treatments soil 500 g treated with the appropriate amendments at 33 gravimetric water content and after 24 h incubation to create a uniform baseline of the beginning of the experiment i e time 0 before irrigation fig 2 thereafter soil solution samples were collected every 2 3 weeks from replicate columns fitted with solution samplers see above soil solution samples were analysed for ph ec and major elements ca mg na k and s by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes varian vista pro and major anions cl so4 2 no3 no2 by ion chromatography soil solution alkalinity was calculated from the measurement of ph and total inorganic carbon tic on a total organic carbon toc analyser shimadzu toc l total carbon in solution was measured by dry combustion infrared gas analyser non dispersive infrared sensor ndir the measurement of tic was achieved by sparging of the co2 released during acid treatment 25 w w phosphoric acid ph 3 and then measured by ndir 2 6 collection of solid phase samples timing for each destructive harvest was based on changes in soil solution ec ecss values with the first destructive harvest made when ecss had decreased by ca 10 20 ds m 1 for most treatments it should be noted that the rate of water infiltration varied between amended treatments 150 170 mm and the non amended control soil 200 mm at the first destructive harvest supplementary table s3 in the control treatment infiltration significantly decreased after the first destructive harvest and despite having extra time to infiltrate only reached 300 mm infiltration at the end of the experiment for each destructive harvest the columns were cut open and soil samples collected from five depths 0 8 8 15 15 25 25 35 and 35 45 cm sub samples were used for determination of gravimetric water content following drying at 105 c whilst the remaining soil was dried at 35 c until a constant weight was obtained then ground to 2 mm 2 7 soil structural stability testing dispersion indices give an effective assessment of soil structural stability to correlate chemical and physical properties of the soil gupta et al 1984 suarez et al 1984 barzegar et al 1997 a simple analytical method for testing rainfall dispersible clay was developed for this study by measuring dispersible clay by optical transmission based on previous methods in the literature suarez et al 1984 miller and baharuddin 1986 burt et al 1993 barzegar et al 1997 briefly 300 mg of air dried soil was combined with 30 ml of deionised water in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and placed on an end over end shaker for 1 h 19 cycles min 1 and left to stand for 22 h a 2 ml aliquot was sampled at 1 cm depth and placed into 1 6 ml cuvettes for optical transmission analysis at 410 nm 2 8 calculating infiltration volume for soil recovery the volume of infiltration water required to establish plants was estimated by assessing the ecss at each soil depth for each treatment rhodes grass was selected as a model species because it demonstrates salt tolerance in soil solution with an ec of 23 ds m 1 corresponding to a 50 reduction in shoot growth russell 1976 qadir et al 2005 rhodes grass has been observed to establish with a minimum soil depth of 15 cm kumar and abrol 1983 malkin and waisel 1986 wehr et al 2006 2016 therefore we aimed to define the volume of water required to leach the top 15 cm of soil to an ecss 23 ds m 1 for plants to establish and a further 100 cm profile for plants to survive high evapotranspiration demands in the summer months plant available water capacity mm was calculated from the difference between fc and pwp 2 9 chemical modelling and statistical analyses thermodynamic modelling of the soil solution was performed using phreeqci version 3 3 12 and the pitzer database parkhurst and appelo 2013 results were compared using a two way analysis of variance anova with a 95 confidence interval to identify significant effects of treatments on chemical properties soil solution sar ec and anion composition and physical properties dispersion at time 0 and at the end of the experiment a one way anova was used to determine i differences between soil depths within a treatment ii differences between treatments within a harvest or sampling period and iii between harvests for each treatment tukey s test with a 95 confidence interval was used to assess significant differences between treatments all analyses were conducted using minitab 16 software 3 results 3 1 electrical conductivity the ecss was measured as an indicator of ionic strength alva et al 1991 changes in ecss were of interest because salinity high ionic strength is most likely the greatest plant growth limiting factor in this soil applying amendments prior to irrigation i e time 0 resulted in a significant increase p 0 001 in ecss from 28 ds m 1 control to between 36 ds m 1 in the g treatment and 40 ds m 1 in the gsom h treatment fig 3 with no significant differences between amendment treatments this increase in ecss was caused by the dissolution of the gypsum and the displacement of na from the soil s exchange complex by ca supplementary fig s1 there was a considerable decrease in ecss for all treatments after infiltration of deionised water as the soluble salts were leached with the infiltrating water this decrease was particularly evident at the surface where the magnitude of the reduction was greater than for the subsoils for example in the gom treatment 600 mm of infiltration was sufficient to decrease ecss at the topsoil 8 cm by approximately 11 fold from 38 to 3 3 ds m 1 whereas at a depth of 25 cm in the same treatment the ecss reduced only three fold from 30 to 7 7 ds m 1 fig 3 3 2 alkalinity even prior to commencing leaching time 0 the addition of amendments significantly reduced soil solution alkalinity p 0 001 with average soil solution alkalinity decreasing by 5730 mg l 1 caco3 equivalent upon addition of amendments fig 3 the most substantial decrease in alkalinity a 10 fold decrease was observed in the amended soils which did not contain om i e g and gs treatments the treatment with the lowest initial decrease in alkalinity was the gsom h treatment which had a two fold decrease in alkalinity to 3540 mg l 1 as caco3 equivalent p 0 001 however after 600 mm infiltration there were no significant differences in alkalinity between treatments the alkalinity of the subsoil below the amended topsoil gradually decreased but compared to the topsoil the overall magnitude of alkalinity decrease in the subsoil was significantly smaller p 0 001 soil solution ph phss data is not presented because alkalinity was calculated as a function of ph in general the addition of amendments resulted in a comparatively rapid and significant decrease in phss in all treatments prior to the commencement of irrigation from a phss of 10 2 in the control to an average of 8 6 p 0 001 however differences between amendment combinations were not significant treatments containing om in the topsoil achieved a phss of 8 with less infiltration than those that did not contain om after 600 mm infiltration all amended topsoil treatments further decreased to an average phss of 7 5 at 8 cm and 8 1 at 15 cm 3 3 dispersion indices all amendment treatments increased optical transmission i e decreased dispersion and thus improved soil structural stability compared to the control treatment at time 0 the addition of gypsum increased optical transmission from 64 in the control to an average of 94 in the amended topsoil layers 0 15 cm fig 4 optical transmission remained high in amended topsoils during leaching with values of 94 99 after 200 300 mm infiltration however after 600 mm some surface soils 0 8 cm layer began to decrease in soil structural stability for example in the g treatment optical transmission decreased from 99 to 84 p 0 001 whilst this decrease was not considered likely to be critical to soil structural stability it indicated that soil stability was beginning to decrease and may require an additional surface application of gypsum conversely in the control treatment optical transmission decreased from 64 to 2 with increasing infiltration p 0 001 fig 4 indicating that soil structural stability decreased with the leaching of soluble salts for the subsoil below the amended topsoil treatments 15 25 cm layer changes in optical transmission depended on the volume of infiltration for example in the gs treatment soil stability initially decreased after 130 mm of infiltration then improved after 350 mm infiltration and finally decreased substantially to 8 5 after 600 mm infiltration in contrast it was not until 600 mm infiltration that an improvement in soil structural stability was observed in the gom and gsom h treatments the gom treatment optical transmission also improved substantially from 12 to 68 p 0 001 in the 15 25 cm layer this indicates an interaction between the amended topsoil and infiltration which may have allowed some ca to be leached down the soil profile and precipitated as caco3 the lower layers of the subsoil i e 25 35 cm and 35 45 cm layers continued to decrease in soil structural stability with increasing infiltration 3 4 soluble cation concentrations including sar prior to leaching time 0 the addition of gypsum increased concentrations of soluble ca substantially from 0 6 mm in the control to an average of 15 mm fig 4 furthermore the ca concentration within the soil solution of the topsoil remained relatively constant with increasing infiltration due to the progressive dissolution of gypsum thermodynamic modelling of gypsum reacting with the measured soil solution cation and anion composition estimated a ca concentration of 13 mm thus confirming the soil was at saturation and that caco3 was most likely being precipitated supplementary file simulation s1 after 600 mm infiltration the gs treatment had the highest ca concentration 17 mm compared to both the g and gom treatments 13 mm p 0 001 despite the elevated ca concentrations in the amended topsoils concentrations in the subsoil below amended topsoil remained similar to ca concentrations in the subsoil of the control thus any soluble ca which leached below the topsoil layer was assumed to have precipitated as caco3 due to its high alkalinity and ph fig 3 changes in soil solution sar reflected the changes described above for ca fig 3 and na supplementary fig s1 with the greatest decrease in sar being for the topsoil supplementary fig s1 before leaching the addition of gypsum decreased the average sar in all treatments from 431 to 126 p 0 001 after 600 mm infiltration average sar of the amended topsoils was 8 with no significant differences between amendment combinations 3 5 soluble anion concentrations chloride cl is often used as a simple measure for indicating salinity because is usually moves with na however given the high carbonate content in the saline sodic alkaline soil it was important to distinguish between anion sources concentrations of cl increased slightly with amendment addition prior to leaching and then decreased substantially with increasing infiltration supplementary fig s2 the rate of cl leaching slowed in the subsoil layers but not to the same extent as na the addition of gypsum and s prior to leaching time 0 caused a significant increase in so4 s concentration from 15 mm to between 220 mm and 250 mm p 0 001 supplementary fig s2 after 600 mm infiltration the so4 s concentration at 8 cm decreased to an average of 28 mm whereas treatments to which elemental s was applied did not have higher concentrations of so4 s in the soil solution compared to the g and gom treatments 3 6 infiltration volume required for soil remediation on average 300 mm infiltration was sufficient to reduce the ecss to 23 ds m 1 or less to a depth of 15 cm in a saline sodic alkaline vertosol fig 3 fig 5 depending on the treatment there were slight differences between rate of ecss decrease and the volume of infiltration but these differences were comparatively small fig 5 after 600 mm of infiltration all amendment combinations achieved an ecss of 23 ds m 1 at 45 cm depth as the data in the present study were limited to a depth of 45 cm this relationship was extrapolated to determine the volume of infiltration required to remediate the soil to 100 cm depth assuming that all water that infiltrated ended up as deep drainage fig 5 this would allow sufficient pawc to keep plants alive during periods of high evaporative demand in queensland vertosols hochman 2001 a simple linear regression of the amended treatments i e y 0 0772x 6 0842 r2 0 86 determined that to achieve a remediated soil profile ecss of 23 ds m 1 of 100 cm depth approximately 1400 mm of infiltration water is required this corresponded to a pawc of approximately 165 mm for 100 cm depth fig 5 4 discussion this study demonstrated that it is possible to remediate a strongly saline sodic alkaline vertosol to a condition where plants could theoretically grow by applying ca based amendments such as gypsum including in combination with other amendments followed by leaching the soil with just 300 mm low ionic strength water this order of application was critically important to allow for 1 a decrease in sodicity and alkalinity in order to improve soil structural stability and infiltration and 2 a decrease in salinity by leaching excess salts with low ionic strength water conversely the control treatment demonstrated that leaching a saline sodic alkaline vertosol in the absence of amendments can create a non saline sodic soil e g pathway 1 in fig 1 with poor structure and infiltration fig 3 and fig 4 4 1 maintaining infiltration by amending with gypsum soil structural stability was maintained in the topsoil despite the ongoing decrease in ionic strength ecss caused by progressive leaching fig 3 fig 4 this was achieved with a gypsum application that was calculated to displace the na from the soil exchange complex and to neutralise alkalinity maintaining soil structural stability and infiltration rate enabled the decrease the ecss of the amended topsoils from an average of 37 5 6 ds m 1 at 8 cm depth fig 3 these findings align with diffuse double layer theory in clay soils van olphen 1977 sposito 2008 and other column experiments mckenna et al 2019 tirado corbalá et al 2019 because applying gypsum increased the valency of the ions on the soil exchange complex the continued dissolution of gypsum provided ca to balance the reduction of ionic strength of the soil solution during leaching thereby maintaining soil structural stability soluble ca concentrations were expected to increase in amended treatments along with the concomitant precipitation of caco3 this is because adding gypsum to sodic and alkaline soils increases soil solution ca concentrations above the solubility of calcite which results in the precipitation of calcite and the consumption of alkalinity lindsay 1979 indeed the ecss increased by 8 ds m 1 in the g treatment compared to the control at time 0 fig 3 this was not expected as thermodynamic modelling estimated an increase of 0 9 ds m 1 for the dissolution of gypsum supplementary file simulation s1 this increase was attributed to the ongoing dissolution of gypsum with ca moving onto the soil exchange complex and displacing na into the solution thereby increasing the ecss this reaction demonstrated the importance of delaying the revegetation process until the initial phases i e 100 300 mm of leaching are completed and ecss in the top soil is below pre amendment values dispersion indices are widely accepted as an appropriate and modern method for soil stability assessment e g basga et al 2018 liang et al 2021 including in saline sodic soils miranda et al 2018 a major critique of the use of optical transmission is that results are relative to the size and mineralogy of the suspended particles abu sharar 1988 however our method was paired with soil solution chemical analyses and therefore can be compared to other studies the correlation between ca in solution 1 mm and low clay dispersion fig 4 demonstrated that the analytical method developed for this study to determine soil structural stability was suitable this relationship agreed with threshold electrolyte concentration curves in vertic soils for irrigation of water with varying concentrations of dissolved salts onto agricultural land cass and sumner 1982 curtin et al 1994 quirk 2001 evangelou and marsi 2003 dikinya et al 2007 our method also provided a simple cheap and consistent method of assessment which directly measures the effect of the effect of low ionic strength water on soil physical properties 4 2 effect of different amendment combinations all amendment combinations were similarly effective in improving soil structural stability reducing sodicity and alkalinity and reducing salinity after leaching compared to the control treatment this uniformity in results was not expected as previous efforts have demonstrated improved rehabilitation was dependent on amendment combinations mahmoodabadi et al 2013 adding om did not influence soil structural stability in the present study in contrast with previous research which demonstrated either increased soil structural stability sekhon and bajwa 1993 vance et al 1998 tejada et al 2006 prapagar et al 2012 chaganti et al 2015 or increased soil dispersion gupta et al 1984 the results of this study may be attributed to several points of difference firstly each study in the literature used different om materials varying in structure and length of c chains which may have influenced the stabilising effects of the om oades 1984 secondly the addition of gypsum was proportionally larger compared to these previous studies and may have masked other amendment effects finally om may not have had the same beneficial effects under the low evaporative conditions in the current study compared to field experiments where it could influence evaporation there were however minor differences in alkalinity for the high om treatment fig 3 we assume this was an artefact caused by dissolved co2 measured as inorganic c from increased microbial activity during om decomposition rather than an actual increase in alkalinity from inorganic c in the soil geochemical modelling indicated that the solution was likely in equilibrium with a co2 concentration of 1000 2000 μmol mol 1 being 3 to 6 fold higher than atmospheric values data not presented small differences between treatments containing s were observed in this study supplementary fig s2 despite ca solubility being higher in gs than g alone this did not improve soil structural stability and alkalinity fig 4 other studies found the use of s based amendments were effective at increasing ca availability in calcareous soils and neutralising soil ph both with and without gypsum amezketa et al 2005 zia et al 2006 mckenna et al 2019 this result was attributed to the sufficient application of gypsum 102 t ha 1 mined gypsum to effectively remediate and stabilise soil structural stability therefore land managers could use elemental s to neutralise alkalinity depending on its availability and the cost of gypsum 4 3 ability of amendments to remediate soil below the depth of incorporation the combination of s and om with gypsum did not increase the movement of ca down the soil profile as expected fig 4 therefore soil structural stability did not improve at depth but in most cases it decreased our results reflect findings from previous research using gypsum application alone and with a similar volume of infiltration frenkel et al 1989 ilyas et al 1993 1997 we attribute this subsoil constraint to the extremely high subsoil alkalinity fig 3 causing any soluble ca to be precipitated as caco3 and thus inhibiting its transport to deeper layers of the subsoil with infiltration consequently it will be important for land managers to monitor field conditions to prevent developing perched water tables and waterlogging if subsoil structural stability declines however given that the soil was a shrink swell self mulching soil structure at depth is expected to gradually improve over longer periods of time through drying cycles grant and blackmore 1991 therefore it is recommended that gypsum and other amendments are incorporated into the soil to the greatest depth possible given that direct incorporation of gypsum was the most effective way of displacing na from the soil s exchange complex 4 4 practical solutions longevity of amendments and establishing plants as a practical safeguard surface reapplication of gypsum may be necessary to maintain ionic strength of the soil solution after substantial leaching has occurred this study measured a ca concentration in soil solution of 14 mmol l at 8 cm depth fig 4 for our application rate of 102 t ha 1 mined gypsum to 15 cm depth approximately 1600 mm of infiltration will solubilise all the gypsum in the top 8 cm 9 t ca ha 1 or 22 4 m ca m 2 therefore a low rate of surface reapplication of gypsum should occur after 1200 1500 mm of infiltration to maintain surface soil structural stability for initial plant establishment this study demonstrated that 300 mm of infiltration could improve soil chemical conditions to allow for root growth of a salt tolerant plant such as rhodes grass in the amended topsoil layers 15 cm depth of a saline sodic alkaline vertosol fig 5 furthermore 1400 mm of infiltration could potentially provide plants with a 100 cm deep root zone and 165 mm of plant available water at a salinity of 23 ds m 1 however to ensure seedling survival it is critical that pawc must not only be maintained to ensure continued plant survival but it must also be exceeded to ensure further leaching below 15 cm and increase rooting depth for example within the study region of south east queensland australia evaporative demand largely exceeds rainfall bom 2018 therefore pawc may be insufficient to sustain plant survival in saline conditions particularly given that drought periods may occur and thus continued irrigation may be required therefore a remediated root zone of 80 100 cm may be required for successful site rehabilitation given that rhodes grass is known to extract water to 150 cm depth in queensland soils shelton and dalzell 2007 this root zone can provide adequate pawc ca 100 mm in queensland vertosols hochman et al 2001 sufficient to keep plants alive during periods of high evaporative demand typically during september to april bom 2018 finally it is necessary to consider the source of water used to infiltrate the soil using existing data on deep drainage from queensland of 5 mm year 1 for a pasture system silburn et al 2011 tolmie et al 2011 to increase the remediated root zone to 100 cm depth relying solely on rainfall it would take 280 years for 1400 mm of deep drainage to move below the root zone in a depression zone i e assuming 100 infiltration and 0 runoff such as an evaporation pond therefore in this case irrigation water would likely be required to initiate leaching for plant establishment 5 conclusion this study is one of few to investigate remediation of salt affected soils in subtropical context it took a novel approach to demonstrate detailed changes in soil chemical and physical properties of an amended and a non amended highly saline sodic soil with the infiltration of 600 mm low ionic strength water furthermore it demonstrated the combination of gypsum and other amendments s and om were not strictly advantageous in maintaining ionic strength to facilitate salt leaching this study also provides critical soil solution input data to advance the field of hydraulic modelling of saline sodic soils and to allow for longer term estimation of soil recovery future research for remediation of saline sodic soils should aim to quantify the leaching fraction required to balance evapotranspiration and salt leaching to avoid the point of no return i e developing a non saline sodic soil the order of remediation was found to be critical to ensure that the soil remained stable during leaching to remove soluble salts specifically it was necessary to ensure that amendments were applied to the soil prior to leaching all amendment combinations reduced soil solution ph alkalinity and dispersion the key aspect of successful remediation being the sufficient application of gypsum and supply of ca to neutralise alkalinity and displace na from the soil exchange complex in turn the improved soil structural stability enhanced and maintained infiltration to reduce ecss to a suitable soil depth for plant establishment however soluble ca did not move down the profile despite being applied at a rate to displace na to a depth of 30 cm infiltration of 600 mm of deionised water was sufficient for this saline sodic alkaline vertosol to decrease ecss from 27 ds m 1 to 23 ds m 1 to a depth of 45 cm with this ecss value 23 ds m 1 corresponding to a 50 growth reduction for the model species rhodes grass extrapolating the results of this experiment allowed the prediction of long term site recovery and movement of salt further research into plant growth should follow this experiment to take evapotranspiration into account with the use of amendments and different leaching regimes effective amelioration is therefore recommended in the order of 1 sufficient amendment application according to the soil cec and soil alkalinity with gypsum and additional s to the maximum depth possible 2 leaching of salts with 300 mm of water infiltration this leaching should be achieved by irrigation in cases where deep drainage by rainfall is insufficient 3 surface reapplication of gypsum 1 5 t ha 1 after ca 1400 mm infiltration to ensure surface soil structural stability 4 planting salt tolerant species such as rhodes grass and 5 continue leaching to produce 1400 mm deep drainage to ameliorate a target root zone of 100 cm depth irrigation should be managed to increase deep drainage where possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9423,saline sodic soils are often too saline and alkaline for plant survival these soils are prone to dispersing and eroding after high rainfall events when salinity is reduced before the sodicity cost effective and water efficient methods are needed to leach salts while maintaining sufficient ionic strength of the soil solution we tested the ability of gypsum both alone and combined with elemental sulfur and organic matter to remediate the upper 15 cm of a strongly saline sodic alkaline vertosol when leached with deionised water in repacked columns prior to leaching all amendment combinations reduced soil alkalinity by 80 and dispersion by 47 by displacing exchangeable sodium na after leaching with 600 mm of deionised water electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecss decreased from an average of 38 4 8 ds m 1 at 8 cm depth importantly structure was maintained in all amended soils despite this decrease in ecss in contrast for the control treatment there was a concomitant loss of soil structural stability as ecss decreased this decrease in stability also occurred in the subsoils of all treatments which were not amended because the applied calcium ca precipitated before it could be leached to remediate the deeper layers this study demonstrated that it was critical to first apply amendments as deep in the soil profile as possible to prevent the development of a non saline sodic soil leaching the soil with low ionic strength water removed excess soluble salts from the plant root zone we estimated that 300 mm of water rainfall or irrigation

yensen and biel 2006 with estimated costs of us 40 billion per year fao 2013 the area of land affected by salinity and sodicity is increasing globally due to the extraction and deposition by irrigation evaporation or storage of marginal quality groundwater that contains elevated concentrations of carbonates and sodium na as a result soils that may not typically be affected by surface

soluble carbonates and a ph above 8 3 qadir et al 2005 saline sodic soils present a series of challenges for land managers and advisors the difficulty lies in preparing the soil to a condition where plants can establish in order to reduce erosion and thereby stabilise the landscape li and kang 2020 this step requires leaching with good quality i e low ionic strength water to reduce salinity and alkalinity in the root zone fig 1 however using water with low ionic strength can cause clay colloids to rapidly disperse clog soil pores and degrade soil structural stability particularly at the surface van olphen 1977 agassi et al 1981 shainberg et al 1992 regions with intense and sporadic rainfall present an additional challenge because rainwater further dilutes the ionic strength of soil solution suarez et al 2008 tirado corbalá et al 2019 a non saline sodic soil may develop in the topsoil after prolonged leaching making the soil more susceptible to water erosion and restricting air and water movement qadir et al 2005 this limits plant growth and the potential for further leaching in the subsoil furthermore soils with vertic properties of 2 1 clay minerals promote swelling dispersion and waterlogging in the presence of na and water further exacerbating the effects of poor soil structure and water infiltration qadir et al 2007 soil amendments such as gypsum caso4 2 h2o elemental sulfur s and organic matter om are commonly employed to address soil structural stability by promoting flocculation improving infiltration and reducing alkalinity to facilitate the leaching

the potentially deleterious effects of intense rainfall and other low ionic strength water on soil structural stability suarez et al 2006 2008 furthermore little is known about the volume of low ionic strength water required to allow for plant establishment this is particularly important as large rainfall events equivalent to 100 mm d may fall unexpectedly bom 2018 few studies have evaluated remediation of subsoil layers below the depth of amendment application vance et al 1998 mckenna et al 2019 and a best practice method is yet to be determined to examine these challenges a highly saline sodic alkaline vertosol from south east queensland australia was studied to i examine changes in soil chemical ec alkalinity sar and physical properties soil structural stability following the application of deionised water ii compare the effectiveness of different amendment combinations for soil remediation iii identify interactions between amendments in the topsoil and the behaviour of

by x ray diffraction supplementary table s1 the gravimetric water content g g was calculated from intact soil cores taken at three depths 10 40 and 80 cm soil from the cores was placed on a tension table to absorb water to saturation by pore suction then pressure was applied at field capacity fc 10 kpa suction and permanent wilting point pwp 1500 kpa suction and allowed to equilibrate for 2 weeks supplementary table s2 klute and dirksen 1986 2 2 determining amendment application rates three amendments gypsum s and om were selected to achieve three inter related effects with their primary purpose being to maintain soil structure whilst the soluble salts were being leached firstly mined gypsum 17 5 ca was selected to displace na from the soil exchange complex and to increase soil solution ionic strength and thereby reduce the width of the diffuse double layer between clay particles and thus promote clay flocculation the gypsum application rate was calculated to sufficiently saturate the soil s exchange complex with ca assuming 100 replacement of na 100 gypsum dissolution and no cation competition to a depth of 30 cm 66 mg g 1 soil equivalent to 102 t ha 1 prior to application gypsum was air dried 40 c ground and sieved to 2 mm secondly two amendments were investigated to lower soil alkalinity and limit the precipitation of the soluble ca from the gypsum as caco3 elemental s fine powder 1 mm was added in some treatments to reduce the ph of the topsoil to 8 2 2 mg g 1 soil at 15 cm depth equivalent to 3 5 t ha 1 the amount of s required to reduce the soil to ph 8 was determined by the soil alkalinity titration table 1 in the other treatments no s was added but gypsum was added at a higher rate of 81 mg g 1 soil equivalent to 126 t ha 1 with this increased rate of gypsum sufficient to not only precipitate alkalinity as insoluble caco3 in the top 15 cm of the soil but also supply ca to lower the sar finally om cut grass hay residue was investigated for its potential to improve soil structure and thereby assist in the leaching of salinity and limiting soil structural degradation an application rate of ca 10 20 t ha 1 has previously been found to be effective for improving vegetation growth in saline and sodic soils tejada et al 2006 gill et al 2008 wong et al 2009 locally sourced para grass hay urochloa mutica forssk stapf was cut to 5 cm length prior to application to a depth of 15 cm 6 9 mg g 1 soil equivalent to 10 t ha 1 or 35 mg g 1 soil equivalent to 50 t ha 1 2 3 experimental design six treatments were investigated

referred to as i control ii g iii gs iv gom v gsom and vi gsom h changes in soil properties during the experimental period were assessed using hollow fibre soil solution samplers and measurements of dispersion indices in solid phase samples progressive assessment of changes in solid phase soil structural stability was made by three destructive harvests of soil columns during the experimental period the experiment consisted of six treatments with each treatment having 12 columns four replicates each for three destructive harvests for a total of 72 experimental units the experiment was arranged in a randomised block design 2 4 column preparation and irrigation columns were prepared using pvc pipes 150 mm internal diameter 600 mm high packed with topsoil 0 15 cm and subsoil 15 50 cm using field bulk density values of 1 0 g cm 3 for topsoil and 1 3 g cm 3 for subsoil soil amendments were mixed into the topsoil during packing to pack the soil it was divided into six equal volumes and sufficient water added to achieve ca 33 gravimetric water content g g a 33 water content was determined as the highest water content possible to retain coherence and consistency upon packing progressively after packing each individual layer to the correct depth ca 8 3 cm the top 2 cm was re disturbed to limit the formation of distinct boundaries within the profile in one set of columns i e the set which would be the last to be destructively harvested a total of 10 poly acrylonitrile hollow fibre soil solution samplers were inserted at five depths 8 15 25 35 and 45 cm with two samplers per depth menzies and guppy 2000 the columns were placed inside a facility where they were shaded and protected from rain but were at ambient temperature with daily minimum temperatures ranging between 14 and 24 c and daily maximum temperatures ranging between 27 and 34 c the columns were left to equilibrate for 3 6 d before leaching to allow for dissolution of gypsum and exchange of ca2 on the soil exchange surface fig 2 in this experiment we were interested in the effects of volume of low ionic strength water rather than the rate of water infiltration therefore the application of infiltration water was staggered to allow for the lagging treatments to catch up avoid the development of anoxic conditions and maintain field capacity for consistency in soil solution extraction columns were leached with approximately 575 ml 33 mm deionised water applied to the columns for 7 d every 1 2 weeks via a mariotte bottle system head of 5 mm during irrigation soil water content ranged from field capacity 0 41 g g to saturation 0 56 g g and were equilibrated back to field capacity when soil solution was extracted surface evaporation was calculated as 2 mm d 1 december to march and 0 7 mm d 1 april to august based on pan evaporation and outdoor evaporation data the experiment ran for 40 weeks in total table s2 2 5 collection and analysis of soil solution samples soil solution extracts were collected using centrifuge drainage gillman 1976 from duplicate treatments soil 500 g treated with the appropriate amendments at 33 gravimetric water content and after 24 h incubation to create a uniform baseline of the beginning of the experiment i e time 0 before irrigation fig 2 thereafter soil solution samples were collected every 2 3 weeks from replicate columns fitted with solution samplers see above soil solution samples were analysed for ph ec and major elements ca mg na k and s by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes varian

released during acid treatment 25 w w phosphoric acid ph 3 and then measured by ndir 2 6 collection of solid phase samples timing for each destructive harvest was based on changes in soil solution ec ecss values with the first destructive harvest made when ecss had decreased by ca 10 20 ds m 1 for most treatments it should be noted that the rate of water infiltration varied between amended treatments 150 170 mm and the non amended control soil 200 mm at the first destructive harvest supplementary table s3 in the control treatment infiltration significantly decreased after the first destructive harvest and despite having extra time to infiltrate only reached 300 mm infiltration at the end of the experiment for each destructive harvest the columns were cut open and soil samples collected from five depths 0 8 8 15 15 25 25 35 and 35 45 cm sub samples were used for determination of gravimetric water content following drying at 105 c whilst the remaining soil was dried at 35 c until a constant weight was obtained then ground to 2 mm 2 7 soil structural stability testing dispersion indices give an effective assessment of soil structural stability to correlate chemical and physical properties of the soil gupta et al 1984 suarez et al 1984 barzegar et al 1997 a simple analytical method for testing rainfall dispersible clay was developed for this study by measuring dispersible clay by optical transmission based on previous methods in the literature suarez et al 1984 miller and baharuddin 1986 burt et al 1993 barzegar et al 1997 briefly 300 mg of air dried soil was combined with 30 ml of deionised water in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and placed on an end over end shaker for 1 h 19 cycles min 1 and left to stand for 22 h a 2 ml aliquot was sampled at 1 cm depth and placed into 1 6 ml cuvettes for optical transmission analysis at 410 nm 2 8 calculating infiltration volume for soil recovery the volume of infiltration water required to establish plants was estimated by assessing the ecss at each soil depth for each treatment rhodes grass was selected as a model species because it demonstrates salt tolerance in soil solution with an ec of 23 ds m 1 corresponding to a 50 reduction in shoot growth russell 1976 qadir et al 2005 rhodes grass has been observed to establish with a minimum soil depth of 15 cm kumar and abrol 1983 malkin and waisel 1986 wehr et al 2006 2016 therefore we aimed to define the volume of water required to leach the top 15 cm of soil to an ecss 23 ds m 1 for plants to establish and a further 100 cm profile for plants to survive high evapotranspiration demands in the summer months plant available water capacity mm was calculated from the difference between fc and pwp 2 9 chemical modelling and statistical analyses thermodynamic modelling of the soil solution was performed using phreeqci version 3 3 12 and the pitzer database parkhurst and appelo 2013 results were compared using a two way analysis of variance anova with a 95 confidence interval to identify significant effects of treatments on chemical properties soil solution sar ec and anion composition and physical properties dispersion at time 0 and at the end of the experiment a one way anova was used to determine i differences between soil depths within a treatment ii differences between treatments within a harvest or sampling period and iii between harvests for each treatment tukey s test with a 95 confidence interval was used to assess significant differences between treatments all analyses were conducted using minitab 16 software 3 results 3 1 electrical conductivity the ecss was measured as an indicator of ionic strength alva et al 1991 changes in ecss were of interest because salinity high ionic strength is most likely the greatest plant growth limiting factor in this soil applying amendments prior to irrigation i e time 0 resulted in a significant increase p 0 001 in ecss from 28 ds m 1 control to between 36 ds m 1 in the g treatment and 40 ds m 1 in the gsom h treatment fig 3 with no significant differences between amendment treatments this increase in ecss was caused by the dissolution of the gypsum and the displacement of na from the soil s exchange complex by ca supplementary fig s1 there was a considerable decrease in ecss for all treatments after infiltration of deionised water as the soluble salts were leached with the infiltrating water this decrease was particularly evident at the surface where the magnitude of the reduction was greater than for the subsoils for example in the gom treatment 600 mm of infiltration was sufficient to decrease ecss at the topsoil 8 cm by approximately 11 fold from 38 to 3 3 ds m 1 whereas at a depth of 25 cm in the same treatment the ecss reduced only three fold from 30 to 7 7 ds m 1 fig 3 3 2 alkalinity even prior to commencing leaching time 0 the addition of amendments significantly reduced soil solution alkalinity p 0 001 with average soil solution alkalinity decreasing by 5730 mg l 1 caco3 equivalent upon addition of amendments fig 3 the most substantial decrease in alkalinity a 10 fold decrease was observed in the amended soils which did not contain om i e g and gs treatments the treatment with the lowest initial decrease in alkalinity was the gsom h treatment which had a two fold decrease in alkalinity to 3540 mg l 1 as caco3 equivalent p 0 001 however after 600 mm infiltration there were no significant differences in alkalinity between treatments the alkalinity of the subsoil below the amended topsoil gradually decreased but compared to the topsoil the overall magnitude of alkalinity decrease in the subsoil was significantly smaller p 0 001 soil solution ph phss data is not presented because alkalinity was calculated as a function of ph in general the addition of amendments resulted in a comparatively rapid and significant decrease in phss in all treatments prior to the commencement of irrigation from a phss of 10 2 in the control to an average of 8 6 p 0 001 however differences between amendment combinations were not significant treatments containing om in the topsoil achieved a phss of 8 with less infiltration than those that did not contain om after 600 mm infiltration all amended topsoil treatments further decreased to an average phss of 7 5 at 8 cm and 8 1 at 15 cm 3 3 dispersion indices all amendment treatments increased optical transmission i e decreased dispersion and thus improved soil structural stability compared to the control treatment at time 0 the addition of gypsum increased optical transmission from 64 in the control to an average of 94 in the amended topsoil layers 0 15 cm fig 4 optical transmission remained high in amended topsoils during leaching with values of 94 99 after 200 300 mm infiltration however after 600 mm some surface soils 0 8 cm layer began to decrease in soil structural stability for example in the g treatment optical transmission decreased from 99 to 84 p 0 001 whilst this decrease was not considered likely to be critical to soil structural stability it indicated that soil stability was beginning to decrease and may require an additional surface application of gypsum conversely in the control treatment optical transmission decreased from 64 to 2 with increasing infiltration p 0 001 fig 4 indicating that soil structural stability decreased with the leaching of soluble salts for the subsoil below the amended topsoil treatments 15 25 cm layer changes in optical transmission depended on the volume of infiltration for example in the gs treatment soil stability initially decreased after 130 mm of infiltration then improved after 350 mm infiltration and finally decreased substantially to 8 5 after 600 mm infiltration in contrast it was not until 600 mm infiltration that an improvement in soil structural stability was observed in the gom and gsom h treatments the gom treatment optical transmission also improved substantially from 12 to 68 p 0 001 in the 15 25 cm layer this indicates an interaction between the amended topsoil and infiltration which may have allowed some ca to be leached down the soil profile and precipitated as caco3 the lower layers of the subsoil i e 25 35 cm and 35 45 cm layers continued to decrease in soil structural stability with increasing infiltration 3 4 soluble cation concentrations including sar prior to leaching time 0 the addition of gypsum increased concentrations of soluble ca substantially from 0 6 mm in the control to an average of 15 mm fig 4 furthermore the ca concentration within the soil solution of the topsoil remained relatively constant with increasing infiltration due to the progressive dissolution of gypsum thermodynamic modelling of gypsum reacting with the measured soil solution cation and anion composition estimated a ca concentration of 13 mm thus confirming the soil was at saturation and that caco3 was most likely being precipitated supplementary file simulation s1 after 600 mm infiltration the gs treatment had the highest ca concentration 17 mm compared to both the g and gom treatments 13 mm p 0 001 despite the elevated ca concentrations in the amended topsoils concentrations in the subsoil below amended topsoil remained similar to ca concentrations in the subsoil of the control thus any soluble ca which leached below the topsoil layer was assumed to have precipitated as caco3 due to its high alkalinity and ph fig 3 changes in soil solution sar reflected the changes described above for ca fig 3 and na supplementary fig s1 with the greatest decrease in sar being for the topsoil supplementary fig s1 before leaching the addition of gypsum decreased the average sar in all treatments from 431 to 126 p 0 001 after 600 mm infiltration average sar of the amended topsoils was 8 with no significant differences between amendment combinations 3 5 soluble anion concentrations chloride cl is often used as a simple measure for indicating salinity because is usually moves with na however given the high carbonate content in the saline sodic alkaline soil it was important to distinguish between anion sources concentrations of cl increased slightly with amendment addition prior to leaching and then decreased substantially with increasing infiltration supplementary fig s2 the rate of cl leaching slowed in the subsoil layers but not to the same extent as na the addition of gypsum and s prior to leaching time 0 caused a significant increase in so4 s concentration from 15 mm to between 220 mm and 250 mm p 0 001 supplementary fig s2 after 600 mm infiltration the so4 s concentration at 8 cm decreased to an average of 28 mm whereas treatments to which elemental s was applied did not have higher concentrations of so4 s in the soil solution compared to the g and gom treatments 3 6 infiltration volume required for soil remediation on average 300 mm infiltration was sufficient to reduce the ecss to 23 ds m 1 or less to a depth of 15 cm in a saline sodic alkaline vertosol fig 3 fig 5 depending on the treatment there were slight differences between rate of ecss decrease and the volume of infiltration but these differences were comparatively small fig 5 after 600 mm of infiltration all amendment combinations achieved an ecss of 23 ds m 1 at 45 cm depth as the data in the present study were limited to a depth of 45 cm this relationship was extrapolated to determine the volume of infiltration required to remediate the soil to 100 cm depth assuming that all water that infiltrated ended up as deep drainage fig 5 this would allow sufficient pawc to keep plants alive during periods of high evaporative demand in queensland vertosols hochman 2001 a simple linear regression of the amended treatments i e y 0 0772x 6 0842 r2 0 86 determined that to achieve a remediated soil profile ecss of 23 ds m 1 of 100 cm depth approximately 1400 mm of infiltration water is required this corresponded to a pawc of approximately 165 mm for 100 cm depth fig 5 4 discussion this study demonstrated that it is possible to remediate a strongly saline sodic alkaline vertosol to a condition where plants could theoretically grow by applying ca based amendments such as gypsum including in combination with other amendments followed by leaching the soil with just 300 mm low ionic strength water this order of application was critically important to allow for 1 a decrease in sodicity and alkalinity in order to improve soil structural stability and infiltration and 2 a decrease in salinity by leaching excess salts with low ionic strength water conversely the control treatment demonstrated that leaching a saline sodic alkaline vertosol in the absence of amendments can create a non saline sodic soil e g pathway 1 in fig 1 with poor structure and infiltration fig 3 and fig 4 4 1 maintaining infiltration by amending with gypsum soil structural stability was maintained in the topsoil despite the ongoing decrease in ionic strength ecss caused by progressive leaching fig 3 fig 4 this was achieved with a gypsum application that was calculated to displace the na from the soil exchange complex and to neutralise alkalinity maintaining soil structural stability and infiltration rate enabled the decrease the ecss of the amended topsoils from an average of 37 5 6 ds m 1 at 8 cm depth fig 3 these findings align with diffuse double layer theory in clay soils van olphen 1977 sposito 2008 and other column experiments mckenna et al 2019 tirado corbalá et al 2019 because applying gypsum increased the valency of the ions on the soil exchange complex the continued dissolution of gypsum provided ca to balance the reduction of ionic strength of the soil solution during leaching thereby maintaining soil structural stability soluble ca concentrations were expected to increase in amended treatments along with the concomitant precipitation of caco3 this is because adding gypsum to sodic and alkaline soils increases soil solution ca concentrations above the solubility of calcite which results in the precipitation of calcite and the consumption of alkalinity lindsay 1979 indeed the ecss increased by 8 ds m 1 in the g treatment compared to the control at time 0 fig 3 this was not expected as thermodynamic modelling estimated an increase of 0 9 ds m 1 for the dissolution of gypsum supplementary file simulation s1 this increase was attributed to the ongoing dissolution of gypsum with ca moving onto the soil exchange complex and displacing na into the solution thereby increasing the ecss this reaction demonstrated the importance of delaying the revegetation process until the initial phases i e 100 300 mm of leaching are completed and ecss in the top soil is below pre amendment values dispersion indices are widely accepted as an appropriate and modern method for soil stability assessment e g basga et al 2018 liang et al 2021 including in saline sodic soils miranda et al 2018 a major critique of the use of optical transmission is that results are relative to the size and mineralogy of the suspended particles abu sharar 1988 however our method was paired with soil solution chemical analyses and therefore can be compared to other studies the correlation between ca in solution 1 mm and low clay dispersion fig 4 demonstrated that the analytical method developed for this study to determine soil structural stability was suitable this relationship agreed with threshold electrolyte concentration curves in vertic soils for irrigation of water with varying concentrations of dissolved salts onto agricultural land cass and sumner 1982 curtin et al 1994 quirk 2001 evangelou and marsi 2003 dikinya et al 2007 our method also provided a simple cheap and consistent method of assessment which directly measures the effect of the effect of low ionic strength water on soil physical properties 4 2 effect of different amendment combinations all amendment combinations were similarly effective in improving soil structural stability reducing sodicity and alkalinity and reducing salinity after leaching compared to the control treatment this uniformity in results was not expected as previous efforts have demonstrated improved rehabilitation was dependent on amendment combinations mahmoodabadi et al 2013 adding om did not influence soil structural stability in the present study in contrast with previous research which demonstrated either increased soil structural stability sekhon and bajwa 1993 vance et al 1998 tejada et al 2006 prapagar et al 2012 chaganti et al 2015 or increased soil dispersion gupta et al 1984 the results of this study may be attributed to several points of difference firstly each study in the literature used different om materials varying in structure and length of c chains which may have influenced the stabilising effects of the om oades 1984 secondly the addition of gypsum was proportionally larger compared to these previous studies and may have masked other amendment effects finally om may not have had the same beneficial effects under the low evaporative conditions in the current study compared to field experiments where it could influence evaporation there were however minor differences in alkalinity for the high om treatment fig 3 we assume this was an artefact caused by dissolved co2 measured as inorganic c from increased microbial activity during om decomposition rather than an actual increase in alkalinity from inorganic c in the soil geochemical modelling indicated that the solution was likely in equilibrium with a co2 concentration of 1000 2000 μmol mol 1 being 3 to 6 fold higher than atmospheric values data not presented small differences between treatments containing s were observed in this study supplementary fig s2 despite ca solubility being higher in gs than g alone this did not improve soil structural stability and alkalinity fig 4 other studies found the use of s based amendments were effective at increasing ca availability in calcareous soils and neutralising soil ph both with and without gypsum amezketa et al 2005 zia et al 2006 mckenna et al 2019 this result was attributed to the sufficient application of gypsum 102 t ha 1 mined gypsum to effectively remediate and stabilise soil structural stability therefore land managers could use elemental s to neutralise alkalinity depending on its availability and the cost of gypsum 4 3 ability of amendments to remediate soil below the depth of incorporation the combination of s and om with gypsum did not increase the movement of ca down the soil profile as expected fig 4 therefore soil structural stability did not improve at depth but in most cases it decreased our results reflect findings from previous research using gypsum application alone and with a similar volume of infiltration frenkel et al 1989 ilyas et al 1993 1997 we attribute this subsoil constraint to the extremely high subsoil alkalinity fig 3 causing any soluble ca to be precipitated as caco3 and thus inhibiting its transport to deeper layers of the subsoil with infiltration consequently it will be important for land managers to monitor field conditions to prevent developing perched water tables and waterlogging if subsoil structural stability declines however given that the soil was a shrink swell self mulching soil structure at depth is expected to gradually improve over longer periods of time through drying cycles grant and blackmore 1991 therefore it is recommended that gypsum and other amendments are incorporated into the soil to the greatest depth possible given that direct incorporation of gypsum was the most effective way of displacing na from the soil s exchange complex 4 4 practical solutions longevity of amendments and establishing plants as a practical safeguard surface reapplication of gypsum may be necessary to maintain ionic strength of the soil solution after substantial leaching has occurred this study measured a ca concentration in soil solution of 14 mmol l at 8 cm depth fig 4 for our application rate of 102 t ha 1 mined gypsum to 15 cm depth approximately 1600 mm of infiltration will solubilise all the gypsum in the top 8 cm 9 t ca ha 1 or 22 4 m ca m 2 therefore a low rate of surface reapplication of gypsum should occur after 1200 1500 mm of infiltration to maintain surface soil structural stability for initial plant establishment this study demonstrated that 300 mm of infiltration could improve soil chemical conditions to allow for root growth of a salt tolerant plant such as rhodes grass in the amended topsoil layers 15 cm depth of a saline sodic alkaline vertosol fig 5 furthermore 1400 mm of infiltration could potentially provide plants with a 100 cm deep root zone and 165 mm of plant available water at a salinity of 23 ds m 1 however to ensure seedling survival it is critical that pawc must not only be maintained to ensure continued plant survival but it must also be exceeded to ensure further leaching below 15 cm and increase rooting depth for example within the study region of south east queensland australia evaporative demand largely exceeds rainfall bom 2018 therefore pawc may be insufficient to sustain plant survival in saline conditions particularly given that drought periods may occur and thus continued irrigation may be required therefore a remediated root zone of 80 100 cm may be required for successful site rehabilitation given that rhodes grass is known to extract water to 150 cm depth in queensland soils shelton and dalzell 2007 this root zone can provide adequate pawc ca 100 mm in queensland vertosols hochman et al 2001 sufficient to keep plants alive during periods of high evaporative demand typically during september to april bom 2018 finally it is necessary to consider the source of water used to infiltrate the soil using existing data on deep drainage from queensland of 5 mm year 1 for a pasture system silburn et al 2011 tolmie et al 2011 to increase the remediated root zone to 100 cm depth relying solely on rainfall it would take 280 years for 1400 mm of deep drainage to move below the root zone in a depression zone i e assuming 100 infiltration and 0 runoff such as an evaporation pond therefore in this case irrigation water would likely be required to initiate leaching for plant establishment 5 conclusion this study is one of few to investigate remediation of salt affected soils in subtropical context it took a novel approach to demonstrate detailed changes in soil chemical and physical properties of an amended and a non amended highly saline sodic soil with the infiltration of 600 mm low ionic strength water furthermore it demonstrated the combination of gypsum and other amendments s and om were not strictly advantageous in maintaining ionic strength to facilitate salt leaching this study also provides critical soil solution input data to advance the field of hydraulic modelling of saline sodic soils and to allow for longer term estimation of soil recovery future research for remediation of saline sodic soils should aim to quantify the leaching fraction required to balance evapotranspiration and salt leaching to avoid the point of no return i e developing a non saline sodic soil the order of remediation was found to be critical to ensure that the soil remained stable during leaching to remove soluble salts specifically it was necessary to ensure that amendments were applied to the soil prior to leaching all amendment combinations reduced soil solution ph alkalinity and dispersion the key aspect of successful remediation being the sufficient application of gypsum and supply of ca to neutralise alkalinity and displace na from the soil exchange complex in turn the improved soil structural stability enhanced and maintained infiltration to reduce ecss to a suitable soil depth for plant establishment however soluble ca did not move down the profile despite being applied at a rate to displace na to a depth of 30 cm infiltration of 600 mm of deionised water was sufficient for this saline sodic alkaline vertosol to decrease ecss from 27 ds m 1 to 23 ds m 1 to a depth of 45 cm with this ecss value 23 ds m 1 corresponding to a 50 growth reduction for the model species rhodes grass extrapolating the results of this experiment allowed the prediction of long term site recovery and movement of salt further research into plant growth should follow this experiment to take evapotranspiration into account with the use of amendments and different leaching regimes effective amelioration is therefore recommended in the order of 1 sufficient amendment application according to the soil cec and soil alkalinity with gypsum and additional s to the maximum depth possible 2 leaching of salts with 300 mm of water infiltration this leaching should be achieved by irrigation in cases where deep drainage by rainfall is insufficient 3 surface reapplication of gypsum 1 5 t ha 1 after ca 1400 mm infiltration to ensure surface soil structural stability 4 planting salt tolerant species such as rhodes grass and 5 continue leaching to produce 1400 mm deep drainage to ameliorate a target root zone of 100 cm depth irrigation should be managed to increase deep drainage where possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9424,aiming at the extensive management problems in ecological operation and ecological irrigation this paper proposed a novel ecological irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation eii and established a multi scale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with eii for the irrigation and restoration of river valley grasslands firstly the ecological available water supplies in ecological periods were obtained by long term ecological operation then reservoirs on mainstream and tributaries gathered flood peaks through real time ecological operation to create artificial ecological flood processes finally by the joint operation of eii projects the water level of artificial flood was raised and the artificial flood was controllably introduced into irrigation districts for the precision irrigation of river valley grasslands the rationality of ecological operation model and the feasibility of eii technology were then verified through case analysis results indicate that 1 through the 5 9 13 division of ecological irrigation districts analysis of the ecological water demand multi scale ecological operation eii technology and projects and other measures suitable artificial floods can be created and fully introduced into ecological irrigation districts to realize the timely and appropriate irrigation of river valley grasslands 2 in the critical ecological period in 2018 the core protected area was basically fully irrigated through eii with an effective irrigation rate of 82 4 and a vegetation coverage of 74 8 which basically met the ecological water demand of river valley forests and grasses and 3 for animal husbandry after using eii technology for grassland irrigation the average forage yield of river valley grasslands has an increase of 25 and the direct economic benefit has an average increase of 18 9 million yuan per year effectively improving the economic income of local herdsmen the research results have important theoretical and practical significance for the ecological protection and restoration of river valley vegetation keywords ecological infiltration irrigation river valley grassland irrigation district division ecological restoration ecological operation 1 introduction under the combined effects of human activities and climate change watershed ecosystems have been facing unprecedented severe challenges graf 1999 nilsson 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 with the development of society and the increasing public awareness of environmental protection ecological protection and restoration of watersheds has attracted widespread attention worldwide palmer and bernhardt 2006 fang and elliott 2016 le et al 2020 nowadays most major rivers in the world have built large scale reservoir systems and the ecological operation of reservoirs has become a key measure to maintain the biodiversity of river basin and ensure the regional safety of water and ecology adams et al 2017 sabo et al 2017 ecological operation of reservoirs is a new operating mode that focuses on ecological benefits on the basis of taking into account the social economic benefits of reservoir operation for the protection of aquatic ecosystems ecological operation is mainly realized by adjusting reservoir outflow to change the water temperature velocity flow sediment concentration and other conditions in the downstream river xu et al 2017 yan et al 2020 however the ecological operation considering the restoration of forests and grasses in river valleys needs to consider both the regulation of river flow and the irrigation of terrestrial vegetation which belongs to the complex operation problem of water land coupling higgins and brock 1999 luo et al 2016 for the restoration of river valley grassland many organizations and individuals have carried out rich and in depth research and practice based on reservoir operation for example the tennessee valley authority of the united states amended the original tva act for 20 reservoirs in the basin in 1987 and began to consider the ecological objectives of water environment and habitat olden and naiman 2010 in the colorado river basin of the united states for reshaping the natural geomorphic characteristics and the ecological environment functions of the grand canyon glen canyon dam carried out three artificial flood tests in 1996 2004 and 2008 respectively through these processes of artificial floods created by reservoir operation the sediment in the riverbed was transported and deposited to the severely scoured downstream beaches and sandbars which promoted the growth of forests and grasses in the river valley along with fish reproduction powell 2002 mueller et al 2014 chapman et al 2020 to promote the vegetation restoration in the lower reaches of the yellow river in china since 2002 xiaolangdi reservoir has been making artificial floods to regulate the balance between water and sediment of the river every year which improves the water sediment conditions of river channel and increases the supplies of sediment and ecological water to riverside wetlands and estuary deltas miao et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in addition the technology of machine learning and multi objective optimization has also further promoted the development of ecological operation for example artificial neural network can be used for the quantification of riverine ecosystem requirements and the prediction of suitable flow regimes that sustain river and floodplain ecology and multi objective evolutionary algorithms are often used to obtain the tradeoffs between socio economic and ecological water use tsai et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 however the current ecological operation research on the restoration of river valley forests and grasses is mainly to improve the reservoir operating modes by adding ecological objectives and constraints to conventional operating rules which focuses on the discharge processes of reservoirs but pays less attention to the irrigation and consumption of ecological water in river valley grasslands after discharge thus there is a severe disconnection between the ecological operation of reservoirs and the irrigation of river valley grasslands at the same time due to the complex terrain and huge area of grasslands flooding irrigation is still the main way for irrigating grasslands which makes the water supply of ecological operation large but the effective irrigation area small consequently the restoring effects of forests and grasses are not up to expectations and the theoretical results of ecological operation are difficult to apply in practice therefore the ecological operation considering grassland restoration is a complex interdisciplinary problem involving ecology irrigation hydrology and hydrodynamics as we all know different irrigation methods determine the water demand and consumption of vegetation when the water demand of vegetation is certain the water supply and consumption of flooding irrigation are significantly higher than those of water saving irrigation serra wittling et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 to overcome the application problems of ecological regulation it is of much necessity to clarify the relationship between ecological water demand irrigation system ecological water supply and ecological water consumption and to consider the influence of different irrigation systems on the ecological water dissipation mechanism and use efficiency numerous ecological irrigation studies have been carried out in terms of water compensation water demand prediction and ecological response but they rarely involve the improvement or innovation of ecological irrigation methods borin et al 2016 peng et al 2019 li et al 2019 however irrigating mode determines the consumption process of irrigating water and is the core factor connecting the processes of vegetation water demand and ecological water supply therefore it is urgent to implement a new ecological irrigation method for grassland restoration in northwest china there are many inland rivers with wide and flat river valleys dense forests and grasses grow on both sides of these river valleys forming a unique river valley ecosystem however with the increasing socio economic water consumption the water demand of river valley ecosystem is gradually not guaranteed resulting in serious ecological problems such as grassland degradation therefore how to solve the ecological problems of the northwest inland river basins by means of ecological operation and irrigation is the purpose of this study for improving the irrigation efficiency of ecological water and restoring the damaged river valley ecosystem this study proposed a novel irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation eii and established a multi scale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with eii for the restoration of river valley forests and grasses the proposed irrigation method eii involves three systems of ecology irrigation and water resources and comprehensively considers ecological water demand vegetation irrigation and multi scale reservoir operation moreover compared with flooding irrigation one of the main advantages of eii is that it can make irrigating water stay in irrigation district for a longer time and infiltrate into the soil more fully thereby promoting the growth of river valley forests and grasses therefore we call this irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation the main contents of this study are shown in fig 1 section 2 introduces the basic theory of eii including necessary conditions definition and connotation and project layout section 3 details the methods of establishing multi scale ecological operation model coupled with eii including the division of ecological irrigation districts the calculation of ecological water demand the establishment of long term and real time ecological operation models and the coupling of ecological operation and eii section 4 presents and discusses the study results of ecological operation and grassland irrigation and section 5 draws our conclusions the study results have important theoretical value and practical significance for guiding the ecological protection and restoration of forests and grasses in river valleys 2 basic theory of ecological infiltration irrigation 2 1 necessary conditions for ecological infiltration irrigation nowadays the common irrigation method for river valley grasslands is mainly based on flooding irrigation the irrigation scope of flooding irrigation is concentrated on the low lying river beaches and the limited area extended by ecological irrigation canals while most areas far away from rivers cannot be effectively irrigated resulting in large ecological water supply but low ecological irrigation efficiency meanwhile the retention time of ecological water in irrigation districts is generally short for flooding irrigation causing a large part of irrigating water to return to river therefore the current flooding irrigation based method will not only cause irrigating water waste but also make it difficult to achieve the ecological goal of grassland restoration in order to improve irrigation efficiency a novel ecological irrigation method eii is proposed in this paper through the construction of eii supporting projects such as ecological gates water blocking dams and irrigation canals irrigating water can be repeatedly and continuously consumed in grasslands along the river 2 2 definition and connotation of ecological infiltration irrigation the basic definition of eii is that according to the water demand of river valley ecosystem the downstream ecological irrigation projects control the artificial floods created by upstream ecological operation to form a timely and appropriate ecological irrigation which is called ecological infiltration irrigation the basic connotation of eii is mainly reflected in the four aspects of resistance diversion dredging and overflow resistance refers to the construction of ecological gates water blocking dams overflow outlets and other engineering measures to prolong irrigation time and expand irrigation scope diversion means ecological irrigation through diversion gates and main irrigation canals dredging is to dredge the branches and tributaries of the river and to dig secondary canals for irrigating forests and grasses overflow means the formation of an ecological irrigation system with accessible water network and submerged grasslands 2 3 project layout of ecological infiltration irrigation the project layout of eii system should meet the requirements of the overall design and irrigation standard of each irrigation district and the complete project layout is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the construction and operation of ecological gates and ecological canals are the important prerequisites for the effective implementation of eii ecological gates are mainly arranged in the main river which can increase water level increase floodplain water and expand ecological flooding area main irrigation canals are mainly arranged in the higher areas of irrigation district to control the larger irrigating area by gravity flow and other irrigation canals at all levels should also be arranged in the higher areas within their respective control ranges additionally for some areas that cannot be reached by floods water pumps can be used for irrigation if an irrigation district does not have the conditions to build large scale ecological projects such as water blocking dams and main irrigation canals ecological irrigation canals without anti seepage lining can be built along the riverbank as shown in fig 3 the construction of ecological irrigation canals can effectively irrigate forests and grasses far from the riverbank and the unlined treatment makes part of canal water seep into the soil on both sides of the canal in summary the engineering system of eii can not only expand the irrigation area of forests and grasses in river valleys but also replenish groundwater on both sides of the river 3 methodology 3 1 division of eii irrigation district scientific division of irrigation district is an important guarantee for the realization of precision ecological irrigation according to the river system characteristics grassland distribution eii project layout and other factors the division of irrigation district is carried out for the efficient utilization of water resources the eii irrigation districts at all levels are divided as follows 1 level i irrigation district the characteristics of watershed river system is the dominant factor in the division of level i irrigation districts to reflect the differences in the natural zones 2 level ii irrigation district the major ecological irrigation projects e g large ecological gates built on the river mainstream and the geographical locations of river intersection are the leading factors to divide the level ii irrigation districts 3 level iii irrigation district based on natural geography climate conditions farming units and other factors the level iii irrigation districts are divided for the analysis of ecological water demand in different regions 3 2 calculation of ecological water demand the ecological water demand of forests and grasses in river valley refers to the water necessary to ensure that river valley ecosystem performs its normal function at specific development periods it has obvious temporal and spatial characteristics and is the basis for determining the vegetation irrigation quota 3 2 1 penman monteith equation the calculation of ecological water demand of non agricultural land in irrigation district shall consider the ecological water demand of forest land grassland shrub land and reed land because the basic physiological water demand of general plants accounts for a small proportion of evapotranspiration the ecological water demand of vegetation can be directly and approximately determined by the water consumption of vegetation evapotranspiration in the calculation of ecological water demand the penman monteith equation recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao is often used doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 taking alfalfa as the reference crop assuming that the crop plant height is 0 12 m the canopy resistance is 70 m s and the albedo is 0 23 its evapotranspiration is equivalent to that of the open green grassland with vigorous and consistent growth complete ground coverage and sufficient water supply then the calculation formula of evapotranspiration e t 0 of reference crop is as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where e t 0 is the evapotranspiration of reference crop mm d δ is the slope of the saturated water pressure curve kpa r n is the net surface radiation mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux density mj m² d γ is the psychrometer constant kpa t m e a n is the daily average temperature at a height of 2 m u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the saturated water pressure kpa e s is the actual water pressure kpa 3 2 2 empirical formula limited by the data this paper uses empirical formula instead of penman monteith equation to calculate the water demand process of vegetation according to the existing methods for calculating vegetation evapotranspiration several main factors e g water surface evaporation temperature humidity radiation etc are selected from many factors affecting vegetation evapotranspiration based on the experimental observation data the quantitative relationships between these main factors and vegetation evapotranspiration are analyzed and then summarized into an empirical formula many studies show that reference crop evapotranspiration has a good correlation with water surface evaporation trajkovic and kolakovic 2010 heydari and heydari 2013 awe et al 2020 in practical applications et 0 can usually be estimated by measured water surface evaporation and the calculation formula is described as follows 2 e t 0 λ e 601 where λ is reduction coefficient and e 601 is the water surface evaporation measured by ϕ 601 evaporating dish mm 3 2 3 ecological water demand quota of vegetation by calculating the evapotranspiration e t 0 of vegetation and using the water demand coefficient k t and conversion coefficient ξ of vegetation the ecological water demand quota for different vegetation can be calculated wu et al 2018 the calculation formula is as follows 3 e t i t k i t e t 0 ξ where e t i t and k i t are respectively the ecological water demand quota and water demand coefficient of vegetation i in period t ξ is conversion coefficient and ξ 2 3 3 2 4 ecological water demand of vegetation in this paper the quota area method is selected for the calculation of ecological water demand of forests and grasses in river valley li et al 2013 wang and yang 2019 the ecological water demand of a certain type of vegetation in an irrigation district is the product of its area and its ecological water demand quota thus the total ecological water demand of vegetation in irrigation district is equal to the sum of the ecological water demand of various vegetation the calculation formula is as follows 4 w i t e t i t a i where w i t and e t i t are respectively the ecological water demand and ecological water demand quota of vegetation i in period t a i is the area of vegetation i 3 3 long term ecological optimal operation of reservoir group in order to give full play to the vital operation role of reservoir group the long term ecological optimal operation model was established for optimization of four operation objectives i e the minimum ecological and socio economic water shortage the maximum water diversion the maximum comprehensive benefit and the maximum hydropower generation moreover the water supply assurance rate and basin water balance are taken as the global constraints while the reservoir water balance water level constraints water supply constraints and output constraints are taken as the local constraints 3 3 1

limits of hydropower output k e l e q e l e and h e l e are the output coefficient flow and waterhead for hydropower generation respectively 3 3 3 solution method for optimization model due to the complexity of optimization model this paper transformed the multi objective model into a single objective model by taking the minimum ecological and socio economic water shortage as the main objective and treating other objectives as constraints moreover using large scale system coordination decomposition method the multi reservoir operation problem was decomposed into several single reservoir operation problems with water connection the optimal operation of a single reservoir was solved by dynamic programming method and then solved by the coordinator through iteration 3 4 real time ecological optimal operation of reservoir group coupling hydrological and ecological processes we constructed a one dimensional hydrodynamic model to determine the outflow of each reservoir flood encounter time of mainstream and tributaries flood discharge of floodplain and other main parameter thresholds next according to the macro long term operating strategy reservoir water storage and ecological water demand the real time optimal operation model of reservoir group was established at the micro implementation level for the deduction of the artificial flood process suitable for the growth of forests and grasses 3 4 1 real time optimal operation model in critical ecological period aiming at minimizing the water shortage in the critical period of forest and grass growth the real time ecological optimal operation model of reservoir group is established as follows 16 min w f o r e s t g r a s s t 1 t d f o r e s t g r a s s t s f o r e s t g r a s s t 17 s t w f o r e s t g r a

calculated by long term operation model t is the total number of operation periods n is the serial number of reservoirs q and q are respectively the inflow and outflow of reservoir δ t is time step v is reservoir storage the one dimensional constant flow saint venant equations are used for river flow simulation the basic equations including continuity equation and momentum equation are described

is chezy coefficient r is hydraulic radius m g is gravitational acceleration m s2 h is water level m in addition the model includes the constraints of reservoirs and ecological projects which are not listed one by one due to space limitations 3 4 2 solution method for optimization model the real time optimal operation model of reservoir group is solved by genetic algorithm the specific principle is to define a constraint dominated rule for the division of all solutions into feasible and infeasible solutions and then to judge any two solutions a and b based on feasibility the idea is as follows 1 if solution a is a feasible solution and solution b is an infeasible solution then solution a is better than solution b 2 if both solutions a and b are infeasible but the constraint violation of solution a is less than that of solution b then solution a is better than solution b 3 if both solutions a and b are feasible and the objective value of solution a is better than that of solution b then solution a is better than solution b additionally the saint venant equations are discretized by abbott six point implicit difference method the calculation grid is composed of water level points and flow points calculated respectively at the same time step 3 5 coupling of ecological operation and ecological infiltration irrigation focusing on the disconnection between current ecological operation and ecological irrigation and the low irrigation efficiency of traditional flooding irrigation a multi scale ecological operation model coupled with eii was established for the irrigation and restoration of river valley forests and grasses firstly through long term ecological operation the ecological operation rules of reservoir group are derived for the obtaining of ecological available water supply in different hydrological years and critical ecological periods then based on the long term ecological operation strategy of reservoir group the ecological water demand of each irrigation district and the water storage and inflow of each reservoir reservoirs on mainstream and tributaries gather flood peaks through real time ecological operation to create artificial ecological flood processes suitable for the growth of river valley forests and grasses finally by the joint operation of eii projects such as ecological gates water blocking dams and ecological canals the water level of artificial flood is raised and then the artificial flood is controllably introduced into irrigation districts for the precision irrigation of river valley grasslands see fig 2 in the deep water irrigation districts on river floodplains artificial flood directly irrigates the forests and grasses through overflow outlets in the shallow water irrigation districts on the higher river terraces artificial flood is introduced into these districts for grassland irrigation through main irrigation canals and pump stations furthermore the connected project layout of eii system makes the irrigation water can be reused among multiple irrigation districts through the coupling of ecological operation and eii the current extensive irrigation mode of ecological operation can be changed into a new mode of timely and appropriate ecological irrigation 4 results and discussions in this paper eii technology is applied to the ecological restoration of river valley forests and grasses in an inland river basin of northwest china to test the feasibility and effectiveness of this new ecological irrigation theory with the development of social economy the contradiction between ecological and non ecological water use is becoming increasingly serious in this basin at the same time due to the low irrigation coverage and low water utilization efficiency of traditional ecological irrigation mode the water demand of watershed ecosystem has not been met for a long time resulting in the increasingly degradation of river valley grasslands thus it is urgent to find an efficient ecological irrigation method for the problem of ecological degradation in the basin 4 1 division of ecological infiltration irrigation district according to the distribution of river valley grasslands the layout of reservoir group and eii system projects river system and natural landform the ecological function areas of river valley forests and grasses in the basin are divided into 5 level i irrigation districts 9 level ii irrigation districts and 13 level iii irrigation districts as shown in fig 4 the downstream areas of the mainstream reservoir r 2 and the three tributary reservoirs i e r 3 r 5 and r 7 are divided into irrigation district i ii iii and iv respectively and the downstream wetland of reservoir r 2 and r 3 is separately divided into irrigation district v within the irrigation district i three secondary irrigation districts i 1 i 2 and i 3 are divided according to the river system characteristics and project layout the internal division of other irrigation districts is similar to that of irrigation district i and finally the ecological infiltration irrigation districts in the basin are formed into the distribution of 5 9 13 4 2 analysis on the ecological water demand of river valley vegetation analyzing the phenological laws and water demand processes of forests and grasses in river valleys is the key to carry out ecological operation and eii since the ecological water demand of river valley vegetation in the basin is mainly concentrated from april to september in a year the ecological water demand of each irrigation district in these months is calculated according to the data of water surface evaporation solar radiation air temperature and wind speed of representative meteorological stations as shown in table 1 and fig 5 the total ecological water demand of river valley forests and grasses from april to september is 648 million m3 of which the water demand from june to july accounts for 51 2 moreover among the level i irrigation districts the ecological water demand of irrigation district i is the largest reaching 402 million m3 and accounting for 62 0 of the total water demand of level i irrigation districts 4 3 regime of ecological infiltration irrigation the irrigation regime of eii mainly includes irrigation time irrigation times and irrigation quota according to the irrigating test data and the ecological water demand of river valley forests and grasses the irrigation regime of eii is formulated to provide technical support for the planning of irrigation projects and the management of irrigation districts table 2 presents the irrigation regime of eii for river valley forests and grasses where mu is a common unit of area in china and 1 mu is equal to 666 67 square meters or 1 hectare is equal to 15 mu among the vegetation in the basin the irrigation quota of reed land is the largest accounting for 27 of the total irrigation quota of all vegetation while the irrigation quota of sandy grassland is the smallest accounting for 6 of the total irrigation quota of all vegetation in addition the total irrigation quota from june 30 to july 8 is the largest which is 300 m3 mu accounting for 13 of the total irrigation quota from april to september 4 4 long term ecological operation results of reservoir group according to the importance and assurance rate requirements of water use units water supply obeys such priorities of domestic and industrial water ecological base flow inter basin water diversion agricultural irrigation river valley ecology and lake replenishment and the corresponding design assurance rates are 95 90 90 75 50 and 50 respectively the operation period is from may 1959 to april 2012 of which the flood season is from may to july with ten days as time step and the non flood season is from august to april of the next year with one month as time step in the middle reaches of the river the total ecological water demand of the core protected area for river valley forests and grasses is 516 million m3 considering factors such as water surface evaporation and groundwater replenishment the upstream reservoirs r 2 and r 3 need to discharge a total of 520 million m3 of water including 446 million m3 of water from reservoir r 2 and 74 million m3 of water from reservoir r 3 to meet the ecological water demand and the irrigation requirement of eii in the core protected area by solving the long term ecological optimal operation model of reservoir group the water supply guarantee rates of all units in the basin are obtained as shown in table 3 on the whole the water supply of each unit meets the requirement of corresponding design guarantee rate especially the water supply of forests and grasses in each irrigation district meets the design requirement of 50 indicating that the ecological operation of reservoir group can provide sufficient ecological water for the implementation of eii projects on a macro scale 4 5 real time ecological operation results of reservoir group real time ecological operation refers to the operation of critical ecological period of river valley forests and grasses from late may to early june every year according to the long term operation strategy reservoir storage and ecological water demand the real time ecological optimal operation model is solved in hourly steps to determine the key parameters such as the reservoir outflow the encounter time of mainstream and tributary floods and the flood discharge of floodplain during the peak gathering progress of real time operation reservoirs r 1 and r 2 take the lead in opening the spillway gate to create an artificial flood process in the upper reaches of the mainstream then considering the encounter time of mainstream and tributary floods reservoir r 3 opens the spillway gate to discharge water and carries out peak gathering operation in the middle reaches of the mainstream next the spillway gates of reservoirs r 4 and r 5 are opened for gathering flood peak in the lower reaches of the mainstream finally reservoirs r 6 and r 7 carry out peak gathering operation for mainstream flood besides meeting the peak gathering requirements of mainstream flood the artificial flood created by each tributary reservoir also meets the irrigation requirements of eii in the tributary ecological irrigation districts fig 6 shows the measured artificial flood process in june 2016 and its simulated process based on real time ecological operation model and one dimensional hydrodynamic model mike 11 the model calculations are close to the measured values and the average relative error is 0 05 indicating that the model result is reasonable in the core protected area of river valley forests and grasses the design floodplain discharge for eii is 800 m3 s from 2001 to 2016 there were only 11 years when the natural flood peak in the core protected area was greater than 800 m3 s but after the peak gathering operation of reservoir group there were 15 years when the flood peak met the design requirement of floodplain discharge see fig 7 the artificial flood process created by the real time ecological operation of mainstream and tributary reservoirs provides necessary hydrological conditions for the implementation of forest and grass irrigation in river valley 4 6 effect analysis of ecological infiltration irrigation 4 6 1 ecological benefits since the implementation of eii in 2016 there have been remarkable effects on the ecological irrigation and restoration of river valley grasslands taking the demonstration of core protected area in critical ecological period in 2018 as an example from remote sensing images the core protected area was basically fully irrigated through eii with an effective irrigation rate of 82 4 see fig 8 and a vegetation coverage of 74 8 see fig 9 which basically met the ecological water demand of forests and grasses in the river valley fig 10 shows the interannual variation of vegetation coverage in the core protected area from 2000 to 2018 due to the implementation of eii the vegetation coverage in the core protected area increased significantly and remained stable from 2016 to 2018 close to the highest level since 2000 eii prolongs the retention time of floods in irrigation districts and expands the irrigation area thereby significantly restoring the degraded grassland ecosystem in river valley and effectively ensuring the ecological security of the river basin 4 6 2 socio economic benefits river valley grasslands have always been important winter pastures for agriculture and animal husbandry in this region as shown in table 4 since the adoption of eii for grassland irrigation in 2016 the average forage yield of river valley grasslands has increased from 165 kg mu to 206 kg mu with an increase of 25 according to the purchase price of 280 yuan t the direct economic benefit has an average increase of 18 9 million yuan per year effectively improving the economic income of local farmers and herdsmen and ensuring the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the region 5 conclusions aiming at the extensive management problems in ecological operation and ecological irrigation this paper proposed a novel ecological irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation eii and established a multi scale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with eii for the restoration of river valley forests and grasses the rationality of ecological operation model and the feasibility of eii technology were then verified through case analysis the conclusions are as follows 1 in order to improve irrigation efficiency a novel ecological irrigation method eii was proposed in this paper through the construction of eii supporting projects irrigating water can be repeatedly and continuously consumed in grasslands along river for the improvement of ecological irrigation efficiency 2 through the 5 9 13 division of ecological irrigation districts the analysis on the ecological water demand and the multi scale ecological operation coupled with eii suitable artificial floods will be created and fully introduced into ecological irrigation districts to realize the timely and appropriate ecological irrigation of forests and grasses in river valleys changing the extensive management

valley grasslands in the research region taking the critical ecological period in 2018 as an example the core protected area was basically fully irrigated through eii with an effective irrigation rate of 82 4 and a vegetation coverage of 74 8 which basically met the ecological water demand of forests and grasses in the river valley 4 for the agriculture and animal husbandry in the research region

important theoretical value and practical significance for guiding the ecological protection and restoration of forests and grasses in river valleys at present the ecological protection object of this study is mainly the river valley vegetation there is no in depth study on the protection of aquatic organisms and their habitats in the river in the next step we will therefore comprehensively consider the ecological protection objects inside and outside the river and carry out more systematic research on ecological operation and ecological restoration declaration of competing interest the

9424,aiming at the extensive management problems in ecological operation and ecological irrigation this paper proposed a novel ecological irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation eii and established a multi scale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with eii for the irrigation and restoration of river valley grasslands firstly the ecological available water supplies in ecological periods were obtained by long term ecological operation then reservoirs on mainstream and tributaries gathered flood peaks through real time ecological operation to create artificial ecological flood processes finally by the joint operation of eii projects the water level of artificial flood was raised and the artificial flood was controllably introduced into irrigation districts for the precision irrigation of river valley grasslands the rationality of ecological operation model and the feasibility of eii technology were then verified through case analysis results indicate

practical significance for the ecological protection and restoration of river valley vegetation keywords ecological infiltration irrigation river valley grassland irrigation district division ecological restoration ecological operation 1 introduction under the combined effects of human activities and climate change watershed ecosystems have been facing unprecedented severe challenges graf 1999 nilsson 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 with the development of society and the increasing public awareness of environmental protection ecological protection and restoration of watersheds has attracted widespread attention worldwide palmer and bernhardt 2006 fang and elliott 2016 le et al 2020 nowadays most major rivers in the world have built large scale reservoir systems and the ecological operation of reservoirs has become a key measure to maintain the biodiversity of river basin and ensure the regional safety of water and ecology adams et al 2017 sabo et al 2017 ecological operation of reservoirs is a new operating mode that focuses on ecological benefits on the basis of taking into account the social economic benefits of reservoir operation for the protection of aquatic ecosystems ecological operation is mainly realized by adjusting reservoir outflow to change the water temperature velocity flow sediment concentration and other conditions in the downstream river xu et al 2017 yan et al 2020 however the ecological operation considering the restoration of forests and grasses in river valleys needs to consider both the regulation of river flow and the irrigation of terrestrial vegetation which belongs to the complex operation problem of water land coupling higgins and brock 1999 luo et al 2016 for the restoration of river valley grassland many organizations and individuals have carried out rich and in depth research and practice based on reservoir operation for example the tennessee valley authority of the united states amended the original tva act for 20 reservoirs in the basin in 1987 and began to consider the ecological objectives of water environment and habitat olden and naiman 2010 in the colorado river basin of the united states for reshaping the natural geomorphic characteristics and the ecological environment functions of the grand canyon glen canyon dam carried out three artificial flood tests in 1996 2004 and 2008 respectively through these processes of artificial floods created by reservoir operation the sediment in the riverbed was transported and deposited to the severely scoured downstream beaches and sandbars which promoted the growth of forests and grasses in the river valley along with fish reproduction powell 2002 mueller et al 2014 chapman et al 2020 to promote the vegetation restoration in the lower reaches of the yellow river in china since 2002 xiaolangdi reservoir has been making artificial floods to regulate the balance between water and sediment of the river every year which improves the water sediment conditions of river channel and increases the supplies of sediment and ecological water to riverside wetlands and estuary deltas miao et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 in addition the technology of machine learning and multi objective optimization has also further promoted the development of ecological operation for example artificial neural network can be used for the quantification of riverine ecosystem requirements and the prediction of suitable flow regimes that sustain river and floodplain ecology and multi objective evolutionary algorithms are often used to obtain the tradeoffs between socio economic and ecological water use tsai et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 however the current ecological operation research on the restoration of river valley forests and grasses is mainly to improve the reservoir operating modes by adding ecological objectives and constraints to conventional operating rules which focuses on the discharge processes of reservoirs but pays less attention to the irrigation and consumption of ecological water in river valley grasslands after discharge thus there is a severe disconnection between the ecological operation of reservoirs and the irrigation of river valley grasslands at the same time due to the complex terrain and huge area of grasslands flooding irrigation is still the main way for irrigating grasslands which makes the water supply of ecological operation large but the effective irrigation area small consequently the restoring effects of forests and grasses are not up to expectations and the theoretical results of ecological operation are difficult to apply in practice therefore the ecological operation considering grassland restoration is a complex interdisciplinary problem involving ecology irrigation hydrology and hydrodynamics as we all know different irrigation methods determine the water demand and consumption of vegetation when the water demand of vegetation is certain the water supply and consumption of flooding irrigation are significantly higher than those of water saving irrigation serra wittling et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 to overcome the application problems of ecological regulation it is of much necessity to clarify the relationship between ecological water demand irrigation system ecological water supply and ecological water consumption and to consider the influence of different irrigation systems on the ecological water dissipation mechanism and use efficiency numerous ecological irrigation studies have been carried out in terms of water compensation water demand prediction and ecological response but they rarely involve the improvement or innovation of ecological irrigation methods borin et al 2016 peng et al 2019 li et al 2019 however irrigating mode determines the consumption process of irrigating water and is the core factor connecting the processes of vegetation water demand and ecological water supply therefore it is urgent to implement a new ecological irrigation method for grassland restoration in northwest china there are many inland rivers with wide and flat river valleys dense forests and grasses grow on both sides of these river valleys forming a unique river valley ecosystem however with the increasing socio economic water consumption the water demand of river valley ecosystem is gradually not guaranteed resulting in serious ecological problems such as grassland degradation therefore how to solve the ecological problems of the northwest inland river basins by means of ecological operation and irrigation is the purpose of this study for improving the irrigation efficiency of ecological water and restoring the damaged river valley ecosystem this study proposed a novel irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation eii and established a multi scale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with eii for the restoration of river valley forests and grasses the proposed irrigation method eii involves three systems of ecology irrigation and water resources and comprehensively considers ecological water demand vegetation irrigation and multi scale reservoir operation moreover compared with flooding irrigation one of the main advantages of eii is that it can make irrigating water stay in irrigation district for a longer time and infiltrate into the soil more fully thereby promoting the growth of river valley forests and grasses therefore we call this irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation the main contents of this study are shown in fig 1 section 2 introduces the basic theory of eii including necessary conditions definition and connotation and project layout section 3 details the methods of establishing multi scale ecological operation model coupled with eii including the division of ecological irrigation districts the calculation of ecological water demand the establishment of long term and real time ecological operation models and the coupling of ecological operation and eii section 4 presents and discusses the study results of ecological operation and grassland irrigation and section 5 draws our conclusions the study results have important theoretical value and practical significance for guiding the ecological protection and restoration of forests and grasses in river valleys 2 basic theory of ecological infiltration irrigation 2 1 necessary conditions for ecological infiltration irrigation nowadays the common irrigation method for river valley grasslands is mainly based on flooding irrigation the irrigation scope of flooding irrigation is concentrated on the low lying river beaches and the limited area extended by ecological irrigation canals while most areas far away from rivers cannot be effectively irrigated resulting in large ecological water supply but low ecological irrigation efficiency meanwhile the retention time of ecological water in irrigation districts is generally short for flooding irrigation causing a large part of irrigating water to return to river therefore the current flooding irrigation based method will not only cause irrigating water waste but also make it difficult to achieve the ecological goal of grassland restoration in order to improve irrigation efficiency a novel ecological irrigation method eii is proposed in this paper through the construction of eii supporting projects such as ecological gates water blocking dams and irrigation canals irrigating water can be repeatedly and continuously consumed in grasslands along the river 2 2 definition and connotation of ecological infiltration irrigation the basic definition of eii is that according to the water demand of river valley ecosystem the downstream ecological irrigation projects control the artificial floods created by upstream ecological operation to form a timely and appropriate ecological irrigation which is called ecological infiltration irrigation the basic connotation of eii is mainly reflected in the four aspects of resistance diversion dredging and overflow resistance refers to the construction of ecological gates water blocking dams overflow outlets and other engineering measures to prolong irrigation time and expand irrigation scope diversion means ecological irrigation through diversion gates and main irrigation canals dredging is to dredge the branches and tributaries of the river and to dig secondary canals for irrigating forests and grasses overflow means the formation of an ecological irrigation system with accessible water network and submerged grasslands 2 3 project layout of ecological infiltration irrigation the project layout of eii system should meet the requirements of the overall design and irrigation standard of each irrigation district and the complete project layout is shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the construction and operation of ecological gates and ecological canals are the important prerequisites for the effective implementation of eii ecological gates are mainly arranged in the main river which can increase water level increase floodplain water and expand ecological flooding area main irrigation canals are mainly arranged in the higher areas of irrigation district to control the larger irrigating area by gravity flow and other irrigation canals at all levels should also be arranged in the higher areas within their respective control ranges additionally for some areas that cannot be reached by floods water pumps can be used for irrigation if an irrigation district does not have the conditions to build large scale ecological projects such as water blocking dams and main irrigation canals ecological irrigation canals without anti seepage lining can be built along the riverbank as shown in fig 3 the construction of ecological irrigation canals can effectively irrigate forests and grasses far from the riverbank and the unlined treatment makes part of canal water seep into the soil on both sides of the canal in summary the engineering system of eii can not only expand the irrigation area of forests and grasses in river valleys but also replenish groundwater on both sides of the river 3 methodology 3 1 division of eii irrigation district scientific division of irrigation district is an important guarantee for the realization of precision ecological irrigation according to the river system characteristics grassland distribution eii project layout and other factors the division of irrigation district is carried out for the efficient utilization of water resources the eii irrigation districts at all levels are divided as follows 1 level i irrigation district the characteristics of watershed river system is the dominant factor in the division of level i irrigation districts to reflect the differences in the natural zones 2 level ii irrigation district the major ecological irrigation projects e g large ecological gates built on the river mainstream and the geographical locations of river intersection are the leading factors to divide the level ii irrigation districts 3 level iii irrigation district based on natural geography climate conditions farming units and other factors the level iii irrigation districts are divided for the analysis of ecological water demand in different regions 3 2 calculation of ecological water demand the ecological water demand of forests and grasses in river valley refers to the water necessary to ensure that river valley ecosystem performs its normal function at specific development periods it has obvious temporal and spatial characteristics and is the basis for determining the vegetation irrigation quota 3 2 1 penman monteith equation the calculation of ecological water demand of non agricultural land in irrigation district shall consider the ecological water demand of forest land grassland shrub land and reed land because the basic physiological water demand of general plants accounts for a small proportion of evapotranspiration the ecological water demand of vegetation can be directly and approximately determined by the water consumption of vegetation evapotranspiration in the calculation of ecological water demand the penman monteith equation recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao is often used doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 taking alfalfa as the reference crop assuming that the crop plant height is 0 12 m the canopy resistance is 70 m s and the albedo is 0 23 its evapotranspiration is equivalent to that of the open green grassland with vigorous and consistent growth complete ground coverage and sufficient water supply then the calculation formula of evapotranspiration e t 0 of reference crop is as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where e t 0 is the evapotranspiration of reference crop mm d δ is the slope of the saturated water pressure curve kpa r n is the net surface radiation mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux density mj m² d γ is the psychrometer constant kpa t m e a n is the daily average temperature at a height of 2 m u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the saturated water pressure kpa e s is the actual water pressure kpa 3 2 2 empirical formula limited by the data this paper uses empirical formula instead of penman monteith equation to calculate the water demand process of vegetation according to the existing methods for calculating vegetation evapotranspiration several main factors e g water surface evaporation temperature humidity radiation etc are selected from many factors affecting vegetation evapotranspiration based on the experimental observation data the quantitative relationships between these main factors and vegetation evapotranspiration are analyzed and then summarized into an empirical formula many studies show that reference crop evapotranspiration has a good correlation with water surface evaporation trajkovic and kolakovic 2010 heydari and heydari 2013 awe et al 2020 in practical applications et 0 can usually be estimated by measured water surface evaporation and the calculation formula is described as follows 2 e t 0 λ e 601 where λ is reduction coefficient and e 601 is the water surface evaporation measured by ϕ 601 evaporating dish mm 3 2 3 ecological water demand quota of vegetation by calculating the evapotranspiration e t 0 of vegetation and using the water demand coefficient k t and conversion coefficient ξ of vegetation the ecological water demand quota for different vegetation can be calculated wu et al 2018 the calculation formula is as follows 3 e t i t k i t e t 0 ξ where e t i t and k i t are respectively the ecological water demand quota and water demand coefficient of vegetation i in period t ξ is conversion coefficient and ξ 2 3 3 2 4 ecological water demand of vegetation in this paper the quota area method is selected for the calculation of ecological water demand of forests and grasses in river valley li et al 2013 wang and yang 2019 the ecological water demand of a certain type of vegetation in an irrigation district is the product of its area and its ecological water demand quota thus the total ecological water demand of vegetation in irrigation district is equal to the sum of the ecological water demand of various vegetation the calculation formula is as follows 4 w i t e t i t a i where w i t and e t i t are respectively the ecological water demand and ecological water demand quota of vegetation i in period t a i is the area of vegetation i 3 3 long term ecological optimal operation of reservoir group in order to give full play to the vital operation role of reservoir group the long term ecological optimal operation model was established for optimization of four operation objectives i e the minimum ecological and socio economic water shortage the maximum water diversion the maximum comprehensive benefit and the maximum hydropower generation moreover the water supply assurance rate and basin water balance are taken as the global constraints while the reservoir water balance water level constraints water supply constraints and output constraints are taken as the local constraints 3 3 1

limits of hydropower output k e l e q e l e and h e l e are the output coefficient flow and waterhead for hydropower generation respectively 3 3 3 solution method for optimization model due to the complexity of optimization model this paper transformed the multi objective model into a single objective model by taking the minimum ecological and socio economic water shortage as the main objective and treating other objectives as constraints moreover using large scale system coordination decomposition method the multi reservoir operation problem was decomposed into several single reservoir operation problems with water connection the optimal operation of a single reservoir was solved by dynamic programming method and then solved by the coordinator through iteration 3 4 real time ecological optimal operation of reservoir group coupling hydrological and ecological processes we constructed a one dimensional hydrodynamic model to determine the outflow of each reservoir flood encounter time of mainstream and tributaries flood discharge of floodplain and other main parameter thresholds next according to the macro long term operating strategy reservoir water storage and ecological water demand the real time optimal operation model of reservoir group was established at the micro implementation level for the deduction of the artificial flood process suitable for the growth of forests and grasses 3 4 1 real time optimal operation model in critical ecological period aiming at minimizing the water shortage in the critical period of forest and grass growth the real time ecological optimal operation model of reservoir group is established as follows 16 min w f o r e s t g r a s s t 1 t d f o r e s t g r a s s t s f o r e s t g r a s s t 17 s t w f o r e s t g r a

calculated by long term operation model t is the total number of operation periods n is the serial number of reservoirs q and q are respectively the inflow and outflow of reservoir δ t is time step v is reservoir storage the one dimensional constant flow saint venant equations are used for river flow simulation the basic equations including continuity equation and momentum equation are described

is chezy coefficient r is hydraulic radius m g is gravitational acceleration m s2 h is water level m in addition the model includes the constraints of reservoirs and ecological projects which are not listed one by one due to space limitations 3 4 2 solution method for optimization model the real time optimal operation model of reservoir group is solved by genetic algorithm the specific principle is to define a constraint dominated rule for the division of all solutions into feasible and infeasible solutions and then to judge any two solutions a and b based on feasibility the idea is as follows 1 if solution a is a feasible solution and solution b is an infeasible solution then solution a is better than solution b 2 if both solutions a and b are infeasible but the constraint violation of solution a is less than that of solution b then solution a is better than solution b 3 if both solutions a and b are feasible and the objective value of solution a is better than that of solution b then solution a is better than solution b additionally the saint venant equations are discretized by abbott six point implicit difference method the calculation grid is composed of water level points and flow points calculated respectively at the same time step 3 5 coupling of ecological operation and ecological infiltration irrigation focusing on the disconnection between current ecological operation and ecological irrigation and the low irrigation efficiency of traditional flooding irrigation a multi scale ecological operation model coupled with eii was established for the irrigation and restoration of river valley forests and grasses firstly through long term ecological operation the ecological operation rules of reservoir group are derived for the obtaining of ecological available water supply in different hydrological years and critical ecological periods then based on the long term ecological operation strategy of reservoir group the ecological water demand of each irrigation district and the water storage and inflow of each reservoir reservoirs on mainstream and tributaries gather flood peaks through real time ecological operation to create artificial ecological flood processes suitable for the growth of river valley forests and grasses finally by the joint operation of eii projects such as ecological gates water blocking dams and ecological canals the water level of artificial flood is raised and then the artificial flood is controllably introduced into irrigation districts for the precision irrigation of river valley grasslands see fig 2 in the deep water irrigation districts on river floodplains artificial flood directly irrigates the forests and grasses through overflow outlets in the shallow water irrigation districts on the higher river terraces artificial flood is introduced into these districts for grassland irrigation through main irrigation canals and pump stations furthermore the connected project layout of eii system makes the irrigation water can be reused among multiple irrigation districts through the coupling of ecological operation and eii the current extensive irrigation mode of ecological operation can be changed into a new mode of timely and appropriate ecological irrigation 4 results and discussions in this paper eii technology is applied to the ecological restoration of river valley forests and grasses in an inland river basin of northwest china to test the feasibility and effectiveness of this new ecological irrigation theory with the development of social economy the contradiction between ecological and non ecological water use is becoming increasingly serious in this basin at the same time due to the low irrigation coverage and low water utilization efficiency of traditional ecological irrigation mode the water demand of watershed ecosystem has not been met for a long time resulting in the increasingly degradation of river valley grasslands thus it is urgent to find an efficient ecological irrigation method for the problem of ecological degradation in the basin 4 1 division of ecological infiltration irrigation district according to the distribution of river valley grasslands the layout of reservoir group and eii system projects river system and natural landform the ecological function areas of river valley forests and grasses in the basin are divided into 5 level i irrigation districts 9 level ii irrigation districts and 13 level iii irrigation districts as shown in fig 4 the downstream areas of the mainstream reservoir r 2 and the three tributary reservoirs i e r 3 r 5 and r 7 are divided into irrigation district i ii iii and iv respectively and the downstream wetland of reservoir r 2 and r 3 is separately divided into irrigation district v within the irrigation district i three secondary irrigation districts i 1 i 2 and i 3 are divided according to the river system characteristics and project layout the internal division of other irrigation districts is similar to that of irrigation district i and finally the ecological infiltration irrigation districts in the basin are formed into the distribution of 5 9 13 4 2 analysis on the ecological water demand of river valley vegetation analyzing the phenological laws and water demand processes of forests and grasses in river valleys is the key to carry out ecological operation and eii since the ecological water demand of river valley vegetation in the basin is mainly concentrated from april to september in a year the ecological water demand of each irrigation district in these months is calculated according to the data of water surface evaporation solar radiation air temperature and wind speed of representative meteorological stations as shown in table 1 and fig 5 the total ecological water demand of river valley forests and grasses from april to september is 648 million m3 of which the water demand from june to july accounts for 51 2 moreover among the level i irrigation districts the ecological water demand of irrigation district i is the largest reaching 402 million m3 and accounting for 62 0 of the total water demand of level i irrigation districts 4 3 regime of ecological infiltration irrigation the irrigation regime of eii mainly includes irrigation time irrigation times and irrigation quota according to the irrigating test data and the ecological water demand of river valley forests and grasses the irrigation regime of eii is formulated to provide technical support for the planning of irrigation projects and the management of irrigation districts table 2 presents the irrigation regime of eii for river valley forests and grasses where mu is a common unit of area in china and 1 mu is equal to 666 67 square meters or 1 hectare is equal to 15 mu among the vegetation in the basin the irrigation quota of reed land is the largest accounting for 27 of the total irrigation quota of all vegetation while the irrigation quota of sandy grassland is the smallest accounting for 6 of the total irrigation quota of all vegetation in addition the total irrigation quota from june 30 to july 8 is the largest which is 300 m3 mu accounting for 13 of the total irrigation quota from april to september 4 4 long term ecological operation results of reservoir group according to the importance and assurance rate requirements of water use units water supply obeys such priorities of domestic and industrial water ecological base flow inter basin water diversion agricultural irrigation river valley ecology and lake replenishment and the corresponding design assurance rates are 95 90 90 75 50 and 50 respectively the operation period is from may 1959 to april 2012 of which the flood season is from may to july with ten days as time step and the non flood season is from august to april of the next year with one month as time step in the middle reaches of the river the total ecological water demand of the core protected area for river valley forests and grasses is 516 million m3 considering factors such as water surface evaporation and groundwater replenishment the upstream reservoirs r 2 and r 3 need to discharge a total of 520 million m3 of water including 446 million m3 of water from reservoir r 2 and 74 million m3 of water from reservoir r 3 to meet the ecological water demand and the irrigation requirement of eii in the core protected area by solving the long term ecological optimal operation model of reservoir group the water supply guarantee rates of all units in the basin are obtained as shown in table 3 on the whole the water supply of each unit meets the requirement of corresponding design guarantee rate especially the water supply of forests and grasses in each irrigation district meets the design requirement of 50 indicating that the ecological operation of reservoir group can provide sufficient ecological water for the implementation of eii projects on a macro scale 4 5 real time ecological operation results of reservoir group real time ecological operation refers to the operation of critical ecological period of river valley forests and grasses from late may to early june every year according to the long term operation strategy reservoir storage and ecological water demand the real time ecological optimal operation model is solved in hourly steps to determine the key parameters such as the reservoir outflow the encounter time of mainstream and tributary floods and the flood discharge of floodplain during the peak gathering progress of real time operation reservoirs r 1 and r 2 take the lead in opening the spillway gate to create an artificial flood process in the upper reaches of the mainstream then considering the encounter time of mainstream and tributary floods reservoir r 3 opens the spillway gate to discharge water and carries out peak gathering operation in the middle reaches of the mainstream next the spillway gates of reservoirs r 4 and r 5 are opened for gathering flood peak in the lower reaches of the mainstream finally reservoirs r 6 and r 7 carry out peak gathering operation for mainstream flood besides meeting the peak gathering requirements of mainstream flood the artificial flood created by each tributary reservoir also meets the irrigation requirements of eii in the tributary ecological irrigation districts fig 6 shows the measured artificial flood process in june 2016 and its simulated process based on real time ecological operation model and one dimensional hydrodynamic model mike 11 the model calculations are close to the measured values and the average relative error is 0 05 indicating that the model result is reasonable in the core protected area of river valley forests and grasses the design floodplain discharge for eii is 800 m3 s from 2001 to 2016 there were only 11 years when the natural flood peak in the core protected area was greater than 800 m3 s but after the peak gathering operation of reservoir group there were 15 years when the flood peak met the design requirement of floodplain discharge see fig 7 the artificial flood process created by the real time ecological operation of mainstream and tributary reservoirs provides necessary hydrological conditions for the implementation of forest and grass irrigation in river valley 4 6 effect analysis of ecological infiltration irrigation 4 6 1 ecological benefits since the implementation of eii in 2016 there have been remarkable effects on the ecological irrigation and restoration of river valley grasslands taking the demonstration of core protected area in critical ecological period in 2018 as an example from remote sensing images the core protected area was basically fully irrigated through eii with an effective irrigation rate of 82 4 see fig 8 and a vegetation coverage of 74 8 see fig 9 which basically met the ecological water demand of forests and grasses in the river valley fig 10 shows the interannual variation of vegetation coverage in the core protected area from 2000 to 2018 due to the implementation of eii the vegetation coverage in the core protected area increased significantly and remained stable from 2016 to 2018 close to the highest level since 2000 eii prolongs the retention time of floods in irrigation districts and expands the irrigation area thereby significantly restoring the degraded grassland ecosystem in river valley and effectively ensuring the ecological security of the river basin 4 6 2 socio economic benefits river valley grasslands have always been important winter pastures for agriculture and animal husbandry in this region as shown in table 4 since the adoption of eii for grassland irrigation in 2016 the average forage yield of river valley grasslands has increased from 165 kg mu to 206 kg mu with an increase of 25 according to the purchase price of 280 yuan t the direct economic benefit has an average increase of 18 9 million yuan per year effectively improving the economic income of local farmers and herdsmen and ensuring the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the region 5 conclusions aiming at the extensive management problems in ecological operation and ecological irrigation this paper proposed a novel ecological irrigation method ecological infiltration irrigation eii and established a multi scale ecological operation model of reservoir group coupled with eii for the restoration of river valley forests and grasses the rationality of ecological operation model and the feasibility of eii technology were then verified through case analysis the conclusions are as follows 1 in order to improve irrigation efficiency a novel ecological irrigation method eii was proposed in this paper through the construction of eii supporting projects irrigating water can be repeatedly and continuously consumed in grasslands along river for the improvement of ecological irrigation efficiency 2 through the 5 9 13 division of ecological irrigation districts the analysis on the ecological water demand and the multi scale ecological operation coupled with eii suitable artificial floods will be created and fully introduced into ecological irrigation districts to realize the timely and appropriate ecological irrigation of forests and grasses in river valleys changing the extensive management mode of traditional ecological operation and ecological irrigation 3 since the application of eii in 2016 there have been remarkable effects on the ecological irrigation and restoration of river valley grasslands in the research region taking the critical ecological period in 2018 as an example the core protected area was basically fully irrigated through eii with an effective irrigation rate of 82 4 and a vegetation coverage of 74 8 which basically met the ecological water demand of forests and grasses in the river valley 4 for the agriculture and animal husbandry in the research region after using eii technology for grassland irrigation the average forage yield of river valley grasslands has increased from 165 kg mu to 206 kg mu with an increase of 25 according to the purchase price of 280 yuan t the direct economic benefit has an average increase of 18 9 million yuan per year effectively improving the economic income of local farmers and herdsmen the research results have important theoretical value and practical significance for guiding the ecological protection and restoration of forests and grasses in river valleys at present the ecological protection object of this study is mainly the river valley vegetation there is no in depth study on the protection of aquatic organisms and their habitats in the river in the next step we will therefore comprehensively consider the ecological protection objects inside and outside the river and carry out more systematic research on ecological operation and ecological restoration declaration of competing interest the
