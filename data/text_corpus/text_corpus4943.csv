24715,a comprehensive understanding of the spatial carbon metabolism distribution is essential for future mitigation policies from a land based perspective this study develops a methodological framework for carbon metabolism measurement and future simulation an assessment of carbon sequestration and emission is conducted based on land use components within the biosphere carbon scenarios in accordance with the governmental mitigation policy were then established and these were coupled with future multiple type land use transitions to simulate the future spatial carbon distribution this future carbon distribution map can help us understand the carbon dynamics in specific locations with possible land based mitigation for policy making guangzhou which is a rapid urbanization metropolis in china was taken as a case study to conduct the proposed methodological framework and models the results revealed that high density carbon emissions dominated in the city center and expanded in the east west direction while carbon sequestration diminished in the middle and southern areas with a decreased total sequestration amount the carbon distribution in the 2030 scenarios highlighted different mitigation implications for different locations in the north south and central areas projections of emission reductions in northern outskirts and southern sub center as well as the projections of sequestration increases in the city center and northern mountainous area are then proposed to support mitigation the established framework is proven to be effective for examining spatial carbon features at an urban scale and the empirical findings can provide valuable insight into carbon mitigation strategies for rapid urbanization areas in developing countries keywords carbon mitigation land use change policy making carbon metabolism flus model guangzhou 1 introduction three quarters of the total global carbon emissions have been found to occur in urban areas intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 which only occupy 2 share of the world land area hence cities are rethinking their responsibility for carbon mitigation grimm et al 2008 as shown in previous studies land use and cover change lucc is considered as a primary driver of carbon storage loss for example land turned into cultivated land and forest lands and grasslands with high carbon storage densities have been converted into urban built up lands with low carbon storage densities wu et al 2016 de carvalho and szlafsztein 2019 the acceleration of urbanization has inevitably changed the land cover from natural vegetation to urban patterns with complicated man made surfaces zhao et al 2019 su et al 2020 these variations significantly influence the carbon emission and sequestration cycles in the biosphere a process that is defined as carbon metabolism in urban metabolism studies hutyra et al 2011 cui 2018 in china urbanization rapid population migration and land use transitions have made carbon emissions increase dramatically leading to a challenge for carbon mitigation wang et al 2018a thus an understanding of the spatial carbon distribution and patterns can provide insights for future mitigation policies from a land based perspective to explore the carbon emission and sequestration changes the development of methods for carbon assessments has been focused on for several decades the international council for local environmental initiatives iclei first developed a carbon accounting method to calculate the emissions generated by energy use in the 1990s iclei 1993 in 2006 the ippc international panel on climate change established carbon emission accounting guidelines which provided empirical coefficients to estimate fuel carbon emissions ipcc 2006 with the advantage of energy consumption data availability energy related emissions have since been widely studied in urban areas kennedy et al 2010 kellett 2013 different from emissions carbon sequestration is considered to be related to the land cover types in a natural system tao et al 2015 xu et al 2016 the carbon sequestration capacity of different land cover types usually reflected by the carbon storage density have typically been used as constant coefficients for most carbon sequestration estimations long et al 2014 li et al 2020 to support these sequestration assessments remote sensing has been used to interpret land cover areas and monitor changes by scholars bp 2019 thus studies of carbon metabolism have typically been conducted as 1 sequestration changes due to land cover changes and 2 emission changes caused by energy consumption variations in a socioeconomic system although there are growing literatures on territorial carbon change and related assessment studies referred to cities and rural settlements in developing countries were still limited making the land related carbon estimation in non developed cities a challenge chavez et al 2012 paloheimo and salmi 2013 minx et al 2013 sohn et al 2018 semieniuk and yakovenko 2020 since the application of the geographic information system gis in carbon emission sequestration studies research on the spatial patterns of carbon emission sequestration dynamics has been focused on land component layouts some studies have examined spatial carbon sequestration features among different natural land covers to reveal the effects of land urbanization liu et al 2018 wu et al 2018 xia et al 2019 by focusing on one land cover type for example the forest rittenhouse and rissman built three scenarios including a static forest an all forest and a dynamic forest to examine future land cover change effects on carbon sequestration rittenhouse and rissman 2012 future carbon sequestration simulations concerning other land cover types such as grasslands and croplands have also been studied using a scenario analysis wang et al 2015 however these sequestration simulations have primarily been quantitative assessments without a spatial analysis in addition they did not consider the interactions and competitions between multiple lucc types which ignores the complex interrelationships between the land components in the lucc processes liu et al 2017 limited by data availability spatial carbon emission studies have typically been conducted at national or regional scales by using economic models cai et al 2018 researchers have calculated the energy related carbon emissions of different cities and mapped their differentiation to reveal the differences between cities different from those large scale studies zhang et al used land areas and related empirical conversion coefficients of different land use types to calculate carbon emissions and analyzed their spatial distribution at the city level zhang et al 2014 other methods such as the ecological network model have also been applied to study the spatial carbon metabolism between urban land components xia et al 2016 according to the network method in the study of xia et al land transfers between a given pair of components can produce the same relationship mutualism or a different relationship such as competition in the following period which is then used to describe the spatial carbon emissions future carbon simulations have been another focus in this field to reflect possible carbon dynamics in urban areas limited by data availability and estimation accounting current references have typically used regression analyses e g concerning economic development or energy consumption in xu et al 2015 to predict future carbon quantities rather than spatial simulations other studies have simulated carbon emissions by using a network model supported by highly aggregate data and thus these studies have provided a snapshot of carbon emissions at the regional level without specific analysis of locations activities or people chen et al 2015 thus spatial information of future carbon emissions is vitally important for effective mitigation from a land based perspective madlener and sunak 2011 to summarize considerable improvements have been made in the field of carbon metabolism studies a number of which are noted in fig 1 however simulations of future spatial carbon metabolism that integrate both carbon emissions and sequestration changes in urban spatial layouts are needed to understand how decarbonization can work through land based policy to address this research target this study aims to do the following 1 develop a land based carbon metabolism accounting to assess carbon sequestration and emissions for different land use types that uses carbon metabolism as a sub process of urban metabolism and 2 establish future spatial carbon scenarios that couple the governmental decarbonization target with multiple type land use simulations to locate specific areas for effective land based mitigation 2 method 2 1 the study framework in this section a carbon metabolism framework is developed including 1 the land based accounting 2 the spatial pattern assessment and 3 the future spatial simulation modeling this approach can be conducted by three steps firstly the land based carbon emissions and sequestrations were estimated according to the established carbon accounting then the spatial carbon metabolism pattern was investigated by using the land use transition matrix which is supported by the remote sensing data finally the assumed carbon scenarios were coupled with land use change simulation by using future land use simulation flus model which can be downloaded at http www geosimulation cn flus html liu et al 2017 fig 2 presents an overview of the study framework 2 2 carbon metabolism accounting a land based carbon metabolism accounting was established to quantify the carbon dioxide emissions and sequestrations for different land use types in this accounting the land use types were classified as urban land u rural land r transportation and industrial land t cultivated land c grassland g forest f water w and bare land b which is in accordance with the standard classification of remote sensing monitoring systems u refers to the built up areas of a city which comprise human daily life activities both household and office activities r represents the rural residential areas independent from the urban zone which encompasses the rural daily household life t is the land areas for transport and industry production use c is the cultivated land that is composed of irrigated cultivated land and dry cultivated land denoted as c1 and c2 g includes three sub classes which are high coverage grassland vegetation cover more than 50 medium coverage grassland vegetation cover between 20 and 50 and low coverage grassland vegetation cover between 5 and 20 signed as g1 g2 and g3 respectively f comprises four sub classes including forest shrub land open woodland and other woodland which are designated as f1 f2 f3 and f4 respectively w refers to three sub classes which are rivers lakes and reservoirs and intermittently flooded land denoted as w1 w2 and w3 respectively b is bare land that is considered unusable by humans to conduct carbon quantification on a certain kind of land use type the linkage between carbon metabolism and land use type was established by defining the land components among the land use classifications f g and w which reflect the natural land cover are the natural components land use types u r and t which refer to the urban or rural daily life and the freight passenger transport and industry production are considered as the artificial components land use type c with crop cultivation including both vegetation cover and human farming activities is defined as the semi natural component thus the natural components with natural land cover are used to calculate carbon sequestration artificial components with anthropogenic land use activities are responsible for carbon emission estimation finally the semi natural component with both natural cover and human activity refers to the measurement of both emissions and sequestrations carbon emissions from the artificial components were calculated by using a physical flow method which is based on our previous publication concerning urban metabolism cui et al 2019 as one of the output items in the urban metabolism carbon emissions were calculated using different human activities including 1 agricultural and industrial product production primarily energy use 2 breath soil livestock and human and 3 freight and passenger transportation thus carbon emissions from these activities could be calculated to match the certain land use type including 1 c 2 u and r and 3 t as shown by eqs 1 4 these connect the carbon emissions to certain land use functions which will facilitate further spatial analysis 1 c e c f

related land cover areas and their empirical coefficients see table 1 which was provided by zhang et al 2014 both the carbon emission and sequestration were valued as the carbon metabolism rate denoted as kgcyr 1 carbon emission sequestration amount per year 2 3 spatial pattern assessment in this section the spatial carbon metabolism pattern is depicted by combining the carbon emission sequestration density with the land use transition matrix the land use transition matrix was calculated by using the land use monitoring data the carbon emission sequestration density of a certain land use type is usually obtained from the carbon metabolism emission or sequestration rate divided by land area zhang et al 2014 for natural components the spatial carbon sequestration density is determined by the land cover types as the sequestration coefficients imply for the artificial components the carbon emission rate and related land area were used to calculate the carbon emission density for a certain land type for the semi natural component with both carbon emission and sequestration the difference between the carbon emission and the sequestration rate were calculated to obtain a net value to calculate the emission sequestration density land use transition among different natural components which leads to sequestration density changes can be calculated using the difference of the final and initial sequestration coefficients of different land types other kinds of land use transitions including transitions between different land use components and transitions among artificial components cause carbon emission sequestration density changes through the final and initial density difference as shown in eq 5 5 δ d d i d j c i s i c j s j w h e n c i a n d c j a r e t h e b o t h e m i s s i o n o r s e q u e s t r a t i o n d i d j c i s i c j s j w h e n c i a n d c j a r e d i f f e r e n t t y p e s e m i s s i o n o r s e q u e s t r a t i o n where δd is the density change for a given land type which can be positive δd 0 or negative δd 0 i and j denote the final and initial land types and s indicates the land use area c represents the carbon metabolism rate which can be emission or sequestration finally the spatial carbon metabolism pattern can be described by multiplying the land transition area and related density change the land patch with increasing carbon emissions or decreasing carbon sequestration is then regarded as a negative process and vice versa this enables a map of the spatial carbon metabolism pattern with information of the net emission sequestration increases or decreases the spatial carbon metabolism pattern can then be reflected by the dominant carbon density change and its spatial distribution features 2 4 spatial simulation modeling in this section future land based carbon simulation was conducted to simulate future land use change and spatial carbon distribution it concerns two coupled modules 1 future land use simulation which is to assess a given grid as either transiting to another land use type or remaining in the current type and 2 carbon amount assumption by determining if there is any policy intervention for carbon emissions of different land use types the carbon amount for different land use type can be located through the future land simulation leading to the future spatial carbon distribution the modeling structure and general process are shown in fig 3 module one used the markov chain to project the future land demand of 15 sub types on a quantity perspective which was then combined with the trained artificial neural network ann and the self adaptive inertia process to conduct the spatial simulation module two assumed the alternatives of carbon scenarios on the basis of the carbon metabolism level in 2015 with regard to the governmental targets finally different carbon metabolism alternatives have been coupled with the spatial land use simulation to display the spatial carbon distribution grimm et al 2006 the general concept of this modeling is to simulate the future spatial carbon distribution from a land based perspective the alternative carbon scenarios and multiple land use change have been integrated by different carbon metabolism mechanism on different land use type for a given land use grid its land use type has been predicted in module one which was then followed by assigning related carbon amount in module two the complex adaptive process in module one enables the land use grid change as an individual that influenced by the historical and current land use pattern and the governmental policy targets in module two provides the carbon emission differences caused by different policy formulations thus this method is to provide spatial information of future carbon patterns under different policy regulation and locate specific land scope for effective land based carbon mitigation 2 4 1 module one in module one the interactions and competitions between 15 sub land use types were considered to simulate the future land use change since the multiple type land use simulation is difficult to conduct using the traditional cellular automaton ca approach li and yeh 2002 yang et al 2008 chen et al 2014 a future land use simulation flus model was introduced due to its advantage of higher accuracy in complex land simulations liu et al 2017 li et al 2017 the flus model operates through a top down land use demand prediction coupled with a down top spatial simulation which is considered effective at different scales of studies liu et al 2017 thus the flus model is a modeling framework in this study to that is integrated by using different embedded calculation processes for the quantity prediction the markov chain was used to project the quantity demand of 15 sub land use types in this study which determines the transition probability on the basis of historical land use data arsanjani et al 2011 ghosh et al 2017 this land use demand was then used to guide a ca based spatial simulation to meet the projected land quantity for the spatial simulation the trained artificial neural network ann was first used to train the probability of occurrence of each land use type for a given grid cell this process was conducted on the basis of the current land use data which has been proven to be effective in flus operation liang et al 2018 second the interactions among the different land use types were considered on the basis of an inheritance mechanism liu et al 2017 the current land uses on each grid cell could then be adjusted automatically according to the differences between future land use demand and current allocated land use areas which were calculated as shown in eq 6 6 i n e r t i a k t i n e r t i a k t 1 i f d k t 1 d k t 2 i n e r t i a k t 1 d k t 2 d k t 1 i f d k t 1 d k t 2 0 i n e r t i a k t 1 d k t 1 d k t 2 i f 0 d k t 2 d k t 1 where d k t 1 is the difference between the predicted macro demand and the allocated amount of land use type k until iteration time t 1 and i n e r t i a k t 1 indicates the inertia coefficient for type k at time t 1 the combined probability of a cell being occupied by a certain land use type can be calculated by combining the result of ann and the self adaptive inertia process as eq 7 shows 7 t p p k t p p k ω p k t i n e r t i a k t 1 s c c k where t p p k t represents the combined probability of the grid cell p for conversion from the original land use type to the target type k at iteration time t p p k denotes the probability of occurrence of land use type k on grip cell p which was generated from the ann algorithm ω p k t is the neighborhood influence of land use type k on cell p at time t i t e r t i a k t indicates the self adaptive coefficient of land use type k at time t and sc c k represents the conversion cost from the original land use type c to k the sensitivity of the flus model has been examined when liu et al 2017 first proposed the model their case study proved that the simulation results of the flus model are not very sensitive to the flexible conversion cost variations in this study we referred to the flexible conversion cost setting in liu et al 2017 s literature to ensure the model stability finally the roulette wheel selection was followed to process the competition between different land uses this self adaptive and competitive mechanism enables the comprehensive development probability of each grid cell for future land use allocation for the model uncertainty over space there is a stochastic mechanism in the flus model to reflect the uncertainty of real world land use change liu et al 2017 in this stochastic mechanism a uniform distribution random number from 0 to 1 was generated in the roulette wheel selection for different land use types which is to assign related land use type to a certain grid cell in an iteration 2 4 2 module two in module two we establish carbon scenarios to project the future carbon change on the multiple land use simulation result displaying the spatial carbon distribution in the future by relating the governmental intervention on carbon emissions with different land components the spatially explicit carbon distribution under different interventions can be illustrated in this perspective the carbon distribution difference caused by different policy formulations can be understood through 1 specific locations with significant carbon changes under a certain regulation and 2 what impact the land based policy can have for further mitigation concerning these locations therefore the carbon emission scenario was established in accordance with the governmental target on mitigation policies by considering the primary source of emissions the carbon emission scenarios were established according to the following decarbonization target alternatives alternative 1 govern total emission alternative 2 govern energy emission alternative 3 control population increase under each alternative the carbon emissions for different land use types were valued according to the mandatory mitigation target by coupling this with the result of the flus model the carbon scenario maps under different alternatives were obtained and compared with each other locating specific areas for further policy making since carbon sequestration density is typically considered stable in a short period because the vegetation types and their coefficients are recognized as fixed parameters espirito santo et al 2015 the spatial carbon sequestration will be influenced only by the flus results this land based simulation and scenario modeling can overcome the uncertainty and complexity in land use transitions among the 15 sub land use types and provide fine spatial information for future carbon distributions under different policies 3 study area and datasets 3 1 study area guangzhou is the third largest city and an important economic and cultural center of china which can be taken as a representative of the rapid developed cities in china guangzhou was selected as the empirical object in this carbon metabolism study for the purpose 1 to examine its spatial carbon metabolism feature by using the land based carbon accounting and 2 to testify the method put forward by this study which can be used as a reference for other cities this empirical study will be helpful in providing some suggestions for the carbon mitigation strategies when facing the continuous urbanization process guangzhou which is a megacity with an area of 7434 km2 and a population of nearly 9 3 million 2019 data from the guangzhou municipal statistics bureau 2020 is the third largest megacity located in southern china fig 4 guangzhou is the economic political and cultural center of guangdong province and has experienced dramatic industrial development and population growth with serious decarbonization challenges based on its spatial carbon distribution from 2000 to 2015 a future simulation for 2030 was then conducted for land based carbon mitigation to support sustainable development of guangzhou 3 2 datasets 3 2 1 carbon metabolism data collection the data used in this section were from 2000 to 2015 which were based on carbon metabolism accounting the fertilizer amount and farming machine power for the agricultural land component the amount of different livestock and fuel consumption for the rural land component the daily life energy consumption and population for the urban land component and the energy use for the transportation and industrial land use component were obtained from the guangzhou statistical yearbook 2001 2016 all the carbon emission coefficients of energy use were acquired from the ipcc 2006 3 2 2 lucc data possessing the lucc datasets of guangzhou for the years 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were derived from the original datasets of the chinese academy of sciences cas http www resdc cn with a resolution of 30 m the original lucc data were generated from landsat tm data by using the standard classification of the remote sensing monitoring system of china the overall discrimination accuracy for all of the land use types reached more than 95 according to the carbon metabolism accounting the original lucc types were combined into 15 types based on the eight components and related sub classes in section 2 2 table 2 shows the land use areas for four years in which bare land is ignored due to its unusable feature 3 2 3 data possessing for spatial simulation modeling a total of 11 spatial driving forces were prepared using the gis function these spatial variables were normalized within the range of 0 1 for the initial year of simulation these variables included the digital elevation model dem aspect slope distance to districts and various traffic distance variables as shown in fig 5 the carbon emission scenarios were established according to the governmental mandatory regulation and related policy formulations which include three alternatives the reference r scenario the low transportation and industrial energy use le scenario and the urban population growth pg scenario table 3 shows the three scenarios for carbon emission decreases of the artificial and semi artificial components on the basis of the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 of the chinese government china has reduced 20 of its total carbon emissions during the last five years from 2010 to 2015 a further reduction of 18 was reported to be achieved from 2016 to 2020 chinese government 2016 people s government of guangdong province 2018 according to this mandatory plan for total carbon emissions the r scenario in this study was set as a continuing decrease of 20 carbon emissions for every five years thereby leading to a final 49 carbon emission decline for all components by 2030 compared with the emission level in 2015 on the basis of guangzhou s 13th five year plan for energy conservation and carbon reduction people s government of guangzhou municipality 2017 an annual 5 decrease in carbon emissions was assumed in the transportation and industrial sector for 15 years toward 2030 the le scenario was set according to this plan which will result in a total 72 emission decrease from component t compared with the emission level in 2015 in the pg scenario the carbon emission from components u and t are set as a 30 decrease in accordance with a population increase of 1 4 times compared with the 2015 level people s government of guangdong province 2018 the carbon sequestration scenario depends on the vegetation type of the land cover this is because the sequestration coefficients of certain vegetation are considered as fixed parameters over a short period of time espirito santo et al 2015 and the future spatial carbon sequestration will be only influenced by the land use transition results in 2030 4 results 4 1 carbon metabolism pattern the carbon emission rate in guangzhou increased from 2313 63 107 kgc yr 1 in 2000 to 3392 52 107 kgc yr 1 in 2015 which shows a growth of 31 7 during these 15 years carbon sequestration decreased from 207 27 106 kgc yr 1 to 199 6 106 kgc yr 1 with a slight declining trend fig 6 illustrates the metabolism pattern among the different components components t and u are considered responsible for the largest carbon emissions in guangzhou emissions from component t accounted for 59 21 of the total emissions in 2000 which increased to 69 9 in 2015 as the primary carbon emission contributor component t accounted for 1 17 of the total land area with an emission density of 16 229 107 kgc km 2yr 1 in 2000 and 4 33 of land area share with emission density of 7 582 107 kgc km 2yr 1 in 2015 component u was the second largest contributor which accounted for 5 6 and 12 4 of the land area share in 2000 and 2015 contributing 37 74 and 28 37 of the total carbon emissions as shown in fig 5 a carbon sequestration in guangzhou was too weak to offset the emission the total carbon sequestration fluctuated near 200 million kgc per year during the study period among the 11 land components f1 contributed 83 of the total sequestration as shown in fig 5 b f3 contributed no more than 5 of the total sequestration from 2000 to 2015 carbon sequestration in guangzhou was primarily dominated by forestland open woodland rivers and lakes and reservoirs accompanied by the increasing land area of components t and u the carbon emission showed a total climbing trend prior to 2010 and the emission of t decreased slightly as shown in figs 6 a and 6 c this pattern implied that the enlarged areas in urbanization process were bringing about increasing human activities and consequent carbon emissions in contrast component r demonstrated a slight decrease in carbon emissions because its land area diminished with the declining land area the carbon sequestration of f1 significantly decreased from 172 05 106 to 167 07 106 kgc yr 1 during the study period as shown in figs 6 b and 6 d right y axis other components including f2 f3 f4 g1 w3 c1 and c2 also displayed descending carbon sequestrations due to a decrease in land area 4 2 spatial carbon metabolism distribution to clarify the spatial distribution of carbon metabolism the natural breaks method was adopted to divide the carbon emission and sequestration rates into the six grades as denoted in figs 8 and 9 the spatial carbon emission distribution in guangzhou was high in the mid center with directions aggregated from the north east and south indicated by the blue arrow lines in fig 8 from 2000 to 2015 the grade one emission 892 79 to 2476 64 107 kgc yr 1 patches sprawled from the center of the city to the outskirts with an enlarged area their influence on the local carbon emission level increased due to the aggregation the dominant emission type in the north was at a moderate level in 2000 which changed to a high level in 2015 with an increase in high level patches and aggregation the northeast parts showed an increasing trend of the low emission patches but they were still scattered the south exhibited a process of the high emission patches growing to a higher level and the moderate emission patches changed to a lower level the spatial carbon sequestration in guangzhou demonstrated a significant spatial differentiation as shown in fig 9 different from carbon emissions no significant aggregation process of sequestration is presented and the sequestration layout was nearly opposite to that of the carbon emissions the high level sequestration zone was located in the north and maintained a high level during the study period from 2000 to 2005 high sequestration patches 2 33 to 9 97 106 kgc yr 1 increased in the north suburb as shown by the left blue arrow line and the low sequestration patches presented a fragmented pattern after 2005 this fragmentation continued and thus resulted in a total decrease in carbon sequestration and spatial heterogeneity the dominant sequestration patches changed from a moderate level 0 29 to 1 52 106 kgc yr 1 to a low level 0 to 0 29 106 kgc yr 1 from 2005 to 2010 and maintained this level until 2015 by considering land use transitions and related carbon metabolism changes the net emission sequestration variation is shown in fig 9 each patch with a land use type change was calculated by its transition area and carbon density change which can be used to assess whether it leads to net emission or sequestration the net emission in 2000 2005 was approximately 14 62 billion kgc per year which was more than 10 times the net sequestration 1 3 billion kgc per year from 2005 to 2010 the net emission was 5 3 times the net sequestration after 2010 the net emission and sequestration were 5 25 and 0 347 billion kgc per year respectively given that the net sequestration patches were small in size scattered and embedded in the net emission patches the green circles were added to emphasize these weak sequestration increases from 2000 to 2005 the net emission increase occurred in the city including the inner city and its southern and northern extensions as shown in fig 10 a the patches with net sequestration increase were small in size and mostly resulted from the transitions of t to u the net emission process was significant and dominated by the transitions of c c1 and c2 to t c to u f f1 f2 f3 and f4 to t and w3 to t from 2005 to 2010 the net sequestration process increased with the transition from t to w2 and t to f4 and were mostly scattered in the central and southern locations as shown in fig 10 b the net emission process exhibited a growth trend and further fragmentation caused by transitions from c to t t to u r to t and f to t after 2010 the carbon process continued fragmenting which made both the net emission and sequestration patches smaller the net emission process continued increasing in the mid guangzhou area as shown in fig 10 c 4 3 future carbon metabolism scenarios to test the validity of the embedded calculation process and parameters in flus a land use simulation of guangzhou from 2000 to 2015 was first conducted before the future multiple land use simulation by using the markov chain the land use demand quantity for each component in 2015 was calculated based on the matrix of historical land use transition probability then the ann was designed to have 11 neurons corresponding to 11 spatial driving variables in the input layer and 15 neurons corresponding to 15 subcomponents in the output layer the land use and spatial driving factor data were randomly sampled at a rate of 0 1 as the training dataset for the neural network taking the land use data of guangzhou in 2000 fig 11 a as the initial state the spatial land use distribution in 2015 was simulated the results indicated that the actual and simulated land use patterns in 2015 were similar figs 11 c and 11 d the kappa value was 0 9166 and the overall accuracy was 93 4015 this accuracy is highly acceptable especially considering that there were as many as 15 types of land uses involved this test simulation implied that it was reliable to be used for simulating future land use patterns in 2030 the result of the simulation is shown in fig 11 b after the future land simulation the carbon scenarios in 2030 were integrated with the land component change to show the spatial carbon distribution as presented in fig 12 the r scenario shown in fig 12 a implies the mandatory carbon mitigation target and the spatial distribution exhibits a moderate level in the city center and most of the outskirt areas but with a high level in the north the general carbon emission in the city center appears similar to that in the le scenario which had lower emissions in the north as illustrated in fig 12 b this result demonstrated that the carbon emission control relating transportation and industrial land use will begin with the new built up area in the north in the pg scenario the carbon emissions exhibited a dramatic increase in the city center at an extremely high level and extended to the fringes of the north east and south as shown in fig 12 c as the third megacity in china guangzhou has always been attractive to migrants which makes the population increase a continuing trend since the total population would be controlled by 2030 as assumed carbon emissions in the built up area decreased as was expected however the emission in the south and north fringes was discouraging with high carbon emission density patches red color increasing this change implied that a population increase and induced energy and product consumption will threaten the carbon mitigation target for the southern new built up area of guangzhou where more attention is needed the new built up area which is an important part of the urbanization showed it had a significant influence on carbon emissions in 2030 similar results have also been found in the study of the urbanization effects on co2 emissions wang et al 2018b the authors studied the effect of land urbanization and population urbanization on carbon emissions in the pearl river delta their result implied that the increased land area was a key driver of carbon growth therefore the policy for urban layouts especially the new built up areas is important for carbon mitigation from the population increase perspective despite similar results of the population effects on co2 emissions this study provided a spatial presentation of the locations of different urban land use types to support policy making the carbon sequestration simulation in 2030 varied from the north to the south as shown in fig 12 d ecological landscape transitions and loss of forest cover occurred in the north and northeast of guangzhou thereby decreasing the carbon sequestration potential this result is expected to change the artificial components with areas of afforestation and reforestation which can be combined with effective urban forestry programs to manage the forest this is in accordance with the spatial distribution of carbon storage loss that has been found in a current study which considered the pearl river delta as one of its study areas liu et al 2019 the result in the study by liu et al showed that a high carbon storage loss will occur in each city including guangzhou under all the scenarios and further high carbon storage losses in guangzhou will be widespread under the basic and fast development scenarios in a related study that supports the result of the present study li et al 2020 focused on another city wuhan to explore the impacts of urban growth on regional carbon storage they concluded that under integrated spatial regulation the encroachment rate of high carbon sequestration density land by urban growth gradually slowed down effectively reducing the loss of regional carbon storage li et al 2020 5 discussion future carbon scenarios and their spatial dimensions are conducted to assist policy makers in reducing carbon emissions at the city level by effective and feasible land use and allocation points for guangzhou the growing metropolis with its polycentric urban layout plan an integrated concentration should be interlinked and coordinated to show where and how varied types of development should be allowed huang and wang 2016 similarly these spatial carbon scenarios for 2030 are helpful for policy efforts from a carbon mitigation perspective by exploring the differences in carbon distribution under certain constraints the comparison between energy use control or population control compared with that of a reference scenario was conducted the varied carbon features focused on innovative land based carbon mitigation including the implications for 1 the northern area under the low energy use scenario 2 the southern area new built up area under the population control scenario and 3 the central city under the carbon sequestration scenario compared with the r scenario the le scenario had significant carbon reduction in north guangzhou which indicated that the policy for the northern new built up areas regarding carbon mitigation depends on influencing transportation energy consumption this highlighted that land based policy concerning the public transportation network is important in the north as shown in fig 13 for the north land patches with significant emission decrease could be considered as the main sites for new public transport nodes or sub nodes depending on their emission scales other modes such as rail transit networks at specific locations supported by the scenarios are also necessary for future land allocations to link the north to the central city thus the new built up areas in north guangzhou have to occur around these traffic networks for low carbon travel and effective carbon mitigation according to the future land simulation for 2030 there will be an increase of 92 3 km2 in industry and transportation land which addresses further land based regulations for the north in its land use planning south guangzhou is a sub center planning zone where the carbon emission change was significant in the pg scenario this indicates that the emission increase in the south will be influenced by the population movement the patches with high emission levels in the pg scenarios should be focused on influencing the citizen s behavior through policy on land use for example mixed land use and functional zone planning are the focal points that could alleviate land related carbon emissions due to population increase thus in south guangzhou it is suggested to relocate the functional niches of habitat settlement industry development and service facilities as fig 14 shows the developing zone in the south needs further policies on land use reallocation and fine mixed use planning for carbon mitigation since the natural components forest grassland and water have continuously dominated carbon sequestration in guangzhou there was a 2 9 decrease in forestland area with 1930 85 kgc per year carbon sequestration loss in 2030 this highlights the importance of urban green space planning the north with its natural mountainous advantages requires further protective planning of afforestation and reforestation during urban sprawl as fig 15 shows the south dominated by new developing zones can use coastal and agricultural ecological landscape planning combined with geographic features as the focus of carbon mitigation compared with these developing areas enhancing sequestration in the urbanized area of the central city is very difficult the question is whether urbanization can bring carbon sequestration the answer provided by other scholars is that an effective carbon sink in urban area relies on terminal land use and its dominant vegetation type in an urban landscape zhang et al 2012 pickett et al 2008 piao et al 2018 in this study a positive carbon process sequestration increase and emission decrease emerged in both the metropolis and the outskirts of guangzhou from 2000 to 2015 although weak these positive processes supported the point that landscape heterogeneity in a metropolis could be emphasized to deal with fragmented green space in an overpopulated area by using vegetation coverage increases therefore future green space promotion has to be located on specific patches as supported by the carbon sequestration scenario as fig 15 shows the dispersed carbon sequestration patches in the city center imply that green nodes along with the river system could be focused on to comprise a green circle with the existing green coverage around the central city this result may provide insights on how to achieve carbon mitigation in urbanized areas 6 conclusion this study developed a methodological framework for spatial carbon metabolism assessments and future simulations the contributions of this study were as follows 1 developing a land based accounting for carbon assessment using the linkage between carbon metabolism and land use type and 2 introducing spatial simulation modeling for future carbon scenarios to render a pro active approach for local land based carbon mitigation the established framework is a suitable alternative for examining spatial carbon features at an urban scale and provides support for future simulation and land based mitigation the performance of the proposed method was thought acceptable in the case study and the results were nearly in agreement with that of current related studies the case study of guangzhou presented a metropolis with an unbalanced carbon metabolism that features low carbon sequestration and dramatic emissions the spatial pattern of the carbon emissions was found to be increasing with high density in the city center and this was caused by transportation and industrial activities however the emission density was found to be decreasing on the outskirts of the city in contrast carbon sequestration demonstrated an opposite trend with a high density in the north and a scattered distribution in the south the spatial carbon simulation indicated the possible carbon distributions in 2030 under different mandatory policies which provided land based mitigation choices for different locations in the city projections of emission reductions for the north built up areas and the south sub center as well as the projections of a sequestration increase for the city center and northern mountainous areas were suggested to support policy making this case study and its identified carbon features can be used as a reference for other case studies in addition more comparative studies of different cities and metropolitan areas can be conducted in the future this will help establish the basic carbon profiles and mitigation guidelines within and among large regions despite the merits some limitations have to be acknowledged in this study which need to be addressed for future improvement first for the model uncertainty over spacused fixed coefficients for different natural components further attention on carbon storage change among different geographical regions over time is required to increase the accuracy second the lucc data from the landsat tm dataset with a resolution of 30 m was not effective enough to identify the small green patches inside urban lands in future studies much effort should be made to identify such elements in urban land by using high resolution datasets kellett et al 2013 which may contribute to ecosystem service assessments lastly comparing the simulation results with real annual data is essential for proving the validity of the model although it was seldom used in current studies due to the data availability it deserves much attention and efforts in lucc simulation studies to obtain annual land use data for simulation validation starting with the land related carbon metabolism accounting establishment and spatial pattern analysis the coming work in the future is planned to examine the relationship between different possible carbon metabolism features and the influencing factors in urban system the influencing factors can be defined as the input model parameters with their feasible range based on their physical meaning or other constraint information from this perspective further efforts have to be focused on how the variation in the carbon output of the urban system can be attribute to variations of its input factors for instance the land use change energy consumption and demographic change thus a further function of the carbon metabolism will be built on the basis of the carbon accounting established in this study to reveal the full picture of the carbon metabolism then global sensitivity analysis gsa with its entire feasible space of the model parameters will be applied packages downloaded at https www safetoolbox info info and documentation to extract drivers of carbon metabolism and analyze the dominant controls of the concerning carbon metabolism factors pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2004 it will be helpful to improve the understanding of the carbon mechanism in urban network servadio and convertino 2018 and provide insight into sensitive factors identification leading to a better management strategy under a

24715,a comprehensive understanding of the spatial carbon metabolism distribution is essential for future mitigation policies from a land based perspective this study develops a methodological framework for carbon metabolism measurement and future simulation an assessment of carbon sequestration and emission is conducted based on land use components within the biosphere carbon scenarios in accordance with the governmental mitigation policy were then established and these were coupled with future multiple type land use transitions to simulate the future spatial carbon distribution this future carbon distribution map can help us understand the carbon dynamics in specific locations with possible land based mitigation for policy making guangzhou which is a rapid urbanization metropolis in china was taken as a case study to conduct the proposed methodological framework and models the results revealed that high density carbon emissions dominated in the city center and expanded in the east west direction while carbon sequestration diminished in the middle and southern areas with a decreased total sequestration amount the carbon distribution in the 2030 scenarios highlighted different mitigation implications for different locations in the north south and central areas projections of emission reductions in northern outskirts and southern sub center as well as the projections of sequestration increases in the city center and northern mountainous area are then proposed to support mitigation the established framework is proven to be effective for examining spatial carbon features at an urban scale and the empirical findings can provide valuable insight into carbon mitigation strategies for rapid urbanization areas in developing countries keywords carbon mitigation land use change policy making carbon metabolism flus model guangzhou 1 introduction three quarters of the total global carbon emissions have been found to occur in urban areas intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 which only occupy 2 share of the world land area hence cities are rethinking their responsibility for carbon mitigation grimm et al 2008 as shown in previous studies land use and cover change lucc is considered as a primary driver of carbon storage loss for example land turned into cultivated land and forest lands and grasslands with high carbon storage densities have been converted into urban built up lands with low carbon storage densities wu et al 2016 de carvalho and szlafsztein 2019 the acceleration of urbanization has inevitably changed the land cover from natural vegetation to urban patterns with complicated man made surfaces zhao et al 2019 su et al 2020 these variations significantly influence the carbon emission and sequestration cycles in the biosphere a process that is defined as carbon metabolism in urban metabolism studies hutyra et al 2011 cui 2018 in china urbanization rapid population migration and land use transitions have made carbon emissions increase dramatically leading to a challenge for carbon mitigation wang et al 2018a thus an understanding of the spatial carbon distribution and patterns can provide insights for future mitigation policies from a land based perspective to explore the carbon emission and sequestration changes the development of methods for carbon assessments has been focused on for several decades the international council for local environmental initiatives iclei first developed a carbon accounting method to calculate the emissions generated by energy use in the 1990s iclei 1993 in 2006 the ippc international panel on climate change established carbon emission accounting guidelines which provided empirical coefficients to estimate fuel carbon emissions ipcc 2006 with the advantage of energy consumption data availability energy related emissions have since been widely studied in urban areas kennedy et al 2010 kellett 2013 different from emissions carbon sequestration is considered to be related to the land cover types in a natural system tao et al 2015 xu et al 2016 the carbon sequestration capacity of different land cover types usually reflected by the carbon storage density have typically been used as constant coefficients for most carbon sequestration estimations long et al 2014 li et al 2020 to support these sequestration assessments remote sensing has been used to interpret land cover areas and monitor changes by scholars bp 2019 thus studies of carbon metabolism have typically been conducted as 1 sequestration changes due to land cover changes and 2 emission changes caused by energy consumption variations in a socioeconomic system although there are growing literatures on territorial carbon change and related assessment studies referred to cities and rural settlements in developing countries were still limited making the land related carbon estimation in non developed cities a challenge chavez et al 2012 paloheimo and salmi 2013 minx et al 2013 sohn et al 2018 semieniuk and yakovenko 2020 since the application of the geographic information system gis in carbon emission sequestration studies research on the spatial patterns of carbon emission sequestration dynamics has been focused on land component layouts some studies have examined spatial carbon sequestration features among different natural land covers to reveal the effects of land urbanization liu et al 2018 wu et al 2018 xia et al 2019 by focusing on one land cover type for example the forest rittenhouse and rissman built three scenarios including a static forest an all forest and a dynamic forest to examine future land cover change effects on carbon sequestration rittenhouse and rissman 2012 future carbon sequestration simulations concerning other land cover types such as grasslands and croplands have also been studied using a scenario analysis wang et al 2015 however these sequestration simulations have primarily been quantitative assessments without a spatial analysis in addition they did not consider the interactions and competitions between multiple lucc types which ignores the complex interrelationships between the land components in the lucc processes liu et al 2017 limited by data availability spatial carbon emission studies have typically been conducted at national or regional scales by using economic models cai et al 2018 researchers have calculated the energy related carbon emissions of different cities and mapped their differentiation to reveal the differences between cities different from those large scale studies zhang et al used land areas and related empirical conversion coefficients of different land use types to calculate carbon emissions and analyzed their spatial distribution at the city level zhang et al 2014 other methods such as the ecological network model have also been applied to study the spatial carbon metabolism between urban land components xia et al 2016 according to the network method in the study of xia et al land transfers between a given pair of components can produce the same relationship mutualism or a different relationship such as competition in the following period which is then used to describe the spatial carbon emissions future carbon simulations have been another focus in this field to reflect possible carbon dynamics in urban areas limited by data availability and estimation accounting current references have typically used regression analyses e g concerning economic development or energy consumption in xu et al 2015 to predict future carbon quantities rather than spatial simulations other studies have simulated carbon emissions by using a network model supported by highly aggregate data and thus these studies have provided a snapshot of carbon emissions at the regional level without specific analysis of locations activities or people chen et al 2015 thus spatial information of future carbon emissions is vitally important for effective mitigation from a land based perspective madlener and sunak 2011 to summarize considerable improvements have been made in the field of carbon metabolism studies a number of which are noted in fig 1 however simulations of future spatial carbon metabolism that integrate both carbon emissions and sequestration changes in urban spatial layouts are needed to understand how decarbonization can work through land based policy to address this research target this study aims to do the following 1 develop a land based carbon metabolism accounting to assess carbon sequestration and emissions for different land use types that uses carbon metabolism as a sub process of urban metabolism and 2 establish future spatial carbon scenarios that couple the governmental decarbonization target with multiple type land use simulations to locate specific areas for effective land based mitigation 2 method 2 1 the study framework in this section a carbon metabolism framework is developed including 1 the land based accounting 2 the spatial pattern assessment and 3 the future spatial simulation modeling this approach can be conducted by three steps firstly the land based carbon emissions and sequestrations were estimated according to the established carbon accounting then the spatial carbon metabolism pattern was investigated by using the land use transition matrix which is supported by the remote sensing data finally the assumed carbon scenarios were coupled with land use change simulation by using future land use simulation flus model which can be downloaded at http www geosimulation cn flus html liu et al 2017 fig 2 presents an overview of the study framework 2 2 carbon metabolism accounting a land based carbon metabolism accounting was established to quantify the carbon dioxide emissions and sequestrations for different land use types in this accounting the land use types were classified as urban land u rural land r transportation and industrial land t cultivated land c grassland g forest f water w and bare land b which is in accordance with the standard classification of remote sensing monitoring systems u refers to the built up areas of a city which comprise human daily life activities both household and office activities r represents the rural residential areas independent from the urban zone which encompasses the rural daily household life t is the land areas for transport and industry production use c is the cultivated land that is composed of irrigated cultivated land and dry cultivated land denoted as c1 and c2 g includes three sub classes which are high coverage grassland vegetation cover more than 50 medium coverage grassland vegetation cover between 20 and 50 and low coverage grassland vegetation cover between 5 and 20 signed as g1 g2 and g3 respectively f comprises four sub classes including forest shrub land open woodland and other woodland which are designated as f1 f2 f3 and f4 respectively w refers to three sub classes which are rivers lakes and reservoirs and intermittently flooded land denoted as w1 w2 and w3 respectively b is bare land that is considered unusable by humans to conduct carbon quantification on a certain kind of land use type the linkage between carbon metabolism and land use type was established by defining the land components among the land use classifications f g and w which reflect the natural land cover are the natural components land use types u r and t which refer to the urban or rural daily life and the freight passenger transport and industry production are considered as the artificial components land use type c with crop cultivation including both vegetation cover and human farming activities is defined as the semi natural component thus the natural components with natural land cover are used to calculate carbon sequestration artificial components with anthropogenic land use activities are responsible for carbon emission estimation finally the semi natural component with both natural cover and human activity refers to the measurement of both emissions and sequestrations carbon emissions from the artificial components were calculated by using a physical flow method which is based on our previous publication concerning urban metabolism cui et al 2019 as one of the output items in the urban metabolism carbon emissions were calculated using different human activities including 1 agricultural and industrial product production primarily energy use 2 breath soil livestock and human and 3 freight and passenger transportation thus carbon emissions from these activities could be calculated to match the certain land use type including 1 c 2 u and r and 3 t as shown by eqs 1 4 these connect the carbon emissions to certain land use functions which will facilitate further spatial analysis 1 c e c f

related land cover areas and their empirical coefficients see table 1 which was provided by zhang et al 2014 both the carbon emission and sequestration were valued as the carbon metabolism rate denoted as kgcyr 1 carbon emission sequestration amount per year 2 3 spatial pattern assessment in this section the spatial carbon metabolism pattern is depicted by combining the carbon emission sequestration density with the land use transition matrix the land use transition matrix was calculated by using the land use monitoring data the carbon emission sequestration density of a certain land use type is usually obtained from the carbon metabolism emission or sequestration rate divided by land area zhang et al 2014 for natural components the spatial carbon sequestration density is determined by the land cover types as the sequestration coefficients imply for the artificial components the carbon emission rate and related land area were used to calculate the carbon emission density for a certain land type for the semi natural component with both carbon emission and sequestration the difference between the carbon emission and the sequestration rate were calculated to obtain a net value to calculate the emission sequestration density land use transition among different natural components which leads to sequestration density changes can be calculated using the difference of the final and initial sequestration coefficients of different land types other kinds of land use transitions including transitions between different land use components and transitions among artificial components cause carbon emission sequestration density changes through the final and initial density difference as shown in eq 5 5 δ d d i d j c i s i c j s j w h e n c i a n d c j a r e t h e b o t h e m i s s i o n o r s e q u e s t r a t i o n d i d j c i s i c j s j w h e n c i a n d c j a r e d i f f e r e n t t y p e s e m i s s i o n o r s e q u e s t r a t i o n where δd is the density change for a given land type which can be positive δd 0 or negative δd 0 i and j denote the final and initial land types and s indicates the land use area c represents the carbon metabolism rate which can be emission or sequestration finally the spatial carbon metabolism pattern can be described by multiplying the land transition area and related density change the land patch with increasing carbon emissions or decreasing carbon sequestration is then regarded as a negative process and vice versa this enables a map of the spatial carbon metabolism pattern with information of the net emission sequestration increases or decreases the spatial carbon metabolism pattern can then be reflected by the dominant carbon density change and its spatial distribution features 2 4 spatial simulation modeling in this section future land based carbon simulation was conducted to simulate future land use change and spatial carbon distribution it concerns two coupled modules 1 future land use simulation which is to assess a given grid as either transiting to another land use type or remaining in the current type and 2 carbon amount assumption by determining if there is any policy intervention for carbon emissions of different land use types the carbon amount for different land use type can be located through the future land simulation leading to the future spatial carbon distribution the modeling structure and general process are shown in fig 3 module one used the markov chain to project the future land demand of 15 sub types on a quantity perspective which was then combined with the trained artificial neural network ann and the self adaptive inertia process to conduct the spatial simulation module two assumed the alternatives of carbon scenarios on the basis of the carbon metabolism level in 2015 with regard to the governmental targets finally different carbon metabolism alternatives have been coupled with the spatial land use simulation to display the spatial carbon distribution grimm et al 2006 the general concept of this modeling is to simulate the future spatial carbon distribution from a land based perspective the alternative carbon scenarios and multiple land use change have been integrated by different carbon metabolism mechanism on different land use type for a given land use grid its land use type has been predicted in module one which was then followed by assigning related carbon amount in module two the complex adaptive process in module one enables the land use grid change as an individual that influenced by the historical and current land use pattern and the governmental policy targets in module two provides the carbon emission differences caused by different policy formulations thus this method is to provide spatial information of future carbon patterns under different policy regulation and locate specific land scope for effective land based carbon mitigation 2 4 1 module one in module one the interactions and competitions between 15 sub land use types were considered to simulate the future land use change since the multiple type land use simulation is difficult to conduct using the traditional cellular automaton ca approach li and yeh 2002 yang et al 2008 chen et al 2014 a future land use simulation flus model was introduced due to its advantage of higher accuracy in complex land simulations liu et al 2017 li et al 2017 the flus model operates through a top down land use demand prediction coupled with a down top spatial simulation which is considered effective at different scales of studies liu et al 2017 thus the flus model is a modeling framework in this study to that is integrated by using different embedded calculation processes for the quantity prediction the markov chain was used to project the quantity demand of 15 sub land use types in this study which determines the transition probability on the basis of historical land use data arsanjani et al 2011 ghosh et al 2017 this land use demand was then used to guide a ca based spatial simulation to meet the projected land quantity for the spatial simulation the trained artificial neural network ann was first used to train the probability of occurrence of each land use type for a given grid cell this process was conducted on the basis of the current land use data which has been proven to be effective in flus operation liang et al 2018 second the interactions among the different land use types were considered on the basis of an inheritance mechanism liu et al 2017 the current land uses on each grid cell could then be adjusted automatically according to the differences between future land use demand and current allocated land use areas which were calculated as shown in eq 6 6 i n e r t i a k t i n e r t i a k t 1 i f d k t 1 d k t 2 i n e r t i a k t 1 d k t 2 d k t 1 i f d k t 1 d k t 2 0 i n e r t i a k t 1 d k t 1 d k t 2 i f 0 d k t 2 d k t 1 where d k t 1 is the difference between the predicted macro demand and the allocated amount of land use type k until iteration time t 1 and i n e r t i a k t 1 indicates the inertia coefficient for type k at time t 1 the combined probability of a cell being occupied by a certain land use type can be calculated by combining the result of ann and the self adaptive inertia process as eq 7 shows 7 t p p k t p p k ω p k t i n e r t i a k t 1 s c c k where t p p k t represents the combined probability of the grid cell p for conversion from the original land use type to the target type k at iteration time t p p k denotes the probability of occurrence of land use type k on grip cell p which was generated from the ann algorithm ω p k t is the neighborhood influence of land use type k on cell p at time t i t e r t i a k t indicates the self adaptive coefficient of land use type k at time t and sc c k represents the conversion cost from the original land use type c to k the sensitivity of the flus model has been examined when liu et al 2017 first proposed the model their case study proved that the simulation results of the flus model are not very sensitive to the flexible conversion cost variations in this study we referred to the flexible conversion cost setting in liu et al 2017 s literature to ensure the model stability finally the roulette wheel selection was followed to process the competition between different land uses this self adaptive and competitive mechanism enables the comprehensive development probability of each grid cell for future land use allocation for the model uncertainty over space there is a stochastic mechanism in the flus model to reflect the uncertainty of real world land use change liu et al 2017 in this stochastic mechanism a uniform distribution random number from 0 to 1 was generated in the roulette wheel selection for different land use types which is to assign related land use type to a certain grid cell in an iteration 2 4 2 module two in module two we establish carbon scenarios to project the future carbon change on the multiple land use simulation result displaying the spatial carbon distribution in the future by relating the governmental intervention on carbon emissions with different land components the spatially explicit carbon distribution under different interventions can be illustrated in this perspective the carbon distribution difference caused by different policy formulations can be understood through 1 specific locations with significant carbon changes under a certain regulation and 2 what impact the land based policy can have for further mitigation concerning these locations therefore the carbon emission scenario was established in accordance with the governmental target on mitigation policies by considering the primary source of emissions the carbon emission scenarios were established according to the following decarbonization target alternatives alternative 1 govern total emission alternative 2 govern energy emission alternative 3 control population increase under each alternative the carbon emissions for different land use types were valued according to the mandatory mitigation target by coupling this with the result of the flus model the carbon scenario maps under different alternatives were obtained and compared with each other locating specific areas for further policy making since carbon sequestration density is typically considered stable in a short period because the vegetation types and their coefficients are recognized as fixed parameters espirito santo et al 2015 the spatial carbon sequestration will be influenced only by the flus results this land based simulation and scenario modeling can overcome the uncertainty and complexity in land use transitions among the 15 sub land use types and provide fine spatial information for future carbon distributions under different policies 3 study area and datasets 3 1 study area guangzhou is the third largest city and an important economic and cultural center of china which can be taken as a representative of the rapid developed cities in china guangzhou was selected as the empirical object in this carbon metabolism study for the purpose 1 to examine its spatial carbon metabolism feature by using the land based carbon accounting and 2 to testify the method put forward by this study which can be used as a reference for other cities this empirical study will be helpful in providing some suggestions for the carbon mitigation strategies when facing the continuous urbanization process guangzhou which is a megacity with an area of 7434 km2 and a population of nearly 9 3 million 2019 data from the guangzhou municipal statistics bureau 2020 is the third largest megacity located in southern china fig 4 guangzhou is the economic political and cultural center of guangdong province and has experienced dramatic industrial development and population growth with serious decarbonization challenges based on its spatial carbon distribution from 2000 to 2015 a future simulation for 2030 was then conducted for land based carbon mitigation to support sustainable development of guangzhou 3 2 datasets 3 2 1 carbon metabolism data collection the data used in this section were from 2000 to 2015 which were based on carbon metabolism accounting the fertilizer amount and farming machine power for the agricultural land component the amount of different livestock and fuel consumption for the rural land component the daily life energy consumption and population for the urban land component and the energy use for the transportation and industrial land use component were obtained from the guangzhou statistical yearbook 2001 2016 all the carbon emission coefficients of energy use were acquired from the ipcc 2006 3 2 2 lucc data possessing the lucc datasets of guangzhou for the years 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were derived from the original datasets of the chinese academy of sciences cas http www resdc cn with a resolution of 30 m the original lucc data were generated from landsat tm data by using the standard classification of the remote sensing monitoring system of china the overall discrimination accuracy for all of the land use types reached more than 95 according to the carbon metabolism accounting the original lucc types were combined into 15 types based on the eight components and related sub classes in section 2 2 table 2 shows the land use areas for four years in which bare land is ignored due to its unusable feature 3 2 3 data possessing for spatial simulation modeling a total of 11 spatial driving forces were prepared using the gis function these spatial variables were normalized within the range of 0 1 for the initial year of simulation these variables included the digital elevation model dem aspect slope distance to districts and various traffic distance variables as shown in fig 5 the carbon emission scenarios were established according to the governmental mandatory regulation and related policy formulations which include three alternatives the reference r scenario the low transportation and industrial energy use le scenario and the urban population growth pg scenario table 3 shows the three scenarios for carbon emission decreases of the artificial and semi artificial components on the basis of the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 of the chinese government china has reduced 20 of its total carbon emissions during the last five years from 2010 to 2015 a further reduction of 18 was reported to be achieved from 2016 to 2020 chinese government 2016 people s government of guangdong province 2018 according to this mandatory plan for total carbon emissions the r scenario in this study was set as a continuing decrease of 20 carbon emissions for every five years thereby leading to a final 49 carbon emission decline for all components by 2030 compared with the emission level in 2015 on the basis of guangzhou s 13th five year plan for energy conservation and carbon reduction people s government of guangzhou municipality 2017 an annual 5 decrease in carbon emissions was assumed in the transportation and industrial sector for 15 years toward 2030 the le scenario was set according to this plan which will result in a total 72 emission decrease from component t compared with the emission level in 2015 in the pg scenario the carbon emission from components u and t are set as a 30 decrease in accordance with a population increase of 1 4 times compared with the 2015 level people s government of guangdong province 2018 the carbon sequestration scenario depends on the vegetation type of the land cover this is because the sequestration coefficients of certain vegetation are considered as fixed parameters over a short period of time espirito santo et al 2015 and the future spatial carbon sequestration will be only influenced by the land use transition results in 2030 4 results 4 1 carbon metabolism pattern the carbon emission rate in guangzhou increased from 2313 63 107 kgc yr 1 in 2000 to 3392 52 107 kgc yr 1 in 2015 which shows a growth of 31 7 during these 15 years carbon sequestration decreased from 207 27 106 kgc yr 1 to 199 6 106 kgc yr 1 with a slight declining trend fig 6 illustrates the metabolism pattern among the different components components t and u are considered responsible for the largest carbon emissions in guangzhou emissions from component t accounted for 59 21 of the total emissions in 2000 which increased to 69 9 in 2015 as the primary carbon emission contributor component t accounted for 1 17 of the total land area with an emission density of 16 229 107 kgc km 2yr 1 in 2000 and 4 33 of land area share with emission density of 7 582 107 kgc km 2yr 1 in 2015 component u was the second largest contributor which accounted for 5 6 and 12 4 of the land area share in 2000 and 2015 contributing 37 74 and 28 37 of the total carbon emissions as shown in fig 5 a carbon sequestration in guangzhou was too weak to offset the emission the total carbon sequestration fluctuated near 200 million kgc per year during the study period among the 11 land components f1 contributed 83 of the total sequestration as shown in fig 5 b f3 contributed no more than 5 of the total sequestration from 2000 to 2015 carbon sequestration in guangzhou was primarily dominated by forestland open woodland rivers and lakes and reservoirs accompanied by the increasing land area of components t and u the carbon emission showed a total climbing trend prior to 2010 and the emission of t decreased slightly as shown in figs 6 a and 6 c this pattern implied that the enlarged areas in urbanization process were bringing about increasing human activities and consequent carbon emissions in contrast component r demonstrated a slight decrease in carbon emissions because its land area diminished with the declining land area the carbon sequestration of f1 significantly decreased from 172 05 106 to 167 07 106 kgc yr 1 during the study period as shown in figs 6 b and 6 d right y axis other components including f2 f3 f4 g1 w3 c1 and c2 also displayed descending carbon sequestrations due to a decrease in land area 4 2 spatial carbon metabolism distribution to clarify the spatial distribution of carbon metabolism the natural breaks method was adopted to divide the carbon emission and sequestration rates into the six grades as denoted in figs 8 and 9 the spatial carbon emission distribution in guangzhou was high in the mid center with directions aggregated from the north east and south indicated by the blue arrow lines in fig 8 from 2000 to 2015 the grade one emission 892 79 to 2476 64 107 kgc yr 1 patches sprawled from the center of the city to the outskirts with an enlarged area their influence on the local carbon emission level increased due to the aggregation the dominant emission type in the north was at a moderate level in 2000 which changed to a high level in 2015 with an increase in high level patches and aggregation the northeast parts showed an increasing trend of the low emission patches but they were still scattered the south exhibited a process of the high emission patches growing to a higher level and the moderate emission patches changed to a lower level the spatial carbon sequestration in guangzhou demonstrated a significant spatial differentiation as shown in fig 9 different from carbon emissions no significant aggregation process of sequestration is presented and the sequestration layout was nearly opposite to that of the carbon emissions the high level sequestration zone was located in the north and maintained a high level during the study period from 2000 to 2005 high sequestration patches 2 33 to 9 97 106 kgc yr 1 increased in the north suburb as shown by the left blue arrow line and the low sequestration patches presented a fragmented pattern after 2005 this fragmentation continued and thus resulted in a total decrease in carbon sequestration and spatial heterogeneity the dominant sequestration patches changed from a moderate level 0 29 to 1 52 106 kgc yr 1 to a low level 0 to 0 29 106 kgc yr 1 from 2005 to 2010 and maintained this level until 2015 by considering land use transitions and related carbon metabolism changes the net emission sequestration variation is shown in fig 9 each patch with a land use type change was calculated by its transition area and carbon density change which can be used to assess whether it leads to net emission or sequestration the net emission in 2000 2005 was approximately 14 62 billion kgc per year which was more than 10 times the net sequestration 1 3 billion kgc per year from 2005 to 2010 the net emission was 5 3 times the net sequestration after 2010 the net emission and sequestration were 5 25 and 0 347 billion kgc per year respectively given that the net sequestration patches were small in size scattered and embedded in the net emission patches the green circles were added to emphasize these weak sequestration increases from 2000 to 2005 the net emission increase occurred in the city including the inner city and its southern and northern extensions as shown in fig 10 a the patches with net sequestration increase were small in size and mostly resulted from the transitions of t to u the net emission process was significant and dominated by the transitions of c c1 and c2 to t c to u f f1 f2 f3 and f4 to t and w3 to t from 2005 to 2010 the net sequestration process increased with the transition from t to w2 and t to f4 and were mostly scattered in the central and southern locations as shown in fig 10 b the net emission process exhibited a growth trend and further fragmentation caused by transitions from c to t t to u r to t and f to t after 2010 the carbon process continued fragmenting which made both the net emission and sequestration patches smaller the net emission process continued increasing in the mid guangzhou area as shown in fig 10 c 4 3 future carbon metabolism scenarios to test the validity of the embedded calculation process and parameters in flus a land use simulation of guangzhou from 2000 to 2015 was first conducted before the future multiple land use simulation by using the markov chain the land use demand quantity for each component in 2015 was calculated based on the matrix of historical land use transition probability then the ann was designed to have 11 neurons corresponding to 11 spatial driving variables in the input layer and 15 neurons corresponding to 15 subcomponents in the output layer the land use and spatial driving factor data were randomly sampled at a rate of 0 1 as the training dataset for the neural network taking the land use data of guangzhou in 2000 fig 11 a as the initial state the spatial land use distribution in 2015 was simulated the results indicated that the actual and simulated land use patterns in 2015 were similar figs 11 c and 11 d the kappa value was 0 9166 and the overall accuracy was 93 4015 this accuracy is highly acceptable especially considering that there were as many as 15 types of land uses involved this test simulation implied that it was reliable to be used for simulating future land use patterns in 2030 the result of the simulation is shown in fig 11 b after the future land simulation the carbon scenarios in 2030 were integrated with the land component change to show the spatial carbon distribution as presented in fig 12 the r scenario shown in fig 12 a implies the mandatory carbon mitigation target and the spatial distribution exhibits a moderate level in the city center and most of the outskirt areas but with a high level in the north the general carbon emission in the city center appears similar to that in the le scenario which had lower emissions in the north as illustrated in fig 12 b this result demonstrated that the carbon emission control relating transportation and industrial land use will begin with the new built up area in the north in the pg scenario the carbon emissions exhibited a dramatic increase in the city center at an extremely high level and extended to the fringes of the north east and south as shown in fig 12 c as the third megacity in china guangzhou has always been attractive to migrants which makes the population increase a continuing trend since the total population would be controlled by 2030 as assumed carbon emissions in the built up area decreased as was expected however the emission in the south and north fringes was discouraging with high carbon emission density patches red color increasing this change implied that a population increase and induced energy and product consumption will threaten the carbon mitigation target for the southern new built up area of guangzhou where more attention is needed the new built up area which is an important part of the urbanization showed it had a significant influence on carbon emissions in 2030 similar results have also been found in the study of the urbanization effects on co2 emissions wang et al 2018b the authors studied the effect of land urbanization and population urbanization on carbon emissions in the pearl river delta their result implied that the increased land area was a key driver of carbon growth therefore the policy for urban layouts especially the new built up areas is important for carbon mitigation from the population increase perspective despite similar results of the population effects on co2 emissions this study provided a spatial presentation of the locations of different urban land use types to support policy making the carbon sequestration simulation in 2030 varied from the north to the south as shown in fig 12 d ecological landscape transitions and loss of forest cover occurred in the north and northeast of guangzhou thereby decreasing the carbon sequestration potential this result is expected to change the artificial components with areas of afforestation and reforestation which can be combined with effective urban forestry programs to manage the forest this is in accordance with the spatial distribution of carbon storage loss that has been found in a current study which considered the pearl river delta as one of its study areas liu et al 2019 the result in the study by liu et al showed that a high carbon storage loss will occur in each city including guangzhou under all the scenarios and further high carbon storage losses in guangzhou will be widespread under the basic and fast development scenarios in a related study that supports the result of the present study li et al 2020 focused on another city wuhan to explore the impacts of urban growth on regional carbon storage they concluded that under integrated spatial regulation the encroachment rate of high carbon sequestration density land by urban growth gradually slowed down effectively reducing the loss of regional carbon storage li et al 2020 5 discussion future carbon scenarios and their spatial dimensions are conducted to assist policy makers in reducing carbon emissions at the city level by effective and feasible land use and allocation points for guangzhou the growing metropolis with its polycentric urban layout plan an integrated concentration should be interlinked and coordinated to show where and how varied types of development should be allowed huang and wang 2016 similarly these spatial carbon scenarios for 2030 are helpful for policy efforts from a carbon mitigation perspective by exploring the differences in carbon distribution under certain constraints the comparison between energy use control or population control compared with that of a reference scenario was conducted the varied carbon features focused on innovative land based carbon mitigation including the implications for 1 the northern area under the low energy use scenario 2 the southern area new built up area under the population control scenario and 3 the central city under the carbon sequestration scenario compared with the r scenario the le scenario had significant carbon reduction in north guangzhou which indicated that the policy for the northern new built up areas regarding carbon mitigation depends on influencing transportation energy consumption this highlighted that land based policy concerning the public transportation network is important in the north as shown in fig 13 for the north land patches with significant emission decrease could be considered as the main sites for new public transport nodes or sub nodes depending on their emission scales other modes such as rail transit networks at specific locations supported by the scenarios are also necessary for future land allocations to link the north to the central city thus the new built up areas in north guangzhou have to occur around these traffic networks for low carbon travel and effective carbon mitigation according to the future land simulation for 2030 there will be an increase of 92 3 km2 in industry and transportation land which addresses further land based regulations for the north in its land use planning south guangzhou is a sub center planning zone where the carbon emission change was significant in the pg scenario this indicates that the emission increase in the south will be influenced by the population movement the patches with high emission levels in the pg scenarios should be focused on influencing the citizen s behavior through policy on land use for example mixed land use and functional zone planning are the focal points that could alleviate land related carbon emissions due to population increase thus in south guangzhou it is suggested to relocate the functional niches of habitat settlement industry development and service facilities as fig 14 shows the developing zone in the south needs further policies on land use reallocation and fine mixed use planning for carbon mitigation since the natural components forest grassland and water have continuously dominated carbon sequestration in guangzhou there was a 2 9 decrease in forestland area with 1930 85 kgc per year carbon sequestration loss in 2030 this highlights the importance of urban green space planning the north with its natural mountainous advantages requires further protective planning of afforestation and reforestation during urban sprawl as fig 15 shows the south dominated by new developing zones can use coastal and agricultural ecological landscape planning combined with geographic features as the focus of carbon mitigation compared with these developing areas enhancing sequestration in the urbanized area of the central city is very difficult the question is whether urbanization can bring carbon sequestration the answer provided by other scholars is that an effective carbon sink in urban area relies on terminal land use and its dominant vegetation type in an urban landscape zhang et al 2012 pickett et al 2008 piao et al 2018 in this study a positive carbon process sequestration increase and emission decrease emerged in both the metropolis and the outskirts of guangzhou from 2000 to 2015 although weak these positive processes supported the point that landscape heterogeneity in a metropolis could be emphasized to deal with fragmented green space in an overpopulated area by using vegetation coverage increases therefore future green space promotion has to be located on specific patches as supported by the carbon sequestration scenario as fig 15 shows the dispersed carbon sequestration patches in the city center imply that green nodes along with the river system could be focused on to comprise a green circle with the existing green coverage around the central city this result may provide insights on how to achieve carbon mitigation in urbanized areas 6 conclusion this study developed a methodological framework for spatial carbon metabolism assessments and future simulations the contributions of this study were as follows 1 developing a land based accounting for carbon assessment using the linkage between carbon metabolism and land use type and 2 introducing spatial simulation modeling for future carbon scenarios to render a pro active approach for local land based carbon mitigation the established framework is a suitable alternative for examining spatial carbon features at an urban scale and provides support for future simulation and land based mitigation the performance of the proposed method was thought acceptable in the case study and the results were nearly in agreement with that of current related studies the case study of guangzhou presented a metropolis with an unbalanced carbon metabolism that features low carbon sequestration and dramatic emissions the spatial pattern of the carbon emissions was found to be increasing with high density in the city center and this was caused by transportation and industrial activities however the emission density was found to be decreasing on the outskirts of the city in contrast carbon sequestration demonstrated an opposite trend with a high density in the north and a scattered distribution in the south the spatial carbon simulation indicated the possible carbon distributions in 2030 under different mandatory policies which provided land based mitigation choices for different locations in the city projections of emission reductions for the north built up areas and the south sub center as well as the projections of a sequestration increase for the city center and northern mountainous areas were suggested to support policy making this case study and its identified carbon features can be used as a reference for other case studies in addition more comparative studies of different cities and metropolitan areas can be conducted in the future this will help establish the basic carbon profiles and mitigation guidelines within and among large regions despite the merits some limitations have to be acknowledged in this study which need to be addressed for future improvement first for the model uncertainty over spacused fixed coefficients for different natural components further attention on carbon storage change among different geographical regions over time is required to increase the accuracy second the lucc data from the landsat tm dataset with a resolution of 30 m was not effective enough to identify the small green patches inside urban lands in future studies much effort should be made to identify such elements in urban land by using high resolution datasets kellett et al 2013 which may contribute to ecosystem service assessments lastly comparing the simulation results with real annual data is essential for proving the validity of the model although it was seldom used in current studies due to the data availability it deserves much attention and efforts in lucc simulation studies to obtain annual land use data for simulation validation starting with the land related carbon metabolism accounting establishment and spatial pattern analysis the coming work in the future is planned to examine the relationship between different possible carbon metabolism features and the influencing factors in urban system the influencing factors can be defined as the input model parameters with their feasible range based on their physical meaning or other constraint information from this perspective further efforts have to be focused on how the variation in the carbon output of the urban system can be attribute to variations of its input factors for instance the land use change energy consumption and demographic change thus a further function of the carbon metabolism will be built on the basis of the carbon accounting established in this study to reveal the full picture of the carbon metabolism then global sensitivity analysis gsa with its entire feasible space of the model parameters will be applied packages downloaded at https www safetoolbox info info and documentation to extract drivers of carbon metabolism and analyze the dominant controls of the concerning carbon metabolism factors pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2004 it will be helpful to improve the understanding of the carbon mechanism in urban network servadio and convertino 2018 and provide insight into sensitive factors identification leading to a better management strategy under a

arendell street p o box 769 morehead city nc 28557 usa ecological risk assessments play an important role in environmental management and decision making although empirical measurements of the effects of habitat changes and chemical exposure are often made at molecular and individual levels environmental decision making often requires the quantification of management relevant population level outcomes in this study we generalized a modeling framework to evaluate population level ecological risk of environmental stress and bioactive chemicals the modeling framework includes 1 a biological model module that incorporates complex and interacting biological and ecological processes and environmental stochasticity 2 an effect module that links the impacts of environmental changes and chemical exposure to individual characteristics and 3 a population module that makes decisions on the choice of population level properties to best capture the effects and thus to track in the model based on the target species and the research and management interest this framework is a 3 module procedure that provides an alternative way for researchers to organize present and communicate the risk assessment modeling studies to demonstrate this framework we used a socioeconomically important riverine fish species smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu as the model species we developed an individual based model as the biological model module we evaluated the impacts of changing water temperature and flow regimes and the impacts of exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds eedc on smallmouth bass populations in the chesapeake bay watershed usa warm summer water temperatures and year round high flows had the most severe impacts on the smallmouth bass population an increase in exposure level to eedc both year round and in summer months substantially reduced population size spawner and recruit abundance and the proportion of quality length individuals acute exposure to eedc was more detrimental to the population than chronic exposure acute exposure during spawning season had the most severe impacts this modeling framework can be extended to other species

transport of nutrients and organic matter e g statzner and higler 1986 allen 1995 johnson and jones 2000 these factors also define habitat conditions and influence individual behavior and survival e g allen 1995 grossman et al 1998 hart and finelli 1999 within agricultural and urban environments fertilizers pesticides personal care products and pharmaceuticals enter aquatic ecosystems through overland storm flow point source discharge and ground water chemical contaminants may affect wildlife health by impacting reproductive health growth and survival e g dunier and siwicki 1993 miller et

they can lead to significant population level effects affecting population size recruitment and age structure for example a local population of fathead minnow pimephales promelas in an experimental lake in northwestern ontario canada approached local extinction after a three year exposure to 5 6 ng l of the 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 a type of the estrogenic endocrine disrupting compound eedc

management e g barnthouse and suter 1986 pastorok et al 2003 forbes and calow 1999 found that population growth of aquatic species was sometimes more sensitive to chemical contamination than individual level growth kammenga et al 2001 suggested that individual level response could not be directly used to predict population level impacts of cadmium and pentachlorophenol on soil invertebrates vaugeois et al 2020 concluded that population level effects of toxic chemicals are rarely directly proportional to individual level effects based on a modeled population of fathead minnow although the importance of upscaling effects from individual to population level has been acknowledged the stochastic nature and interactions of these abiotic factors make such efforts challenging sumpter 2005 miller et al 2007 schipper et al 2013 white et al 2017 the overall goal of this study was to generalize a modeling framework for evaluating long term population level effects of environmental stress and bioactive chemicals on riverine fish populations the modeling framework includes 1 a biological model module that incorporates complex and interacting biological and ecological processes and environmental stochasticity 2 an effect module that links impacts of environmental factors and bioactive chemicals to individual characteristics and 3 a population module that makes decisions on the choice of population level properties regardless of the model type in the biological model module e g individual based model or population dynamic model among all the possible output from a model the population module focuses on deciding what population level properties to best capture the effects and thus to track in the model based on the ecology of the target species and the research and management interest this framework is a 3 module procedure that provides an alternative way for researchers to organize present and communicate risk assessment modeling studies this framework outlines these three modules and all components under each module can be modified based on the species life history ecology and habitat they occupy data availability research and management interest including the choice of model type e g individual based versus population dynamic models structure and parameterization of the model relationship between the biological parameters and the environmental factors and the type of population level output we demonstrated this modeling framework using smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu as the model species and an individual based model as the biological model module we focused on quantifying the effects of changing water temperature flow and eedc exposure the model species smallmouth bass is a popular recreational fish species that is found in freshwater lakes and rivers throughout north america it is an ecologically important predator and its life history is sensitive to environmental changes including changes to water temperature and flow peterson and kwak 1999 rejwan et al 1999 lorantas et al 2013 the presence of eedcs in freshwater ecosystems has raised concerns over fish and wildlife health because of potential impairment

parameterized the individual based model based on a smallmouth bass population and characterized the model environment based on conditions observed in the susquehanna river pennsylvania table 1 2 1 1 model environment spatial scale and scheduling smallmouth bass prefer cool clear mid order streams wider than 10 5 m carlander 1977 eggs are deposited in nests which are guarded by males and are usually built in waters from 0 3 0 9 m deep coble 1975 the model simulated 10 m wide x 2000 m long x 5 m deep 100 000 m3 river section the length of modeled river section was determined based on the average migration distance of smallmouth bass during a non spawning season schall et al 2019 in the model we did not specifically simulate habitat features except water temperature and flow water temperature and flow are dominant abiotic drivers that regulate smallmouth bass population dynamics e g edwards et al 1983 shuter et al 1987 peterson and kwak 1999 rejwan et al 1999 although other habitat features such as aquatic vegetation and sediment composition also play an important role these features are often stratified with water depth smallmouth bass at each life stage prefer different water depth that provides suitable habitat fry stay in open shallow water juveniles prefer near shore habitat and adults primarily inhabit deep waters but move to shallow areas during spawning coble 1975 ridgway et al 1991 thus in the model the impact of other habitat features was embedded in the variation in life history traits e g growth and survival at different life stages in this study we simulated the system for 200 years at monthly time steps this value of 200 years was sufficient for smallmouth bass population to respond to environmental changes given its observed maximum age in the susquehanna river is only 15 years in the model we obtained a time series of monthly average water temperature by first generating a daily water temperature time series and then calculating the monthly averages the generated daily water temperature allowed for the calculation of degree days to determine the timing of spawning for each individual the time series of daily water temperature was generated by repeatedly appending a one year daily average temperature record 2012 from the susquehanna river pennsylvania we generated a temperature for each day based on a normal distribution with a mean from the observed daily average temperature and a coefficient of variation cv randomly drawn from values ranging 5 10 we also calculated the number of degree days accumulated for temperatures above 10 c by the end of each month since the first day of a year january 1st this time series of monthly degree days was used to determine the spawning month for each individual deangelis et al 1991 ridgway et al 1991 we assumed water temperature did not vary spatially within the model river section we generated a time series of monthly flow m sec by repeatedly appending a one year monthly average flow pattern m sec january 3 68 february 2 39 march 2 86 april 1 47 may 3 34 june 1 68 july 0 5 august 0 56 september 0 6 october 1 november 1 92 and december 2 86 we generated flow for each month based on a normal distribution with its monthly mean drawn from this one year pattern with a cv randomly drawn from values ranging 5 10 this one year monthly average flow pattern was obtained by preserving the monthly pattern but scaling down the magnitude of an observed pattern from a u s geological survey station in the susquehanna river near harrisburg pa in 2012 in the model we assumed smallmouth bass was uniformly distributed throughout the river suggesting everywhere in the model river was its suitable habitat however this assumption is rarely true in the wild which indicates that the locations where the flow data are observed may not always be the suitable habitat for smallmouth bass we initially explored simulations using the observed flow data without scaling down and the fish in the model river died off too quickly to allow for the detection of any flow effects thus given that this observed flow data was the only complete one year time series available for the susquehanna river we decided to preserve the observed flow pattern but to scale it down by 88 to match the maximum flow assumption in the model because information is lacking for the flow tolerance of smallmouth bass we set the maximum flow in the model to be 4 m sec which is twice the threshold 2 m sec that may affect nest and fry survival larimore and duever 1968 this maximum flow value can be adjusted as data become available 2 1 2 growth the biological sub models were parameterized based on empirical data and publications on smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania rivers table 1 in natural populations fertilized eggs develop in nests and are guarded by males until becoming fry that swim up at a size of 8 5 9 5 mm and disperse from nest at a size of 20 mm deangelis et al 1991 1993 fry enter a juvenile stage as their diet switches to benthic invertebrates and then become adults at maturity coble 1975 development of eggs to fry usually takes 1 2 weeks shuter et al 1980 and thus was not specifically modeled within a monthly time step in the model the life cycle of smallmouth bass was divided into four life stages fig 1 egg fry including pre dispersal fry of 8 5 20 mm and post dispersal fry of 20 90 mm the freshly hatched fry that are smaller than 8 5 mm were not explicitly modeled juvenile greater than 90 mm and before maturing beamesderfer and north 1995 and adult at or after becoming mature in the model initial length after swimming up was a random size between 8 5 and 9 5 mm deangelis et al 1993 sex was randomly assigned to each fry with a 1 1 sex ratio although the largest recorded smallmouth bass is 686 mm from kentucky page and burr 1991 fish larger than 560 mm are uncommon edwards et al 1983 in the model we assumed the maximum length of smallmouth bass to be 560 mm fish reaching the maximum length would no longer grow and would die at the next time step and be removed from the system a study of susquehanna river smallmouth bass showed that fish less than 175 mm were immature and all those above 225 mm were mature hoopes 1987 correspondingly in the model we assigned a maturity of zero not mature to individuals less than 175 mm and a maturity of one mature to individuals larger than 225 mm we assumed a linear increase in maturity for individuals between 175 mm and 225 mm quinn and deriso 1999 a fish within this size range was determined whether to mature or not using a bernoulli distribution with a success probability equal to maturity in the model monthly growth of fry juvenile and adults was described by the von bertalanffy growth model von bertalanffy 1938 quinn and deriso 1999 1 δ l l l 1 exp k δ t where l is the length increment mm during the month t 1 month l is the length at the beginning of the month l is the asymptotic length mm and k is the growth coefficient per month negative growth i e negative k value was not permitted in the model li et al 2018b showed great spatial variability in the growth of smallmouth bass across six pennsylvania rivers thus in this study we explored the sensitivity of model outcomes to the parameterization of individual growth specifically we tested two distinct individual growth curves estimated for two of the six rivers in li et al 2018b fig s1 in supplemental information the first growth curve was estimated for the north susquehanna river population l 797 mm and k 0 008 per month which represents a bass population with slower growing individuals that can potentially reach a larger maximum size referred to the slow growing population hereafter by contrast the second growth curve was estimated for the mainstem susquehanna river population l 475 mm and k 0 018 per month which represents a bass population with faster growing individuals that may potentially reach a smaller maximum size referred to the fast growing population hereafter logarithm of monthly growth coefficient k for each individual was generated based on a normal distribution with a mean of ln k and a cv of 0 2 we kept this cv value the same for both populations for comparison purpose 2 1 3 survival eggs and pre dispersal fry are vulnerable to predation especially when the nest is deserted by the guarding male coble 1975 deangelis et al 1991 in the model we did not track individual eggs but set the proportion of fertilized eggs surviving to fry greater than 8 5 mm in a guarded nest to be 0 002 thus this proportion also accounted for the mortality of freshly hatched fry that were smaller than 8 5 mm the value of 0 002 was chosen to avoid the population reaching carrying capacity at any time during simulation otherwise the population response to model manipulation would not be detected in the case of nests not surviving due to premature abandonment by guarding males or environmental stress survival of both eggs and pre dispersal fry was set to zero in the model we used the lorenzen method lorenzen 2000 2005 to estimate size specific natural mortality ml which assumes ml is inversely proportional to the length l 2 m l m 0 l d where m0 0 and d 0 are constants the constant m0 can be determined by setting the integral of ml equal to the integral of a constant natural mortality mc 3 l m i n l m a x m l d t m c l m a x l m i n where lmax 560 mm and lmin 8 5 mm are the maximum and minimum lengths assumed in the model let d 1 and m0 can be obtained by solving the above equation eq 3 4 m 0 l m a x l m i n l n l m a x l n l m i n m c in this study we set mc 0 034 per month 0 41 per year based on a maximum age of 15 for smallmouth bass at susquehanna river then et al 2015 the monthly survival rate sl can then be calculated as 5 s l e x p m l each individual s fate was determined based on a bernoulli distribution with the monthly survival rate sl 2 1 4 reproduction smallmouth bass spawn during april through june coble 1975 in natural populations more than one spawning event can occur during a single season if the initial spawning event has been disrupted and one male can participate in multiple spawnings coble 1975 larger males build nest fertilize eggs and start parental care earlier and larger females lay eggs earlier ridgway et al 1991 in the model we assumed during each spawning season each female and each male participates in only one spawning i e each female lays her eggs on only one nest all at once each male guards only one nest and no nest receive eggs from more than one female thus in the case of nfemale nmale some small females do not spawn deangelis et al 1991 the average cumulative degree days ddays needed before a male starts parental care can be related to the size of the male deangelis et al 1991 6 d days exp 17 669 3 484 ln l male 10 where lmale is the length of guarding male mm and ddays is the number of degree days accumulated for temperatures above 10 c since the temperature begins to rise in spring this relationship has been used to determine spawning date for individual smallmouth bass e g deangelis et al 1993 dong and deangelis 1998 in the model we used this relationship eq 6 to approximate the spawning month for each mature male a mature male was determined to spawn in the current month if its calculated ddays fell within the range of accumulative degree days of that given month then we ranked both males and females that are available to spawn in the current month i e mature but has not spawned yet this year by size and paired the largest female with the largest male ridgway et al 1991 deangelis et al 1991 gross and kapuscinski 1997 evaluated the reproductive success of smallmouth bass using family specific dna fingerprints and found that only 57 4 of the guarding males had offspring who survived to swim up fry stage in the model we set the nest survival to be 0 574 which represents the parental care of the guarding male each nest was determined to survive or not based on a bernoulli distribution with the nest survival rate as the success probability the eggs and pre dispersal fry would die if the nest does not survive the number of eggs negg per female smallmouth bass depends on size raffetto et al 1990 7 n egg 12251 5 59 4 l female where lfemale is the length of spawning female mm and lfemale 206 5 mm in the model a fertilization rate of 0 7 was applied based on a laboratory study of smallmouth bass landsman et al 2011 we tracked individuals starting from the swim up fry stage 2 2 effect module in this study we used a scalar w to describe the environmental and chemical effects on biological parameters the normal value the value under optimum condition of each affected parameter was adjusted by multiplying one scalar if affected by a single factor or multiple scalars if affected by multiple factors simultaneously these scalars are functions of environmental or chemical factors fig 2 2 2 1 density dependence density dependence is one of the fundamental factors to regulate population dynamics to influence population recovery after disturbance such as chemical exposure or harvesting and to predict population level effects of disturbance deangelis et al 1991 pastorok et al 2002 hazlerigg et al 2014 when the density of fish is high young smallmouth bass attempt to capture the fry that disperse from nest dong and deangelis 1998 in this study we set the maximum density to be 0 8 fish per cubic meter based on a density estimate for largemouth bass micropterus salmoides from a hatchery site unpublished data personal communication with dr donald e tillitt usgs columbia environmental research center mortality of fry was assumed to increase linearly from mfry at half the maximum density to 2mfry at the maximum density similarly egg survival was assumed to decline from segg at half the maximum density to zero at the maximum density these density dependent assumptions represent intra specific competition due to space and resource limitation 8 w d m f r y 1 if d 0 8 2

ceases at 35 c horning and pearson 1973 shuter et al 1980 edwards et al 1983 in the model we assumed growth coefficient k to linearly decrease in months with a temperature lower than 25 c or higher than 29 c according to a scalar wt k ranging from 0 to 1 25 thus the value for k was zero near freezing i e set to 0 c in the model and at 35 c and was 1 25 times the normal k at the optimum

temperatures between 13 and 21 c scott and crossman 1973 shuter et al 1980 edwards et al 1983 eggs develop normally at temperatures between 13 and 25 c coble 1975 coutant 1975 landsman et al 2011 in

egg survival t3 21 c for nest survival and 25 c for egg survival this assumption on nest survival is associated with premature abandonment of nests by guarding males and mortality of nests due to abrupt temperature change fry maintain active at temperatures between 20 and 29 c coble 1975 and have a lower and upper lethal temperature of 0 c and 38 c respectively larimore and duever 1968 juveniles prefer temperatures between 28 and 31 c barans and tubb 1973 coutant 1975 and mortality occurs at a temperature near freezing or higher than 35 c horning and pearson 1973 cherry et al 1975 adult smallmouth bass prefer temperatures of 21 27 c in the wild clancey 1980 and their upper and lower lethal temperatures are about 32 c and near 0 c respectively coble 1975 in the model for months

causes nest desertion and flushes away swim up fry montgomery et al 1980 rejwan et al 1999 dispersed fry smaller than 25 mm have difficulty maintaining themselves in current velocities greater than 2 m sec larimore and duever 1968 in the model we set the maximum flow velocity to be twice this threshold value i e 4 m sec for months with flow greater than 2 m sec and up to the maximum the mortality of fry smaller than 25 mm was increased from mfry to 2mfry and the nest survival was linearly reduced by up to 20 12 w f m f r y 1 if f 2 m sec 1 2 1 f 2 4 2 if 2 f 4 m sec w f s nest 1 if f 2 m sec 0

plasma vitellogenin in male smallmouth bass and immunosuppression intersexed male bass produce fewer sperm and the sperm are less motile blazer et al 2007 2012 2014 in the model exposure to eedc reduced survival of fry juvenile and adult and reduced egg production fecundity the comprehensive functional relationships between life history traits and a particular eedc compound is lacking for smallmouth bass therefore to demonstrate the modeling framework we borrowed this information from other species schwindt et al 2014 examined the effects of ee2 on the survival and reproduction of fathead minnow with four exposure concentrations i e 0 3 2 5 3 and 10 9 ng l although ee2 was not detected in the susquehanna river for which the model environment was developed due to data limitation and for demonstration purposes we treated the ee2 concentration in these relationships as a measure of exposure level to eedc ng l called eedc exposure level hereafter these relationships can be updated as additional data become available for smallmouth bass in the susquehanna river or modified as needed for applications of this model to other species and systems in this study we used the response curves from schwindt et al 2014 figs 2 3 a and 3b in schwindt et al 2014 to describe the eedc effects on smallmouth bass specifically we used a step function with linear transitions between the four exposure levels to calculate the scalars for estrogen effect on fry survival w c s f r y juvenile survival w c s j u v e n i l e male adult survival w c s a d u l t m a l e female adult

fry survival 0 54 for juvenile survival 0 21 for male adult survival and 0 74 for female adult survival and 0 57 for fecundity y3 0 01 for fry survival 0 01 for juvenile survival 0 for male adult survival and 0 68 for female adult survival and 0 05 for fecundity ee2 has been measured up to 11 ng l in the environment schwindt et al 2014 in this study the maximum eedc exposure level was set at 10 9 ng l which matched the maximum ee2 level used in the schwindt et al 2014 because the male smallmouth bass guards a nest until fry swim up coble 1975 feminization of guarding males i e intersex may increase the chance of deserting the nest or for poorly caring for the nest in the model this effect corresponds to intersex incidence and intersex severity both of which could be a function of eedc exposure level arlos et al 2018 linked the intersex incidence and intersex severity to total estrogenicity based on data for rainbow darter etheostoma caeruleum from grand river in southern ontario canada intersex incidence refers to the probability of a fish having intersex i e at least one oocyte in the male testis intersex severity measures the degree of feminization in terms of the relative number of oocytes given intersex occurs and is scored from 0 to 7 with 0 for a normal male and 7 for a normal female bahamonde et al 2015 arlos et al 2018 in this study we used the relationships developed in arlos et al 2018 and modified them to calculate the intersex incidence intersex probability and the probability of an intersexed male deserting the nest deserting probability given a eedc exposure level the deserting probability was obtained by mapping the intersex severity score to a probability based on a linear relationship that assumed the probability of deserting a nest is one given the severity score of 7 and 0 given the severity score of 0 because arlos et al 2018 developed response curves for total estrogenicity but we assumed ee2 to be a measure of eedc exposure level an adjusting factor 0 17 was applied to convert total estrogenicity concentration to eedc exposure level i e ee2 concentration based on the evidence that ee2 contributes approximately 17 18 of the total estrogenicity in a river in southern ontario arlos et al 2018 the resulting response curves for intersex probability and deserting probability are as follows 14 i n t e r s e x p r o b a b i l i t y 0 1 0 1 10 0 777 c x 1 017 d e s e r t i n g p r o b a b i l i t y 0 6 0 1 10 4 492 c x 0 911 1 6 where the adjusting factor x 0 17 the fraction of 1 6 was multiplied to map the intersex severity score to the nest deserting probability as a result the nest survival in the model was adjusted with a scalar in response to eedc exposure level 15 w c s n e s t 1 intersex probability deserting probability 2 3 population module in each replicate model run we tracked individual attributes and summarized population characteristics annually including population size recruitment and size structure we also tracked the proportion of quality length fish quality length is defined as the size of a fish that most anglers like to catch anderson 1980 a quality length close to 246 279 mm has been suggested for smallmouth bass gabelhouse 1984 in this study we calculated the proportion of the smallmouth bass within this quality length size range 2 4 model initialization and validation we initialized the model with 1000 individuals which equals 1 25 of the carrying capacity i e the maximum population size in the model river section we chose this initial value to ensure the population would sustain during initialization but would not reach the carrying capacity at any time during simulation in this way we can detect the population response to model manipulations without being constrained by the carrying capacity size structure for the initial population was based on survey data collected by the pennsylvania fish and boat commission from the susquehanna river in 1990 each individual in the initial population was randomly assigned a sex with a 1 1 sex ratio and a length based on the size structure we ran ten replicates for each scenario this value of 10 replicates is recommended for individual based models by many studies to balance between ensuring a reasonable variance of the population dynamics and conserving computation effort e g hobday and tegner 2002 coates and hovel 2014 focks et al 2014 meli et al 2014 li and rogers bennett 2017 both individual level e g growth survival and maturity and population level characteristics e g population size size structure spawner abundance and recruitment were updated at each time step i e at each month in this study due to lack of data to validate the model as some other studies have done e g grimm 1999 chang et al 2010 we interpreted our model results in a relative way beissinger and westphal 1998 instead of focusing on the absolute quantity under each scenario we focused on comparing outcomes across scenarios 2 5 simulation experiments we conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the impacts of increasing water temperature increasing flow and exposure to eedc on a smallmouth bass population tables s1 s4 in supplemental information in the baseline scenario we used the generated time series of water temperature and flow and we assumed no eedc exposure in the model river section we then developed two water temperature scenarios 1 high temperature hight scenario in which we elevated the daily average temperature by 3 c this scenario represents warm water temperature year round 2 extreme temperature extremet scenario in which we elevated the daily average temperature by 3 c in summer months june july and august to represent a warm summer scenario the nasa earth observatory stated that average surface temperatures could rise between 2 c and 6 c by the end of the 21st century based on plausible emission scenarios nasa earth observatory 2010 given the fact that changes in water temperature might be milder than changes in air temperature we chose the value of 3 c as the temperature increase in the model this value is also large enough to allow us to discern different temperature scenarios with all the variations included we examined two flow scenarios 1 high flow highf scenario in which we elevated the monthly average flow by 0 5 m sec year round 2 extreme flow extremef scenario in which we only elevated the monthly average flow by 0 5 m sec in summer months june july and august the extremef scenario simulates increased flow velocity during summers due to an increased frequency of intense storms usgcrp 2018 we tested six eedc exposure scenarios the first scenario was normal eedc exposure normalc in which we simulated a time series of monthly eedc exposure level ng l by repeatedly appending a one year pattern of monthly average exposure level total estrogenicity data from a tributary to the susquehanna river west branch mahantango creek in 2015 was used to establish this one year pattern williams et al 2019 assuming ee2 contributes 17 of the observed total estrogenicity we obtained the one year pattern of monthly eedc exposure level i e ee2 concentration by multiplying the observed monthly average total estrogenicity with the adjusting factor 0 17 the resulting one year pattern of monthly eedc exposure level ng l was january 0 february 0 038 march 0 629 april 0 045 may 0 142 june 0 028 july 0 august 0 021 september 0 064 october 0 051 november 0 026 and december 0 057 next we generated the eedc exposure level for each month based on a normal distribution with its mean from the one year pattern and a cv ranging 10 30 this cv range was chosen based on the observed total estrogenicity data in mahantango creek in the second scenario the high eedc exposure highc scenario we elevated the monthly average exposure concentration by 0 5 ng l year round in the third scenario the extreme eedc exposure extremec scenario we only elevated the monthly average exposure concentration by 0 5 ng l in summer months june july and august the next three eedc exposure scenarios namely the chronic exposure chronicc scenario the acute exposure non spawning acutecnsp scenario and the acute exposure spawning acutec sp scenario simulated chronic and acute exposure experiments in which we compared the long term population level response to chronic exposure to small amount for a long continuous time period versus acute exposure to large amount for a short time period exposures to eedcs in the chronicc scenario we released a constant level of eedc 0 108 ng l in the model river each month and continued for the entire simulation time period in the acutecnsp scenario we released an eedc level that equals to the annual total concentration 1 297 ng l 1 0 108 ng l per month x 12 month all at once in a non spawning month january every year the acutec sp scenario was the same as the acutecnsp scenario except that the eedc was released in june every year a month that is critical to both spawning and early recruitment in these eedc exposure scenarios we assumed the water temperature and flow patterns were the same as in the baseline scenario although seasons other than summer could also be explored in all the extreme scenarios we focused on summer in this study because smallmouth bass reach their early life stages during summer early life stages could be more sensitive to environmental changes koger et al 2000 and mortality and disease of young of the year bass have been well documented since 2005 for susquehanna river shull and pulket 2015 smith et al 2015 an additional reason for simulating high eedc exposure level in summer months is that an increased frequency of intense storms during summer predicted for our study area under a changing climate usgcrp 2018 may lead to an increase in mobilization of chemicals from agricultural and urban landscapes into rivers the model and simulation were coded in r version 3 6 1 the r code developed for this study is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3956465 3 results results for the slow growing and fast growing populations were similar except for a slight difference in their response to the water temperature effect thus we present the results for the slow growing population and only those results related to the water temperature effect for the fast growing population the remaining results for the fast growing population are presented in the supplemental information figs s2 s4 in the model regardless of individual growth types changes in water temperature and flow had large effects on population size spawner and recruit abundance whereas their influence on the proportion of quality length fish was not substantial figs 3 5 both slow and fast growing populations in the hight scenario had the highest population size spawner and recruit abundance among the three temperature scenarios within the first 80 years of simulation figs 3 4 during the remaining time period performance of the slow growing population in the hight scenario became equivalent to the baseline scenario fig 3 whereas performance of the fast growing population remained superior over the baseline scenario fig 4 both populations in the extremet scenario performed the worst with the lowest population size spawner and recruit abundance during the entire simulation period year round high flow in the highf scenario substantially reduced population size spawner and recruit abundance compared to the other two flow scenarios fig 5 the bass population performed equivalently under the extremef and baseline scenarios population response to eedc exposure was plotted for the first 80 years of simulation because individuals died off after this time period under most eedc scenarios figs 6 7 compared to the baseline scenarios without eedc exposure figs 3 5 introducing eedc in the model river resulted in substantial negative impacts on the smallmouth bass population with the population size spawner and recruit abundance being reduced by approximately 73 75 and 98 respectively indicated by the magnitude of y axis effects of eedc exposure on the proportion of quality length fish were very dynamic especially during the last 50 years of simulation when the population size became low due to the mortality caused by eedc exposure increase in the eedc exposure level both year round highc and in summers extremec led to catastrophic declines in population size spawner and recruit abundance and the proportion of quality length fish fig 6 among the three eedc exposure scenarios increasing exposure to eedc year round had the most severe impacts causing the fastest extinction of the model population acute exposure imposed larger impacts on the population than chronic exposure resulting in lower population size spawners and recruit abundance fig 7 the acute exposure during spawning season acutec sp led to the most severe outcomes among all three exposure scenarios the chronic exposure resulted in slightly higher proportion than the other two acute exposure scenarios 4 discussion there is an increasing awareness of the importance of upscaling ecological risk assessments from the individual to population level and the value of population modeling as an integral part of chemical contaminant risk assessments is widely recognized e g pastorok et al 2002 bartell et al 2003 forbes et al 2011 2016 forbes et al 2011 asserted that population modeling adds needed value to ecological risk assessments and highlighted the actions necessary to move forward one of the actions identified emphasized the development of a generic modeling framework that can be applied across species and environments that can extrapolate from test species to untested species and that can upscale from individual level endpoints to population level effects our study provides an alternative for such a generic modeling framework although this framework was demonstrated using smallmouth bass and eedc exposure in this study it can be extended to other species environmental factors and chemicals by modifying the modules to further illustrate how this modeling framework can be generalized to different species and systems we give an example of blue crab callinectes sapidus here a species that is biologically distinct from smallmouth bass blue crabs support commercial and recreational fisheries along the atlantic and gulf coasts and are sensitive to a wide range of environmental factors and disturbances including water temperature salinity dissolved oxygen flow and chemical contamination etherington and eggleston 2000 to explore the population level effects of these factors on blue crabs using this proposed modeling framework a population dynamics model e g li et al 2018a 2019 or an individual based model can be used in the biological model module depending on data availability research and management needs the effect module can be constructed based on the response of biological parameters to the changes in environmental factors for blue crabs or other crustaceans e g cadman and weinstein 1988 stickle et al 1989 booth and zou 2016 the scaler approach as we applied here can be used when detailed response curves are not available the population module can choose from a wide range of population level endpoints that are of research and management interest for blue crabs such as population size spawner and recruit abundance sex ratio and harvestable size proportion this modeling framework can also help identify data gaps which may help prioritize future research efforts pastorok et al 2002 bartell et al 2003 forbes et al 2011 2016 in general for population level risk assessment data are often limited for untested species especially data on dose response functions pastorok et al 2003 forbes et al 2016 because the data gap issue is species and chemical specific we highlight some data gaps identified using this modeling framework for our case study for smallmouth bass an indicator species for the fish health in the chesapeake bay watershed research efforts that attempt to elucidate the eedc impacts on smallmouth bass are still ongoing findings thus far suggest that exposure to eedcs has caused intersex and potential immunosuppression in smallmouth bass populations in major rivers of the chesapeake bay watershed blazer et al 2007 2014 smith et al 2015 shull and pulket 2015 however whether and how intersex would further affect male behavior e g nest guarding behavior and whether and how this effect might cascade to alter reproductive success are still largely uncertain studies based on other fish species show that masculinization of females generally has more detrimental impacts on populations than feminization of males and eedc effects on fish population strongly depends on the mating function i e how many males are needed to participate in each spawning of a female white et al 2017 although alteration of sex ratio in smallmouth bass populations in chesapeake bay rivers has not been observed given that male bass guard the nest until fry swims up it is possible that intersex depending on the severity may alter this parental care behavior of male bass to the extent that it could reduce recruitment and cause population declines due to lack of the information on the relationships between eedc exposure and biological parameters for smallmouth bass we had to borrow this information from other fish species such as fathead minnows and rainbow darter in this study additionally the relationships between biological parameters e g growth and survival and the environmental factors e g temperature and flow were described based on threshold values e g optimum temperature lethal temperature and a linear change assumption for smallmouth bass in this study these relationships can be refined by response curves developed from well designed experiments as such our modeling effort highlights the need for collecting those data for smallmouth bass in future studies nevertheless existence of data gap would not undermine the applicability of this modeling framework forbes et al 2016 emphasized that substantial ecological realism may be necessary for making quantitative predictions for specific populations in particular habitats and even with data gaps insights into the importance of the processes can still be drawn from such modeling studies another update to the current framework could be adding functional relationships between abiotic factors abiotic factors i e water temperature flow and chemical contaminants vary seasonally and spatially and interact with each other and with biotic factors for example increased flow during storms may raise in stream concentration of contaminants by increasing contaminant mobility stoeckel et al 2012 in addition chemical reaction kinetics in streams are heavily contingent on water temperature whitehead et al 2009 flow also influences an organism s behavior and biotic interactions through altering habitat condition and food resources dewson et al 2007 the stochastic nature and interactions of these abiotic factors make it a challenge to elucidate their effects especially their combined effects lapointe et al 2014 gandar et al 2017 in this study we did not directly incorporate these interactions due to lack of functional relationships between abiotic factors instead we implicitly incorporated the interaction of chemicals with flow and water temperature by elevating eedc exposure in summer months in the extremec scenario which assumed increased eedc exposure level due to intense storms and warm temperature thus the model will benefit from future research and development that adds relationships quantifying the changes in eedc exposure levels with varying flow and with varying water temperatures this modeling framework can also be used to inform management and conservation actions by comparing outcomes across scenarios the smallmouth bass population in the model appears able to survive year round higher water temperatures better than high summer temperatures alone in the model water temperature influences all life stages and all biological processes the warm temperature in winter months may help offset the negative impacts from hot summers when elevating water temperatures year round by contrast high summer flows had little impact while year round high flows showed detrimental impacts to the population in the model flow primarily affects reproduction success by affecting egg and fry survival smallmouth bass generally spawn during april through june coble 1975 thus only increasing flows in summer months june august would not substantially affect reproduction that occurs during the spawning season elevating flows year round that includes the spawning season would impair reproduction these results bring cautions to fishery management in those years with hot summers and year round or spring high flows in such years any management strategies that help protect spawners and increase young of year survival may help compensate the negative impacts from these environmental stressors examples of such management strategies may include establishing spawning sanctuaries adjusting harvestable size or bag limits and adjust areal or seasonal closure the population level effects of elevated water temperatures are complicated our results indicate that depending on the individual growth curve there might be a time threshold for the bass population to enjoy the benefit of warm winters in the scenario with year round elevated water temperatures the slow growing bass population thrived within the first 80 years of simulation compared to the baseline scenario after that time threshold the benefit of warm winters phased out leaving the population performance the same as the baseline scenario however this time threshold effect was not detected for the fast growing population we suspect the population size or age structure may complicate their response to temperature changes at the population level because juveniles and adults respond differently and individual growth pattern imposes a substantial influence on population size structure for example juveniles have a narrower but higher optimal temperature range for survival 28 31 c in laboratory compared to adults optimal temperature range 21 27 c in the wild also juveniles incipient lethal temperature upper limit 35 c is higher than adults 32 c theoretically juveniles are more resistant to high temperature stress than adults however this advantage for juveniles would be limited and may depend on the simulated water temperature in the model for example if the simulated temperature is below 21 c the lower bound of optimal temperature range for adults the reduction in natural mortality for juveniles would be slower than for adults represented by its lower slope for the changes in the natural mortality scalar fig 2 if the simulated temperature goes above 31 c the upper bound of optimal temperature range for juveniles the increase in natural mortality for juveniles would also be slower than adults additionally the optimal water temperature for juveniles would be difficult to achieve and to maintain due to its narrow and high range such complicated effects would not be discovered if focusing on individual level endpoints a sensitivity analysis could be used to explore the effect of age or size structure on model outcomes while applying this framework the scalar method has been successfully applied in other ecological studies to model the combined effects of multiple abiotic factors e g li and rogers bennett 2017 li et al 2018a this method provides a flexible and effective approach to quantify combined effects of multiple factors this approach uses a scalar to measure the relative change in a parameter in response to the change in an abiotic factor compared to a baseline value or the control level it does not require information of the absolute amount of change in a parameter which is often lacking because the laboratory experiments often measure response of the treatment groups against the control group a sensitivity analysis is generally included in modeling studies as a useful tool to explore uncertainties associated with parameter values and assumptions in the model e g carriger and barron 2020 however it is not uncommon for an individual based model to downweigh the sensitivity analysis e g grimm 1999 chang et al 2010 focks et al 2014 gabsi et al 2014 grimm 1999 stated a different attitude is taken in many papers presenting individual based model with putting no effort or too much effort into sensitivity analysis too much effort into sensitivity and error analysis may distract the modeler from mechanistic understanding of the system that is the most important purpose of modeling instead of a sensitivity analysis a model validation is more emphasized in studies with individual based model e g grimm 1999 chang et al 2010 in the model validation the model generated patterns are compared to the observed data to verify whether the model can realistically capture the dynamics of the species in this study we could not perform a model validation due to lack of observed data for smallmouth bass however instead of accurate prediction of ecological effects a comparative assessment of risk e g relative to baseline or reference is often of primary interest pastorok et al 2003 as demonstrated in this study instead of focusing on the absolute changes in each scenario we focused on the relative changes compared to the baseline level or across scenarios nevertheless a sensitivity analysis is still a useful tool to explore uncertainties in modeling studies in conclusion we developed a modeling framework that evaluates ecological risk of environmental stress and eedc on long term population dynamics and viability we demonstrated the application of this framework using a socioeconomically and ecologically important fish species the smallmouth bass which has shown evidence of exposure to eedcs and that has highlighted the need for considering eedc exposure during fisheries management for smallmouth bass warm summers and high year round flow showed the most negative impacts on the population restricting or minimizing exposure to eedc through conservation restoration and or management especially during spawning season could be critical to sustain the population this framework can be extended to other species environmental factors and chemicals and to inform management and conservation actions credit author statement yan li

arendell street p o box 769 morehead city nc 28557 usa ecological risk assessments play an important role in environmental management and decision making although empirical measurements of the effects of habitat changes and chemical exposure are often made at molecular and individual levels environmental decision making often requires the quantification of management relevant population level outcomes in this study we generalized a modeling framework to evaluate population level ecological risk of environmental stress and bioactive chemicals the modeling framework includes 1 a biological model module that incorporates complex and interacting biological and ecological processes and environmental stochasticity 2 an effect module that links the impacts of environmental changes and chemical exposure to individual characteristics and 3 a population module that makes decisions on the choice of population level properties to best capture the effects and thus to track in the model based on the target species and the research and management interest this framework is a 3 module procedure that provides an alternative way for researchers to organize present and communicate the risk assessment modeling studies to demonstrate this framework we used a socioeconomically important riverine fish species smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu as the model species we developed an individual based model as the biological model module we evaluated the impacts of changing water temperature and flow regimes and the impacts of exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds eedc on smallmouth bass populations in the chesapeake bay watershed usa warm summer water temperatures and year round high flows had the most severe impacts on the smallmouth bass population an increase in exposure level to eedc both year round and in summer months substantially reduced population size spawner and recruit abundance and the proportion of quality length individuals acute exposure to eedc was more detrimental to the population than chronic exposure acute exposure during spawning season had the most severe impacts this modeling framework can be extended to other species environmental factors and chemicals and can be used to inform management and conservation decisions keywords risk assessment individual based model water temperature flow estrogenic endocrine disrupting compound 1 introduction environmental factors including water temperature and flow play critical roles in regulating aquatic ecosystems controlling organismal metabolism and growth and the transport of nutrients and organic matter e g statzner and higler 1986 allen 1995 johnson and jones 2000 these factors also define habitat conditions and influence individual behavior and survival e g allen 1995 grossman et al 1998 hart and finelli 1999 within agricultural and urban environments fertilizers pesticides personal care products and pharmaceuticals enter aquatic ecosystems through overland storm flow point source discharge and ground water chemical contaminants may affect wildlife health by impacting reproductive health growth and survival e g dunier and siwicki 1993 miller et

they can lead to significant population level effects affecting population size recruitment and age structure for example a local population of fathead minnow pimephales promelas in an experimental

fact solely relying on individual level assessments that ignore population or higher level e g ecosystem or landscape level effects can lead to inaccurate risk assessment and can possibly mislead management e g barnthouse and suter 1986 pastorok et al 2003 forbes and calow 1999 found that population growth of aquatic species was sometimes more sensitive to chemical contamination than individual level growth kammenga et al 2001 suggested that individual level response could not be directly used to predict population level impacts of cadmium and pentachlorophenol on soil invertebrates vaugeois et al 2020 concluded that population level effects of toxic chemicals are rarely directly proportional to individual level effects based on a modeled population of fathead minnow although the importance of upscaling effects from individual to population level has been acknowledged the stochastic nature and interactions of these abiotic factors make such efforts challenging sumpter 2005 miller et al 2007 schipper et al 2013 white et al 2017 the overall goal of this study was to generalize a modeling framework for evaluating long term population level effects of environmental stress and bioactive chemicals on riverine fish populations the modeling framework includes 1 a biological model module that incorporates complex and interacting biological and ecological processes and environmental stochasticity 2 an effect module that links impacts of environmental factors and bioactive chemicals to individual characteristics and 3 a population module that makes decisions on the choice of population level properties regardless of the model type in the biological model module e g individual based model or population dynamic model among all the possible output from a model the population module focuses on deciding what population level properties to best capture the effects and thus to track in the model based on the ecology of the target species and the research and management interest this framework is a 3 module procedure that provides an alternative way for researchers to organize present and communicate risk assessment modeling studies this framework outlines these three modules and all components under each module can be modified based on the species life history ecology and habitat they occupy data availability research and management interest including the choice of model type e g individual based versus population dynamic models structure and parameterization of the model relationship between the biological parameters and the environmental factors and the type of population level output we demonstrated this modeling framework using smallmouth bass micropterus dolomieu as the model species and an individual based model as the biological model module we focused on quantifying the effects of changing water temperature flow and eedc exposure the model species smallmouth bass is a popular recreational fish species that is found in freshwater lakes and rivers throughout north america it is an ecologically important predator and its life history is sensitive to environmental changes including changes to water temperature and flow peterson and kwak 1999 rejwan et al 1999 lorantas et al 2013 the presence of eedcs in freshwater ecosystems has raised concerns over fish and wildlife health because of potential impairment to reproductive and developmental processes donohoe and curtis 1996 mills et al 2001 länge et al 2001 sumpter 2005 white et al 2017 for example eedc exposure is associated with intersex i e a type of gonadal abnormality with both male and female characteristics present and immunomodulation in a variety of fish species including smallmouth bass e g jobling et al 1998 blazer et al 2007 2012 2014 abdel moneim et al 2015 schug et al 2016 potential impacts of eedcs on smallmouth bass have raised concerns about the health and sustainability of this socioeconomically important fishery arway and smith 2013 smith et al 2015 disease and mortality of young bass have occurred since 2005 in the juniata and susquehanna rivers in pennsylvania usa and eedcs were identified as one potential contributing factor blazer et al 2014 shull and pulket 2015 because of this smallmouth bass has been used as an indicator species in research programs dedicated to evaluating the potential effects of eedcs on fish and wildlife within the chesapeake bay watershed usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological model module an individual based model the individual based model tracks the life cycle of individuals within a population the biological and ecological processes are tailored to individual biological characteristics and individual strategies for adapting to a changing environment grimm et al 2006 individual based models have been widely used in ecological risk assessment e g rutherford et al 1999 chang et al 2010 hazlerigg et al 2014 li and rogers bennett 2017 in this study we parameterized the individual based model based on a smallmouth bass population and characterized the model environment based on conditions observed in the susquehanna river pennsylvania table 1 2 1 1 model environment spatial scale and scheduling smallmouth bass prefer cool clear mid order streams wider than 10 5 m carlander 1977 eggs are deposited in nests which are guarded by males and are usually built in waters from 0 3 0 9 m deep coble 1975 the model simulated 10 m wide x 2000 m long x 5 m deep 100 000 m3 river section the length of modeled river section was determined based on the average migration distance of smallmouth bass during a non spawning season schall et al 2019 in the model we did not specifically simulate habitat features except water temperature and flow water temperature and flow are dominant abiotic drivers that regulate smallmouth bass population dynamics e g edwards et al 1983 shuter et al 1987 peterson and kwak 1999 rejwan et al 1999 although other habitat features such as aquatic vegetation and sediment composition also play an important role these features are often stratified with water depth smallmouth bass at each life stage prefer different water depth that provides suitable habitat fry stay in open shallow water juveniles prefer near shore habitat and adults primarily inhabit deep waters but move to shallow areas during spawning coble 1975 ridgway et al 1991 thus in the model the impact of other habitat features was embedded in the variation in life history traits e g growth and survival at different life stages in this study we simulated the system for 200 years at monthly time steps this value of 200 years was sufficient for smallmouth bass population to respond to environmental changes given its observed maximum age in the susquehanna river is only 15 years in the model we obtained a time series of monthly average water temperature by first generating a daily water temperature time series and then calculating the monthly averages the generated daily water temperature allowed for the calculation of degree days to determine the timing of spawning for each individual the time series of daily water temperature was generated by repeatedly appending a one year daily average temperature record 2012 from the susquehanna river pennsylvania we generated a temperature for each day based on a normal distribution with a mean from the observed daily average temperature and a coefficient of variation cv randomly drawn from values ranging 5 10 we also calculated the number of degree days accumulated for temperatures above 10 c by the end of each month since the first day of a year january 1st this time series of monthly degree days was used to determine the spawning month for each individual deangelis et al 1991 ridgway et al 1991 we assumed water temperature did not vary spatially within the model river section we generated a time series of monthly flow m sec by repeatedly appending a one year monthly average flow pattern m sec january 3 68 february 2 39 march 2 86 april 1 47 may 3 34 june 1 68 july 0 5 august 0 56 september 0 6 october 1 november 1 92 and december 2 86 we generated flow for each month based on a normal distribution with its monthly mean drawn from this one year pattern with a cv randomly drawn from values ranging 5 10 this one year monthly average flow pattern was obtained by preserving the monthly pattern but scaling down the magnitude of an observed pattern from a u s geological survey station in the susquehanna river near harrisburg pa in 2012 in the model we assumed smallmouth bass was uniformly distributed throughout the river suggesting everywhere in the model river was its suitable habitat however this assumption is rarely true in the wild which indicates that the locations where the flow data are observed may not always be the suitable habitat for smallmouth bass we initially explored simulations using the observed flow data without scaling down and the fish in the model river died off too quickly to allow for the detection of any flow effects thus given that this observed flow data was the only complete one year time series available for the susquehanna river we decided to preserve the observed flow pattern but to scale it down by 88 to match the maximum flow assumption in the model because information is lacking for the flow tolerance of smallmouth bass we set the maximum flow in the model to be 4 m sec which is twice the threshold 2 m sec that may affect nest and fry survival larimore and duever 1968 this maximum flow value can be adjusted as data become available 2 1 2 growth the biological sub models were parameterized based on empirical data and publications on smallmouth bass populations in pennsylvania rivers table 1 in natural populations fertilized eggs develop in nests and are guarded by males until becoming fry that swim up at a size of 8 5 9 5 mm and disperse from nest at a size of 20 mm deangelis et al 1991 1993 fry enter a juvenile stage as their diet switches to benthic invertebrates and then become adults at maturity coble 1975 development of eggs to fry usually takes 1 2 weeks shuter et al 1980 and thus was not specifically modeled within a monthly time step in the model the life cycle of smallmouth bass was divided into four life stages fig 1 egg fry including pre dispersal fry of 8 5 20 mm and post dispersal fry of 20 90 mm the freshly hatched fry that are smaller than 8 5 mm were not explicitly modeled juvenile greater than 90 mm and before maturing beamesderfer and north 1995 and adult at or after becoming mature in the model initial length after swimming up was a random size between 8 5 and 9 5 mm deangelis et al 1993 sex was randomly assigned to each fry with a 1 1 sex ratio although the largest recorded smallmouth bass is 686 mm from kentucky page and burr 1991 fish larger than 560 mm are uncommon edwards et al 1983 in the model we assumed the maximum length of smallmouth bass to be 560 mm fish reaching the maximum length would no longer grow and would die at the next time step and be removed from the system a study of susquehanna river smallmouth bass showed that fish less than 175 mm were immature and all those above 225 mm were mature hoopes 1987 correspondingly in the model we assigned a maturity of zero not mature to individuals less than 175 mm and a maturity of one mature to individuals larger than 225 mm we assumed a linear increase in maturity for individuals between 175 mm and 225 mm quinn and deriso 1999 a fish within this size range was determined whether to mature or not using a bernoulli distribution with a success probability equal to maturity in the model monthly growth of fry juvenile and adults was described by the von bertalanffy growth model von bertalanffy 1938 quinn and deriso 1999 1 δ l l l 1 exp k δ t where l is the length increment mm during the month t 1 month l is the length at the beginning of the month l is the asymptotic length mm and k is the growth coefficient per month negative growth i e negative k value was not permitted in the model li et al 2018b showed great spatial variability in the growth of smallmouth bass across six pennsylvania rivers thus in this study we explored the sensitivity of model outcomes to the parameterization of individual growth specifically we tested two distinct individual growth curves estimated for two of the six rivers in li et al 2018b fig s1 in supplemental information the first growth curve was estimated for the north susquehanna river population l 797 mm and k 0 008 per month which represents a bass population with slower growing individuals that can potentially reach a larger maximum size referred to the slow growing population hereafter by contrast the second growth curve was estimated for the mainstem susquehanna river population l 475 mm and k 0 018 per month which represents a bass population with faster growing individuals that may potentially reach a smaller maximum size referred to the fast growing population hereafter logarithm of monthly growth coefficient k for each individual was generated based on a normal distribution with a mean of ln k and a cv of 0 2 we kept this cv value the same for both populations for comparison purpose 2 1 3 survival eggs and pre dispersal fry are vulnerable to predation especially when the nest is deserted by the guarding male coble 1975 deangelis et al 1991 in the model we did not track individual eggs but set the proportion of fertilized eggs surviving to fry greater than 8 5 mm in a guarded nest to be 0 002 thus this proportion also accounted for the mortality of freshly hatched fry that were smaller than 8 5 mm the value of 0 002 was chosen to avoid the population reaching carrying capacity at any time during simulation otherwise the population response to model manipulation would not be detected in the case of nests not surviving due to premature abandonment by guarding males or environmental stress survival of both eggs and pre dispersal fry was set to zero in the model we used the lorenzen method lorenzen 2000 2005 to estimate size specific natural mortality ml which assumes ml is inversely proportional to the length l 2 m l m 0 l d where m0 0 and d 0 are constants the constant m0 can be determined by setting the integral of ml equal to the integral of a constant natural mortality mc 3 l m i n l m a x m l d t m c l m a x l m i n where lmax 560 mm and lmin 8 5 mm are the maximum and minimum lengths assumed in the model let d 1 and m0 can be obtained by solving the above equation eq 3 4 m 0 l m a x l m i n l n l m a x l n l m i n m c in this study we set mc 0 034 per month 0 41 per year based on a maximum age of 15 for smallmouth bass at susquehanna river then et al 2015 the monthly survival rate sl can then be calculated as 5 s l e x p m l each individual s fate was determined based on a bernoulli distribution with the monthly survival rate sl 2 1 4 reproduction smallmouth bass spawn during april through june coble 1975 in natural populations more than one spawning event can occur during a single season if the initial spawning event has been disrupted and one male can participate in multiple spawnings coble 1975 larger males build nest fertilize eggs and start parental care earlier and larger females lay eggs earlier ridgway et al 1991 in the model we assumed during each spawning season each female and each male participates in only one spawning i e each female lays her eggs on only one nest all at once each male guards only one nest and no nest receive eggs from more than one female thus in the case of nfemale nmale some small females do not spawn deangelis et al 1991 the average cumulative degree days ddays needed before a male starts parental care can be related to the size of the male deangelis et al 1991 6 d days exp 17 669 3 484 ln l male 10 where lmale is the length of guarding male mm and ddays is the number of degree days accumulated for temperatures above 10 c since the temperature begins to rise in spring this relationship has been used to determine spawning date for individual smallmouth bass e g deangelis et al 1993 dong and deangelis 1998 in the model we used this relationship eq 6 to approximate the spawning month for each mature male a mature male was determined to spawn in the current month if its calculated ddays fell within the range of accumulative degree days of that given month then we ranked both males and females that are available to spawn in the current month i e mature but has not spawned yet this year by size and paired the largest female with the largest male ridgway et al 1991 deangelis et al 1991 gross and kapuscinski 1997 evaluated the reproductive success of smallmouth bass using family specific dna fingerprints and found that only 57 4 of the guarding males had offspring who survived to swim up fry stage in the model we set the nest survival to be 0 574 which represents the parental care of the guarding male each nest was determined to survive or not based on a bernoulli distribution with the nest survival rate as the success probability the eggs and pre dispersal fry would die if the nest does not survive the number of eggs negg per female smallmouth bass depends on size raffetto et al 1990 7 n egg 12251 5 59 4 l female where lfemale is the length of spawning female mm and lfemale 206 5 mm in the model a fertilization rate of 0 7 was applied based on a laboratory study of smallmouth bass landsman et al 2011 we tracked individuals starting from the swim up fry stage 2 2 effect module in this study we used a scalar w to describe the environmental and chemical effects on biological parameters the normal value the value under optimum condition of each affected parameter was adjusted by multiplying one scalar if affected by a single factor or multiple scalars if affected by multiple factors simultaneously these scalars are functions of environmental or chemical factors fig 2 2 2 1 density dependence density dependence is one of the fundamental factors to regulate population dynamics to influence population recovery after disturbance such as chemical exposure or harvesting and to predict population level effects of disturbance deangelis et al 1991 pastorok et al 2002 hazlerigg et al 2014 when the density of fish is high young smallmouth bass attempt to capture the fry that disperse from nest dong and deangelis 1998 in this study we set the maximum density to be 0 8 fish per cubic meter based on a density estimate for largemouth bass micropterus salmoides from a hatchery site unpublished data personal communication with dr donald e tillitt usgs columbia environmental research center mortality of fry was assumed to increase linearly from mfry at half the maximum density to 2mfry at the maximum density similarly egg survival was assumed to decline from segg at half the maximum density to zero at the maximum density these density dependent assumptions represent intra specific competition due to space and resource limitation 8 w d m f r y 1 if d 0 8 2

ceases at 35 c horning and pearson 1973 shuter et al 1980 edwards et al 1983 in the model we assumed growth coefficient k to linearly decrease in months with a temperature lower than 25 c or higher

plasma vitellogenin in male smallmouth bass and immunosuppression intersexed male bass produce fewer sperm and the sperm are less motile blazer et al 2007 2012 2014 in the model exposure to eedc reduced survival of fry juvenile and adult and reduced egg production fecundity the comprehensive functional relationships between life history traits and a particular eedc compound is lacking for smallmouth bass therefore to demonstrate the modeling framework we borrowed this information from other species schwindt et al 2014 examined the effects of ee2 on the survival and reproduction of fathead minnow with four exposure concentrations i e 0 3 2 5 3 and 10 9 ng l although ee2 was not detected in the susquehanna river for which the model environment was developed due to data limitation and for demonstration purposes we treated the ee2 concentration in these relationships as a measure of exposure level to eedc ng l called eedc exposure level hereafter these relationships can be updated as additional data become available for smallmouth bass in the susquehanna river or modified as needed for applications of this model to other species and systems in this study we used the response curves from schwindt et al 2014 figs 2 3 a and 3b in schwindt et al 2014 to describe the eedc effects on smallmouth bass specifically we used a step function with linear transitions between the four exposure levels to calculate the scalars for estrogen effect on fry survival w c s f r y juvenile survival w c s j u v e n i l e male adult survival w c s a d u l t m a l e female adult

survival and 0 68 for female adult survival and 0 05 for fecundity ee2 has been measured up to 11 ng l in the environment schwindt et al 2014 in this study the maximum eedc exposure level was set at 10 9 ng l which matched the maximum ee2 level used in the schwindt et al 2014 because the male smallmouth bass guards a nest until fry swim up coble 1975 feminization of guarding males i e intersex may increase the chance of deserting the nest or for poorly caring for the nest in the model this effect corresponds to intersex incidence and intersex severity both of which could be a function of eedc exposure level arlos et al 2018 linked the intersex incidence and intersex severity to total estrogenicity based on data for rainbow darter etheostoma caeruleum from grand river in southern ontario canada intersex incidence refers to the probability of a fish having intersex i e at least one oocyte in the male testis intersex severity measures the degree of feminization in terms of the relative number of oocytes given intersex occurs and is scored from 0 to 7 with 0 for a normal male and 7 for a normal female bahamonde et al 2015 arlos et al 2018 in this study we used the relationships developed in arlos et al 2018 and modified them to calculate the intersex incidence intersex probability and the probability of an intersexed male deserting the nest deserting probability given a eedc exposure level the deserting probability was obtained by mapping the intersex severity score to a probability based on a linear relationship that assumed the probability of deserting a nest is one given the severity score of 7 and 0 given the severity score of 0 because arlos et al 2018 developed response curves for total estrogenicity but we assumed ee2 to be a measure of eedc exposure level an adjusting factor 0 17 was applied to convert total estrogenicity concentration to eedc exposure level i e ee2 concentration based on the evidence that ee2 contributes approximately 17 18 of the total estrogenicity in a river in southern ontario arlos et al 2018 the resulting response curves for intersex probability and deserting probability are as follows 14 i n t e r s e x p r o b a b i l i t y 0 1 0 1 10 0 777 c x 1 017 d e s e r t i n g p r o b a b i l i t y 0 6 0 1 10 4 492 c x 0 911 1 6 where the adjusting factor x 0 17 the fraction of 1 6 was multiplied to map the intersex severity score to the nest deserting probability as a result the nest survival in the model was adjusted with a scalar in response to eedc exposure level 15 w c s n e s t 1 intersex probability deserting probability 2 3 population module in each replicate model run we tracked individual attributes and summarized population characteristics annually including population size recruitment and size structure we also tracked the proportion of quality length fish quality length is defined as the size of a fish that most anglers like to catch anderson 1980 a quality length close to 246 279 mm has been suggested for smallmouth bass gabelhouse 1984 in this study we calculated the proportion of the smallmouth bass within this quality length size range 2 4 model initialization and validation we initialized the model with 1000 individuals which equals 1 25 of the carrying capacity i e the maximum population size in the model river section we chose this initial value to ensure the population would sustain during initialization but would not reach the carrying capacity at any time during simulation in this way we can detect the population response to model manipulations without being constrained by the carrying capacity size structure for the initial population was based on survey data collected by the pennsylvania fish and boat commission from the susquehanna river in 1990 each individual in the initial population was randomly assigned a sex with a 1 1 sex ratio and a length based on the size structure we ran ten replicates for each scenario this value of 10 replicates is recommended for individual based models by many studies to balance between ensuring a reasonable variance of the population dynamics and conserving computation effort e g hobday and tegner 2002 coates and hovel 2014 focks et al 2014 meli et al 2014 li and rogers bennett 2017 both individual level e g growth survival and maturity and population level characteristics e g population size size structure spawner abundance and recruitment were updated at each time step i e at each month in this study due to lack of data to validate the model as some other studies have done e g grimm 1999 chang et al 2010 we interpreted our model results in a relative way beissinger and westphal 1998 instead of focusing on the absolute quantity under each scenario we focused on comparing outcomes across scenarios 2 5 simulation experiments we conducted simulation experiments to evaluate the impacts of increasing water temperature increasing flow and exposure to eedc on a smallmouth bass population tables s1 s4 in supplemental information in the baseline scenario we used the generated time series of water temperature and flow and we assumed no eedc exposure in the model river section we then developed two water temperature scenarios 1 high temperature hight scenario in which we elevated the daily average temperature by 3 c this scenario represents warm water temperature year round 2 extreme temperature extremet scenario in which we elevated the daily average temperature by 3 c in summer months june july and august to represent a warm summer scenario the nasa earth observatory stated that average surface temperatures could rise between 2 c and 6 c by the end of the 21st century based on plausible emission scenarios nasa earth observatory 2010 given the fact that changes in water temperature might be milder than changes in air temperature we chose the value of 3 c as the temperature increase in the model this value is also large enough to allow us to discern different temperature scenarios with all the variations included we examined two flow scenarios 1 high flow highf scenario in which we elevated the monthly average flow by 0 5 m sec year round 2 extreme flow extremef scenario in which we only elevated the monthly average flow by 0 5 m sec in summer months june july and august the extremef scenario simulates increased flow velocity during summers due to an increased frequency of intense storms usgcrp 2018 we tested six eedc exposure scenarios the first scenario was normal eedc exposure normalc in which we simulated a time series of monthly eedc exposure level ng l by repeatedly appending a one year pattern of monthly average exposure level total estrogenicity data from a tributary to the susquehanna river west branch mahantango creek in 2015 was used to establish this one year pattern williams et al 2019 assuming ee2 contributes 17 of the observed total estrogenicity we obtained the one year pattern of monthly eedc exposure level i e ee2 concentration by multiplying the observed monthly average total estrogenicity with the adjusting factor 0 17 the resulting one year pattern of monthly eedc exposure level ng l was january 0 february 0 038 march 0 629 april 0 045 may 0 142 june 0 028 july 0 august 0 021 september 0 064 october 0 051 november 0 026 and december 0 057 next we generated the eedc exposure level for each month based on a normal distribution with its mean from the one year pattern and a cv ranging 10 30 this cv range was chosen based on the observed total estrogenicity data in mahantango creek in the second scenario the high eedc exposure highc scenario we elevated the monthly average exposure concentration by 0 5 ng l year round in the third scenario the extreme eedc exposure extremec scenario we only elevated the monthly average exposure concentration by 0 5 ng l in summer months june july and august the next three eedc exposure scenarios namely the chronic exposure chronicc scenario the acute exposure non spawning acutecnsp scenario and the acute exposure spawning acutec sp scenario simulated chronic and acute exposure experiments in which we compared the long term population level response to chronic exposure to small amount for a long continuous time period versus acute exposure to large amount for a short time period exposures to eedcs in the chronicc scenario we released a constant level of eedc 0 108 ng l in the model river each month and continued for the entire simulation time period in the acutecnsp scenario we released an eedc level that equals to the annual total concentration 1 297 ng l 1 0 108 ng l per month x 12 month all at once in a non spawning month january every year the acutec sp scenario was the same as the acutecnsp scenario except that the eedc was released in june every year a month that is critical to both spawning and early recruitment in these eedc exposure scenarios we assumed the water temperature and flow patterns were the same as in the baseline scenario although seasons other than summer could also be explored in all the extreme scenarios we focused on summer in this study because smallmouth bass reach their early life stages during summer early life stages could be more sensitive to environmental changes koger et al 2000 and mortality and disease of young of the year bass have been well documented since 2005 for susquehanna river shull and pulket 2015 smith et al 2015 an additional reason for simulating high eedc exposure level in summer months is that an increased frequency of intense storms during summer predicted for our study area under a changing climate usgcrp 2018 may lead to an increase in mobilization of chemicals from agricultural and urban landscapes into rivers the model and simulation were coded in r version 3 6 1 the r code developed for this study is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3956465 3 results results for the slow growing and fast growing populations were similar except for a slight difference in their response to the water temperature effect thus we present the results for the slow growing population and only those results related to the water temperature effect for the fast growing population the remaining results for the fast growing population are presented in the supplemental information figs s2 s4 in the model regardless of individual growth types changes in water temperature and flow had large effects on population size spawner and recruit abundance whereas their influence on the proportion of quality length fish was not substantial figs 3 5 both slow and fast growing populations in the hight scenario had the highest population size spawner and recruit abundance among the three temperature scenarios within the first 80 years of simulation figs 3 4 during the remaining time period performance of the slow growing population in the hight scenario became equivalent to the baseline scenario fig 3 whereas performance of the fast growing population remained superior over the baseline scenario fig 4 both populations in the extremet scenario performed the worst with the lowest population size spawner and recruit abundance during the entire simulation period year round high flow in the highf scenario substantially reduced population size spawner and recruit abundance compared to the other two flow scenarios fig 5 the bass population performed equivalently under the extremef and baseline scenarios population response to eedc exposure was plotted for the first 80 years of simulation because individuals died off after this time period under most eedc scenarios figs 6 7 compared to the baseline scenarios without eedc exposure figs 3 5 introducing eedc in the model river resulted in substantial negative impacts on the smallmouth bass population with the population size spawner and recruit abundance being reduced by approximately 73 75 and 98 respectively indicated by the magnitude of y axis effects of eedc exposure on the proportion of quality length fish were very dynamic especially during the last 50 years of simulation when the population size became low due to the mortality caused by eedc exposure increase in the eedc exposure level both year round highc and in summers extremec led to catastrophic declines in population size spawner and recruit abundance and the proportion of quality length fish fig 6 among the three eedc exposure scenarios increasing exposure to eedc year round had the most severe impacts causing the fastest extinction of the model population acute exposure imposed larger impacts on the population than chronic exposure resulting in lower population size spawners and recruit abundance fig 7 the acute exposure during spawning season acutec sp led to the most severe outcomes among all three exposure scenarios the chronic exposure resulted in slightly higher proportion than the other two acute exposure scenarios 4 discussion there is an increasing awareness of the importance of upscaling ecological risk assessments from the individual to population level and the value of population modeling as an integral part of chemical contaminant risk assessments is widely recognized e g pastorok et al 2002 bartell et al 2003 forbes et al 2011 2016 forbes et al 2011 asserted that population modeling adds needed value to ecological risk assessments and highlighted the actions necessary to move forward one of the actions identified emphasized the development of a generic modeling framework that can be applied across species and environments that can extrapolate from test species to untested species and that can upscale from individual level endpoints to population level effects our study provides an alternative for such a generic modeling framework although this framework was demonstrated using smallmouth bass and eedc exposure in this study it can be extended to other species environmental factors and chemicals by modifying the modules to further illustrate how this modeling framework can be generalized to different species and systems we give an example of blue crab callinectes sapidus here a species that is biologically distinct from smallmouth bass blue crabs support commercial and recreational fisheries along the atlantic and gulf coasts and are sensitive to a wide range of environmental factors and disturbances including water temperature salinity dissolved oxygen flow and chemical contamination etherington and eggleston 2000 to explore the population level effects of these factors on blue crabs using this proposed modeling framework a population dynamics model e g li et al 2018a 2019 or an individual based model can be used in the biological model module depending on data availability research and management needs the effect module can be constructed based on the response of biological parameters to the changes in environmental factors for blue crabs or other crustaceans e g cadman and weinstein 1988 stickle et al 1989 booth and zou 2016 the scaler approach as we applied here can be used when detailed response curves are not available the population module can choose from a wide range of population level endpoints that are of research and management interest for blue crabs such as population size spawner and recruit abundance sex ratio and harvestable size proportion this modeling framework can also help identify data gaps which may help prioritize future research efforts pastorok et al 2002 bartell et al 2003 forbes et al 2011 2016 in general for population level risk assessment data are often limited for untested species especially data on dose response functions pastorok et al 2003 forbes et al 2016 because the data gap issue is species and chemical specific we highlight some data gaps identified using this modeling framework for our case study for smallmouth bass an indicator species for the fish health in the chesapeake bay watershed research efforts that attempt to elucidate the eedc impacts on smallmouth bass are still ongoing findings thus far suggest that exposure to eedcs has caused intersex and potential immunosuppression in smallmouth bass populations in major rivers of the chesapeake bay watershed blazer et al 2007 2014 smith et al 2015 shull and pulket 2015 however whether and how intersex would further affect male behavior e g nest guarding behavior and whether and how this effect might cascade to alter reproductive success are still largely uncertain studies based on other fish species show that masculinization of females generally has more detrimental impacts on populations than feminization of males and eedc effects on fish population strongly depends on the mating function i e how many males are needed to participate in each spawning of a female white et al 2017 although alteration of sex ratio in smallmouth bass populations in chesapeake bay rivers has not been observed given that male bass guard the nest until fry swims up it is possible that intersex depending on the severity may alter this parental care behavior of male bass to the extent that it could reduce recruitment and cause population declines due to lack of the information on the relationships between eedc exposure and biological parameters for smallmouth bass we had to borrow this information from other fish species such as fathead minnows and rainbow darter in this study additionally the relationships between biological parameters e g growth and survival and the environmental factors e g temperature and flow were described based on threshold values e g optimum temperature lethal temperature and a linear change assumption for smallmouth bass in this study these relationships can be refined by response curves developed from well designed experiments as such our modeling effort highlights the need for collecting those data for smallmouth bass in future studies nevertheless existence of data gap would not undermine the applicability of this modeling framework forbes et al 2016 emphasized that substantial ecological realism may be necessary for making quantitative predictions for specific populations in particular habitats and even with data gaps insights into the importance of the processes can still be drawn from such modeling studies another update to the current framework could be adding functional relationships between abiotic factors abiotic factors i e water temperature flow and chemical contaminants vary seasonally and spatially and interact with each other and with biotic factors for example increased flow during storms may raise in stream concentration of contaminants by increasing contaminant mobility stoeckel et al 2012 in addition chemical reaction kinetics in streams are heavily contingent on water temperature whitehead et al 2009 flow also influences an organism s behavior and biotic interactions through altering habitat condition and food resources dewson et al 2007 the stochastic nature and interactions of these abiotic factors make it a challenge to elucidate their effects especially their combined effects lapointe et al 2014 gandar et al 2017 in this study we did not directly incorporate these interactions due to lack of functional relationships between abiotic factors instead we implicitly incorporated the interaction of chemicals with flow and water temperature by elevating eedc exposure in summer months in the extremec scenario which assumed increased eedc exposure level due to intense storms and warm temperature thus the model will benefit from future research and development that adds relationships quantifying the changes in eedc exposure levels with varying flow and with varying water temperatures this modeling framework can also be used to inform management and conservation actions by comparing outcomes across scenarios the smallmouth bass population in the model appears able to survive year round higher water temperatures better than high summer temperatures alone in the model water temperature influences all life stages and all biological processes the warm temperature in winter months may help offset the negative impacts from hot summers when elevating water temperatures year round by contrast high summer flows had little impact while year round high flows showed detrimental impacts to the population in the model flow primarily affects reproduction success by affecting egg and fry survival smallmouth bass generally spawn during april through june coble 1975 thus only increasing flows in summer months june august would not substantially affect reproduction that occurs during the spawning season elevating flows year round that includes the spawning season would impair reproduction these results bring cautions to fishery management in those years with hot summers and year round or spring high flows in such years any management strategies that help protect spawners and increase young of year survival may help compensate the negative impacts from these environmental stressors examples of such management strategies may include establishing spawning sanctuaries adjusting harvestable size or bag limits and adjust areal or seasonal closure the population level effects of elevated water temperatures are complicated our results indicate that depending on the individual growth curve there might be a time threshold for the bass population to enjoy the benefit of warm winters in the scenario with year round elevated water temperatures the slow growing bass population thrived within the first 80 years of simulation compared to the baseline scenario after that time threshold the benefit of warm winters phased out leaving the population performance the same as the baseline scenario however this time threshold effect was not detected for the fast growing population we suspect the population size or age structure may complicate their response to temperature changes at the population level because juveniles and adults respond differently and individual growth pattern imposes a substantial influence on population size structure for example juveniles have a narrower but higher optimal temperature range for survival 28 31 c in laboratory compared to adults optimal temperature range 21 27 c in the wild also juveniles incipient lethal temperature upper limit 35 c is higher than adults 32 c theoretically juveniles are more resistant to high temperature stress than adults however this advantage for juveniles would be limited and may depend on the simulated water temperature in the model for example if the simulated temperature is below 21 c the lower bound of optimal temperature range for adults the reduction in natural mortality for juveniles would be slower than for adults represented by its lower slope for the changes in the natural mortality scalar fig 2 if the simulated temperature goes above 31 c the upper bound of optimal temperature range for juveniles the increase in natural mortality for juveniles would also be slower than adults additionally the optimal water temperature for juveniles would be difficult to achieve and to maintain due to its narrow and high range such complicated effects would not be discovered if focusing on individual level endpoints a sensitivity analysis could be used to explore the effect of age or size structure on model outcomes while applying this framework the scalar method has been successfully applied in other ecological studies to model the combined effects of multiple abiotic factors e g li and rogers bennett 2017 li et al 2018a this method provides a flexible and effective approach to quantify combined effects of multiple factors this approach uses a scalar to measure the relative change in a parameter in response to the change in an abiotic factor compared to a baseline value or the control level it does not require information of the absolute amount of change in a parameter which is often lacking because the laboratory experiments often measure response of the treatment groups against the control group a sensitivity analysis is generally included in modeling studies as a useful tool to explore uncertainties associated with parameter values and assumptions in the model e g carriger and barron 2020 however it is not uncommon for an individual based model to downweigh the sensitivity analysis e g grimm 1999 chang et al 2010 focks et al 2014 gabsi et al 2014 grimm 1999 stated a different attitude is taken in many papers presenting individual based model with putting no effort or too much effort into sensitivity analysis too much effort into sensitivity and error analysis may distract the modeler from mechanistic understanding of the system that is the most important purpose of modeling instead of a sensitivity analysis a model validation is more emphasized in studies with individual based model e g grimm 1999 chang et al 2010 in the model validation the model generated patterns are compared to the observed data to verify whether the model can realistically capture the dynamics of the species in this study we could not perform a model validation due to lack of observed data for smallmouth bass however instead of accurate prediction of ecological effects a comparative assessment of risk e g relative to baseline or reference is often of primary interest pastorok et al 2003 as demonstrated in this study instead of focusing on the absolute changes in each scenario we focused on the relative changes compared to the baseline level or across scenarios nevertheless a sensitivity analysis is still a useful tool to explore uncertainties in modeling studies in conclusion we developed a modeling framework that evaluates ecological risk of environmental stress and eedc on long term population dynamics and viability we demonstrated the application of this framework using a socioeconomically and ecologically important fish species the smallmouth bass which has shown evidence of exposure to eedcs and that has highlighted the need for considering eedc exposure during fisheries management for smallmouth bass warm summers and high year round flow showed the most negative impacts on the population restricting or minimizing exposure to eedc through conservation restoration and or management especially during spawning season could be critical to sustain the population this framework can be extended to other species environmental factors and chemicals and to inform management and conservation actions credit author statement yan li

24717,resilience planning requires an understanding of the potential impact of accelerated sea level rise on the narrow coastal habitats between the sea and the built environment in urban estuaries preliminary work suggests that facilitating expansion of coastal upland vegetation grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest may improve resilience we created a gis model for jamaica bay new york to identify areas of inland salt marsh migration induced by sea level rise and map potential locations for expansion of coastal upland vegetation through plantings of local provenance given land use soil type and adjacency to predicted future salt marshes we predicted that regularly flooded salt marshes low marsh will comprise the large majority of salt marsh area 89 up from 68 currently in the coming century due to daily tides covering areas currently categorized as irregularly flooded salt marsh high marsh brackish marsh and coastal upland vegetation considering land use 16 of the area suitable for coastal upland vegetation within the coastal buffer zone could be considered possible sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion with about a fifth of those areas adjacent to predicted new sea level rise induced inland salt marsh areas parks and recreational facilities 43 and open space 32 were the dominant land uses available for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion adjacent to predicted new sea level rise induced inland salt marsh areas potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were considerably more numerous on sandy soils than on loamy sand soils maintained lawn and shrubs and the borders of roads and railroads provided available space in areas disjunct from the predicted new salt marsh areas our study of opportunities for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation fills a gap within existing models and informs land managers of predicted future inland salt marsh migration locations regions of existing vegetation to support and areas where restoration plantings may help sustain coastal upland vegetative communities and their many ecological services keywords

vertical accretion rates are limited and they may lose their lower elevation landscapes under water fitzgerald et al 2008 khan et al 2020 research has indicated that we may see increasing rates of inundation along the coast and more rapid loss of coastal wetlands by 2050 solecki and rosenzweig 2019 this projection is underscored by possible increasing rates of summer evapotranspiration and water deficits projected for the mid to late century which lend further evidence that the total extent of wetlands is likely to be reduced wolfe et al 2011 survival of coastal upland vegetation

2018 by securing and expanding coastal natural resources spalding et al 2014 providing habitat of great value to wildlife dowhan et al 1997 and maintaining ecosystem services meixler 2017 mitsch et al 2015 this is especially true for urban areas which may harbor significant biodiversity resources aronson et al 2014 that can buffer and support the ecological functioning of urban coastal ecosystems and which must be perceived as part of the solution to the negative effects of slr coastal vegetation along urbanized shorelines is especially important because these limited ecosystems serve large human populations within the united states since 1960 54 of the nation s population has lived within the coastal zone tibbetts 2002 and that percentage is expected to increase in the coming decades neumann et al 2015 the pressures of urban advancement and slr have created coastal squeeze a loss of coastal habitats where the high water mark is fixed by a hard structure pavement and buildings while the low water mark migrates landwards in response to slr doody 2004 schleupner 2008 many coastal zones currently experience coastal squeeze and this compression is expected to be exacerbated as sea level rises fig 1 residential and commercial land uses may ultimately limit the possible expansion of salt marsh and coastal upland vegetation unless urban planning conserves existing land or considers potential sites for assisted plantings plant species of fringing salt marshes coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest that can move to higher ground as sea level rises will continue to serve the wildlife community dowhan et al 1997 and will provide ecological services to the nearby residential zones such as buffering from storms and erosion protection costanza et al 2006 feagin et al 2010 zinnert et al 2016 local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion through plantings of local provenance in this zone of coastal squeeze would optimize use of permeable surfaces in the built environment and would help considerably in securing the health of coastal uplands both now and as sea level rises in addition coastal upland vegetation expansion through plantings of local provenance extends the inland edge of the coastal zone so that instead of stopping at the first anthropogenic structure e g road it moves into the built environment integrating the built environment and the natural environment and making the barrier more permeable critical steps for the near future in urban coastal regions involve identifying all possible potential expansion pathways and the most effective methods to assist with expansion and support coastal upland vegetation experiencing coastal squeeze now and in the future knowledge of expansion pathways preparation of inland open space and healthy source populations of propagules are needed to enhance this type of resiliency in a recent study of the fringing habitat near canarsie pier brooklyn new york handel and kaunzinger 2016 found that small pockets of natural coastal vegetation are often present these could become the nuclei from which more diverse and functioning habitats can spread given appropriate management such as removal of invasive competitors planting of extirpated species or soil ph and texture amelioration land managers can also facilitate new habitat patches by initiating nucleating centers of vegetation which can spread by seed dispersal handel 2013 ste marie et al 2011 or clonal growth harper 1977 hutchings and bradbury 1986 unlike south north assisted plant migration these local patches are unlikely to introduce substantially different genetic material further coastal upland vegetation could be used as landscaping material in parks recreation areas and publicly owned spaces dispersal from these locations may spread coastal upland vegetation into natural areas much like horticultural species have spread into natural areas through residential landscape plantings to this end the new york city department of parks and recreation the natural areas conservancy and the nature conservancy have completed a sophisticated analysis of tidal salt marsh migration opportunities in new york city based on model projections and current land use sea level affecting marshes model slamm clough et al 2010 slamm is a two dimensional model in which long term shoreline and habitat changes are predicted as a function of elevation tide range and slr slamm 2016 current slamm model projections don t consider coastal upland vegetation coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest expansion potential in addition to salt marshes similarly the literature has largely addressed only the potential for slr induced inland salt marsh migration not coastal upland vegetation expansion which also contributes to protection from flooding and erosion craft et al 2009 it is important to analyze both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats together as they are naturally adjacent communities treating them as separate entities and restoring under different plans can result in the loss of habitat provision for many wildlife species especially those that require both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats for survival thorne et al 2012 nordenson et al 2018 our study investigates this gap in the slamm model projections and introduces broader thinking on what constitutes available land for expansion areas where natural vegetation expansion may be possible include many public and private lands that could support coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest species with appropriate assistance including mowed lawns municipal or private sector space that is not assigned to active use residential commercial parcels whose landscaping can be improved for higher ecological services by improved species palettes and more fig 1 we created a geographic information system gis model to identify slr induced inland salt marsh migration within the zone from saltwater marshland to the coastal upland vegetation border and map potential locations appropriate for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion given soil type and adjacency to predicted future salt marsh locations our study of opportunities for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion given projected slr will inform land managers of the most vulnerable coastal habitats where fringing plant communities will be lost possible habitats for the future and locations where restoration may be most successful this new york city study is widely applicable to other urban coastal areas 2 methods 2 1 study site jamaica bay new york fig 2 situated on the southwestern shore of long island and bordered by kings and queens counties and a small portion of nassau county has a rich diversity of bird and fish species and the largest wetland complex in the new york city area mcphearson et al 2013 the bay encompasses coastal urban wilds of enormous value provides extensive ecological services and high recreational opportunities trust for public land and new york city audubon 1987 1993 in fact some of the islands within jamaica bay have been designated as the jamaica bay national wildlife refuge which is part of the gateway national recreation area the only wildlife refuge managed by the national park service despite these positive attributes jamaica bay has changed enormously under human influence since european settlement in fact the recent natural history of jamaica bay is one of extensive anthropogenic modification through dredging of channels and filling of salt marshes black 1992 gornitz et al 2001 three quarters of the wetlands in the bay have been lost englebright 1975 hartig et al 2002 and salt marshes and open water were filled for development the landscape that fringes the bay has changed from natural coastal saltwater marshlands bordered by salt shrub and maritime forest into a dense urban matrix that supports over 800 000 people in the communities adjacent to the bay mcphearson et al 2013 hardened shorelines boger et al 2012 changes in tidal patterns due to dredging swanson and wilson 2008 and slr hartig et al 2002 have resulted in significant salt marsh fragmentation and loss kolker 2005 and these factors pose the most substantial threats currently facing jamaica bay mcphearson et al 2013 jamaica bay is considered a priority study area for addressing salt marsh losses and migration mcphearson et al 2013 new york city parks 2016 so we can better learn how coastal urban complexes respond to new ecological stresses sanderson et al 2016 2 2 modeling our goal was to analyze current fringing habitats and to identify opportunities for coastal upland vegetation expansion by locating sites within jamaica bay that have potential to support plantings of local provenance within defined coastal upland zones conceptual diagram shown in fig 3a gis workflow in fig 3b the zone of opportunity for coastal upland vegetation expansion runs from the upper slamm border of saltwater marshland to the potential upland vegetation maritime border fig 4 this is the critical zone of interest as this land is available now for colonization and coastal upland vegetation expansion we first calculated in arcgis 10 6 1 esri 2015 the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone by identifying on staten island new york the furthest location in which coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest exists in the ecological covertype map ecm 2014 natural areas conservancy 2014 which has a spatial resolution of 0 28 m x 0 28 m figs 3a and 3b step 1 the ecm is an urban ecological land cover map for new york city containing 37 unique classes ranging from natural to anthropogenic o neil dunne 2014 we used nearby staten island as a reference ecosystem for this analysis even though our study area is jamaica bay because it is less developed and potentially more representative of a natural coastal plant community with a vegetation gradient from salt marsh to coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest largely unimpeded by anthropogenic activities given its close proximity similar topography modest and gradual elevation rise and analogous ecoregional conditions with jamaica bay staten island shares many of the same properties that define the extent of the coastal upland zone and help to show how far inland the coastal upland zone would extend under similar more natural conditions we used the present day inland extent of the coastal upland vegetation coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest on staten island as an estimate of how far inland coastal upland vegetation can survive and provide resiliency ecological benefits in jamaica bay today in other words we measured the maximum inland range of coastal upland vegetation in staten island as a surrogate for the width of the coastal buffer zone 1332 18 m in nearby jamaica bay this buffer constituted the area in which local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation is most advantageous to coastal wildlife and ecological resilience and where it is likely to grow the elevation change at this reference site from coast inland through the maritime vegetation is similar to the grade at jamaica bay within the buffer zone new york county 2020 fixed width buffer zones are in widespread use along the east coast of the united states as they have the advantage of being easy to implement desbonnet et al 1995 use of vegetation at our reference site to determine the potential coastal buffer zone depth at jamaica bay has the further advantage of integrating the several proximate forces physical and biotic that determine the gradient of plant biodiversity change coastal upland vegetation such as coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest are known to be a zoned mosaic vegetation pattern martin 1959 that does not always have abrupt boundaries among habitat types forces such as salt spray groundwater depth salinity flooding frequency disturbance soil quality and human land use patterns together influence coastal vegetation change ehrenfeld 1990 hayden et al 1995 these are influenced by elevation in part but the intensity of any one of these forces is idiosyncratic at any one location the vegetation pattern such as at our reference site on staten island is a product of a long term interplay of these biotic and physical forces and is a more accurate multifactor predictor of buffer zone depth than elevation alone we used a sea level affecting marshes model slamm 2016 projection for the year 2085 under a scenario of 1 327 m slr by 2100 minimum rapid ice melt rim min to eventually determine potential areas for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation slamm data have a spatial resolution of 5 m x 5 m but only cover kings and queens counties not nassau county we used the projection for the year 2085 under a scenario of 1 327 m slr by 2100 to correlate with other research being done in the area using the same future projection haight et al 2019 and to reflect intermediate levels of predicted slr for the new york city region based on the most current research gornitz et al 2019 we first determined the locations considered potential future salt marsh features in slamm these included the categories regularly flooded salt marsh low salt marsh and irregularly flooded salt marsh high salt marsh then we determined the locations of current salt marsh features from the slamm data projections for 1 327 m slr by 2100 rim min for the year 2008 using the same two salt marsh categories regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes we overlaid current and future salt marshes and then spatially isolated locations where salt marsh features exist in the future but not the present figs 3a and 3b step 2 these locations represent areas where salt marsh could migrate based on the inland salt marsh extent projected in the slamm model analysis aka the slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations note that slamm data do not extend into nassau county so no future salt marsh locations were present in that region of the bay then we created a buffer from the coastline under our projected slr to the potential extent of the coastal upland zone 1332 18 m determined previously using the furthest extent of coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest on staten island figs 3a and 3b step 3 we removed from our selected set of slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations any features outside of the buffer zone figs 3a and 3b step 4 next we obtained new york city land use data from the primary land use tax lot output pluto files provided by the nyc department of city planning nyc dcp 2015 these files contain detailed information about land use and zoning of parcels for kings and queens counties we selected parcels from the pluto map within the buffer zone with the potential to assist in the expansion of coastal upland vegetation figs 3a and 3b step 5 these include the following types public parking areas easements parks recreational facilities beaches city owned vacant lots and open space we also included ball fields golf courses playgrounds and cemeteries from the pluto data within the buffer zone but for these sites we clipped for our use a three meter buffer inside the border of each parcel instead of using the entire area given the expectation that only the borders of these highly used open spaces would be available to coastal upland vegetation we also selected bare soil and maintained lawns and shrubs including those in residential areas from the ecm data within the buffer zone in kings and queens counties in nassau county we extracted old fields pastures golf courses parks lawns barren lands and sand flats from new york gap analysis land use land cover data smith et al 2001 finally we buffered the 2016 roads railroads tiger line file data united states census bureau 2016 for all three counties by three meters on either side together these selected parcels and border spaces represent locations for potential local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation within the buffer zone finally we removed from our set of selected parcels and border spaces any locations that were already one of the following coastal upland vegetation freshwater marsh saltwater marsh buildings or pavement or predicted future salt marsh figs 3a and 3b step 6 we overlaid our remaining parcels and border spaces onto the map of slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations to create a map of available parcels for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation we then subselected parcels that were adjacent to future salt marsh locations and saved these as a separate map for later use figs 3a and 3b step 7 these locations will likely provide certain benefits in the process of slr induced inland salt marsh migration with respect to genetic diversity and biodiversity of non planted species we also subselected parcels adjacent to the full suite of existing coastal upland vegetation locations within the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone figs 3a and 3b step 7 these included the following vegetation classifications in the ecm eastern coastal beach group northern central sand barrens group northern atlantic dune coastal grasslands shrublands group and maritime shrubland and successional maritime forest o neil dunne et al 2014 we obtained soil information from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo 2016 provided by the natural resource conservation service nrcs of the united states department of agriculture usda research has shown that coastal vegetation growth is stimulated by moderate levels of sand due to improved soil resources reactive plant growth and enhanced mycorrhizal activity maun 1998 using the ssurgo map we identified soils in our study area classified as sand 85 sand and loamy sand 70 85 sand we overlaid our map of sandy soils on our selected parcels representing locations for potential local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation to identify which locations are likely to support coastal upland vegetation with and without soil amendment figs 3a and 3b step 8 coastal upland vegetation restoration potential varies based on the need for soil amendments to promote growth and establishment of native plantings parkinson et al 2018 in areas classified as sand little to no soil amendment would be necessary loamy sands would need soil amendments to aid in coastal plant competitive advantage this could be accomplished through restructuring of existing soil by adding sand and possibly removing existing urban soils to create coastal habitat for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion we also overlaid on our map of selected parcels our map of parcels adjacent to future salt marsh locations to assist in the prioritization of restoration activities together this constituted our maps of potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation given soils and future salt marsh adjacency 2 3 analysis we determined from our map of potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation the total area in sq km of current coastal upland vegetation predicted future salt marsh and the total area of potential slr induced inland salt marsh migration predicted future salt marsh current salt marsh predicted from the slamm models we then tabulated areas for current and predicted future salt marsh by marsh type and calculated areas of potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion by land use type given soil types and adjacency to predicted future salt marsh locations we used average nearest neighbor analysis in arcgis version 10 6 1 to determine if clustering exists for potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion 3 results we found that within our study area present day regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes comprised 6 32 km2 about 2 of the area within the extent of the coastal buffer zone table 1 by comparison predicted future regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes were expected to comprise 7 47 km2 when we spatially isolated regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes that exist in the future but not in the present we found that 2 51 km2 of new area would likely comprise our slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations table 1 approximately 16 of the area 42 17 km2 within the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone could be considered potential sites for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation species of these about a fifth 8 99 km2 were adjacent to slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations table 1 sites predicted to have salt marshes in the future where currently salt marshes do not exist we found a similar pattern of salt marsh habitat composition in both current and future scenarios table 2 where percentages of regularly flooded salt marsh comprised the highest percent area in both scenarios with slr there is a greater proportion of low salt marsh spatially the slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations were evenly spread throughout the potential extent of the coastal upland buffer zone fig 2 except along the coastline of the john f kennedy international airport and in the western portion of the study area where few sites exist the densest concentration was along the western and northern shorelines of the rockaway peninsula regularly flooded salt marshes comprise the large majority of the slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations the following land parcel categories comprised the majority of the sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion maintained lawns and shrubs 18 54 km2 44 borders of roads and railroads 9 58 km2 23 parks recreational facilities 6 46 km2 15 and open space 6 04 km2 14 table 3 in just the sites adjacent to slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations we found that the parcel categories parks recreational facilities open space and maintained lawns and shrubs were 43 32 and 21 of the possible areas for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion respectively borders of roads and railroads were almost negligible 1 in the sites adjacent to slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations though it should be noted that road and railroad borders provide benefits disproportionate to their area because they can act as corridors through the urban matrix forman et al 2003 spatially average nearest neighbor analysis indicated a high degree of clustering of potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion z score 394 87 p value 0 0001 looking just at the potential sites for this expansion adjacent to predicted future salt marshes fig 5 we saw that the open space parcels were primarily on the islands in the bay or on nearshore areas on the western side of the bay parks recreational facilities were scattered throughout the study area not surprisingly borders of roads and railroads and maintained lawns and shrubs were further inland than many other parcel categories potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion not adjacent to predicted future salt marshes could also support coastal upland vegetation and provide wildlife habitat especially for the more mobile organisms fig 6 many of these sites were maintained lawns and shrubs scattered throughout the study area but there were also some old field pasture and golf course park lawn on the eastern side nassau county and open space and parks recreational facilities on the rockaway peninsula we found several potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation adjacent to existing coastal upland locations these were in parcels of open space and parks recreational facilities within the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone fig 7 much of the existing coastal upland vegetation in the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone 12 58 km2 was concentrated in the western portion of the bay and on the marsh islands projecting into the future given slr induced inland salt marsh migration we would expect to lose 0 28 km2 2 of current coastal upland vegetation area looking at potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion by soil type we saw that in both sandy and loamy sand soils maintained lawns and shrubs was the category that had the most area for local assisted expansion in each soil type 76 and 75 respectively table 3 the bare soil category occupied 14 of the total area for potential local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion in sandy soils the bare soil and parks recreational facilities categories occupied 11 and 10 respectively in loamy sands overall potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were considerably more numerous on sandy soils 1 197 km2 than on loamy sand 0 219 km2 spatially these potential sites were fairly dispersed in sandy soils with the exception of the rockaway peninsula which had few sites compared with the eastern northern and western portions of the study area fig 8 few sites were present in loamy sand but densities were higher at these few sites than were present as compared to densities in sandy soils fig 8 4 discussion we created a gis model to identify slr induced inland salt marsh migration extent and map potential locations appropriate for local assisted coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest expansion given soil type and adjacency to predicted future salt marsh locations our model suggested that with slr a shift would occur in which considerable areas of high salt marsh and some brackish tidal marsh would become more regularly flooded resulting in a slight increase in overall salt marsh area in the region this is supported by a recent study of jamaica bay marsh change analysis in which salt marsh was demonstrated to increase in area in the absence of restoration efforts campbell et al 2017 this is corroborated by the national wetland inventory change analysis which predicted an increase in salt marsh area for the atlantic between 2004 and 2008 dahl and steadman 2011 between 2003 2008 jamaica bay added 6 3 hectares a 1 8 increase campbell et al 2017 of the regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes in our study area in the future one third were predicted to comprise slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations which are new salt marshes where current salt marshes do not exist within the coastal upland area not including the wetland islands in the bay these results are consistent with those from alizad et al 2016 which predicted that under higher slr marsh migration extended its limits salt marshes were forecasted to move to higher land within a band surrounding their study bay in florida in both our study and theirs the area available to inland salt marsh migration was restricted to a band around the bay characterized by the appropriate topographic profile resource managers intent on providing additional area for future salt marsh migration should consider targeted regrading of upslope areas projected to be located near future salt marshes alizad et al 2016 these landformed areas can have high value in maintaining diverse ecological and social functions handel 2015 schuerch et al 2018 and spencer et al 2016 state that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space stralberg et al 2011 suggest actions toward securing accommodation space through conserving adjacent uplands for salt marsh migration redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment rich areas to minimize salt marsh loss our model and results demonstrate that ample opportunities exist for conservation of adjacent coastal uplands since almost 16 of the area within the potential extent of the coastal upland buffer zone could be considered possible sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion even if we reduced scope to just areas adjacent to predicted slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations 3 of the study region was still considered available space parks recreational facilities 43 and open space 32 were the dominant types of areas available for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion adjacent to predicted slr induced inland salt marsh locations this is a promising result as most open space and parks recreational facilities are publicly owned areas which make them more likely to be available for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation enwright et al 2016 these opportunities involve a shift in thinking with regard to land use especially with regard to conversion of open space to assist the inland expansion of coastal upland vegetation meaningful stakeholder participation is a cornerstone of effective restoration planning and implementation bengston et al 2004 an ecosystem services based approach with an emphasis on the many services coastal upland vegetation provides costanza et al 1997 hauser et al 2015 might help to convince a community of the value of conversion of open land to coastal upland vegetation gedan et al 2009 further though hard engineering solutions have been extensively used in the past coastal protection infrastructure is typically expensive to build and maintain jonkman et al 2013 hill 2015 consequently some urban areas may eventually be abandoned in such areas we might expect salt marshes to advance upslope into abandoned yards and parks forming novel wetland urban mosaics enwright et al 2016 maritime forest species plantings in school yards and other publicly owned spaces may be an example of an opportunistic way to assist expansion while being amenable to stakeholders and land owners potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were considerably more common on sandy soils than on loamy soils again this is encouraging since maun 1998 demonstrated that coastal vegetation growth is stimulated by moderate levels of sand due to improved soil resources reactive plant growth and enhanced mycorrhizal activity our result indicates that soil texture amendments may not be necessary on many of the available lands for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion since appropriate levels of sand already exist several limitations associated with the tools and approaches we used deserve mention our model does not take into account the dynamic nature of the coastline or vegetation dynamics as such it may identify locations for coastal upland vegetation expansion that may in actuality be inundated an overestimation or fail to identify locations that are potential sites but which show in the model as being submerged an underestimation that said the locations identified for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were inland and somewhat isolated from the effects of moderate coastline variability the slamm model lacks feedback mechanisms that may come into play as slr accelerates craft et al 2009 increasing inundation of salt marshes may result in conversion to mudflats if extensive and long lasting hartig et al 2002 but may also increase macrophyte production leading to increased vertical accretion in some cases morris et al 2002 accretion has been documented in jamaica bay clarke 2018 hartig et al 2002 though given current stresses in the region even this hypothesized increased vertical accretion is not likely to offset salt marsh losses due to future sea level rise hartig et al 2002 solecki and rosenzweig 2019 losses of salt marsh at the coastal fringe may be offset by salt marshes migrating inland kirwan et al 2017 as outlined in our study further jamaica bay salt marshes have experienced a loss of mineral sediment and an increase in organic sediment significantly enhancing the risk of salt marsh loss with slr by making them structurally weak peteet et al 2018 our approaches do not take these factors into account also slamm ecm and pluto data did not extend to cover nassau county therefore essentially no sites were found in nassau county adjacent to predicted future slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations due to the limited data however nassau county comprised a very small section of the study area 17 2 km2 6 of the buffer despite these caveats our approach provides important insights into methodologies that could be used to identify sites for potential coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest expansion assistance this study of opportunities for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation given projected slr was undertaken to explore a gap in slamm model projections and introduce broader thinking on what constitutes available land for expansion we believe it is important to analyze both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats together as they are naturally adjacent interacting communities that provide valuable ecosystem services restoration plans should take both habitats into account and should attempt to preserve habitat for wildlife species that utilize both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats for survival our model and results will inform land managers of predicted future slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations and possible areas where restoration interventions of coastal upland vegetation coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest may help facilitate and sustain coastal ecological habitats and wildlife we expect that the modeling methodologies presented here can be used to identify potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation in other coastal areas with similar ecological properties given the critical need to address the impacts of rising sea waters we

24717,resilience planning requires an understanding of the potential impact of accelerated sea level rise on the narrow coastal habitats between the sea and the built environment in urban estuaries preliminary work suggests that facilitating expansion of coastal upland vegetation grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest may improve resilience we created a gis model for jamaica bay new york to identify areas of inland salt marsh migration induced by sea level rise and map potential locations for expansion of coastal upland vegetation through plantings of local provenance given land use soil type and adjacency to predicted future salt marshes we predicted that regularly flooded salt marshes low marsh will comprise the large majority of salt marsh area 89 up from 68 currently in the coming century due to daily tides covering areas currently categorized as irregularly flooded salt marsh high marsh brackish marsh and coastal upland vegetation considering land use 16 of the area suitable for coastal upland vegetation within the coastal buffer zone could be considered possible sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion with about a fifth of those areas adjacent to predicted new sea level rise induced inland salt marsh areas parks and recreational facilities 43 and open space 32 were the dominant land uses available for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion adjacent to predicted new sea level rise induced inland salt marsh areas potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were considerably more numerous on sandy soils than on loamy sand soils maintained lawn and shrubs and the borders of roads and railroads provided available space in areas disjunct from the predicted new salt marsh areas our study of opportunities for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation fills a gap within existing models and informs land managers of predicted future inland salt marsh migration locations regions of existing vegetation to support and areas where restoration plantings may help sustain coastal upland vegetative communities and their many ecological services keywords coastal squeeze resilience sealevel rise marsh assisted migration maritime vegetation 1 introduction there is an increased need to better understand the potential impact of sea level rise slr driven by global climate change boon 2012 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 and the subsequent effects on salt marshes and adjacent or upslope coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland

shoreline from erosion safeguarding people and property hopper and meixler 2016 meixler 2017 mitsch et al 2015 however salt marshes are susceptible to inundation and erosion from slr because their vertical accretion rates are limited and they may lose their lower elevation landscapes under water fitzgerald et al 2008 khan et al 2020 research has indicated that we may see increasing rates of inundation along the coast and more rapid loss of coastal wetlands by 2050 solecki and rosenzweig 2019 this projection is underscored by possible increasing rates of summer evapotranspiration and water deficits projected for the mid to late century which lend further evidence that the total extent of wetlands is likely to be reduced wolfe et al 2011 survival of coastal upland vegetation including coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest natural areas conservancy 2014 will depend on a complex mix of variables including extent of slr local geography sediment accretion and potential for inland expansion of coastal upland vegetation while all factors are important and deserve attention research on slr induced inland salt marsh migration presents an opportunity for restoration that is possibly more feasible to plan for than the other factors affecting salt marsh and coastal upland vegetation survival preliminary work suggests that rates of salt marsh migration into adjacent uplands may accelerate with future sealevel rise chen et al 2020 doyle et al 2010 enwright et al 2016 kirwan et al 2016 and that coastal upland vegetation expansion may be facilitated through assisted plant migration chen et al 2020 the capacity for slr induced inland salt marsh migration is an important component of resiliency for coastal ecosystems schuerch et al 2018 by securing and expanding coastal natural resources spalding et al 2014 providing habitat of great value to wildlife dowhan et al 1997 and maintaining ecosystem services meixler 2017 mitsch et al 2015 this is especially true for urban areas which may harbor significant biodiversity resources aronson et al 2014 that can buffer and support the ecological functioning of urban coastal ecosystems and which must be perceived as part of the solution to the negative effects of slr coastal vegetation along urbanized shorelines is especially important because these limited ecosystems serve large human populations within the united states since 1960 54 of the nation s population has lived within the coastal zone tibbetts 2002 and that percentage is expected to increase in the coming decades neumann et al 2015 the pressures of urban advancement and slr have created coastal squeeze a loss of coastal habitats where the high water mark is fixed by a hard structure pavement and buildings while the low water mark migrates landwards in response to slr doody 2004 schleupner 2008 many coastal zones currently experience coastal squeeze and this compression is expected to be exacerbated as sea level rises fig 1 residential and commercial land uses may ultimately limit the possible expansion of salt marsh and coastal upland vegetation unless urban planning conserves existing land or considers potential sites for assisted plantings plant species of fringing salt marshes coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest that can move to higher ground as sea level rises will continue to serve the wildlife community dowhan et al 1997 and will provide ecological services to the nearby residential zones such as buffering from storms and erosion protection costanza et al 2006 feagin et al 2010 zinnert et al 2016 local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion through plantings of local provenance in this zone of coastal squeeze would optimize use of permeable surfaces in the built environment and would help considerably in securing the health of coastal uplands both now and as sea level rises in addition coastal upland vegetation expansion through plantings of local provenance extends the inland edge of the coastal zone so that instead of stopping at the first anthropogenic structure e g road it moves into the built environment integrating the built environment and the natural environment and making the barrier more permeable critical steps for the near future in urban coastal regions involve identifying all possible potential expansion pathways and the most effective methods to assist with expansion and support coastal upland vegetation experiencing coastal squeeze now and in the future knowledge of expansion pathways preparation of inland open space and healthy source populations of propagules are needed to enhance this type of resiliency in a recent study of the fringing habitat near canarsie pier brooklyn new york handel and kaunzinger 2016 found that small pockets of natural coastal vegetation are often present these could become the nuclei from which more diverse and functioning habitats can spread given appropriate management such as removal of invasive competitors planting of extirpated species or soil ph and texture amelioration land managers can also facilitate new habitat patches by initiating nucleating centers of vegetation which can spread by seed dispersal handel 2013 ste marie et al 2011 or clonal growth harper 1977 hutchings and bradbury 1986 unlike south north assisted plant migration these local patches are unlikely to introduce substantially different genetic material further coastal upland vegetation could be used as landscaping material in parks recreation areas and publicly owned spaces dispersal from these locations may spread coastal upland vegetation into natural areas much like horticultural species have spread into natural areas through residential landscape plantings to this end the new york city department of parks and recreation the natural areas conservancy and the nature conservancy have completed a sophisticated analysis of tidal salt marsh migration opportunities in new york city based on model projections and current land use sea level affecting marshes model slamm clough et al 2010 slamm is a two dimensional model in which long term shoreline and habitat changes are predicted as a function of elevation tide range and slr slamm 2016 current slamm model projections don t consider coastal upland vegetation coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest expansion potential in addition to salt marshes similarly the literature has largely addressed only the potential for slr induced inland salt marsh migration not coastal upland vegetation expansion which also contributes to protection from flooding and erosion craft et al 2009 it is important to analyze both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats together as they are naturally adjacent communities treating them as separate entities and restoring under different plans can result in the loss of habitat provision for many wildlife species especially those that require both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats for survival thorne et al 2012 nordenson et al 2018 our study investigates this gap in the slamm model projections and introduces broader thinking on what constitutes available land for expansion areas where natural vegetation expansion may be possible include many public and private lands that could support coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest species with appropriate assistance including mowed lawns municipal or private sector space that is not assigned to active use residential commercial parcels whose landscaping can be improved for higher ecological services by improved species palettes and more fig 1 we created a geographic information system gis model to identify slr induced inland salt marsh migration within the zone from saltwater marshland to the coastal upland vegetation border and map potential locations appropriate for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion given soil type and adjacency to predicted future salt marsh locations our study of opportunities for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion given projected slr will inform land managers of the most vulnerable coastal habitats where fringing plant communities will be lost possible habitats for the future and locations where restoration may be most successful this new york city study is widely applicable to other urban coastal areas 2 methods 2 1 study site jamaica bay new york fig 2 situated on the southwestern shore of long island and bordered by kings and queens counties and a small portion of nassau county has a rich diversity of bird and fish species and the largest wetland complex in the new york city area mcphearson et al 2013 the bay encompasses coastal urban wilds of enormous value provides extensive ecological services and high recreational opportunities trust for public land and new york city audubon 1987 1993 in fact some of the islands within jamaica bay have been designated as the jamaica bay national wildlife refuge which is part of the gateway national recreation area the only wildlife refuge managed by the national park service despite these positive attributes jamaica bay has changed enormously under human influence since european settlement in fact the recent natural history of jamaica bay is one of extensive anthropogenic modification through dredging of channels and filling of salt marshes black 1992 gornitz et al 2001 three quarters of the wetlands in the bay have been lost englebright 1975 hartig et al 2002 and salt marshes and open water were filled for development the landscape that fringes the bay has changed from natural coastal saltwater marshlands bordered by salt shrub and maritime forest into a dense urban matrix that supports over 800 000 people in the communities adjacent to the bay mcphearson et al 2013 hardened shorelines boger et al 2012 changes in tidal patterns due to dredging swanson and wilson 2008 and slr hartig et al 2002 have resulted in significant salt marsh fragmentation and loss kolker 2005 and these factors pose the most substantial threats currently facing jamaica bay mcphearson et al 2013 jamaica bay is considered a priority study area for addressing salt marsh losses and migration mcphearson et al 2013 new york city parks 2016 so we can better learn how coastal urban complexes respond to new ecological stresses sanderson et al 2016 2 2 modeling our goal was to analyze current fringing habitats and to identify opportunities for coastal upland vegetation expansion by locating sites within jamaica bay that have potential to support plantings of local provenance within defined coastal upland zones conceptual diagram shown in fig 3a gis workflow in fig 3b the zone of opportunity for coastal upland vegetation expansion runs from the upper slamm border of saltwater marshland to the potential upland vegetation maritime border fig 4 this is the critical zone of interest as this land is available now for colonization and coastal upland vegetation expansion we first calculated in arcgis 10 6 1 esri 2015 the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone by identifying on staten island new york the furthest location in which coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest exists in the ecological covertype map ecm 2014 natural areas conservancy 2014 which has a spatial resolution of 0 28 m x 0 28 m figs 3a and 3b step 1 the ecm is an urban ecological land cover map for new york city containing 37 unique classes ranging from natural to anthropogenic o neil dunne 2014 we used nearby staten island as a reference ecosystem for this analysis even though our study area is jamaica bay because it is less developed and potentially more representative of a natural coastal plant community with a vegetation gradient from salt marsh to coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest largely unimpeded by anthropogenic activities given its close proximity similar topography modest and gradual elevation rise and analogous ecoregional conditions with jamaica bay staten island shares many of the same properties that define the extent of the coastal upland zone and help to show how far inland the coastal upland zone would extend under similar more natural conditions we used the present day inland extent of the coastal upland vegetation coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest on staten island as an estimate of how far inland coastal upland vegetation can survive and provide resiliency ecological benefits in jamaica bay today in other words we measured the maximum inland range of coastal upland vegetation in staten island as a surrogate for the width of the coastal buffer zone 1332 18 m in nearby jamaica bay this buffer constituted the area in which local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation is most advantageous to coastal wildlife and ecological resilience and where it is likely to grow the elevation change at this reference site from coast inland through the maritime vegetation is similar to the grade at jamaica bay within the buffer zone new york county 2020 fixed width buffer zones are in widespread use along the east coast of the united states as they have the advantage of being easy to implement desbonnet et al 1995 use of vegetation at our reference site to determine the potential coastal buffer zone depth at jamaica bay has the further advantage of integrating the several proximate forces physical and biotic that determine the gradient of plant biodiversity change coastal upland vegetation such as coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest are known to be a zoned mosaic vegetation pattern martin 1959 that does not always have abrupt boundaries among habitat types forces such as salt spray groundwater depth salinity flooding frequency disturbance soil quality and human land use patterns together influence coastal vegetation change ehrenfeld 1990 hayden et al 1995 these are influenced by elevation in part but the intensity of any one of these forces is idiosyncratic at any one location the vegetation pattern such as at our reference site on staten island is a product of a long term interplay of these biotic and physical forces and is a more accurate multifactor predictor of buffer zone depth than elevation alone we used a sea level affecting marshes model slamm 2016 projection for the year 2085 under a scenario of 1 327 m slr by 2100 minimum rapid ice melt rim min to eventually determine potential areas for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation slamm data have a spatial resolution of 5 m x 5 m but only cover kings and queens counties not nassau county we used the projection for the year 2085 under a scenario of 1 327 m slr by 2100 to correlate with other research being done in the area using the same future projection haight et al 2019 and to reflect intermediate levels of predicted slr for the new york city region based on the most current research gornitz et al 2019 we first determined the locations considered potential future salt marsh features in slamm these included the categories regularly flooded salt marsh low salt marsh and irregularly flooded salt marsh high salt marsh then we determined the locations of current salt marsh features from the slamm data projections for 1 327 m slr by 2100 rim min for the year 2008 using the same two salt marsh categories regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes we overlaid current and future salt marshes and then spatially isolated locations where salt marsh features exist in the future but not the present figs 3a and 3b step 2 these locations represent areas where salt marsh could migrate based on the inland salt marsh extent projected in the slamm model analysis aka the slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations note that slamm data do not extend into nassau county so no future salt marsh locations were present in that region of the bay then we created a buffer from the coastline under our projected slr to the potential extent of the coastal upland zone 1332 18 m determined previously using the furthest extent of coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest on staten island figs 3a and 3b step 3 we removed from our selected set of slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations any features outside of the buffer zone figs 3a and 3b step 4 next we obtained new york city land use data from the primary land use tax lot output pluto files provided by the nyc department of city planning nyc dcp 2015 these files contain detailed information about land use and zoning of parcels for kings and queens counties we selected parcels from the pluto map within the buffer zone with the potential to assist in the expansion of coastal upland vegetation figs 3a and 3b step 5 these include the following types public parking areas easements parks recreational facilities beaches city owned vacant lots and open space we also included ball fields golf courses playgrounds and cemeteries from the pluto data within the buffer zone but for these sites we clipped for our use a three meter buffer inside the border of each parcel instead of using the entire area given the expectation that only the borders of these highly used open spaces would be available to coastal upland vegetation we also selected bare soil and maintained lawns and shrubs including those in residential areas from the ecm data within the buffer zone in kings and queens counties in nassau county we extracted old fields pastures golf courses parks lawns barren lands and sand flats from new york gap analysis land use land cover data smith et al 2001 finally we buffered the 2016 roads railroads tiger line file data united states census bureau 2016 for all three counties by three meters on either side together these selected parcels and border spaces represent locations for potential local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation within the buffer zone finally we removed from our set of selected parcels and border spaces any locations that were already one of the following coastal upland vegetation freshwater marsh saltwater marsh buildings or pavement or predicted future salt marsh figs 3a and 3b step 6 we overlaid our remaining parcels and border spaces onto the map of slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations to create a map of available parcels for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation we then subselected parcels that were adjacent to future salt marsh locations and saved these as a separate map for later use figs 3a and 3b step 7 these locations will likely provide certain benefits in the process of slr induced inland salt marsh migration with respect to genetic diversity and biodiversity of non planted species we also subselected parcels adjacent to the full suite of existing coastal upland vegetation locations within the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone figs 3a and 3b step 7 these included the following vegetation classifications in the ecm eastern coastal beach group northern central sand barrens group northern atlantic dune coastal grasslands shrublands group and maritime shrubland and successional maritime forest o neil dunne et al 2014 we obtained soil information from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo 2016 provided by the natural resource conservation service nrcs of the united states department of agriculture usda research has shown that coastal vegetation growth is stimulated by moderate levels of sand due to improved soil resources reactive plant growth and enhanced mycorrhizal activity maun 1998 using the ssurgo map we identified soils in our study area classified as sand 85 sand and loamy sand 70 85 sand we overlaid our map of sandy soils on our selected parcels representing locations for potential local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation to identify which locations are likely to support coastal upland vegetation with and without soil amendment figs 3a and 3b step 8 coastal upland vegetation restoration potential varies based on the need for soil amendments to promote growth and establishment of native plantings parkinson et al 2018 in areas classified as sand little to no soil amendment would be necessary loamy sands would need soil amendments to aid in coastal plant competitive advantage this could be accomplished through restructuring of existing soil by adding sand and possibly removing existing urban soils to create coastal habitat for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion we also overlaid on our map of selected parcels our map of parcels adjacent to future salt marsh locations to assist in the prioritization of restoration activities together this constituted our maps of potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation given soils and future salt marsh adjacency 2 3 analysis we determined from our map of potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation the total area in sq km of current coastal upland vegetation predicted future salt marsh and the total area of potential slr induced inland salt marsh migration predicted future salt marsh current salt marsh predicted from the slamm models we then tabulated areas for current and predicted future salt marsh by marsh type and calculated areas of potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion by land use type given soil types and adjacency to predicted future salt marsh locations we used average nearest neighbor analysis in arcgis version 10 6 1 to determine if clustering exists for potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion 3 results we found that within our study area present day regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes comprised 6 32 km2 about 2 of the area within the extent of the coastal buffer zone table 1 by comparison predicted future regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes were expected to comprise 7 47 km2 when we spatially isolated regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes that exist in the future but not in the present we found that 2 51 km2 of new area would likely comprise our slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations table 1 approximately 16 of the area 42 17 km2 within the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone could be considered potential sites for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation species of these about a fifth 8 99 km2 were adjacent to slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations table 1 sites predicted to have salt marshes in the future where currently salt marshes do not exist we found a similar pattern of salt marsh habitat composition in both current and future scenarios table 2 where percentages of regularly flooded salt marsh comprised the highest percent area in both scenarios with slr there is a greater proportion of low salt marsh spatially the slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations were evenly spread throughout the potential extent of the coastal upland buffer zone fig 2 except along the coastline of the john f kennedy international airport and in the western portion of the study area where few sites exist the densest concentration was along the western and northern shorelines of the rockaway peninsula regularly flooded salt marshes comprise the large majority of the slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations the following land parcel categories comprised the majority of the sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion maintained lawns and shrubs 18 54 km2 44 borders of roads and railroads 9 58 km2 23 parks recreational facilities 6 46 km2 15 and open space 6 04 km2 14 table 3 in just the sites adjacent to slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations we found that the parcel categories parks recreational facilities open space and maintained lawns and shrubs were 43 32 and 21 of the possible areas for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion respectively borders of roads and railroads were almost negligible 1 in the sites adjacent to slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations though it should be noted that road and railroad borders provide benefits disproportionate to their area because they can act as corridors through the urban matrix forman et al 2003 spatially average nearest neighbor analysis indicated a high degree of clustering of potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion z score 394 87 p value 0 0001 looking just at the potential sites for this expansion adjacent to predicted future salt marshes fig 5 we saw that the open space parcels were primarily on the islands in the bay or on nearshore areas on the western side of the bay parks recreational facilities were scattered throughout the study area not surprisingly borders of roads and railroads and maintained lawns and shrubs were further inland than many other parcel categories potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion not adjacent to predicted future salt marshes could also support coastal upland vegetation and provide wildlife habitat especially for the more mobile organisms fig 6 many of these sites were maintained lawns and shrubs scattered throughout the study area but there were also some old field pasture and golf course park lawn on the eastern side nassau county and open space and parks recreational facilities on the rockaway peninsula we found several potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation adjacent to existing coastal upland locations these were in parcels of open space and parks recreational facilities within the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone fig 7 much of the existing coastal upland vegetation in the potential extent of the coastal buffer zone 12 58 km2 was concentrated in the western portion of the bay and on the marsh islands projecting into the future given slr induced inland salt marsh migration we would expect to lose 0 28 km2 2 of current coastal upland vegetation area looking at potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion by soil type we saw that in both sandy and loamy sand soils maintained lawns and shrubs was the category that had the most area for local assisted expansion in each soil type 76 and 75 respectively table 3 the bare soil category occupied 14 of the total area for potential local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion in sandy soils the bare soil and parks recreational facilities categories occupied 11 and 10 respectively in loamy sands overall potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were considerably more numerous on sandy soils 1 197 km2 than on loamy sand 0 219 km2 spatially these potential sites were fairly dispersed in sandy soils with the exception of the rockaway peninsula which had few sites compared with the eastern northern and western portions of the study area fig 8 few sites were present in loamy sand but densities were higher at these few sites than were present as compared to densities in sandy soils fig 8 4 discussion we created a gis model to identify slr induced inland salt marsh migration extent and map potential locations appropriate for local assisted coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest expansion given soil type and adjacency to predicted future salt marsh locations our model suggested that with slr a shift would occur in which considerable areas of high salt marsh and some brackish tidal marsh would become more regularly flooded resulting in a slight increase in overall salt marsh area in the region this is supported by a recent study of jamaica bay marsh change analysis in which salt marsh was demonstrated to increase in area in the absence of restoration efforts campbell et al 2017 this is corroborated by the national wetland inventory change analysis which predicted an increase in salt marsh area for the atlantic between 2004 and 2008 dahl and steadman 2011 between 2003 2008 jamaica bay added 6 3 hectares a 1 8 increase campbell et al 2017 of the regularly and irregularly flooded salt marshes in our study area in the future one third were predicted to comprise slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations which are new salt marshes where current salt marshes do not exist within the coastal upland area not including the wetland islands in the bay these results are consistent with those from alizad et al 2016 which predicted that under higher slr marsh migration extended its limits salt marshes were forecasted to move to higher land within a band surrounding their study bay in florida in both our study and theirs the area available to inland salt marsh migration was restricted to a band around the bay characterized by the appropriate topographic profile resource managers intent on providing additional area for future salt marsh migration should consider targeted regrading of upslope areas projected to be located near future salt marshes alizad et al 2016 these landformed areas can have high value in maintaining diverse ecological and social functions handel 2015 schuerch et al 2018 and spencer et al 2016 state that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space stralberg et al 2011 suggest actions toward securing accommodation space through conserving adjacent uplands for salt marsh migration redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment rich areas to minimize salt marsh loss our model and results demonstrate that ample opportunities exist for conservation of adjacent coastal uplands since almost 16 of the area within the potential extent of the coastal upland buffer zone could be considered possible sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion even if we reduced scope to just areas adjacent to predicted slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations 3 of the study region was still considered available space parks recreational facilities 43 and open space 32 were the dominant types of areas available for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion adjacent to predicted slr induced inland salt marsh locations this is a promising result as most open space and parks recreational facilities are publicly owned areas which make them more likely to be available for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation enwright et al 2016 these opportunities involve a shift in thinking with regard to land use especially with regard to conversion of open space to assist the inland expansion of coastal upland vegetation meaningful stakeholder participation is a cornerstone of effective restoration planning and implementation bengston et al 2004 an ecosystem services based approach with an emphasis on the many services coastal upland vegetation provides costanza et al 1997 hauser et al 2015 might help to convince a community of the value of conversion of open land to coastal upland vegetation gedan et al 2009 further though hard engineering solutions have been extensively used in the past coastal protection infrastructure is typically expensive to build and maintain jonkman et al 2013 hill 2015 consequently some urban areas may eventually be abandoned in such areas we might expect salt marshes to advance upslope into abandoned yards and parks forming novel wetland urban mosaics enwright et al 2016 maritime forest species plantings in school yards and other publicly owned spaces may be an example of an opportunistic way to assist expansion while being amenable to stakeholders and land owners potential sites for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were considerably more common on sandy soils than on loamy soils again this is encouraging since maun 1998 demonstrated that coastal vegetation growth is stimulated by moderate levels of sand due to improved soil resources reactive plant growth and enhanced mycorrhizal activity our result indicates that soil texture amendments may not be necessary on many of the available lands for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion since appropriate levels of sand already exist several limitations associated with the tools and approaches we used deserve mention our model does not take into account the dynamic nature of the coastline or vegetation dynamics as such it may identify locations for coastal upland vegetation expansion that may in actuality be inundated an overestimation or fail to identify locations that are potential sites but which show in the model as being submerged an underestimation that said the locations identified for local assisted coastal upland vegetation expansion were inland and somewhat isolated from the effects of moderate coastline variability the slamm model lacks feedback mechanisms that may come into play as slr accelerates craft et al 2009 increasing inundation of salt marshes may result in conversion to mudflats if extensive and long lasting hartig et al 2002 but may also increase macrophyte production leading to increased vertical accretion in some cases morris et al 2002 accretion has been documented in jamaica bay clarke 2018 hartig et al 2002 though given current stresses in the region even this hypothesized increased vertical accretion is not likely to offset salt marsh losses due to future sea level rise hartig et al 2002 solecki and rosenzweig 2019 losses of salt marsh at the coastal fringe may be offset by salt marshes migrating inland kirwan et al 2017 as outlined in our study further jamaica bay salt marshes have experienced a loss of mineral sediment and an increase in organic sediment significantly enhancing the risk of salt marsh loss with slr by making them structurally weak peteet et al 2018 our approaches do not take these factors into account also slamm ecm and pluto data did not extend to cover nassau county therefore essentially no sites were found in nassau county adjacent to predicted future slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations due to the limited data however nassau county comprised a very small section of the study area 17 2 km2 6 of the buffer despite these caveats our approach provides important insights into methodologies that could be used to identify sites for potential coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest expansion assistance this study of opportunities for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation given projected slr was undertaken to explore a gap in slamm model projections and introduce broader thinking on what constitutes available land for expansion we believe it is important to analyze both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats together as they are naturally adjacent interacting communities that provide valuable ecosystem services restoration plans should take both habitats into account and should attempt to preserve habitat for wildlife species that utilize both salt marsh and coastal upland habitats for survival our model and results will inform land managers of predicted future slr induced inland salt marsh migration locations and possible areas where restoration interventions of coastal upland vegetation coastal grasslands and maritime shrubland successional maritime forest may help facilitate and sustain coastal ecological habitats and wildlife we expect that the modeling methodologies presented here can be used to identify potential locations for local assisted expansion of coastal upland vegetation in other coastal areas with similar ecological properties given the critical need to address the impacts of rising sea waters we envision a new coastal living landscape which will include open spaces as targets for new fringing vegetation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

24718,a complex network model for the spread of dutch elm disease in an urban forest is formulated american elms are the focus of the model each elm can be in one of five states a combination of their life and epidemiological status each tree is also potentially a host to a population of elm bark beetles the vectors of dutch elm disease the epidemiological dynamics of trees is governed by a stochastic process that takes into account the dispersal of spore carrying beetles between trees and potential contacts between tree root systems the model describes seasonal variations of beetle activity and population dynamics numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses of the model are carried out in this introductory paper we use data from the city of winnipeg where dutch elm disease is prevalent and focus on two neighbourhoods representative of a residential area and an area with urban parks keywords network epidemic model plant pathogens hybrid model multi scale model 1 introduction urban forestry is a specialized branch of forestry that involves the cultivation and management of trees in urban urban interface areas and greenspaces for the physiological sociological and economic well being of urban society harris et al 1999 jorgensen 1974 miller et al 2015 the presence of trees in urban landscapes provides benefits by mitigating some of the negative impacts of urban development such as increased heating energy and carbon dioxide levels diminished air quality or loss of rain water dwyer et al 1992 grote et al 2016 livesley et al 2016 elm trees ulmus spp have traditionally been planted widely in urban forests in north america due to increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions fast rates of growth and high survival as seedlings and juveniles rioux 2003 american elm ulmus americana l has been planted extensively in many north american cities as a park and boulevard tree due to its dense canopy and vase shaped form which provides efficient shading in summer and its ability to tolerate cold winters and hot dry summers these traits have made american elm the tree of choice for planting for many decades in urban environments however urban trees are subject to many environmental stressors that includes attack by insects and diseases north american elm species are highly susceptible to dutch elm disease ded an ascomycete fungal wilt disease caused by three species in the genus ophiostoma in northern north america the primary fungal strain is ophiostoma novo ulmi brasier which is spread mostly by the native elm bark beetle nebb hylurgopinus rufipes eichoff pines and westwood 2008 once the fungus is introduced into the tree it spreads through the cells of the phloem and xylem which inhibits water and nutrient transport hiratsuka et al 1987 american elm is the most susceptible north american elm species and infections are almost always fatal with death usually occurring over a period of weeks to months hildahl and jeffrey 1980 hubbes 1988 hubbes and jeng 1981 stipes and campana 1981 ded reached eastern north america in the late 1920 s from europe and the west coast of north america oregon by 1973 and in the 50 years after its introduction the disease is estimated to have killed 50 to 100 million elms soll 2016 the disease eliminated american elm as a major component in the urban forests of many cities in eastern north america as well causing extensive mortality in natural stands of american elm sinclair and campana 1978 world wide many bark beetle species are able to transmit ophiostoma spores to elm with nebb being the primary vector in the northern north america swedenborg et al 1988 bark beetles such as nebb are an important symbiotic partner of these fungi and the primary vector of the disease among elms webber et al 1984 adult nebb s mate and feed in twig crotches in the tree canopy during the spring after mating female beetles construct brood galleries within the cambium laying eggs in the galleries brood galleries are formed in the larger diameter canopy branches and sometimes the upper trunk at the beginning of the infection kaston 1939 lanier et al 1982 pines and westwood 1996 swedenborg et al 1988 thompson and matthysse 1972 whitten 1964 the larvae then feed and develop in the galleries eventually pupating within individual chambers hiratsuka et al 1987 later in the summer and in fall newly emerged adults usually move to new trees to feed if the previously colonised tree was infected with o novo ulmi nebb will mechanically carry fungal spores upon emergence from brood galleries kondo et al 1981 in the late fall the newly emerged adults will move to the base of a healthy tree or occasionally a still living infected tree to overwinter anderson and holliday 2003 strobel and lanier 1981 overwintering beetles burrow into the bark at a height generally below the snow line and overwinter below the phloem after emerging from their overwintering diapause state in spring at the tree base adults carrying ophiostoma spores will move into the canopy of healthy trees to feed and mate and begin forming brood galleries it is during this period that inoculum can be introduced into the xylem of healthy elms gardiner 1981 a second infection route for ded may occur via interconnected root systems in areas of higher tree density brasier and gibbs 1978 in urban environments where boulevard elms may be planted close together root infections can quickly spread within streets causing further mortality to elms within neighbourhoods in urban forests the disease may cost millions per year to keep the incidence economically manageable by spreading losses over a longer time period westwood 1991 dutch elm disease reached manitoba in 1975 and in response a large scale integrated pest management program ipm was developed to manage the disease westwood 1991 control of dutch elm disease is an expensive process due to the complex relationship between pathogen host and vector and its ipm program is based on reducing the probability of occurrence of new disease infections dreistadt et al 1990 gibbs 1978 westwood 1991 integrated control programs include sanitation which involves the elimination of vector populations through insecticides and removal of elm wood that could provide potential habitat westwood 1991 other control methods include severing root grafts between adjacent trees to prevent fungal spread chemical injections of fungicides to increase tree fitness and increased propagation of resistant elm species one missing aspect of ded control which requires more attention is improving disease management and reducing disease incidence through a better understanding of how ded spreads within urban forests studies that have focused on the spread of the disease are few and mainly occurred in the united kingdom harwood et al 2011 sarre 1978 swinton and gilligan 1999 1996 2000 winnipeg manitoba is located adjacent to the temperate shrublands and grasslands biome found over much of the southern portion of the prairie provinces in canada winnipeg contains a large urban forest of over 8 million trees including the largest remaining urban elm canopy in north america barwinsky 2016 city of winnipeg 2018 2019 the impact of ded in north america has been catastrophic in ecological and economical terms through the loss of tree diversity in urban forests and natural forest stands hubbes 1999 oghiakhe 2014 pines and westwood 2008 rioux 2003 slowing the spread and incidence of the disease in urban forests is of major interest in order to save the remaining elm trees still present in cities of north america we propose a model to represent the mechanism of spread in a large urban forest by focusing on both infection modes the pathogen and its dynamics are not explicitly modelled only tree and vector dynamics are described we consider a network model where vertices are the elms dispersal of beetles between elm trees defines the first network used in this study the second network is defined by considering the connectivity between tree root systems beetle dynamics are represented by a stochastic matrix population model a second stochastic process governs the life and infection dynamics of elm trees the resulting model is complex and mathematically intractable in order to study its behaviour in this preliminary study we perform computational and sensitivity analyses focusing on the case of two urban forests in neighbourhoods in the city of winnipeg 2 material and methods 2 1 modelling in order to model the spread of ded in american elms which dominate the urban forest in various winnipeg neighbourhoods we consider the spread via beetle vectors and the root systems of elm trees fig 1 each tree is characterised by its health and epidemiological conditions the population of beetles on each tree is also tracked dispersal of beetles between trees and interactions between root systems of different trees are modelled using two networks the trees are the vertices of networks the presence of an edge indicates that beetles could move between two trees or that the root systems are connected the model is formulated in discrete time two time steps are used to depict the spread of the disease and the beetle dynamics the time step required to update the life and epidemiological status of the trees is denoted δt and represents one year in our simulations the beetle lifespan in manitoba is reported as one year in duration anderson 1996 we denote δt the time step at which beetles grow and move one week in the model 2 1 1 urban forest system the spatial setting of the model is the population of american elm trees found in winnipeg s urban forest elms are considered habitats for the beetles and can be represented as heterogeneous in age size environment etc inventory data for american elm trees on public owned land was obtained from the city of winnipeg open data portal https data winnipeg ca the dataset contains the locations coordinates of about 300 000 trees on public property in the city including at the time of writing approximately 60 000 american elms the location and diameter at breast height is available for each tree in this work the set of elms is denoted t we refer to a given tree in the set as t t or using some index k 1 t where the cardinality t is the total number of american elms for a given tree t t we denote bh t its diameter at breast height 2 1 2 beetle dispersal network beetles disperse between trees when they seek food a location to lay their eggs or an overwintering site in order to keep the model computationally tractable we create a network n b establishing for each tree what other trees are close enough that they can be targets of beetle movement to do this we consider the distances between each pair of trees in the database if t t t are two trees then there is an edge between t and t in n b if d t t r b where d t t is the euclidean distance between t and t and the parameter rb is the maximum beetle dispersal distance weighting the beetle dispersal network the network n b lists the trees that a beetle can fly to if they are in a given tree t t denote d b t the set of trees that are directly connected to t trees in the blue region in fig 1 i e its neighbours within n b when a beetle undertakes movement between trees it is possible that it does not survive the trip this is used later in the dynamical model the probability of surviving dispersal is used as the weight of edges in n b and is defined for t t as for all t d b t 1 p d t t exp d t t r b 2 1 3 root network a different network n r is used to describe the potential connections between root systems of nearby trees the edges of this network are weighted to indicate uncertainty in the extent of root systems the extent of the root system of a given tree is approximated from its diameter at breast height dbh if t t is a tree and bh t is its dbh we assume that the maximal extent of the root system of t is 3h t where h t is the height of t obtained from bh t by a 1 see details in appendix a let t t t be two trees then there is an edge between t and t in n r if 2 d t t 3 h t h t i e if the root systems of t and t are in contact pruning the root network removing roads and rivers root systems are greatly disrupted by the way roads are created to the point that two trees separated by a cement road cannot have their root systems be in contact personal communication of city of winnipeg urban forestry branch as a consequence pruning of n r is carried out as follows for each edge t i t j n r we instantiate the line segment titj as an sf object in r using the r library openstreetmap we download the coordinates of all roads in winnipeg and then remove from n r all edges that are such that the line segment joining them intersects a road the same procedure is used to remove edges between trees separated by one of the rivers that flow through the city of winnipeg the pruned network still denoted n r and called root network then has edges between any pair of trees whose root systems come into contact and that are not separated by a road or a river brown network in fig 1 weighting the root network we assume that when the root networks of two trees are in contact and one of the trees is infected the infection can be transmitted to the other tree to model this root driven infection we add weights to the root network n r these weights represent the probability of infection by roots they take into account the distance between trees and use a parameter pr 0 1 accounting for uncertainty in the extent of roots systems let t t t be two trees the weight of the edge between t and t is given by 3 p r t t p r if d t t h t h t 3 h t h t d t t 2 h t h t p r otherwise recall that there is no edge in n r between t and t if 2 is not satisfied in the remainder of the paper n r refers to this weighted network as for the beetle network n b we define the root neighbourhood of tree t t as the set d r t of trees that are directly connected to t in n r the parameter pr is the maximum probability of infection via roots assessing topology of the root network some properties of networks are relevant for the propagation of the disease shirley and rushton 2005 to assess topological differences between different types of neighbourhoods some properties of the root networks are investigated we used the package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 in the r environment here we consider degree strength connected component distance eccentricity betweenness and density of the root network see details in appendix b 2 1 4 elm dynamics hypotheses each tree t t can be in one of two epidemiological states and one of three life stages susceptible s or infected i and healthy h stressed w or dead d the state w aggregates stressed trees and trees with excessive amounts of dead canopy wood it is assumed that a tree cannot be infected and healthy so elms can be in five states healthy susceptible sh stressed susceptible sw dead susceptible sd stressed infected iw and dead infected id the natural life cycle of trees in the absence of infection is to remain many years in sh then switch to sw and finally die when they switch to sd transitions between epidemiological states depend on the cumulative number of spore carrying beetles that have travelled to a tree during a one year period infection via beetles and the distance that separates the tree from other infected and dead trees infection via roots mathematical representation for each tree transitions between states are governed by a discrete time markovian process on the state space s s h s w i w s d i d combining tree ageing and beetle or root driven infections the flow diagram in fig 2 gives transitions between states for a tree t t for beetle driven infection the cumulative number bt t of spore carrying beetles that have travelled to tree t during t t δ t is given by 5 for root driven infection the set d i d r t represents dead infected trees id that are in d r t at t δ t ageing and beetle driven infection or root driven infection are two independent processes however they impact the transition probabilities simultaneously a selection process combining the outcomes of those independent stochastic processes is used to determine the future state of the tree details are given in appendix c at time t the outcome of stochastic process is a vector z t z t t 1 z t t 2 z t t t representing states of all trees of t with z t t i s the update of tree states occurs during the week 21 of the year middle of may which is assumed to be the end of winter in winnipeg parameters used in the tree dynamics are listed in table c 3 2 1 5 beetle dynamics hypotheses in order to maintain computational tractability our model for beetle dynamics focuses on the trees that insects are colonising and the season rather than on the physiological states of beetles in the absence of ded five stages for beetles are considered juvenile j the juvenile stage j is the aggregation of the biological stages eggs larvae and pupae individuals j develop in live trees in summer and fall dispersing f newly emerged dispersing adults move in fall to the canopy of adjacent live trees to feed callow adults c callow adults c are adults feeding on canopy of live trees in fall then entering winter diapause in the trunks of healthy trees and in spring leaving emerging from tree trunks to their canopy dispersing m dispersing individuals that move in summer from overwintering sites healthy or weak trees to colonise new trees for laying eggs adults a adults a are mature adults that lay eggs during summer resulting in the next generation of juveniles after laying eggs adults die the simplified life cycle of beetles considered in the present study is shown in fig 3 season lengths ought to vary as a function of the temperature however in this preliminary model we caricature a typical year in winnipeg using data shown in fig d 14 the seasons and corresponding beetle behaviour are as follows winter overwinter callow adults overwinter in healthy trees if beetles do not reside on a healthy tree or if they are at any other stage of their life they die when winter starts winter lasts from week 45 one year to week 21 the next spring emergence callow adults go to feed at the canopy of trees in which they overwintered they mature to dispersing individuals m spring lasts one week week 22 summer breeding at the beginning of summer callow adults that are still alive become dispersing individuals m dispersing m fly to colonise new trees once they arrive dispersing individuals become mature adults a eggs are laid in branches or upper trunks of trees resulting in the new generation of juveniles j it is assumed that beetles are univoltine adult females lay on average 60 eggs kaston 1939 and then die new juveniles stay in this stage until the end of summer summer lasts from week 23 to week 38 fall new generation of beetle the new generation of beetles j can now start emerging as dispersing individuals f which leave trees to seek food in healthy or weak trees once they have arrived in appropriate trees dispersing individuals become callow adults c and begin feeding on the tree canopy they stay there and prepare themselves for winter this period lasts from week 39 to 44 after this period the cycle starts again it is assumed that the presence of disease does not affect the beetle life cycle however in the presence of ded individuals can become spore carrier only by growing as a juvenile in an infected stressed or dead tree if the tree is infected and dead then the juvenile carries spores whereas if the tree is infected and stressed then the beetle has a chance to not become spore carrier it is assumed that an individual becoming a spore carrier as juvenile remains a spore carrier all its life we denote jp fp cp mp and ap the corresponding stages to indicate that individuals are spore carrying it is assumed that of the spore carrying states only individuals in fp can infect trees when they arrive to feed on the canopy mathematical representation the flow diagram for beetle dynamics is shown in fig 4 its dependence on periods and tree states are detailed in fig d 15 beetle dispersal and growth are represented by a stage structured matrix model caswell 2001 the time step for the beetle dynamics is δt in our simulations δt is chosen as the minimum time of sojourn in stages which is one week as is customary in structured population models only female beetles are considered in the model a constant sex ratio is assumed caswell 2001 the evolution of the beetle population is governed by the following equation 4 π t δ t s δ t s t z t β t z t p d t z t π t where π π t 1 π t t with for a given tree t t π t t j t t j p t t f t t f p t t c t t c p t t m t t m p t t a t t a p t t the beetle population vector at time t in 4 and wherever matrix products are involved π is assumed to be a column vector but we omit the transpose operator to simplify notation the matrix sδt s t zt describes survival and state transitions β t zt p is the fertility matrix and d t zt is the dispersal matrix the mortality 1 s δ t 0 1 is a fixed proportion of beetles that die each week it occurs irrespective of survival through other processes the scalar valued function β t zt indicates whether birth occurs depending on periods and tree states the matrices s t zt and p are detailed in appendix d specific values for all parameters appearing in fig 4 are given in tables d 4 and d 5 beetle dispersal is encoded in the matrix d t zt at each time step δt this matrix which acts before the processes of survival and fertility potentially moves beetles between trees dispersal only occurs at the beginning of summer breeding and in fall new generation when beetles are in one of the four dispersal stages m mp f and

the weight p d t t of the edge t t in n b as given by 1 hence the number bt t of spore carrying beetles that have travelled to tree t during t t δ t used for tree infection is computed as follows 5 b t t i 0 w f p t t i δ t where w is the number of weeks in a given year 2 2 setting up simulations as simulation of the model is computationally intensive in this preliminary study we focus on the two areas shown in fig 5 a zone with two parks with high american elm densities fig 5 a and a residential block neighbourhood fig 5 b the park area pcp results from grouping two winnipeg neighbourhoods pulberry and crescent park the boulevard area in which trees line the streets is north river heights nrh the initial date for simulations is july 31 of year 0 which falls within the breeding period furthermore we assume that only spore carrying juvenile beetles jp are present at the beginning of simulations the initial number of beetles in the juvenile stage per tree is set to 500 individuals per infected tree concerning initially infected trees we use three approaches one cluster has all trees in a zone delimited by a circle infected and dead id the radii of the circles for the two neighbourhoods are given in table 1 all other trees are healthy sh two clusters consists of two clusters as defined above with the total number of infected and dead trees for the entire neighbourhood the same as in the one cluster case randomised has the same number of initially infected and dead trees randomly located over the neighbourhood under consideration in order to have comparable initial conditions the percentage of initially infected and dead trees is the same for the three approaches this is done for clusters by adapting the radius thus only the initial spatial layout of the infection changes parameter values used for simulations are provided in tables c 3 d 4 and d 5 2 3 main parameters sensitivity analysis in addition to initial conditions the study focuses on the effect of four parameters i the maximal distance rb that beetles can move during dispersal beetle dispersal is complex to measure and our present study explores a large range for beetle dispersal pines and westwood 2008 found that beetles may travel up to 1000 m from their original tree but most beetles move much shorter distances if sufficient healthy elms are available based on this we explore the beetle dispersal distance from 20 to 380 m in the simulations ii the probability pi that a spore carrying beetle successfully introduces the pathogen into a susceptible tree this has been shown to be between 3 and 5 in webber et al 1984 iii the weekly survival rate sδt of beetles iv the maximum probability pr that infection is transmitted via the root system ranges of these parameters are given in tables c 3 and d 5 to assess the effect of these parameters on the prevalence of disease i e the proportion of infected trees over time a sensitivity analysis is carried out the four main parameters above are the input factors for the sensitivity analysis we consider ten different values for rb 20 to 380 m with 40 m step three for sδt 0 97 0 98 0 99 four for pr 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and three for pi 0 01 0 02 0 03 leading to 360 different combinations of parameters each combination of parameter values is used for 100 simulations and the proportion of infected trees over time is the output the sensitivity analysis is an analysis of variance anova and is carried out using the r package multisensi bidot et al 2018 sensitivity indices si of input factors are computed every year results represent the contributions of each input factor main effect of interactions between two factors interactions and of interactions of more than two factors residual to the total variability of the disease prevalence over time furthermore global sensitivity indices gsi are calculated that represent the sum of the main effect and all the interactions for each input factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 topology of the root network the distribution of degrees with for each neighbourhood 1h the network describing the extent of maximum transmission probabilities on the left and 3h the network describing the extent of positive infection probabilities on the right are shown in fig 6 a in a park neighbourhood considering a larger extent for a tree s root system as is done in 3h has strong consequences with some trees being in this case connected to more than 100 other trees considering strengths from table 2 while the median is very similar for 1h it is almost twice as large for trees in parks for 3h showing a significant difference between the two topologies another difference between parks and boulevards is observed when considering connected components in the graph while the situation appears quite similar if referring to table 2 the situation is different when one considers 3h in fig 6 b the right section of each violin plot there are two main differences in parks the median number of trees per connected component is lower than in boulevards however park neighbourhoods also comprise some connected components that contain many trees for instance the two actual parks seen in fig 5 a in boulevard neighbourhoods connected components are more homogeneous with respect to the number of trees they contain the next three indicators in table 2 eccentricity diameter and betweenness further highlight the organisation of the connected components in terms of infection through root systems eccentricity describes how far away in the graph the infection can travel in a connected component unsurprisingly the median eccentricity is much higher for parks than it is for boulevards interestingly while the mean eccentricity strongly differentiates both neighbourhood types the diameter is quite similar for both finally betweenness is lower in parks for 1h but much higher for 3h the last three indicators listed in table 2 are obtained by drilling down further into connected components clearly density is higher in parks that in boulevards results are striking the median density of components is 100 in parks even for 1h while it is at most 50 in boulevards thus half or more of the connected components in parks have all trees connected to each other through their root systems which is translated in the diameter by a median value of 1 the diameter of the components is larger in boulevards 3 2 role of root driven infection the impact of the root network on the spread of the disease in both neighbourhoods pcp and nrh for different values of the beetle maximum dispersal distance rb is investigated in fig 7 the presence of infection by root systems always favours the propagation of the disease increasing beetle dispersal rb also augments the prevalence of the infection further when both modes of infection are considered and beetle dispersal is low the prevalence is higher in parks pcp dark gray then as beetle dispersal increases past r b 100 the situation reverses and prevalence becomes higher in boulevards nrh light gray conversely when there is no root driven infection the situation is different there is no difference until r b 220 at which point the prevalence becomes higher in parks below r b 260 the topology of the neighbourhood does not seem to play a role in the spread of the disease this could be a consequence of the difference of topology of the root networks in both neighbourhoods section 3 1 there are two large connected components in the park neighbourhood and many small others while the boulevard neighbourhood has connected components that are much more homogeneous in terms of the number of trees they comprise fig 6 b when beetles can disperse far enough the infection is likely to spread faster in neighbourhoods with many medium sized connected components nrh than in ones with few very large and many very small components pcp when beetles do not disperse very far they can have trouble reaching and infecting the other connected components of the network however in the park type neighbourhood if they happen to reach one of the large connected components then the root network takes over and drives the propagation from now on all results consider both modes of transmission the maximum probability of infection through the root system is described by the parameter pr see eq 3 the influence of this parameter on the spread of the disease for one cluster and randomised initial conditions is shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively in fig 8 the prevalence of the infection is increasing as the maximum probability of infection via roots pr becomes larger as beetle maximum dispersal increases so does the proportion of infected trees note that once the probability of infection becomes larger than 0 5 the mean prevalence of the disease is qualitatively the same for all values of pr note that there is a steep increase of the proportion of infected trees between years 2 and 3 for pr 0 25 this occurs when the infection reaches one of the large sized connected components of the root network in fig 9 in which initial conditions are random the prevalence of infection is qualitatively the same for all values of rb 3 3 effect of initial conditions initial conditions have an important effect on the prevalence of the disease based on fig 8 one cluster of initially infected and dead trees we observe that increasing the maximum beetle dispersal distance rb induces an increase of the number of infected trees however in fig 9 random initial conditions and for a large enough value of pr the dispersal of the beetles has no influence on the propagation of the disease this is also observed in fig 10 in which the prevalence of the disease is compared for one cluster two clusters and randomised initial conditions see section 2 2 in the park type neighbourhood pcp the prevalence of the disease is higher when the initial distribution of infected and dead trees is randomised in this case the dispersal of beetles has little effect and we observe that the infection is severe from the first year of the epidemic however as rb gets larger the number of trees infected during the epidemic for the one and two clusters initial approaches increases the marked difference in fig 10 between the behaviour of infection for randomised initial conditions and for clusters could be explained as follows in clusters only the root systems of trees at the periphery of the cluster can contribute to the root driven infection process by opposition in randomised conditions it is most likely that each initially infected and dead tree has only susceptible neighbours in d r see section 2 1 3 since the park type neighbourhood has two large connected components in the root network n r it is very likely that several of the initially infected and dead trees are within these components implying that they have access to a very large number of susceptible trees the same mechanism seems to operate when comparing one initial cluster and two initial clusters we postulate that one initial cluster and randomised initial conditions represent the two extreme cases in terms of magnitude of infection and that increasing the number of clusters would increase the severity of the infection 3 4 impact of beetles dynamics using one cluster initial conditions for infected trees the spatial and temporal spread of the disease is quantified using the wave front of infection at the start of the simulation all trees are within the cluster so the maximum distance between any two trees is no larger than the radius of the cluster as the infection starts to spread we track the maximum distance separating all pairs of infected trees fig 11 shows the extent of disease propagation at each time step using the average over 100 simulations of this maximum distance parameters related to beetle dynamics sδt and probability of beetle driven infection pi are varied for different values of rb for small values of rb varying the values of parameters pi and sδt does not affect the wave front when rb gets larger increases of both pi and sδt have an effect on the wave front substantially increasing the extent of the infection 3 5 sensitivity analysis results of the sensitivity analysis carried out on the four parameters pr pi rb and sδt are summarised in fig 12 the park type neighbourhood pcp with one cluster initial conditions is used for the analysis sensitivity indices are the contributions to the total variability of each input factor or of interactions between two factors or more residuals at time t they are represented by the lengths of the different colour segments along a vertical line at time t in the lower part of fig 12 a the prevalence of disease is mostly sensitive to pr i e the maximum probability that an infected tree infects adjacent ones at the beginning of the infection the maximum beetle dispersal distance rb plays a role it becomes less influential in the long run the dynamics of the proportion of infected trees is barely sensitive to the probability pi that one beetle infects trees at the beginning of the propagation the vector survival rate sδt does not influence prevalence global sensitivity indices show that pr is the most influential input factor in disease propagation and acts mainly alone fig 12 b 4 conclusion we developed a spatially realistic model of dutch elm disease spread in an urban context the model is a complex network model that explicitly incorporates the actual locations of american elms in the city of winnipeg in a sense it can be likened to a metapopulation model in which each tree would be a patch the dynamics of the epidemiological state of trees is described using a stochastic process that takes into consideration both roots and beetles infection pathways beetle dynamics is modelled using a matrix population model that considers both beetle population growth deterministic and its dispersal stochastic the overall multi scale model has three different time scales week period and year making it extremely challenging to analyse theoretically previous studies concerning the spread of ded did not explicitly take into account beetle dynamics and movement in harwood et al 2011 the beetle dispersal range is approximated to provide insights concerning the spread of the disease in the uk during an epidemic in the 1960s but explicit movement of the beetles is not represented in the present study we attempt to provide a deeper understanding of how beetles spread the disease in an urban context by representing more precisely beetle development and movement through the trees of the city further harwood et al 2011 omitted estimates of infection through the roots because they consider that infection via beetles was significantly greater than root infection however we show here that root infections should be considered to better understand disease spreads based on the simulations and sensitivity analyses it appears that at the early stage of infection of an entirely susceptible neighbourhood preventing ded transmission through the roots would be the most efficient control measure in those situations where root grafting would be considered highly likely in a neighbourhood where the disease is already established beetle control would be more beneficial however as indicated above our approach has some limitations in order to address these limitations it would be prudent to expand the present model to incorporate disease management practices this would necessitate the investigation of the effects of sanitation and beetle control to more accurately predict spread rates it would also be important to gather more information about two specific issues the number and location of trees on private land and the number and location of removed ded infected trees which would allow improved calibration of the model the present study only takes into account the trees inventoried in the winnipeg open data portal which are the trees on public city of winnipeg land this represents roughly 56 000 american elms however american elms are also located on private property in the study neighbourhoods and their location and diameter at breast height cannot be accessed from the public database the percentage of such trees was considered to be small but nonetheless their absence from the database means that this study does not consider interactions of private and public elms these interactions are likely to further densify the root network the present simulation framework most of which we are making available at https github com julien arino ded ecological modelling code could be adapted to other cities and tree diseases or pests provided that an accurate and up to date tree inventory were available for instance the recent introduction of the emerald ash borer into urban forests across eastern north america could be studied using the same general framework with adaptations of the model to account for differences between the life cycles of hylurgopinus rufipes and agrilus planipennis credit authorship contribution statement nicolas bajeux

appendix a tree height as a function of dbh we use data collected by one of the authors rw to obtain a relation between diameter at breast height and tree height data on 787 american elms in winnipeg is shown in fig a 13 using nonlinear regression we find that the relation can be approximated as a 1 h t 4 208 log b h t 1 707 where t t is a tree bh t its diameter at breast height in centimetres and h t its height in metres tree height is then used to determine the extent of the root system appendix b description of graph measures for the reader s convenience we explain here some of the measures of graph topology used in this work as much as possible the vocabulary of graph network theory is recast in the context of the root system networks considered in this paper we consider two root networks in each neighbourhood the first one which we call 1h for short is the network that is generated if one considers the subgraph of n r with edge weights equal to pr with pr taken equal to 1 in other words this is how trees are connected through their roots if the extent of a tree s root system is the same as its height the other network 3h is n r the network obtained when using all trees satisfying 2 that is the network describing the maximum extent of the reach of trees before the probabilities of infection through the root system vanishes the degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of vertices it is directly connected to so for trees this is the number of other trees that a given tree is in contact with through roots and can therefore infect strength is closely related to the degree and actually matches exactly in the case of an unweighted graph such as 1h indeed rather than consider the number of trees a given tree s root system is connected to strength considers the weights of these connections which are 1 in the case of 1h thus strength sums the probabilities that a given tree can infect its neighbours through their root systems note that the result is not a probability since probability of infection through roots is not normalised a connected component is a group of trees in which each tree has access to all other trees directly or not a connected component is thus a group of trees which if left to itself in the presence of one pathogen bearing tree in its midst would end up completely contaminated eccentricity diameter and betweenness further help understand the organisation of the connected components eccentricity is a tree specific measure consider a tree t t the geodesic shortest distance to another tree t t is the minimum number of root systems i e edges that must be traversed to get from t to t for instance if t and t are directly connected through their root systems then the shortest distance between them is one whereas if t and t are not directly connected but are both connected to a third tree t t then the shortest distance between them is 2 clearly if two trees are in two different connected components then there is no route from one to the other and we say that the shortest distance is shortest distances can also be weighted the mechanism is the same but instead of returning the number of jumps needed to go from one tree to another it is connected to one sums the weights of the edges involved the eccentricity of a tree is then the largest finite shortest distance from that tree in other words in terms of infection through root systems eccentricity describes how far away the infection can travel in a connected component the diameter of a graph is the maximum finite eccentricity for all trees in this graph betweenness is a tree centric measure that describes how central a tree is it is sometimes also called betweenness centrality the betweenness of a tree t t is the number of shortest paths going through t excluding those shortest paths in which t is an endpoint thus a tree at the end of a line has a betweenness of 0 while one that is quite central has high betweenness the last three indicators are obtained by drilling down further into connected components indeed some measures that apply at the network level fail to pick up on characteristics of connected components we therefore compute these measures for each connected component density is a measure of how well connected trees are to one another if all trees were connected to every other tree in the neighbourhood we would say the graph is complete density is then the percentage of completeness of the graph i e the percentage of the possible connections that is present appendix c life and epidemiological dynamics of elms three mechanisms govern elm dynamics ageing infection via beetles and infection via roots in order to describe these mechanisms the submodels for ageing and beetle driven infection on the one hand and for root driven infection on the other are discrete time markov chains in the absence of the other process denote these processes xt and yt respectively a selection process zt is then used at each time step δt to decide on the actual tree status which then used as the initial state of both xt and yt all the processes are defined on the same state space s s h s w i w s d i d c1 markov chain for ageing and beetle driven infection in the absence of root driven infection the processes of ageing and beetle driven infection are described for a given tree t t by a single markov chain x t t defined by the transition matrix t a b t t representing the probabilities to switch from one state to another given by c 1 t a b t t 1 p a 1 p b b t t 0 0 0 0 p a 1 p b b t t 1 p a 1 p b b t t 0 0 0 p

state s i the probability of ageing is a constant pa and affects only states sh and sw by our modelling assumptions infection by beetles only occurs when a spore carrying beetle feeds at the canopy of a susceptible healthy or stressed tree i e trees in states sh and sw webber et al 1984 each spore carrying beetle that arrives in a tree t t has a probability pi to infect this tree this probability is the same for all trees the probability of becoming infected via beetles is pb bt t for a tree t t at state sh or sw where bt t is the cumulative number of spore carrying beetles having travelled to tree t between t and t δ t a binomial distribution b b t t p i is used to decide if tree t becomes infected at t δ t then the probability pb bt t of becoming infected at time t δ t is the probability that at least one spore carrying beetle successfully infects the tree during t t δ t so that c 2 p b b t t 1 1 p i b t t parameter values are given in table c 3 furthermore it is observed that an infected tree dies within a year giving that the probability to switch from iw to id is equal to one finally note that states sd and id are absorbing hence for the urban forest as a whole in the absence of root driven infection the process of ageing and beetle driven infection is described by a markov chain xt with transition matrix taking the form t a b t t t t a b t t c2 markov chain for root driven infection in the absence of tree ageing and beetle driven infection the evolution of infection of a tree t t via the root system is driven by a markov chain y t t let t t be a susceptible

will become id the next year but are not yet infectious in order to determine if t becomes infected via the root network of one of its infected neighbours t 1 t k d i d r t we use a poisson binomial distribution wang 1993 with parameters p r t t 1 p r t t k i e the weights given by 3 of the edges in n r between t and all its infected neighbours we then have c 3 p y t δ t t i w i d y t t s h s w s

these sets the poisson binomial c 3 sums the probabilities that no infection occurs f 0 or t is infected by exactly one of its neighbours f 1 or t is infected by exactly two of its neighbours f 2 or t

thus selects at each time step δt for each tree the worst possible outcome in terms of ageing and beetle driven infection and root driven infection to summarise when both ageing and beetle and root driven processes are considered simultaneously we can caricature the processes as operating as follows x t δ t g x z t y t δ t g y z t z t δ t g z x t δ t y t δ t thus in the description of xt in

24718,a complex network model for the spread of dutch elm disease in an urban forest is formulated american elms are the focus of the model each elm can be in one of five states a combination of their life and epidemiological status each tree is also potentially a host to a population of elm bark beetles the vectors of dutch elm disease the epidemiological dynamics of trees is governed by a stochastic process that takes into account the dispersal of spore carrying beetles between trees and potential contacts between tree root systems the model describes seasonal variations of beetle activity and population dynamics numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses of the model are carried out in this introductory paper we use data from the city of winnipeg where dutch elm disease is prevalent and focus on two neighbourhoods representative of a residential area and an area with urban parks keywords network epidemic model plant pathogens hybrid model multi scale model 1 introduction urban forestry is a specialized branch of forestry that involves the cultivation and management of trees in urban urban interface areas and greenspaces for the physiological sociological and economic well being of urban society harris et al 1999 jorgensen 1974 miller et al 2015 the presence of trees in urban landscapes provides benefits by mitigating some of the negative impacts of urban development such as increased heating energy and carbon dioxide levels diminished air quality or loss of rain water dwyer et al 1992 grote et al 2016 livesley et al 2016 elm trees ulmus spp have traditionally been planted widely in urban forests in north america due to increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions fast rates of growth and high survival as seedlings and juveniles rioux 2003 american elm ulmus americana l has been planted extensively in many north american cities as a park and boulevard tree due to its dense canopy and vase shaped form which provides efficient shading in summer and its ability to tolerate cold winters and hot dry summers these traits have made american elm the tree of choice for planting for many decades in urban environments however urban trees are subject to many environmental stressors that includes attack by insects and diseases north american elm species are highly susceptible to dutch elm disease ded an ascomycete fungal wilt disease caused by three species in the genus ophiostoma in northern north america the primary fungal strain is ophiostoma novo ulmi brasier which is spread mostly by the native elm bark beetle nebb hylurgopinus rufipes eichoff pines and westwood 2008 once the fungus is introduced into the tree it spreads through the cells of the phloem and xylem which inhibits water and nutrient transport hiratsuka et al 1987 american elm is the most susceptible north american elm species and infections are almost always fatal with death usually occurring over a period of weeks to months hildahl and jeffrey 1980 hubbes 1988 hubbes and jeng 1981 stipes and campana 1981 ded reached eastern north america in the late 1920 s from europe and the west coast of north america oregon by 1973 and in the 50 years after its introduction the disease is estimated to have killed 50 to 100 million elms soll 2016 the disease eliminated american elm as a major component in the urban forests of many cities in eastern north america as well causing extensive mortality in natural stands of american elm sinclair and campana 1978 world wide many bark beetle species are able to transmit ophiostoma spores to elm with nebb being the primary vector in the northern north america swedenborg et al 1988 bark beetles such as nebb are an important symbiotic partner of these fungi and the primary vector of the disease among elms webber et al 1984 adult nebb s mate and feed in twig crotches in the tree canopy during the spring after mating female beetles construct brood galleries within the cambium laying eggs in the galleries brood galleries are formed in the larger diameter canopy branches and sometimes the upper trunk at the beginning of the infection kaston 1939 lanier et al 1982 pines and westwood 1996 swedenborg et al 1988 thompson and matthysse 1972 whitten 1964 the larvae then feed and develop in the galleries eventually pupating within individual chambers hiratsuka et al 1987 later in the summer and in fall newly emerged adults usually move to new trees to feed if the previously colonised tree was infected with o novo ulmi nebb will mechanically carry fungal spores upon emergence from brood galleries kondo et al 1981 in the late fall the newly emerged adults will move to the base of a healthy tree or occasionally a still living infected tree to overwinter anderson and holliday 2003 strobel and lanier 1981 overwintering beetles burrow into the bark at a height generally below the snow line and overwinter below the phloem after emerging from their overwintering diapause state in spring at the tree base adults carrying ophiostoma spores will move into the canopy of healthy trees to feed and mate and begin forming brood galleries it is during this period that inoculum can be introduced into the xylem of healthy elms gardiner 1981 a second infection route for ded may occur via interconnected root systems in areas of higher tree density brasier and gibbs 1978 in urban environments where boulevard elms may be planted close together root infections can quickly spread within streets causing further mortality to elms within neighbourhoods in urban forests the disease may cost millions per year to keep the incidence economically manageable by spreading losses over a longer time period westwood 1991 dutch elm disease reached manitoba in 1975 and in response a large scale integrated pest management program ipm was developed to manage the disease westwood 1991 control of dutch elm disease is an expensive process due to the complex relationship between pathogen host and vector and its ipm program is based on reducing the probability of occurrence of new disease infections dreistadt et al 1990 gibbs 1978 westwood 1991 integrated control programs include sanitation which involves the elimination of vector populations through insecticides and removal of elm wood that could provide potential habitat westwood 1991 other control methods include severing root grafts between adjacent trees to prevent fungal spread chemical injections of fungicides to increase tree fitness and increased propagation of resistant elm species one missing aspect of ded control which requires more attention is improving disease management and reducing disease incidence through a better understanding of how ded spreads within urban forests studies that have focused on the spread of the disease are few and mainly occurred in the united kingdom harwood et al 2011 sarre 1978 swinton and gilligan 1999 1996 2000 winnipeg manitoba is located adjacent to the temperate shrublands and grasslands biome found over much of the southern portion of the prairie provinces in canada winnipeg contains a large urban forest of over 8 million trees including the largest remaining urban elm canopy in north america barwinsky 2016 city of winnipeg 2018 2019 the impact of ded in north america has been catastrophic in ecological and economical terms through the loss of tree diversity in urban forests and natural forest stands hubbes 1999 oghiakhe 2014 pines and westwood 2008 rioux 2003 slowing the spread and incidence of the disease in urban forests is of major interest in order to save the remaining elm trees still present in cities of north america we propose a model to represent the mechanism of spread in a large urban forest by focusing on both infection modes the pathogen and its dynamics are not explicitly modelled only tree and vector dynamics are described we consider a network model where vertices are the elms dispersal of beetles between elm trees defines the first network used in this study the second network is defined by considering the connectivity between tree root systems beetle dynamics are represented by a stochastic matrix population model a second stochastic process governs the life and infection dynamics of elm trees the resulting model is complex and mathematically intractable in order to study its behaviour in this preliminary study we perform computational and sensitivity analyses focusing on the case of two urban forests in neighbourhoods in the city of winnipeg 2 material and methods 2 1 modelling in order to model the spread of ded in american elms which dominate the urban forest in various winnipeg neighbourhoods we consider the spread via beetle vectors and the root systems of elm trees fig 1 each tree is characterised by its health and epidemiological conditions the population of beetles on each tree is also tracked dispersal of beetles between trees and interactions between root systems of different trees are modelled using two networks the trees are the vertices of networks the presence of an edge indicates that beetles could move between two trees or that the root systems are connected the model is formulated in discrete time two time steps are used to depict the spread of the disease and the beetle dynamics the time step required to update the life and epidemiological status of the trees is denoted δt and represents one year in our simulations the beetle lifespan in manitoba is reported as one year in duration anderson 1996 we denote δt the time step at which beetles grow and move one week in the model 2 1 1 urban forest system the spatial setting of the model is the population of american elm trees found in winnipeg s urban forest elms are considered habitats for the beetles and can be represented as heterogeneous in age size environment etc inventory data for american elm trees on public owned land was obtained from the city of winnipeg open data portal https data winnipeg ca the dataset contains the locations coordinates of about 300 000 trees on public property in the city including at the time of writing approximately 60 000 american elms the location and diameter at breast height is available for each tree in this work the set of elms is denoted t we refer to a given tree in the set as t t or using some index k 1 t where the cardinality t is the total number of american elms for a given tree t t we denote bh t its diameter at breast height 2 1 2 beetle dispersal network beetles disperse between trees when they seek food a location to lay their eggs or an overwintering site in order to keep the model computationally tractable we create a network n b establishing for each tree what other trees are close enough that they can be targets of beetle movement to do this we consider the distances between each pair of trees in the database if t t t are two trees then there is an edge between t and t in n b if d t t r b where d t t is the euclidean distance between t and t and the parameter rb is the maximum beetle dispersal distance weighting the beetle dispersal network the network n b lists the trees that a beetle can fly to if they are in a given tree t t denote d b t the set of trees that are directly connected to t trees in the blue region in fig 1 i e its neighbours within n b when a beetle undertakes movement between trees it is possible that it does not survive the trip this is used later in the dynamical model the probability of surviving dispersal is used as the weight of edges in n b and is defined for t t as for all t d b t 1 p d t t exp d t t r b 2 1 3 root network a different network n r is used to describe the potential connections between root systems of nearby trees the edges of this network are weighted to indicate uncertainty in the extent of root systems the extent of the root system of a given tree is approximated from its diameter at breast height dbh if t t is a tree and bh t is its dbh we assume that the maximal extent of the root system of t is 3h t where h t is the height of t obtained from bh t by a 1 see details in appendix a let t t t be two trees then there is an edge between t and t in n r if 2 d t t 3 h t h t i e if the root systems of t and t are in contact pruning the root network removing roads and rivers root systems are greatly disrupted by the way roads are created to the point that two trees separated by a cement road cannot have their root systems be in contact personal communication of city of winnipeg urban forestry branch as a consequence pruning of n r is carried out as follows for each edge t i t j n r we instantiate the line segment titj as an sf object in r using the r library openstreetmap we download the coordinates of all roads in winnipeg and then remove from n r all edges that are such that the line segment joining them intersects a road the same procedure is used to remove edges between trees separated by one of the rivers that flow through the city of winnipeg the pruned network still denoted n r and called root network then has edges between any pair of trees whose root systems come into contact and that are not separated by a road or a river brown network in fig 1 weighting the root network we assume that when the root networks of two trees are in contact and one of the trees is infected the infection can be transmitted to the other tree to model this root driven infection we add weights to the root network n r these weights represent the probability of infection by roots they take into account the distance between trees and use a parameter pr 0 1 accounting for uncertainty in the extent of roots systems let t t t be two trees the weight of the edge between t and t is given by 3 p r t t p r if d t t h t h t 3 h t h t d t t 2 h t h t p r otherwise recall that there is no edge in n r between t and t if 2 is not satisfied in the remainder of the paper n r refers to this weighted network as for the beetle network n b we define the root neighbourhood of tree t t as the set d r t of trees that are directly connected to t in n r the parameter pr is the maximum probability of infection via roots assessing topology of the root network some properties of networks are relevant for the propagation of the disease shirley and rushton 2005 to assess topological differences between different types of neighbourhoods some properties of the root networks are investigated we used the package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 in the r environment here we consider degree strength connected component distance eccentricity betweenness and density of the root network see details in appendix b 2 1 4 elm dynamics hypotheses each tree t t can be in one of two epidemiological states and one of three life stages susceptible s or infected i and healthy h stressed w or dead d the state w aggregates stressed trees and trees with excessive amounts of dead canopy wood it is assumed that a tree cannot be infected and healthy so elms can be in five states healthy susceptible sh stressed susceptible sw dead susceptible sd stressed infected iw and dead infected id the natural life cycle of trees in the absence of infection is to remain many years in sh then switch to sw and finally die when they switch to sd transitions between epidemiological states depend on the cumulative number of spore carrying beetles that have travelled to a tree during a one year period infection via beetles and the distance that separates the tree from other infected and dead trees infection via roots mathematical representation for each tree transitions between states are governed by a discrete time markovian process on the state space s s h s w i w s d i d combining tree ageing and beetle or root driven infections the flow diagram in fig 2 gives transitions between states for a tree t t for beetle driven infection the cumulative number bt t of spore carrying beetles that have travelled to tree t during t t δ t is given by 5 for root driven infection the set d i d r t represents dead infected trees id that are in d r t at t δ t ageing and beetle driven infection or root driven infection are two independent processes however they impact the transition probabilities simultaneously a selection process combining the outcomes of those independent stochastic processes is used to determine the future state of the tree details are given in appendix c at time t the outcome of stochastic process is a vector z t z t t 1 z t t 2 z t t t representing states of all trees of t with z t t i s the update of tree states occurs during the week 21 of the year middle of may which is assumed to be the end of winter in winnipeg parameters used in the tree dynamics are listed in table c 3 2 1 5 beetle dynamics hypotheses in order to maintain computational tractability our model for beetle dynamics focuses on the trees that insects are colonising and the season rather than on the physiological states of beetles in the absence of ded five stages for beetles are considered juvenile j the juvenile stage j is the aggregation of the biological stages eggs larvae and pupae individuals j develop in live trees in summer and fall dispersing f newly emerged dispersing adults move in fall to the canopy of adjacent live trees to feed callow adults c callow adults c are adults feeding on canopy of live trees in fall then entering winter diapause in the trunks of healthy trees and in spring leaving emerging from tree trunks to their canopy dispersing m dispersing individuals that move in summer from overwintering sites healthy or weak trees to colonise new trees for laying eggs adults a adults a are mature adults that lay eggs during summer resulting in the next generation of juveniles after laying eggs adults die the simplified life cycle of beetles considered in the present study is shown in fig 3 season lengths ought to vary as a function of the temperature however in this preliminary model we caricature a typical year in winnipeg using data shown in fig d 14 the seasons and corresponding beetle behaviour are as follows winter overwinter callow adults overwinter in healthy trees if beetles do not reside on a healthy tree or if they are at any other stage of their life they die when winter starts winter lasts from week 45 one year to week 21 the next spring emergence callow adults go to feed at the canopy of trees in which they overwintered they mature to dispersing individuals m spring lasts one week week 22 summer breeding at the beginning of summer callow adults that are still alive become dispersing individuals m dispersing m fly to colonise new trees once they arrive dispersing individuals become mature adults a eggs are laid in branches or upper trunks of trees resulting in the new generation of juveniles j it is assumed that beetles are univoltine adult females lay on average 60 eggs kaston 1939 and then die new juveniles stay in this stage until the end of summer summer lasts from week 23 to week 38 fall new generation of beetle the new generation of beetles j can now start emerging as dispersing individuals f which leave trees to seek food in healthy or weak trees once they have arrived in appropriate trees dispersing individuals become callow adults c and begin feeding on the tree canopy they stay there and prepare themselves for winter this period lasts from week 39 to 44 after this period the cycle starts again it is assumed that the presence of disease does not affect the beetle life cycle however in the presence of ded individuals can become spore carrier only by growing as a juvenile in an infected stressed or dead tree if the tree is infected and dead then the juvenile carries spores whereas if the tree is infected and stressed then the beetle has a chance to not become spore carrier it is assumed that an individual becoming a spore carrier as juvenile remains a spore carrier all its life we denote jp fp cp mp and ap the corresponding stages to indicate that individuals are spore carrying it is assumed that of the spore carrying states only individuals in fp can infect trees when they arrive to feed on the canopy mathematical representation the flow diagram for beetle dynamics is shown in fig 4 its dependence on periods and tree states are detailed in fig d 15 beetle dispersal and growth are represented by a stage structured matrix model caswell 2001 the time step for the beetle dynamics is δt in our simulations δt is chosen as the minimum time of sojourn in stages which is one week as is customary in structured population models only female beetles are considered in the model a constant sex ratio is assumed caswell 2001 the evolution of the beetle population is governed by the following equation 4 π t δ t s δ t s t z t β t z t p d t z t π t where π π t 1 π t t with for a given tree t t π t t j t t j p t t f t t f p t t c t t c p t t m t t m p t t a t t a p t t the beetle population vector at time t in 4 and wherever matrix products are involved π is assumed to be a column vector but we omit the transpose operator to simplify notation the matrix sδt s t zt describes survival and state transitions β t zt p is the fertility matrix and d t zt is the dispersal matrix the mortality 1 s δ t 0 1 is a fixed proportion of beetles that die each week it occurs irrespective of survival through other processes the scalar valued function β t zt indicates whether birth occurs depending on periods and tree states the matrices s t zt and p are detailed in appendix d specific values for all parameters appearing in fig 4 are given in tables d 4 and d 5 beetle dispersal is encoded in the matrix d t zt at each time step δt this matrix which acts before the processes of survival and fertility potentially moves beetles between trees dispersal only occurs at the beginning of summer breeding and in fall new generation when beetles are in one of the four dispersal stages m mp f and

the weight p d t t of the edge t t in n b as given by 1 hence the number bt t of spore carrying beetles that have travelled to tree t during t t δ t used for tree infection is computed as follows 5 b t t i 0 w f p t t i δ t where w is the number of weeks in a given year 2 2 setting up simulations as simulation of the model is computationally intensive in this preliminary study we focus on the two areas shown in fig 5 a zone with two parks with high american elm densities fig 5 a and a residential block neighbourhood fig 5 b the park area pcp results from grouping two winnipeg neighbourhoods pulberry and crescent park the boulevard area in which trees line the streets is north river heights nrh the initial date for simulations is july 31 of year 0 which falls within the breeding period furthermore we assume that only spore carrying juvenile beetles jp are present at the beginning of simulations the initial number of beetles in the juvenile stage per tree is set to 500 individuals per infected tree concerning initially infected trees we use three approaches one cluster has all trees in a zone delimited by a circle infected and dead id the radii of the circles for the two neighbourhoods are given in table 1 all other trees are healthy sh two clusters consists of two clusters as defined above with the total number of infected and dead trees for the entire neighbourhood the same as in the one cluster case randomised has the same number of initially infected and dead trees randomly located over the neighbourhood under consideration in order to have comparable initial conditions the percentage of initially infected and dead trees is the same for the three approaches this is done for clusters by adapting the radius thus only the initial spatial layout of the infection changes parameter values used for simulations are provided in tables c 3 d 4 and d 5 2 3 main parameters sensitivity analysis in addition to initial conditions the study focuses on the effect of four parameters i the maximal distance rb that beetles can move during dispersal beetle dispersal is complex to measure and our present study explores a large range for beetle dispersal pines and westwood 2008 found that beetles may travel up to 1000 m from their original tree but most beetles move much shorter distances if sufficient healthy elms are available based on this we explore the beetle dispersal distance from 20 to 380 m in the simulations ii the probability pi that a spore carrying beetle successfully introduces the pathogen into a susceptible tree this has been shown to be between 3 and 5 in webber et al 1984 iii the weekly survival rate sδt of beetles iv the maximum probability pr that infection is transmitted via the root system ranges of these parameters are given in tables c 3 and d 5 to assess the effect of these parameters on the prevalence of disease i e the proportion of infected trees over time a sensitivity analysis is carried out the four main parameters above are the input factors for the sensitivity analysis we consider ten different values for rb 20 to 380 m with 40 m step three for sδt 0 97 0 98 0 99 four for pr 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and three for pi 0 01 0 02 0 03 leading to 360 different combinations of parameters each combination of parameter values is used for 100 simulations and the proportion of infected trees over time is the output the sensitivity analysis is an analysis of variance anova and is carried out using the r package multisensi bidot et al 2018 sensitivity indices si of input factors are computed every year results represent the contributions of each input factor main effect of interactions between two factors interactions and of interactions of more than two factors residual to the total variability of the disease prevalence over time furthermore global sensitivity indices gsi are calculated that represent the sum of the main effect and all the interactions for each input factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 topology of the root network the distribution of degrees with for each neighbourhood 1h the network describing the extent of maximum transmission probabilities on the left and 3h the network describing the extent of positive infection probabilities on the right are shown in fig 6 a in a park neighbourhood considering a larger extent for a tree s root system as is done in 3h has strong consequences with some trees being in this case connected to more than 100 other trees considering strengths from table 2 while the median is very similar for 1h it is almost twice as large for trees in parks for 3h showing a significant difference between the two topologies another difference between parks and boulevards is observed when considering connected components in the graph while the situation appears quite similar if referring to table 2 the situation is different when one considers 3h in fig 6 b the right section of each violin plot there are two main differences in parks the median number of trees per connected component is lower than in boulevards however park neighbourhoods also comprise some connected components that contain many trees for instance the two actual parks seen in fig 5 a in boulevard neighbourhoods connected components are more homogeneous with respect to the number of trees they contain the next three indicators in table 2 eccentricity diameter and betweenness further highlight the organisation of the connected components in terms of infection through root systems eccentricity describes how far away in the graph the infection can travel in a connected component unsurprisingly the median eccentricity is much higher for parks than it is for boulevards interestingly while the mean eccentricity strongly differentiates both neighbourhood types the diameter is quite similar for both finally betweenness is lower in parks for 1h but much higher for 3h the last three indicators listed in table 2 are obtained by drilling down further into connected components clearly density is higher in parks that in boulevards results are striking the median density of components is 100 in parks even for 1h while it is at most 50 in boulevards thus half or more of the connected components in parks have all trees connected to each other through their root systems which is translated in the diameter by a median value of 1 the diameter of the components is larger in boulevards 3 2 role of root driven infection the impact of the root network on the spread of the disease in both neighbourhoods pcp and nrh for different values of the beetle maximum dispersal distance rb is investigated in fig 7 the presence of infection by root systems always favours the propagation of the disease increasing beetle dispersal rb also augments the prevalence of the infection further when both modes of infection are considered and beetle dispersal is low the prevalence is higher in parks pcp dark gray then as beetle dispersal increases past r b 100 the situation reverses and prevalence becomes higher in boulevards nrh light gray conversely when there is no root driven infection the situation is different there is no difference until r b 220 at which point the prevalence becomes higher in parks below r b 260 the topology of the neighbourhood does not seem to play a role in the spread of the disease this could be a consequence of the difference of topology of the root networks in both neighbourhoods section 3 1 there are two large connected components in the park neighbourhood and many small others while the boulevard neighbourhood has connected components that are much more homogeneous in terms of the number of trees they comprise fig 6 b when beetles can disperse far enough the infection is likely to spread faster in neighbourhoods with many medium sized connected components nrh than in ones with few very large and many very small components pcp when beetles do not disperse very far they can have trouble reaching and infecting the other connected components of the network however in the park type neighbourhood if they happen to reach one of the large connected components then the root network takes over and drives the propagation from now on all results consider both modes of transmission the maximum probability of infection through the root system is described by the parameter pr see eq 3 the influence of this parameter on the spread of the disease for one cluster and randomised initial conditions is shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively in fig 8 the prevalence of the infection is increasing as the maximum probability of infection via roots pr becomes larger as beetle maximum dispersal increases so does the proportion of infected trees note that once the probability of infection becomes larger than 0 5 the mean prevalence of the disease is qualitatively the same for all values of pr note that there is a steep increase of the proportion of infected trees between years 2 and 3 for pr 0 25 this occurs when the infection reaches one of the large sized connected components of the root network in fig 9 in which initial conditions are random the prevalence of infection is qualitatively the same for all values of rb 3 3 effect of initial conditions initial conditions have an important effect on the prevalence of the disease based on fig 8 one cluster of initially infected and dead trees we observe that increasing the maximum beetle dispersal distance rb induces an increase of the number of infected trees however in fig 9 random initial conditions and for a large enough value of pr the dispersal of the beetles has no influence on the propagation of the disease this is also observed in fig 10 in which the prevalence of the disease is compared for one cluster two clusters and randomised initial conditions see section 2 2 in the park type neighbourhood pcp the prevalence of the disease is higher when the initial distribution of infected and dead trees is randomised in this case the dispersal of beetles has little effect and we observe that the infection is severe from the first year of the epidemic however as rb gets larger the number of trees infected during the epidemic for the one and two clusters initial approaches increases the marked difference in fig 10 between the behaviour of infection for randomised initial conditions and for clusters could be explained as follows in clusters only the root systems of trees at the periphery of the cluster can contribute to the root driven infection process by opposition in randomised conditions it is most likely that each initially infected and dead tree has only susceptible neighbours in d r see section 2 1 3 since the park type neighbourhood has two large connected components in the root network n r it is very likely that several of the initially infected and dead trees are within these components implying that they have access to a very large number of susceptible trees the same mechanism seems to operate when comparing one initial cluster and two initial clusters we postulate that one initial cluster and randomised initial conditions represent the two extreme cases in terms of magnitude of infection and that increasing the number of clusters would increase the severity of the infection 3 4 impact of beetles dynamics using one cluster initial conditions for infected trees the spatial and temporal spread of the disease is quantified using the wave front of infection at the start of the simulation all trees are within the cluster so the maximum distance between any two trees is no larger than the radius of the cluster as the infection starts to spread we track the maximum distance separating all pairs of infected trees fig 11 shows the extent of disease propagation at each time step using the average over 100 simulations of this maximum distance parameters related to beetle dynamics sδt and probability of beetle driven infection pi are varied for different values of rb for small values of rb varying the values of parameters pi and sδt does not affect the wave front when rb gets larger increases of both pi and sδt have an effect on the wave front substantially increasing the extent of the infection 3 5 sensitivity analysis results of the sensitivity analysis carried out on the four parameters pr pi rb and sδt are summarised in fig 12 the park type neighbourhood pcp with one cluster initial conditions is used for the analysis sensitivity indices are the contributions to the total variability of each input factor or of interactions between two factors or more residuals at time t they are represented by the lengths of the different colour segments along a vertical line at time t in the lower part of fig 12 a the prevalence of disease is mostly sensitive to pr i e the maximum probability that an infected tree infects adjacent ones at the beginning of the infection the maximum beetle dispersal distance rb plays a role it becomes less influential in the long run the dynamics of the proportion of infected trees is barely sensitive to the probability pi that one beetle infects trees at the beginning of the propagation the vector survival rate sδt does not influence prevalence global sensitivity indices show that pr is the most influential input factor in disease propagation and acts mainly alone fig 12 b 4 conclusion we developed a spatially realistic model of dutch elm disease spread in an urban context the model is a complex network model that explicitly incorporates the actual locations of american elms in the city of winnipeg in a sense it can be likened to a metapopulation model in which each tree would be a patch the dynamics of the epidemiological state of trees is described using a stochastic process that takes into consideration both roots and beetles infection pathways beetle dynamics is modelled using a matrix population model that considers both beetle population growth deterministic and its dispersal stochastic the overall multi scale model has three different time scales week period and year making it extremely challenging to analyse theoretically previous studies concerning the spread of ded did not explicitly take into account beetle dynamics and movement in harwood et al 2011 the beetle dispersal range is approximated to provide insights concerning the spread of the disease in the uk during an epidemic in the 1960s but explicit movement of the beetles is not represented in the present study we attempt to provide a deeper understanding of how beetles spread the disease in an urban context by representing more precisely beetle development and movement through the trees of the city further harwood et al 2011 omitted estimates of infection through the roots because they consider that infection via beetles was significantly greater than root infection however we show here that root infections should be considered to better understand disease spreads based on the simulations and sensitivity analyses it appears that at the early stage of infection of an entirely susceptible neighbourhood preventing ded transmission through the roots would be the most efficient control measure in those situations where root grafting would be considered highly likely in a neighbourhood where the disease is already established beetle control would be more beneficial however as indicated above our approach has some limitations in order to address these limitations it would be prudent to expand the present model to incorporate disease management practices this would necessitate the investigation of the effects of sanitation and beetle control to more accurately predict spread rates it would also be important to gather more information about two specific issues the number and location of trees on private land and the number and location of removed ded infected trees which would allow improved calibration of the model the present study only takes into account the trees inventoried in the winnipeg open data portal which are the trees on public city of winnipeg land this represents roughly 56 000 american elms however american elms are also located on private property in the study neighbourhoods and their location and diameter at breast height cannot be accessed from the public database the percentage of such trees was considered to be small but nonetheless their absence from the database means that this study does not consider interactions of private and public elms these interactions are likely to further densify the root network the present simulation framework most of which we are making available at https github com julien arino ded ecological modelling code could be adapted to other cities and tree diseases or pests provided that an accurate and up to date tree inventory were available for instance the recent introduction of the emerald ash borer into urban forests across eastern north america could be studied using the same general framework with adaptations of the model to account for differences between the life cycles of hylurgopinus rufipes and agrilus planipennis credit authorship contribution statement nicolas bajeux

appendix a tree height as a function of dbh we use data collected by one of the authors rw to obtain a relation between diameter at breast height and tree height data on 787 american elms in winnipeg is shown in fig a 13 using nonlinear regression we find that the relation can be approximated as a 1 h t 4 208 log b h t 1 707 where t t is a tree bh t its diameter at breast height in centimetres and h t its height in metres tree height is then used to determine the extent of the root system appendix b description of graph measures for the reader s convenience we explain here some of the measures of graph topology used in this work as much as possible the vocabulary of graph network theory is recast in the context of the root system networks considered in this paper we consider two root networks in each neighbourhood the first one which we call 1h for short is the network that is generated if one considers the subgraph of n r with edge weights equal to pr with pr taken equal to 1 in other words this is how trees are connected through their roots if the extent of a tree s root system is the same as its height the other network 3h is n r the network obtained when using all trees satisfying 2 that is the network describing the maximum extent of the reach of trees before the probabilities of infection through the root system vanishes the degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of vertices it is directly connected to so for trees this is the number of other trees that a given tree is in contact with through roots and can therefore infect strength is closely related to the degree and actually matches exactly in the case of an unweighted graph such as 1h indeed rather than consider the number of trees a given tree s root system is connected to strength considers the weights of these connections which are 1 in the case of 1h thus strength sums the probabilities that a given tree can infect its neighbours through their root systems note that the result is not a probability since probability of infection through roots is not normalised a connected component is a group of trees in which each tree has access to all other trees directly or not a connected component is thus a group of trees which if left to itself in the presence of one pathogen bearing tree in its midst would end up completely contaminated eccentricity diameter and betweenness further help understand the organisation of the connected components eccentricity is a tree specific measure consider a tree t t the geodesic shortest distance to another tree t t is the minimum number of root systems i e edges that must be traversed to get from t to t for instance if t and t are directly connected through their root systems then the shortest distance between them is one whereas if t and t are not directly connected but are both connected to a third tree t t then the shortest distance between them is 2 clearly if two trees are in two different connected components then there is no route from one to the other and we say that the shortest distance is shortest distances can also be weighted the mechanism is the same but instead of returning the number of jumps needed to go from one tree to another it is connected to one sums the weights of the edges involved the eccentricity of a tree is then the largest finite shortest distance from that tree in other words in terms of infection through root systems eccentricity describes how far away the infection can travel in a connected component the diameter of a graph is the maximum finite eccentricity for all trees in this graph betweenness is a tree centric measure that describes how central a tree is it is sometimes also called betweenness centrality the betweenness of a tree t t is the number of shortest paths going through t excluding those shortest paths in which t is an endpoint thus a tree at the end of a line has a betweenness of 0 while one that is quite central has high betweenness the last three indicators are obtained by drilling down further into connected components indeed some measures that apply at the network level fail to pick up on characteristics of connected components we therefore compute these measures for each connected component density is a measure of how well connected trees are to one another if all trees were connected to every other tree in the neighbourhood we would say the graph is complete density is then the percentage of completeness of the graph i e the percentage of the possible connections that is present appendix c life and epidemiological dynamics of elms three mechanisms govern elm dynamics ageing infection via beetles and infection via roots in order to describe these mechanisms the submodels for ageing and beetle driven infection on the one hand and for root driven infection on the other are discrete time markov chains in the absence of the other process denote these processes xt and yt respectively a selection process zt is then used at each time step δt to decide on the actual tree status which then used as the initial state of both xt and yt all the processes are defined on the same state space s s h s w i w s d i d c1 markov chain for ageing and beetle driven infection in the absence of root driven infection the processes of ageing and beetle driven infection are described for a given tree t t by a single markov chain x t t defined by the transition matrix t a b t t representing the probabilities to switch from one state to another given by c 1 t a b t t 1 p a 1 p b b t t 0 0 0 0 p a 1 p b b t t 1 p a 1 p b b t t 0 0 0 p b b t t p b b t t 0 0 0 0 p a 1 p b b t t 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 in the latter matrix states are ordered as in the state space s with the i j entry representing the probability of switching from state s j to state s i the probability of ageing is a constant pa and affects only states sh and sw by our modelling assumptions infection by beetles only occurs when a spore carrying beetle feeds at the canopy of a susceptible healthy or stressed tree i e trees in states sh and sw webber et al 1984 each spore carrying beetle that arrives in a tree t t has a probability pi to infect this tree this probability is the same for all trees the probability of becoming infected via beetles is pb bt t for a tree t t at state sh or sw where bt t is the cumulative number of spore carrying beetles having travelled to tree t between t and t δ t a binomial distribution b b t t p i is used to decide if tree t becomes infected at t δ t then the probability pb bt t of becoming infected at time t δ t is the probability that at least one spore carrying beetle successfully infects the tree during t t δ t so that c 2 p b b t t 1 1 p i b t t parameter values are given in table c 3 furthermore it is observed that an infected tree dies within a year giving that the probability to switch from iw to id is equal to one finally note that states sd and id are absorbing hence for the urban forest as a whole in the absence of root driven infection the process of ageing and beetle driven infection is described by a markov chain xt with transition matrix taking the form t a b t t t t a b t t c2 markov chain for root driven infection in the absence of tree ageing and beetle driven infection the evolution of infection of a tree t t via the root system is driven by a markov chain y t t let t t be a susceptible tree i e a tree in state sh sw or sd let d i d r t d r t be the set of dead infected trees id in d r t we assume that infection via the roots of trees in state iw is not possible since these trees will become id the next year but are not yet infectious in order to determine if t becomes infected via the root network of one of its infected neighbours t 1 t k d i d r t we use a poisson binomial distribution wang 1993 with parameters p r t t 1 p r t t k i e the weights given by 3 of the edges in n r between t and all its infected neighbours we then have c 3 p y t δ t t i w i d y t t s h s w s d a f x t a p r t t t a c 1 p r t t and 0 otherwise here f x is defined as f x a a d i d r t a x with k d i d r t x 0 k and ac the complement of a to illustrate the role of c 3 suppose that a tree t t has three infected trees it is connected to in the weighted pruned network n r then d i d r t t 1 t 2 t 3 and f 0 f 1 t 1 t 2 t 3 f 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 3 t 2 t 3 and f 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 by considering each of these sets the poisson binomial c 3 sums the probabilities that no infection occurs f 0 or t is infected by exactly one of its neighbours f 1 or t is infected by exactly two of its neighbours f 2 or t is infected by all its neighbours f 3 hence the second markov chain yt representing the root driven infection is defined by the transition matrix t r built using c 3 for all trees in t c3 selection process define an order on the state space sh sw iw sd id by c 4 s h s w i w s d i d the overall stochastic process z t t governing the dynamics of a tree t t is defined by combining the processes for ageing and beetle driven infection and root driven infection as c 5 z t δ t t max x t δ t t y t δ t t if x t δ t t y t δ t t s d i w i d if x t δ t t y t δ t t s d i w this overall stochastic process thus selects at each time step δt for each tree the worst possible outcome in terms of ageing and beetle driven infection and root driven infection to summarise when both ageing and beetle and root driven processes are considered simultaneously we can caricature the processes as operating as follows x t δ t g x z t y t δ t g y z t z t δ t g z x t δ t y t δ t thus in the description of xt in appendix c 1 and yt in appendix c 2 the states x t δ t and y t δ t depend on zt instead of xt and yt respectively as all processes operate on the same state space s zt is also a markov process appendix d components of beetles dynamics the transition matrix for beetles from tree t t is given by d 1 s t t z t t s j 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 s j p j s j p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 s f j 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 s f

overwinter only in healthy trees however in the model they might emerge from stressed trees too this is a feature of the model as the tree state update occurs during the last week of winter just

24719,citizen science programs and particularly atlas schemes based on opportunistic biological records are very important sources of data for species distribution models and conservation nevertheless these data are prone to bias particularly when they come from less popular or hard to detect identify species such as insects with such biased data it is important to evaluate the stability of the model predictions in recent years point process models ppms have shown their strength as a unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models with many advantages in model implementation and interpretation ppms are closely connected to methods already in widespread use in ecology such as maxent and to logistic regression and benefit from being more transparent about resource selection and absence handling moreover there is a well developed set of tools to fit these models and assess various features of the underlying model including model stability however such tools are currently unavailable when point process models are fitted with a lasso penalty which has been shown to improve predictive performance based on the french citizen science program stag beetle quest we propose new methods to assess model stability in this context the ultimate goal was to develop a set of functions to analyze ppm models with lasso penalties fitted with presence only data to assess model stability we randomly sampled different subsets of locations with varying size from the whole dataset and used the proposed tools to compare fitted intensities and model coefficients all the developed measures are complementary and can be used to identify at what number of point locations the model stabilizes which will be dependent on the dataset our work presents a new toolbox to explore questions around model stability based on the number of locations in the context of point process models with a lasso penalty and confirms once more the use of the point process modeling framework as a flexible and unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models keywords species distribution models point process models lasso diagnostic tools r functions lucanus cervus 1 introduction to be able to estimate accurately the decline of biodiversity we need to be equipped with reliable tools and methods allowing a good characterization of population trends methods should provide a picture of the distribution of species through space and time from data which represent a subsample of the true species populations this is especially necessary for organisms that are hard to detect in their environment such as insects donaldson et al 2016 leandro et al 2017 species distribution models sdms have become important methods to inform policy makers and conservation practitioners about biodiversity trends mapping the patterns of biodiversity sdms can be used in land use planning leading to prioritization of conservation strategies devictor et al 2010 guisan et al 2013 they have also been put forward as pivotal tools for the appropriate evaluation of conservation status of insects diniz filho et al 2010 cardoso et al 2011 leandro et al 2017 in order to fit a sdm a substantial number of recorded locations is typically necessary one source of data that can be used to fit an sdm is a list of locations found in biodiversity atlas schemes and citizen science programs but such data involve the attendance of particular questions related to the observation process alabri 2010 isaac and pockok 2015 powney and isaac 2015 indeed data can come in a number of formats the two most common being 1 presence absence data which implies a clear sampling protocol and a greater effort from the observer when cryptic species are considered and 2 presence only data presence only data are cheaper and consequently more widely available than presence absence data however they are more prone to bias due to the way they are collected presence only data can be opportunistic observations whose distribution is highly correlated with the observation process warton et al 2013 guillera arroita 2017 let us put ourselves in the place of a practitioner wanting to model the distribution of a species whose observations come from citizen science with presence only data let us say that the ecology of the species is relatively well known first we have to address the question which is the best statistical framework to model my data this question has been largely explored aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 guillera arroita et al 2015 duque lazo et al 2016 and in recent years point process models ppms have shown their strength as a unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models sdms with many advantages in model implementation and interpretation which can be obscured in popular software platforms such as maxent renner et al 2015 stirling et al 2016 indeed easy to use click button platforms such as maxent philips et al 2017 and the biomod r package thuiller et al 2009 have been described as black box techniques because users can ignore the details and nuances of their models and default parameters renner and warton 2013 ahmed et al 2015 philips et al 2017 point process models on the contrary let the user have complete control over what its being modelled renner et al 2015 in particular ppms provide clearer interpretations of the model output as an intensity of reported observations per unit area and as well as clarity regarding necessary choices to implement presence only models such as the choice of quadrature points also referred to as pseudo absences or background points then comes the crucial question do i have enough data to model the distribution of the species virgili et al 2018 a question that is not new and which can be translated into the important matter of trust in models or model accuracy and particularly in their specific contexts stockwell and peterson 2002 guillera arroita et al 2015 ross et al 2015 when fitting a point process model we estimate the intensity of species records as a function of the chosen environmental covariates the stability of this intensity surface depends not only on the number of records but also on the choice of covariates used to characterize it indeed reducing the number of candidate variables helps to explain which biological factors are important in determining a species distribution for example maxent software by default uses a lasso penalty which shrinks parameter estimates β toward zero while the lasso penalty is known to improve predictive performance and give numerical stability the default penalty chosen by maxent software is ad hoc the choice of the penalty criterion can have consequences in model interpretation as reducing the number of candidate variables helps to explain which biological factors are important in determining a species distribution but some criteria impose larger penalties than others i e bic msi renner 2013 in the point process framework the spatstat package baddeley and turner 2005 baddeley et al 2015 offers a number of tools to test model reliability including significance levels for implemented variables and standard deviations of the predicted intensity however in spatstat regularization tools aimed at boosting predictive performance through reducing model complexity such as lasso penalties are not available in the ppm lasso framework of the ppmlasso package a number of lasso type penalties are included in order to shrink coefficients of point process models in a data driven way which tends to provide superior predictive performance to maxent renner and warton 2013 nevertheless there are no tools to explore model stability within the ppm lasso framework our goal was to develop a toolbox analogous to that of the spatstat package therefore writing new functions to explore model stability for models fitted with the ppmlasso package that would expand the toolkit for practitioners and researchers who want to have more control over their models based on the french citizen science program en quête d insectes lucane cerf volant or stag beetle quest we explored different methods to assess model stability or the capacity to predict correctly all presence data within the ppm perspective fitted with a lasso penalty and observer bias corrections thanks to the extensive dataset offered by this dynamic program we used random subsets of increasing size to test the stability of models fitted with varying numbers of points in order to determine whether the model fitted with all points could be considered to have stabilized such methods will contribute to an increase in the usage of sdm for a wider audience of practitioners as we provide a toolbox of different r functions which may be used to explore stability of models fitted with the ppmlasso package we present a detailed tutorial as supplementary material demonstrating usage of these functions and interpretation of their output by doing so we also conducted an ecological analysis of the distribution of lucanus cervus in france 2 materials methods 2 1 data species records were obtained from the stag beetle quest citizen science program launched in 2011 and managed by the office for the insects and their environments opie meriguet et al 2012 the program is focused on the french distribution of lucanus cervus linnaeus 1758 insecta coleoptera and contains more than 16 000 records from 1905 onward data from before 2011 come from contributors who entered old records through the stag beetle quest online form the database is composed of 90 presence only data of which 82 of the records have a precise location the data retained for the study correspond to a recent and highly active period of observation from 2007 to 2017 fig 1 a thereby reducing the temporal heterogeneity of the dataset only verified observations photography based validation made by experts were used leaving a total of 2576 point locations saproxilic beetles are species which are involved in or dependent on wood decay in some european forests the lucanidae family presents the highest percentage of indicator species for dead wood amount and temperature lachat et al 2012 indeed like other exothermic insects their life traits and abundance is related to climatic variables additionally as adult activity has been considered as weather dependent fremlin and fremlin 2010 we hypothesized that their sightings observations would be as well therefore to model the distribution of lucanus cervus we used six environmental variables 2 climate variables from worldclim hijmans et al 2005 fick and hijmans 2017 and four land use variables from the corine land cover department of data and statistical studies of the ministry of ecology france 2012 and hilda databases fuch et al 2013 2014 2015 table 1 climatic variables were modelled with linear interaction and quadratic terms while land use defined as proportion of the landscape cover within grid cells and observer bias variables were entered as linear terms leading to a total of 10 covariates variables were chosen based on the literature thomaes et al 2008 hawes 2008 irmler et al 2010 frank et al 2017 and our expertise and verified if in the suite of variables no two variables have a pearson correlation r 0 7 because presence only data are prone to observer bias in which the observed pattern of points reflects not only the distribution of the species but also the distribution of the observers we added an observer bias variable it is common to use distances to roads or to natural areas for this purpose renner et al 2015 fisher phelps et al 2017 nevertheless in our particular case points seemed to be clustered around cities which led us to include the natural logarithm of human population density as an observer bias variable assuming that the species was reported more when human population density was higher therefore we included the human population variable from the sedac dataset 2016 all variables were available at 1 km x 1 km resolution table 1 2 2 sdm framework the m 2576 stag beetle locations denoted by s were modelled with a poisson point process model under this model we assume that the expected number of stag beetle presence reportings per unit area called the intensity μ s varies spatially therefore indexed by location s according to environmental conditions x s and a term related to the observation process z s ecologically speaking this intensity is not a probability of occurrence but a measure proportional to the abundance per unit area for the considered species renner et al 2015 throughout an area in our case the intensity of points was fitted as a log linear model of the predictors warton et al 2013 renner et al 2015 such predictors were split into two categories environmental variables x s parameterized by β and the observer bias variable z s parameterized by gamma γ eq 1 1 ln μ s x s β z s γ the parameters of the model are typically fitted via maximizing the log likelihood expression below eq 2 cressie 1993 which includes an intractable integral µ 2 because the integral µ is intractable it must be approximated via numerical quadrature eq 3 3 this is done by introducing a set of n quadrature points s 0 s m 1 s m n throughout along a regular grid and associating with the species locations s and the quadrature points s 0 a set of quadrature weights w w 1 w m n leading to the approximate likelihood below eq 4 berman and turner 1992 4 l β γ s i i m n w i y i ln μ s i μ s i in eq 4 y i i i i m w i in other words yi is equal to 1 over the quadrature weight if si is one of the presence points and 0 if si is one of the quadrature points quadrature points were initially placed on a regular 1 km x 1 km grid however initial analysis of the data with the findres function of ppmlasso suggested that we did not need to fit models at such a fine resolution as the maximized log likelihood appeared to stabilize at a spatial resolution of 4 km x 4 km see appendix s1 in supporting information fig s1 1 which we hereby used in all of our models in order to reduce the time and computer power needed to run the analysis improving the efficiency of the analysis renner and warton 2013 in our case we used 10 covariates to model the observed pattern of stag beetle locations with so many covariates we run the risk of overfitting the model as some may not be informative of the distribution of the observed records therefore we incorporated a lasso penalty tibshirani 1996 which shrinks coefficients toward zero and in some cases may set some coefficients to be exactly zero effectively removing the associated covariates from the model renner et al in press we fitted regularization paths of 200 poisson ppms with increasing lasso penalties and chose the model with the smallest model selection criterion here bic analyses were performed in r 4 0 2 r development core team 2020 using the ppmlasso package renner and warton 2013 and different r functions which were written to establish intensity and coefficient measures these functions are the stability assessment toolbox hereafter referred to as diagnostic tools code simulated data and a tutorial illustrating use of this code are provided in the following github reposotory appendix sdm ppm stability functions the tutorial is also available in the supplementary material 2 3 diagnostic tools we evaluated the alignment of the fitted model using all available points with models fitted to random subsets of the available points with varying size using the aforementioned diagnostic tools in this way we can assess the number of points required to ensure reasonable trust in the fitted models our main idea was to assess model stability and congruence in the ecological information inferred from the models therefore 1000 randomizations were run in r for each experiment for each number of subsampled points n 50 100 200 500 1000 fig 2 by simulating a number of subsamples from the whole dataset available we reproduced a general framework of ecological studies where the observed dataset is a subset of the whole species pattern the diagnostic tools we propose may be broadly divided into two categories tools that measure stability of the fitted intensity surface μ s and tools that measure alignment of the fitted coefficients β and γ 2 3 1 intensity measures the first set of diagnostic tools assess stability of the fitted intensity surface μ s as this intensity surface is typically the primary output of a species distribution model knowing whether the model which produced it can be assumed to have stabilized is an important consideration we do this by exploring trends in the intensity surface as subset size changes let μ i n s be the fitted intensity of the ith subset of size n at location s as we will consider multiple subset sizes n 50 100 200 500 1000 we would expect the range of these raw fitted intensities μ i n s to expand as subset size n increases consequently we rescale these fitted intensities to achieve a common scale because these tools are used to assess stability of a model fitted with the full set of m species points we will define the rescaled fitted intensity μ i n m s to have the same scaling as the model which uses all m points as follows 5 μ i n m s m n μ i n s here we present five diagnostic measures of intensity surface stability which are in the diagnosticfunctions r file in the supplementary material standard deviation of the intensity the fitted model produces an estimate of intensity at each species location in s and each quadrature point in s 0 as each subset is randomly sampled we can examine trends in the variation of intensity as subset size changes we can thus calculate the standard deviation of the rescaled intensities μ i n m s across all random subsets and visualize them in a map produced by the function sd plot these standard deviations can be used to quantify the likely variation in intensity at each location s for a given subsample size average rescaled intensity we can calculate the average rescaled intensity μ a v g n m s across all random subsets of size n mapping these can indicate when the fitted intensity has stabilized we provide a function avg mu plot in order to map the rescaled intensity across subsets imse the integrated mean square error imse may be used to measure alignment between the fitted intensity surface using the full set of m points with the rescaled intensity of a subset because we expect the intensity surface to be right skewed we implement the imse as a sum of squared differences between the natural logarithm of the fitted rescaled intensities at the quadrature points as follows 6 i m s e μ i n m j m 1 m n ln μ s j ln μ i n m s j 2 the higher the imse the greater the dissimilarity between the fitted intensity surfaces across subsets this tool can also be used to inform about model stability we would expect imse to decrease as subset size increases we provide a function imse plot to visualize the imse for each simulated subset and a trace plot of the mean across subsets correlation we can also measure alignment between the fitted intensity surface using the full set of m points with the rescaled intensity of a subset with a correlation measure using either pearson s correlation coefficient or non parametric alternatives such as spearman s rho or kendall s tau unlike imse correlation measures are bound between 1 and 1 and this scale free property allows judgment to be made about the raw correlation value in addition to relative comparisons across subset sizes we provide a function corr plot to visualize the chosen correlation measure for each simulated subset and a trace plot of the mean across subsets quantile misalignment maps while the previous tools are useful summaries of the overall alignment between the fitted intensities of the model using all the points μ s with the rescaled intensities of the models fitted to the subsets μ i n m s they do not indicate where the intensity surfaces differ pontius and millones 2011 we provide a function quantilematch that produces a map of quantile misalignment between the models that use random subsets and the model that uses the full data with this function the user can supply the desired quantile cutoffs to determine the ordered categories for example if the quantiles argument is left at the default of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 locations are placed into one of five categories corresponding to quantile ranges 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 based on both the fitted intensities μ s of the model using all available points as well as the fitted intensities μ i n m s of the models using random subsets by quantifying the proportion of differences in categories for each location the quantilematch function therefore highlights regions where the relative fitted intensities tend to differ between the models fitted to random subsets and the model fitted with all of the data points 2 3 2 fitted coefficient measures ecologists interested in exploring the effects of the environmental covariates x and the observer bias covariates z on the fitted model can explore all covariate effects included in the model consequently we present two tools to measure the stability of the coefficient estimates β and γ for the environmental parameters β and the observer parameters γ let β j i n and γ k i n be the jth environmental and kth observer bias coefficient estimates of the model fitted to the ith subset of size n tools that may be used to explore stability in the coefficient estimates are as follows coefficient estimate variability as each subset is randomly sampled we can examine trends in the variation of coefficient estimates as subset size changes we can thus calculate the standard deviation of the coefficient estimates β j i n and γ k i n across all random subsets we have provided a function coef plot which constructs a scatterplot of the fitted estimates of a given coefficient across all simulated subsamples along with a trace plot of the mean in addition to the plot it outputs the mean and standard deviation of the coefficient estimates for each subset size this diagnostic tool can not only inform about model stability through its dispersion but also highlight the effect of the different variables on the intensity this second point can be of major importance for the ecological interpretation of results thus we added the function coef se plot which displays empirical standard errors of coefficient estimates along with a trace plot of the standard deviation of the fitted parameter estimates β j i n and γ k i n for each subset size across all environmental and observer bias parameters signs of coefficient estimates the sign of a coefficient estimate indicates whether it has a positive neutral or negative effect on the predicted species distribution providing insight for ecologists consequently exploring trends in the signs of the fitted coefficients can provide insight into the level of agreement in terms of ecological information across subsets we can compute the proportion of fitted coefficients that have the same sign as the model which uses all m points and thus inform about model stability we have provided a function signcoefs which outputs an array which counts the number of negative zero and positive signs for each subset size and coefficient and a function signplot to visualize bar plots of the sign of the fitted parameter estimates β j i n and γ k i n for each subset size across all environmental and observer bias parameters 3 results full results of the lucanus analysis are presented below and the supplementary material we also provide a simulated dataset and stability screening results for this dataset in a separate tutorial 3 1 predicted intensity imse and misalignment as we modelled the intensity of the stag beetle across 1000 random subsets of points for different subset sizes we compared the average intensity of each subset and the fitted intensity for the ppm which uses all 2576 points as some fitted intensities are very low we truncate intensities below 10 5 1 5 of predicted intensities by mapping the average rescaled intensity for each subset size avg mu plot function we note that a pattern appears to stabilize from n 500 points fig 3 a these maps provide point estimates of the intensity but we can also assess variability by examining maps of standard deviations of the rescaled fitted intensities sd plot function see appendix s1 in supporting information fig s1 2 moreover taken one by one visualization of intensities for models above 500 points were more consistent that those under 500 indeed for instance models based on subsets of 50 points appeared more variable between them than those using subsets of 500 points supporting information fig s1 3 such differences were also visible by plotting the average pearson correlation corr plot function between each subset s log intensity and the whole model with all available points was moderately good at 200 points r 0 7 and nearly perfect r 0 97 for models beyond 500 points fig 3b furthermore correlation between subsampled models and the whole model was greater when the subset contained more than 100 points and consistently above 0 9 with 500 points or more 99 4 of correlations greater than 0 9 when n 500 these results were confirmed by the log imse of each model across subsets imse plot function fig 3c indeed we can see how the average log imse by subset significantly decreases from around 10 7 at 50 and 100 points to 6 1 at 1000 points indeed pairwise comparisons of imse are all significantly different at the 0 1 level t test however we noticed that the lasso penalty shrank most of the coefficients to zero in models with 200 points or less leading to greater differences which lead to high imse furthermore regarding the quantile matching quantilematch function we observed that the level of misalignment is initially very high because most of the models for subset sizes n 50 and n 100 set all coefficients to 0 fig 4 once we reach a subset size of n 500 the level of misalignment is much lower even at n 1000 however there are certain regions where there is relatively high misalignment therefore the interpretation of the intensity surfaces should be more prudent in such areas 3 2 covariate effects β dispersion and ecological agreement the plots of the fitted coefficients coef plot function likewise suggest that the model stabilizes when the subset size reaches 500 as the mean values of β j i n appeared to converge to the values β j obtained from fitting a model to the full set of 2576 points and the variation in β j i n likewise appeared to decrease with increasing subset size supporting information figure s1 4 indeed the standard deviation of coefficient estimates β consistently decreased when the number of points increased beyond 200 coef sd plot function fig 5 a this result can be seen as congruent with the measures of intensity from section 3 1 which suggested the stability of models with a number of points of 500 or more it may seem counterintuitive that the average standard deviation in some cases increases from n 50 to n 200 and then decreases fig 5a as many of the coefficient estimates are set to 0 for models of subset size n 50 this has the effect of decreasing the standard deviation across all simulations those coefficients which are non zero tend to have a large spread as shown in the graph with a large range of values for β j i 50 supporting information figure s1 3 in other words there is a strong pull toward 0 for n 50 as shown in the analysis of coefficient signs in the next subsection but those coefficients which are not set to 0 tend to be more variable as subset size increases the range of the fitted coefficients tends to decrease but as fewer coefficients are set to 0 the overall standard deviation may be higher across all 1000 simulated subsets for n 100 and n 200 once the subset size reaches 500 however the range becomes small enough that the overall standard deviation starts to decrease despite very few coefficients being set to 0 the sign of the fitted coefficients β signplot function informed us about the contribution of each environmental variable to the potential distribution of the stag beetle in france fig 5b supporting information figure s1 4 mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation rate the percentage of forest cover in the past and the current presence of broad leaved forest and the natural logarithm of the human population were positively associated with the presence of the species on the other hand the percentage of arable land and coniferous forest as the quadratic term of the temperature and the interaction term of climatic variables were negatively associated with lucanus presence the sign of the fitted coefficient estimate γ log of the human population variable were always 100 positive whatever the subset size supporting information figure s1 5 hence we looked at the agreement between the signs of β and γ across subset models as shown in fig 5b with the signs of the coefficients from the model using all the available data for the temperature or ancient forest variables for instance even if the coefficients were shrunk to zero in many cases particularly models with less than 200 points the sign was always positive when it was non zero coefficients of the other variables fluctuate from positive to negative signs particularly for models with 200 points or less for example the estimated coefficients for precipitation or the interaction term were equally negative and positive until models with 500 points or more therefore getting sign congruency is a sign of model stability nevertheless we got a clear sign tendency with 200 points and more the tools are therefore congruent in their conclusions to model the stag beetle distribution at the french mainland scale and with the given choice of variables and lasso penalty criterion 500 points are needed to get stabilized models and consequently in our point of view also trustworthy conclusions with a different choice of variables the number of points necessary for reliable conclusions may differ in general the more variables included in the model the more variation is expected in the fitted intensity surfaces requiring larger numbers of points to stabilize regardless the tools presented here can be tailored to different spatial scales and choices of variables to investigate model stability 4 discussion 4 1 assessing ppm stabilization by departing from our particular data and environmental context we were able to explore the question of at what point do my models stabilize our suite of diagnostic tools provides a way to assess the stability of the model in its particular context hence this methodology could be used in order to verify how stable a poisson point process model fitted with a lasso type penalty is moreover if the models stabilize at a relatively low number of points it might mean that the dataset could be divided into shorter periods and used for species distribution analysis across time for instance in our case 500 points seem enough to have a reasonably trustworthy model of the stag beetle we could have potentially split the dataset in two and see the differences in the distribution between 2007 and 2012 and 2012 2017 but in our case temporal heterogeneity of the records did not permit this participation in the stag beetle quest significantly increased in 2015 and since the average number of records per year is 1000 this implies that a future comparison of models for different time periods could be possible as these diagnostic tools rely on exploring stability across different subset sizes it is important to consider which subset sizes to specify in the simulations in our context we fitted models using 10 covariates with over 2500 point locations we considered subset sizes ranging from n 50 to n 1000 thus representing between about 2 and 40 of the total number of points indeed allowing the maximum subset size to be too large could give a false impression of stability due to the fact that there are fewer possible subsets and an increasing number of shared records across subsets for instance if we allow the subset size to be 80 of the number of available records different subsets are guaranteed to share at least 60 of the records in common as a general recommendation we advise practitioners to consider subsets ranging in size from a minimum greater than the number of covariates and a maximum less than half of the total number of available records though this may be quite limiting for data sets with few available records relative to the number of covariates while there are certainly other ways to create subsamples aside from sampling at uniform from the available points i e half split or block crossed validation roberts et al 2017 which are certainly preferable for validating models to independent data such schemes do not seem appropriate for our work in our model we also include a term related to sampling bias and incorporating different subsampling schemes could make it difficult to disentangle effects of the environment from effects of this sampling bias in this work we want to call attention to the fact that any given set of observed points represents some likely biased subsample of the true point pattern and by sampling randomly we thereby preserve any underlying bias patterns of the observed data set without direct information regarding sampling effort creating random subsamples from the observed data set thus mimics the setting in which the observed point pattern is some random subsample of the true point pattern we also want to highlight that the criterion we used to select the optimal lasso penalty was the bic as we have seen that stability is greatly influenced by the proportion of models for which the coefficients are set to 0 the choice of the criterion for the lasso penalty will also impact the model complexity and hence the number of points necessary for the models to adequately stabilize if we had instead chosen the aic which tends to choose lower penalties than the bic model stabilization might have been achieved with smaller subset sizes consequently the effect of criterion choice for the lasso penalty on model stability is a potential area of future research if after using these tools the model does not appear to have adequately stabilized we recommend results be interpreted with corresponding caution particularly when the model may be used to inform management or conservation actions greater model stability could be achieved by considering a smaller set of covariates acknowledging that this would lead to less sophisticated ecological understanding of the species distribution and the environmental factors that drive it it is important to note that the tools presented in this paper require an adequate number of points in the original pattern to create reasonably sized subsets when presence records are rare around the same number as the number of modelled covariates it is impractical to produce subsets to assess model stability as there is an increased risk of model convergence problems when fitting models with small numbers of points however the spirit of this paper is to explore questions related to the amount of trust that can be placed in a fitted model and a model fitted using a small number of records is unlikely to be very informative or reliable our approach exploits already existent tools in the ppmlasso package and can therefore be already used in principle these tools could also be adapted for use with models fitted using other software platforms such as spatstat however these functions were specifically built to extract information from objects with a ppmlasso class so adaptation of the functions to objects with other classes may be challenging moreover spatstat provides its own functions to assess model stability our functions explore model stability through subsetting largely due to the fact that classical statistical estimators such as standard errors are not available when fitting models with a lasso penalty and the ppmlasso package is specifically designed for the setting of our paper in fitting species distribution models with lasso penalties this data driven scrutiny of sample size and model stability is more tailored to analysis of different data sets than ad hoc rules for choosing the number of points to model a certain species moreover it helps us explore trust in the conclusions from the fitted model particularly for those who use sdms to inform decisions for conservation 4 2 ecological insight lucanus cervus is a saproxylophagous beetle of conservation interest at the european scale cited in the 3rd appendix of the berne convention of 1979 and the 2nd appendix of the habitat directive of 1992 that is subservient to dead or decaying wood it is observable near old trees in forest but also in wooded and urban areas it is a relatively common species in france and more largely in europe paulian and baraud 1982 bensettiti and gaudillat 2004 using the sdm framework to have ecological insight about the distribution pattern of stag beetles we observed that climate variables dominated the spatial characterization of the species particularly the annual temperature with β coefficients furthest from 0 this was not a surprise as adults activity is considered weather dependent particularly to conditions of temperature and humidity fremlin and fremlin 2010 lachat et al 2012 indeed the whole model supporting information figure s1 2 shows that the species drastically rarifies in mountainous regions where temperatures are lower and humidity higher massif of the cevennes the pyrenees and the alps as the overall alignment between the fitted intensities of the models above 500 points is high less than 20 misalignment fig 4 in the mountainous areas we can validate that lucanus cervus sightings are weather related land use plays a significant but secondary role the extent of agriculture an environmental variable previously thought to be unfavorable for the species was useful the influence of broad leaved vs coniferous forests became unambiguous respectively positive and negative above 50 points which may be due to the mixture of trees in forests and the way in which corine land cover classifies landscape features through a visual interpretation of satellite images at small scale the abundance of ancient forest was positively associated and plays a significant role in the lucanus distribution among the land use variables perhaps it is due to the selection of local broad leaved oaks and beeches bazire and gadant 1991 and availability of dead wood in such plots of old forest the influence of this variable confirms the influence of the landscape matrix and its history in the current distribution of the stag beetle as old growth deciduous forests favor the presence of this saproxylophagous species it also underlines the inertia of forest systems and should warn us about the potential consequences of the large domination of coniferous plantations occurring for the last 70 years in france bazire and gadant 1991 boutefeu 2005 in france broad leaved forests are mainly in the plains or at medium altitude coniferous stands are mainly in mountainous areas in the landes highlands and in recent plantations in western france garnier et al 2018 it is known that coniferous forests are not favorable for this species even if some lucanus can breed on pinus spp and thuja spp paulian and baraud 1982 bensettiti and gaudillat 2004 the bar plots of the sign of the fitted parameter estimates showed us that above 500 points the sign is mainly negative ecologically we expected a negative sign and we only consistently see it from n 200 onward so models fitted with fewer than 100 points could have led to conclusions contradictory to ecological knowledge in interaction with other variables such as the climatic ones this can also explain the absence of lucanus cervus in mountainous areas and could be therefore explored in future models complementary variables such as biotic interactions with fungi in decaying wood or other invertebrate species wood species selection for breeding or micro climatic variables which are important for invertebrate development and suggested as important for saproxilic beetles diniz filho et al 2010 quinto et al 2015 ulyshen et al 2017 garrick et al 2019 were not included as they were not available the importance of the bias covariate human population was significant showing once again the importance of variables that can correct for sampling bias to accurately model species distributions the conclusions inferred from a fitted sdm may be incomplete from an ecological point of view or even inaccurate at small scales here we want to underline the important role of experts of the target species and the fact that models approximate a complex reality and should be used with parsimony and caution especially in conservation contexts furthermore we encourage practitioners to always keep in mind the areas where categories of intensity are most likely to differ between the models fitted to random subsets and the model fitted with all available points misalignment map in our case precautions must be taken before interpreting the whole model in the southwest of france west part of the landes highlands and in particular in the east near the border with switzerland massif du jura even though in this second area we had some observations fig 1 5 conclusion ppms not only offer a unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models with many advantages in model implementation and interpretation but also possess a number of ready to use diagnostic tools that can inform about model consistency and stability without any rule of thumb or an obscure single metric the number of needed points in a particular environmental and spatial context to achieve model stability can be explored from perspectives relating to both the fitted intensity surface and the fitted model coefficients all of the diagnostic tools are congruent and can be used for any kind of point process model above all we recommend collaboration between species experts and researchers in ecology and statistics to build realistic field informed trustworthy models and test them before applying them thanks to the diagnostic tools offered by ppms a constructive step by step process may allow us to rapidly increase our knowledge of species distributions even for the less studied ones authorship statement cl and pjr conceived of the idea of exploring stability with point process models fitted with lasso type penalties as well as the choice of lucanus cervus as an

24719,citizen science programs and particularly atlas schemes based on opportunistic biological records are very important sources of data for species distribution models and conservation nevertheless these data are prone to bias particularly when they come from less popular or hard to detect identify species such as insects with such biased data it is important to evaluate the stability of the model predictions in recent years point process models ppms have shown their strength as a unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models with many advantages in model implementation and interpretation ppms are closely connected to methods already in widespread use in ecology such as maxent and to logistic regression and benefit from being more transparent about resource selection and absence handling moreover there is a well developed set of tools to fit these models and assess various features of the underlying model including model stability however such tools are currently unavailable when point process models are fitted with a lasso penalty which has been shown to improve predictive performance based on the french citizen science program stag beetle quest we propose new methods to assess model stability in this context the ultimate goal was to develop a set of functions to analyze ppm models with lasso penalties fitted with presence only data to assess model stability we randomly sampled different subsets of locations with varying size from the whole dataset and used the proposed tools to compare fitted intensities and model coefficients all the developed measures are complementary and can be used to identify at what number of point locations the model stabilizes which will be dependent on the dataset our work presents a new toolbox to explore questions around model stability based on the number of locations in the context of point process models with a lasso penalty and confirms once more the use of the point process modeling framework as a flexible and unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models keywords species distribution models point process models lasso diagnostic tools r functions lucanus cervus 1 introduction to be able to estimate accurately the decline of biodiversity we need to be equipped with reliable tools and methods allowing a good characterization of population trends methods should provide a picture of the distribution of species through space and time from data which represent a subsample of the true species populations this is especially necessary for organisms that are hard to detect in their environment such as insects donaldson et al 2016 leandro et al 2017 species distribution models sdms have become important methods to inform policy makers and conservation practitioners about biodiversity trends mapping the patterns of biodiversity sdms can be used in land use planning leading to prioritization of conservation strategies devictor et al 2010 guisan et al 2013 they have also been put forward as pivotal tools for the appropriate evaluation of conservation status of insects diniz filho et al 2010 cardoso et al 2011 leandro et al 2017 in order to fit a sdm a substantial number of recorded locations is typically necessary one source of data that can be used to fit an sdm is a list of locations found in biodiversity atlas schemes and citizen science programs but such data involve the attendance of particular questions related to the observation process alabri 2010 isaac and pockok 2015 powney and isaac 2015 indeed data can come in a number of formats the two most common being 1 presence absence data which implies a clear sampling protocol and a greater effort from the observer when cryptic species are considered and 2 presence only data presence only data are cheaper and consequently more widely available than presence absence data however they are more prone to bias due to the way they are collected presence only data can be opportunistic observations whose distribution is highly correlated with the observation process warton et al 2013 guillera arroita 2017 let us put ourselves in the place of a practitioner wanting to model the distribution of a species whose observations come from citizen science with presence only data let us say that the ecology of the species is relatively well known first we have to address the question which is the best statistical framework to model my data this question has been largely explored aguirre gutiérrez et al 2013 guillera arroita et al 2015 duque lazo et al 2016 and in recent years point process models ppms have shown their strength as a unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models sdms with many advantages in model implementation and interpretation which can be obscured in popular software platforms such as maxent renner et al 2015 stirling et al 2016 indeed easy to use click button platforms such as maxent philips et al 2017 and the biomod r package thuiller et al 2009 have been described as black box techniques because users can ignore the details and nuances of their models and default parameters renner and warton 2013 ahmed et al 2015 philips et al 2017 point process models on the contrary let the user have complete control over what its being modelled renner et al 2015 in particular ppms provide clearer interpretations of the model output as an intensity of reported observations per unit area and as well as clarity regarding necessary choices to implement presence only models such as the choice of quadrature points also referred to as pseudo absences or background points then comes the crucial question do i have enough data to model the distribution of the species virgili et al 2018 a question that is not new and which can be translated into the important matter of trust in models or model accuracy and particularly in their specific contexts stockwell and peterson 2002 guillera arroita et al 2015 ross et al 2015 when fitting a point process model we estimate the intensity of species records as a function of the chosen environmental covariates the stability of this intensity surface depends not only on the number of records but also on the choice of covariates used to characterize it indeed reducing the number of candidate variables helps to explain which biological factors are important in determining a species distribution for example maxent software by default uses a lasso penalty which shrinks parameter estimates β toward zero while the lasso penalty is known to improve predictive performance and give numerical stability the default penalty chosen by maxent software is ad hoc the choice of the penalty criterion can have consequences in model interpretation as reducing the number of candidate variables helps to explain which biological factors are important in determining a species distribution but some criteria impose larger penalties than others i e bic msi renner 2013 in the point process framework the spatstat package baddeley and turner 2005 baddeley et al 2015 offers a number of tools to test model reliability including significance levels for implemented variables and standard deviations of the predicted intensity however in spatstat regularization tools aimed at boosting predictive performance through reducing model complexity such as lasso penalties are not available in the ppm lasso framework of the ppmlasso package a number of lasso type penalties are included in order to shrink coefficients of point process models in a data driven way which tends to provide superior predictive performance to maxent renner and warton 2013 nevertheless there are no tools to explore model stability within the ppm lasso framework our goal was to develop a toolbox analogous to that of the spatstat package therefore writing new functions to explore model stability for models fitted with the ppmlasso package that would expand the toolkit for practitioners and researchers who want to have more control over their models based on the french citizen science program en quête d insectes lucane cerf volant or stag beetle quest we explored different methods to assess model stability or the capacity to predict correctly all presence data within the ppm perspective fitted with a lasso penalty and observer bias corrections thanks to the extensive dataset offered by this dynamic program we used random subsets of increasing size to test the stability of models fitted with varying numbers of points in order to determine whether the model fitted with all points could be considered to have stabilized such methods will contribute to an increase in the usage of sdm for a wider audience of practitioners as we provide a toolbox of different r functions which may be used to explore stability of models fitted with the ppmlasso package we present a detailed tutorial as supplementary material demonstrating usage of these functions and interpretation of their output by doing so we also conducted an ecological analysis of the distribution of lucanus cervus in france 2 materials methods 2 1 data species records were obtained from the stag beetle quest citizen science program launched in 2011 and managed by the office for the insects and their environments opie meriguet et al 2012 the program is focused on the french distribution of lucanus cervus linnaeus 1758 insecta coleoptera and contains more than 16 000 records from 1905 onward data from before 2011 come from contributors who entered old records through the stag beetle quest online form the database is composed of 90 presence only data of which 82 of the records have a precise location the data retained for the study correspond to a recent and highly active period of observation from 2007 to 2017 fig 1 a thereby reducing the temporal heterogeneity of the dataset only verified observations photography based validation made by experts were used leaving a total of 2576 point locations saproxilic beetles are species which are involved in or dependent on wood decay in some european forests the lucanidae family presents the highest percentage of indicator species for dead wood amount and temperature lachat et al 2012 indeed like other exothermic insects their life traits and abundance is related to climatic variables additionally as adult activity has been considered as weather dependent fremlin and fremlin 2010 we hypothesized that their sightings observations would be as well therefore to model the distribution of lucanus cervus we used six environmental variables 2 climate variables from worldclim hijmans et al 2005 fick and hijmans 2017 and four land use variables from the corine land cover department of data and statistical studies of the ministry of ecology france 2012 and hilda databases fuch et al 2013 2014 2015 table 1 climatic variables were modelled with linear interaction and quadratic terms while land use defined as proportion of the landscape cover within grid cells and observer bias variables were entered as linear terms leading to a total of 10 covariates variables were chosen based on the literature thomaes et al 2008 hawes 2008 irmler et al 2010 frank et al 2017 and our expertise and verified if in the suite of variables no two variables have a pearson correlation r 0 7 because presence only data are prone to observer bias in which the observed pattern of points reflects not only the distribution of the species but also the distribution of the observers we added an observer bias variable it is common to use distances to roads or to natural areas for this purpose renner et al 2015 fisher phelps et al 2017 nevertheless in our particular case points seemed to be clustered around cities which led us to include the natural logarithm of human population density as an observer bias variable assuming that the species was reported more when human population density was higher therefore we included the human population variable from the sedac dataset 2016 all variables were available at 1 km x 1 km resolution table 1 2 2 sdm framework the m 2576 stag beetle locations denoted by s were modelled with a poisson point process model under this model we assume that the expected number of stag beetle presence reportings per unit area called the intensity μ s varies spatially therefore indexed by location s according to environmental conditions x s and a term related to the observation process z s ecologically speaking this intensity is not a probability of occurrence but a measure proportional to the abundance per unit area for the considered species renner et al 2015 throughout an area in our case the intensity of points was fitted as a log linear model of the predictors warton et al 2013 renner et al 2015 such predictors were split into two categories environmental variables x s parameterized by β and the observer bias variable z s parameterized by gamma γ eq 1 1 ln μ s x s β z s γ the parameters of the model are typically fitted via maximizing the log likelihood expression below eq 2 cressie 1993 which includes an intractable integral µ 2 because the integral µ is intractable it must be approximated via numerical quadrature eq 3 3 this is done by introducing a set of n quadrature points s 0 s m 1 s m n throughout along a regular grid and associating with the species locations s and the quadrature points s 0 a set of quadrature weights w w 1 w m n leading to the approximate likelihood below eq 4 berman and turner 1992 4 l β γ s i i m n w i y i ln μ s i μ s i in eq 4 y i i i i m w i in other words yi is equal to 1 over the quadrature weight if si is one of the presence points and 0 if si is one of the quadrature points quadrature points were initially placed on a regular 1 km x 1 km grid however initial analysis of the data with the findres function of ppmlasso suggested that we did not need to fit models at such a fine resolution as the maximized log likelihood appeared to stabilize at a spatial resolution of 4 km x 4 km see appendix s1 in supporting information fig s1 1 which we hereby used in all of our models in order to reduce the time and computer power needed to run the analysis improving the efficiency of the analysis renner and warton 2013 in our case we used 10 covariates to model the observed pattern of stag beetle locations with so many covariates we run the risk of overfitting the model as some may not be informative of the distribution of the observed records therefore we incorporated a lasso penalty tibshirani 1996 which shrinks coefficients toward zero and in some cases may set some coefficients to be exactly zero effectively removing the associated covariates from the model renner et al in press we fitted regularization paths of 200 poisson ppms with increasing lasso penalties and chose the model with the smallest model selection criterion here bic analyses were performed in r 4 0 2 r development core team 2020 using the ppmlasso package renner and warton 2013 and different r functions which were written to establish intensity and coefficient measures these functions are the stability assessment toolbox hereafter referred to as diagnostic tools code simulated data and a tutorial illustrating use of this code are provided in the following github reposotory appendix sdm ppm stability functions the tutorial is also available in the supplementary material 2 3 diagnostic tools we evaluated the alignment of the fitted model using all available points with models fitted to random subsets of the available points with varying size using the aforementioned diagnostic tools in this way we can assess the number of points required to ensure reasonable trust in the fitted models our main idea was to assess model stability and congruence in the ecological information inferred from the models therefore 1000 randomizations were run in r for each experiment for each number of subsampled points n 50 100 200 500 1000 fig 2 by simulating a number of subsamples from the whole dataset available we reproduced a general framework of ecological studies where the observed dataset is a subset of the whole species pattern the diagnostic tools we propose may be broadly divided into two categories tools that measure stability of the fitted intensity surface μ s and tools that measure alignment of the fitted coefficients β and γ 2 3 1 intensity measures the first set of diagnostic tools assess stability of the fitted intensity surface μ s as this intensity surface is typically the primary output of a species distribution model knowing whether the model which produced it can be assumed to have stabilized is an important consideration we do this by exploring trends in the intensity surface as subset size changes let μ i n s be the fitted intensity of the ith subset of size n at location s as we will consider multiple subset sizes n 50 100 200 500 1000 we would expect the range of these raw fitted intensities μ i n s to expand as subset size n increases consequently we rescale these fitted intensities to achieve a common scale because these tools are used to assess stability of a model fitted with the full set of m species points we will define the rescaled fitted intensity μ i n m s to have the same scaling as the model which uses all m points as follows 5 μ i n m s m n μ i n s here we present five diagnostic measures of intensity surface stability which are in the diagnosticfunctions r file in the supplementary material standard deviation of the intensity the fitted model produces an estimate of intensity at each species location in s and each quadrature point in s 0 as each subset is randomly sampled we can examine trends in the variation of intensity as subset size changes we can thus calculate the standard deviation of the rescaled intensities μ i n m s across all random subsets and visualize them in a map produced by the function sd plot these standard deviations can be used to quantify the likely variation in intensity at each location s for a given subsample size average rescaled intensity we can calculate the average rescaled intensity μ a v g n m s across all random subsets of size n mapping these can indicate when the fitted intensity has stabilized we provide a function avg mu plot in order to map the rescaled intensity across subsets imse the integrated mean square error imse may be used to measure alignment between the fitted intensity surface using the full set of m points with the rescaled intensity of a subset because we expect the intensity surface to be right skewed we implement the imse as a sum of squared differences between the natural logarithm of the fitted rescaled intensities at the quadrature points as follows 6 i m s e μ i n m j m 1 m n ln μ s j ln μ i n m s j 2 the higher the imse the greater the dissimilarity between the fitted intensity surfaces across subsets this tool can also be used to inform about model stability we would expect imse to decrease as subset size increases we provide a function imse plot to visualize the imse for each simulated subset and a trace plot of the mean across subsets correlation we can also measure alignment between the fitted intensity surface using the full set of m points with the rescaled intensity of a subset with a correlation measure using either pearson s correlation coefficient or non parametric alternatives such as spearman s rho or kendall s tau unlike imse correlation measures are bound between 1 and 1 and this scale free property allows judgment to be made about the raw correlation value in addition to relative comparisons across subset sizes we provide a function corr plot to visualize the chosen correlation measure for each simulated subset and a trace plot of the mean across subsets quantile misalignment maps while the previous tools are useful summaries of the overall alignment between the fitted intensities of the model using all the points μ s with the rescaled intensities of the models fitted to the subsets μ i n m s they do not indicate where the intensity surfaces differ pontius and millones 2011 we provide a function quantilematch that produces a map of quantile misalignment between the models that use random subsets and the model that uses the full data with this function the user can supply the desired quantile cutoffs to determine the ordered categories for example if the quantiles argument is left at the default of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 locations are placed into one of five categories corresponding to quantile ranges 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 based on both the fitted intensities μ s of the model using all available points as well as the fitted intensities μ i n m s of the models using random subsets by quantifying the proportion of differences in categories for each location the quantilematch function therefore highlights regions where the relative fitted intensities tend to differ between the models fitted to random subsets and the model fitted with all of the data points 2 3 2 fitted coefficient measures ecologists interested in exploring the effects of the environmental covariates x and the observer bias covariates z on the fitted model can explore all covariate effects included in the model consequently we present two tools to measure the stability of the coefficient estimates β and γ for the environmental parameters β and the observer parameters γ let β j i n and γ k i n be the jth environmental and kth observer bias coefficient estimates of the model fitted to the ith subset of size n tools that may be used to explore stability in the coefficient estimates are as follows coefficient estimate variability as each subset is randomly sampled we can examine trends in the variation of coefficient estimates as subset size changes we can thus calculate the standard deviation of the coefficient estimates β j i n and γ k i n across all random subsets we have provided a function coef plot which constructs a scatterplot of the fitted estimates of a given coefficient across all simulated subsamples along with a trace plot of the mean in addition to the plot it outputs the mean and standard deviation of the coefficient estimates for each subset size this diagnostic tool can not only inform about model stability through its dispersion but also highlight the effect of the different variables on the intensity this second point can be of major importance for the ecological interpretation of results thus we added the function coef se plot which displays empirical standard errors of coefficient estimates along with a trace plot of the standard deviation of the fitted parameter estimates β j i n and γ k i n for each subset size across all environmental and observer bias parameters signs of coefficient estimates the sign of a coefficient estimate indicates whether it has a positive neutral or negative effect on the predicted species distribution providing insight for ecologists consequently exploring trends in the signs of the fitted coefficients can provide insight into the level of agreement in terms of ecological information across subsets we can compute the proportion of fitted coefficients that have the same sign as the model which uses all m points and thus inform about model stability we have provided a function signcoefs which outputs an array which counts the number of negative zero and positive signs for each subset size and coefficient and a function signplot to visualize bar plots of the sign of the fitted parameter estimates β j i n and γ k i n for each subset size across all environmental and observer bias parameters 3 results full results of the lucanus analysis are presented below and the supplementary material we also provide a simulated dataset and stability screening results for this dataset in a separate tutorial 3 1 predicted intensity imse and misalignment as we modelled the intensity of the stag beetle across 1000 random subsets of points for different subset sizes we compared the average intensity of each subset and the fitted intensity for the ppm which uses all 2576 points as some fitted intensities are very low we truncate intensities below 10 5 1 5 of predicted intensities by mapping the average rescaled intensity for each subset size avg mu plot function we note that a pattern appears to stabilize from n 500 points fig 3 a these maps provide point estimates of the intensity but we can also assess variability by examining maps of standard deviations of the rescaled fitted intensities sd plot function see appendix s1 in supporting information fig s1 2 moreover taken one by one visualization of intensities for models above 500 points were more consistent that those under 500 indeed for instance models based on subsets of 50 points appeared more variable between them than those using subsets of 500 points supporting information fig s1 3 such differences were also visible by plotting the average pearson correlation corr plot function between each subset s log intensity and the whole model with all available points was moderately good at 200 points r 0 7 and nearly perfect r 0 97 for models beyond 500 points fig 3b furthermore correlation between subsampled models and the whole model was greater when the subset contained more than 100 points and consistently above 0 9 with 500 points or more 99 4 of correlations greater than 0 9 when n 500 these results were confirmed by the log imse of each model across subsets imse plot function fig 3c indeed we can see how the average log imse by subset significantly decreases from around 10 7 at 50 and 100 points to 6 1 at 1000 points indeed pairwise comparisons of imse are all significantly different at the 0 1 level t test however we noticed that the lasso penalty shrank most of the coefficients to zero in models with 200 points or less leading to greater differences which lead to high imse furthermore regarding the quantile matching quantilematch function we observed that the level of misalignment is initially very high because most of the models for subset sizes n 50 and n 100 set all coefficients to 0 fig 4 once we reach a subset size of n 500 the level of misalignment is much lower even at n 1000 however there are certain regions where there is relatively high misalignment therefore the interpretation of the intensity surfaces should be more prudent in such areas 3 2 covariate effects β dispersion and ecological agreement the plots of the fitted coefficients coef plot function likewise suggest that the model stabilizes when the subset size reaches 500 as the mean values of β j i n appeared to converge to the values β j obtained from fitting a model to the full set of 2576 points and the variation in β j i n likewise appeared to decrease with increasing subset size supporting information figure s1 4 indeed the standard deviation of coefficient estimates β consistently decreased when the number of points increased beyond 200 coef sd plot function fig 5 a this result can be seen as congruent with the measures of intensity from section 3 1 which suggested the stability of models with a number of points of 500 or more it may seem counterintuitive that the average standard deviation in some cases increases from n 50 to n 200 and then decreases fig 5a as many of the coefficient estimates are set to 0 for models of subset size n 50 this has the effect of decreasing the standard deviation across all simulations those coefficients which are non zero tend to have a large spread as shown in the graph with a large range of values for β j i 50 supporting information figure s1 3 in other words there is a strong pull toward 0 for n 50 as shown in the analysis of coefficient signs in the next subsection but those coefficients which are not set to 0 tend to be more variable as subset size increases the range of the fitted coefficients tends to decrease but as fewer coefficients are set to 0 the overall standard deviation may be higher across all 1000 simulated subsets for n 100 and n 200 once the subset size reaches 500 however the range becomes small enough that the overall standard deviation starts to decrease despite very few coefficients being set to 0 the sign of the fitted coefficients β signplot function informed us about the contribution of each environmental variable to the potential distribution of the stag beetle in france fig 5b supporting information figure s1 4 mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation rate the percentage of forest cover in the past and the current presence of broad leaved forest and the natural logarithm of the human population were positively associated with the presence of the species on the other hand the percentage of arable land and coniferous forest as the quadratic term of the temperature and the interaction term of climatic variables were negatively associated with lucanus presence the sign of the fitted coefficient estimate γ log of the human population variable were always 100 positive whatever the subset size supporting information figure s1 5 hence we looked at the agreement between the signs of β and γ across subset models as shown in fig 5b with the signs of the coefficients from the model using all the available data for the temperature or ancient forest variables for instance even if the coefficients were shrunk to zero in many cases particularly models with less than 200 points the sign was always positive when it was non zero coefficients of the other variables fluctuate from positive to negative signs particularly for models with 200 points or less for example the estimated coefficients for precipitation or the interaction term were equally negative and positive until models with 500 points or more therefore getting sign congruency is a sign of model stability nevertheless we got a clear sign tendency with 200 points and more the tools are therefore congruent in their conclusions to model the stag beetle distribution at the french mainland scale and with the given choice of variables and lasso penalty criterion 500 points are needed to get stabilized models and consequently in our point of view also trustworthy conclusions with a different choice of variables the number of points necessary for reliable conclusions may differ in general the more variables included in the model the more variation is expected in the fitted intensity surfaces requiring larger numbers of points to stabilize regardless the tools presented here can be tailored to different spatial scales and choices of variables to investigate model stability 4 discussion 4 1 assessing ppm stabilization by departing from our particular data and environmental context we were able to explore the question of at what point do my models stabilize our suite of diagnostic tools provides a way to assess the stability of the model in its particular context hence this methodology could be used in order to verify how stable a poisson point process model fitted with a lasso type penalty is moreover if the models stabilize at a relatively low number of points it might mean that the dataset could be divided into shorter periods and used for species distribution analysis across time for instance in our case 500 points seem enough to have a reasonably trustworthy model of the stag beetle we could have potentially split the dataset in two and see the differences in the distribution between 2007 and 2012 and 2012 2017 but in our case temporal heterogeneity of the records did not permit this participation in the stag beetle quest significantly increased in 2015 and since the average number of records per year is 1000 this implies that a future comparison of models for different time periods could be possible as these diagnostic tools rely on exploring stability across different subset sizes it is important to consider which subset sizes to specify in the simulations in our context we fitted models using 10 covariates with over 2500 point locations we considered subset sizes ranging from n 50 to n 1000 thus representing between about 2 and 40 of the total number of points indeed allowing the maximum subset size to be too large could give a false impression of stability due to the fact that there are fewer possible subsets and an increasing number of shared records across subsets for instance if we allow the subset size to be 80 of the number of available records different subsets are guaranteed to share at least 60 of the records in common as a general recommendation we advise practitioners to consider subsets ranging in size from a minimum greater than the number of covariates and a maximum less than half of the total number of available records though this may be quite limiting for data sets with few available records relative to the number of covariates while there are certainly other ways to create subsamples aside from sampling at uniform from the available points i e half split or block crossed validation roberts et al 2017 which are certainly preferable for validating models to independent data such schemes do not seem appropriate for our work in our model we also include a term related to sampling bias and incorporating different subsampling schemes could make it difficult to disentangle effects of the environment from effects of this sampling bias in this work we want to call attention to the fact that any given set of observed points represents some likely biased subsample of the true point pattern and by sampling randomly we thereby preserve any underlying bias patterns of the observed data set without direct information regarding sampling effort creating random subsamples from the observed data set thus mimics the setting in which the observed point pattern is some random subsample of the true point pattern we also want to highlight that the criterion we used to select the optimal lasso penalty was the bic as we have seen that stability is greatly influenced by the proportion of models for which the coefficients are set to 0 the choice of the criterion for the lasso penalty will also impact the model complexity and hence the number of points necessary for the models to adequately stabilize if we had instead chosen the aic which tends to choose lower penalties than the bic model stabilization might have been achieved with smaller subset sizes consequently the effect of criterion choice for the lasso penalty on model stability is a potential area of future research if after using these tools the model does not appear to have adequately stabilized we recommend results be interpreted with corresponding caution particularly when the model may be used to inform management or conservation actions greater model stability could be achieved by considering a smaller set of covariates acknowledging that this would lead to less sophisticated ecological understanding of the species distribution and the environmental factors that drive it it is important to note that the tools presented in this paper require an adequate number of points in the original pattern to create reasonably sized subsets when presence records are rare around the same number as the number of modelled covariates it is impractical to produce subsets to assess model stability as there is an increased risk of model convergence problems when fitting models with small numbers of points however the spirit of this paper is to explore questions related to the amount of trust that can be placed in a fitted model and a model fitted using a small number of records is unlikely to be very informative or reliable our approach exploits already existent tools in the ppmlasso package and can therefore be already used in principle these tools could also be adapted for use with models fitted using other software platforms such as spatstat however these functions were specifically built to extract information from objects with a ppmlasso class so adaptation of the functions to objects with other classes may be challenging moreover spatstat provides its own functions to assess model stability our functions explore model stability through subsetting largely due to the fact that classical statistical estimators such as standard errors are not available when fitting models with a lasso penalty and the ppmlasso package is specifically designed for the setting of our paper in fitting species distribution models with lasso penalties this data driven scrutiny of sample size and model stability is more tailored to analysis of different data sets than ad hoc rules for choosing the number of points to model a certain species moreover it helps us explore trust in the conclusions from the fitted model particularly for those who use sdms to inform decisions for conservation 4 2 ecological insight lucanus cervus is a saproxylophagous beetle of conservation interest at the european scale cited in the 3rd appendix of the berne convention of 1979 and the 2nd appendix of the habitat directive of 1992 that is subservient to dead or decaying wood it is observable near old trees in forest but also in wooded and urban areas it is a relatively common species in france and more largely in europe paulian and baraud 1982 bensettiti and gaudillat 2004 using the sdm framework to have ecological insight about the distribution pattern of stag beetles we observed that climate variables dominated the spatial characterization of the species particularly the annual temperature with β coefficients furthest from 0 this was not a surprise as adults activity is considered weather dependent particularly to conditions of temperature and humidity fremlin and fremlin 2010 lachat et al 2012 indeed the whole model supporting information figure s1 2 shows that the species drastically rarifies in mountainous regions where temperatures are lower and humidity higher massif of the cevennes the pyrenees and the alps as the overall alignment between the fitted intensities of the models above 500 points is high less than 20 misalignment fig 4 in the mountainous areas we can validate that lucanus cervus sightings are weather related land use plays a significant but secondary role the extent of agriculture an environmental variable previously thought to be unfavorable for the species was useful the influence of broad leaved vs coniferous forests became unambiguous respectively positive and negative above 50 points which may be due to the mixture of trees in forests and the way in which corine land cover classifies landscape features through a visual interpretation of satellite images at small scale the abundance of ancient forest was positively associated and plays a significant role in the lucanus distribution among the land use variables perhaps it is due to the selection of local broad leaved oaks and beeches bazire and gadant 1991 and availability of dead wood in such plots of old forest the influence of this variable confirms the influence of the landscape matrix and its history in the current distribution of the stag beetle as old growth deciduous forests favor the presence of this saproxylophagous species it also underlines the inertia of forest systems and should warn us about the potential consequences of the large domination of coniferous plantations occurring for the last 70 years in france bazire and gadant 1991 boutefeu 2005 in france broad leaved forests are mainly in the plains or at medium altitude coniferous stands are mainly in mountainous areas in the landes highlands and in recent plantations in western france garnier et al 2018 it is known that coniferous forests are not favorable for this species even if some lucanus can breed on pinus spp and thuja spp paulian and baraud 1982 bensettiti and gaudillat 2004 the bar plots of the sign of the fitted parameter estimates showed us that above 500 points the sign is mainly negative ecologically we expected a negative sign and we only consistently see it from n 200 onward so models fitted with fewer than 100 points could have led to conclusions contradictory to ecological knowledge in interaction with other variables such as the climatic ones this can also explain the absence of lucanus cervus in mountainous areas and could be therefore explored in future models complementary variables such as biotic interactions with fungi in decaying wood or other invertebrate species wood species selection for breeding or micro climatic variables which are important for invertebrate development and suggested as important for saproxilic beetles diniz filho et al 2010 quinto et al 2015 ulyshen et al 2017 garrick et al 2019 were not included as they were not available the importance of the bias covariate human population was significant showing once again the importance of variables that can correct for sampling bias to accurately model species distributions the conclusions inferred from a fitted sdm may be incomplete from an ecological point of view or even inaccurate at small scales here we want to underline the important role of experts of the target species and the fact that models approximate a complex reality and should be used with parsimony and caution especially in conservation contexts furthermore we encourage practitioners to always keep in mind the areas where categories of intensity are most likely to differ between the models fitted to random subsets and the model fitted with all available points misalignment map in our case precautions must be taken before interpreting the whole model in the southwest of france west part of the landes highlands and in particular in the east near the border with switzerland massif du jura even though in this second area we had some observations fig 1 5 conclusion ppms not only offer a unifying framework to fit presence only species distribution models with many advantages in model implementation and interpretation but also possess a number of ready to use diagnostic tools that can inform about model consistency and stability without any rule of thumb or an obscure single metric the number of needed points in a particular environmental and spatial context to achieve model stability can be explored from perspectives relating to both the fitted intensity surface and the fitted model coefficients all of the diagnostic tools are congruent and can be used for any kind of point process model above all we recommend collaboration between species experts and researchers in ecology and statistics to build realistic field informed trustworthy models and test them before applying them thanks to the diagnostic tools offered by ppms a constructive step by step process may allow us to rapidly increase our knowledge of species distributions even for the less studied ones authorship statement cl and pjr conceived of the idea of exploring stability with point process models fitted with lasso type penalties as well as the choice of lucanus cervus as an
