3120,large scale afforestation exacerbates soil water scarcity in a semiarid region of northern china causing the formation of a dried soil layer dsl and ecosystem degradation and overmature populus simonii carr 30 years degradation in the three north shelterbelt program tnsp area has recently been observed determining the relationship between degraded populus simonii carr and soil water deficit is essential for afforestation in semiarid regions we monitored soil water content swc to a 160 cm depth in an area with five degradation degrees healthy light degradation moderate degradation severe degradation and dead to investigate soil water dynamics and dsl characteristics from may 2018 to december 2021 the results showed that compared with that of healthy populus simonii carr 94 7 26 2 mm the shallow layer 0 80 cm soil water storage of severely degraded 114 1 29 9 mm and dead populus simonii carr 128 0 35 7 mm was restored by 19 4 mm and 33 3 mm respectively however the deep layer 80 160 cm swc was difficult to recover and a dsl gradually developed the dsl swc was only 9 3 11 95 the deep layer relative extractable soil water rew of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 the deep layer swc decreased with increasing degradation due to coarser soils and increased bd a greater bulk density bd and higher sand proportion reduced the soil water holding capacity poor site conditions reduced the resistance of shelterbelts causing the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr during drought therefore our results improve the understanding of the soil water dynamics and degradation mechanism of populus simonii carr providing a theoretical basis for managing and maintaining the tnsp keywords soil water content relative extractable soil water dry soil layer shelterbelt degradation afforestation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil water is a vital component of the hydrological cycle and plays a crucial role in determining ecosystem compositions and functions zhang et al 2020b afforestation alleviates environmental problems to a certain extent but increasing vegetation has great effects on the hydrological cycle deng et al 2016 meng et al 2020 ye et al 2019 natural precipitation is the sole water resource for plant growth in semiarid areas and large scale afforestation has caused soil water deficits in these regions resulting in serious ecosystem degradation dang et al 2021 shao et al 2018 soil desiccation significantly affects the physiological activity of plants chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 deep water reserves are essential for vegetation to be able to withstand dry periods in water limited areas and a severe soil water deficit could cause the degradation and mortality of plants barbeta et al 2014 the water stress that plants face becomes more serious as plants grow and influences root water uptake and plant growth brunner et al 2015 huang et al 2021 the water absorption strategy of plant deep roots in the dry season aggravate a dsl and the reduction of soil water in a dsl in turn threatens plant growth which is not conducive to the restoration of the ecological environment anderegg et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the formation of a dsl leads to insufficient soil water supply which restricts normal plant growth and causes ecosystem degradation chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 liu et al 2020 compared the water sources of populus simonii carr with different degradation degrees and found that the lack of available water may be the main reason for the degeneration of populus simonii carr previous studies have lacked long term continuous monitoring data for the soil water content swc in degraded shelterbelts therefore there is an urgent need for an evaluation of swc dynamics and their interactions in relation to shelterbelt degradation soil water is crucial in the hydrological cycle and is affected by climate dang et al 2021 han et al 2021 soil properties dai et al 2020 pan et al 2020 vegetation characteristics fang et al 2020 pollastrini et al 2016 terrain mei et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a and land use fang et al 2016 the morphology and physiology of trees have changed due to soil water deficits massonnet et al 2020 walthert et al 2020 shelterbelt degradation changes canopy structure and precipitation interception decreases as the leaf area index decreases thus changing the potential mechanism of precipitation redistribution yan et al 2020 a decrease in total leaf area also affects solar radiation input on the soil surface and subsequent soil processes such as transpiration and soil evaporation thus affecting the hydrological cycle hugehes et al 2006 deciduous trees significantly alter the water balance of forest stands by changing the ratio of water input to water output hata et al 2016 in addition during leaf senescence nutrients are resorbed from leaves to perennial organs which also affects important fluxes and may be disrupted by severe soil water deficits estiarte and pe√±uelas 2015 all noted studies state that further integration of information on shelterbelt degradation climate and soil properties is still needed to better understand changes in local swc variability the three north shelterbelt program tnsp is an important ecological project and the bashang plateau shelterbelt is critical part of the program however in recent years 4 5 of the populus simonii carr in this area have been degraded and a near die off of populus simonii carr has occurred in 1 3 of the study area resulting in a decline in ecological functions sun et al 2018 soil water deficit is the main limitation to plant growth in the semiarid areas of north china fang et al 2020 nardini et al 2013 populus simonii carr has been widely established in semiarid areas in northern china song et al 2016 however the reason why some populus simonii carr have died while others have survived drought in this particular region remains unclear hence we aimed to 1 investigate the soil water dynamics and their influencing factors of different degrees of degraded populus simonii carr 2 determine the characteristics of dsls in degraded populus simonii carr and 3 determine the bidirectional effect of shelterbelt degradation and swc through long term continuous soil water monitoring at different degraded populus simonii carr sites in addition the soil properties and dsl characteristics of each stratum among the different degraded populus simonii carr were compared to identify the cause of degradation in the shelterbelts we provided robust evidence that clarifies the interaction mechanisms between shelterbelt degradation and soil water deficits moreover we explored the potential for soil water deficit mitigation via forest management while maintaining ecological benefits 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiments were carried out at the boluosu forest farm 40 57 41 34 n 114 10 115 27 e which is located in zhangbei county hebei province china fig 1 the region has a semiarid zone continental monsoon climate and the meteorological shows the same period of rain and heat the daily precipitation and temperature were obtained from the nearest zhangbei county weather station closest to the sampling point the annual average precipitation in 2018 2021 was 438 8 mm and the cumulative precipitation during the growing season may october was 375 1 mm accounting for 85 5 of the annual average precipitation fig 2 the potential evapotranspiration was 1073 mm the mean annual temperature was 3 2 c the mean annual wind speed was 4 6 m s 1 and the mean desiccation degree was 1 3 with 132 frost free days the soil at the site is mainly sandy loam with a high sand content large areas of shelterbelts dominated by populus simonii carr were planted in the 1980 s there has been varying degrees of degradation in recent years 2 2 experimental design and investigation 2 2 1 tree selection typical populus simonii carr 30 yr were selected based on growth conditions the trees began to show recognizable symptoms of degradation that is many trees experienced defoliation and dieback from the top of the canopy we calculated the number of dead and live branches in each canopy or visually estimated the percentage of canopy dieback jacquet et al 2013 walthert et al 2020 using this as the standard we randomly selected populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation and the defoliation degree of these stands ranged from light to severe fig 3 table 1 among which dead populus simonii carr plots were completely felled after tree death in 2016 2 2 2 monitoring the soil water content three representative trees of each degradation degree were selected and soil water observation points were set up at approximately 30 cm from the sample trees with a total of 15 observation points the seasonal dynamics of swc were monitored using a capacitive probe diviner model 2000 sentek pty ltd australia at depths of 0 160 cm with a depth interval of 10 cm the probe was lowered to the desired depth of the cylindrical tube to acquire data from different soil layers the period from may to october between years was designated the growing season during this time the data were usually collected at least once semimonthly the transition and middle of each month and appropriately encrypted during the rainy season the swc in the nongrowing season was collected at least once every month because it lacked variability in total 68 soil water measurements from may 2018 to december 2021 were conducted at each observation point due to the impact of covid 19 the observation data from february to september 2020 were missing each tube was hermetically sealed at the bottom to prevent possible errors in the readings due to the entry of water because the observation points were relatively concentrated it was assumed that precipitation did not change between these observation points 2 2 3 soil properties soil bulk density bd soil organic carbon soc soil texture sand content silt content and clay content and field capacity fc were measured and are closely related to soil water dynamics at each observation point undisturbed soil cores were collected to measure the soil bd and fc of the 0 160 cm soil profiles at 20 cm intervals using a stainless steel cutting ring yang et al 2021 additional soil samples of representative trees were used to measure the soil texture and soc at each site disturbed soil samples were taken from the 0 160 cm soil layer at an interval of 10 cm for each layer part of the soil samples were brought back to the laboratory and the collected soil samples from three randomly distributed points were mixed together to form a sample all disturbed soil samples were air dried and divided into subsamples which could be passed through 2 mm and 0 25 mm mesh the soil particle composition was determined by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england particle size and composition were described in terms of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm the soil particle size was analyzed three times for each sample and the mean value was used for data analysis the soc of the particles passing through a 0 25 mm mesh was determined using the dichromate oxidation method sparks et al 1996 2 3 evaluation metrics soil water storage sws can more intuitively reflect the soil water supply capacity and the formula is as follows 1 s w s i 10 100 s w c i d i where sws i is the soil water storage capacity of the ith layer mm swc i is the soil volumetric water content of the ith layer cm3 cm 3 10 100 is the unit conversion factor and d i is the thickness of the ith layer cm fc is the mass water content measured by the ring knife method and needs to be converted to volume water content the formula is as follows 2 f c f c m b d where fc is the field capacity mm fcm is the field capacity expressed by the mass water content g g and bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 the relative extractable soil water rew defined as the quotient between the actual extractable water and the maximum extractable water dang et al 2021 granier et al 1999 was also calculated to describe the relative soil moisture conditions at the study sites 3 rew swc swc min fc swc min where swcmin is the minimum soil water during the experimental period and swc is the mean of the soil water value calculated for each soil profile generally the stable field capacity sfc equivalent to 60 of the fc is the most important criterion for determining dsl occurrence and it is simplified to a fixed value in the vertical soil profile jia et al 2019 wang et al 2011 a swc in the soil profile lower than the sfc could be regarded as a dsl wang et al 2015 2018 the soil desiccation index sdi was calculated to evaluate the soil water deficit in the dsl and to determine the distribution range of the dsl in the soil profile the sdi is defined as the ratio of soil water to total available water in a soil layer 4 sdi swc swc min sfc swc min according to the definition of the dsl the upper soil layer 0 100 cm which is susceptible to precipitation and supplementation is not the dsl bai et al 2020 based on the calculation of the sdi an sdi 1 indicates the existence of dsl therefore the swc below the 1 m soil depth was used to calculate indices of dsls in this study dsl thickness dslt dsl formation depth dslfd and dsl average swc dsl swc were used to quantify the dsl based on zhang et al 2020a the following equations were used 5 dslt d i i 1 n s swc i s f c 6 dslfd 10 k k i s d e t e r m i n e d b y i 1 k s swc i s f c 1 7 s swc i s f c 0 swc i s f c 0 1 swc i s f c 0 i 11 12 13 n 8 dsl s w c 1 n i 1 n swc i i f swc i s f c 0 i 11 12 13 n where sfc is the swc at sfc n is the number of soil layer depths and n is the number of soil samples in the dsl n n 2 4 statistical analysis all data are expressed as the means standard errors we calculated the temporally averaged swc and then compared the soil profiles 0 160 cm of the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation the 80 cm soil depth was the threshold for distinguishing the effects of different degradation degrees on swc therefore we divided the soil profile into two vertical layers for subsequent analysis shallow layer 0 80 cm and deep layer 80 160 cm second we calculated depth average swc for the shallow layer and deep layer at each measurement time and then compared the differences between the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation experimental data were analyzed using spss 21 0 ibm corporation armonk usa one way analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the difference in the soil characteristics with the different degradation degrees the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 was used to elucidate any significant differences pearson correlation analysis of the swc and soil properties was performed using origin pro 2020 origin lan inc northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 soil properties the soil properties within the two soil layers varied significantly with degradation degree sand content mean 72 66 0 82 was the dominant component across all five degradation degrees followed by silt content mean 25 27 0 75 and clay content mean 2 07 0 08 shallow layer soil properties did not change significantly with increasing degradation but the effect of soil properties on degradation was mainly in the deep layer fig 4 at 80 160 cm the degradation degree was significantly positively correlated with the sand content which was significantly negatively correlated with the clay content and silt content fig 5 b p 0 001 the sand content of the dead populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of trees with other degrees of degradation fig 4b p 0 05 in addition degradation degree was significantly positively correlated with bd p 0 01 and the bd of the dead populus simonii carr in the two soil layers was significantly higher than that of the trees with other degradation degrees fig 4a p 0 05 the swc in the deep layer was significantly negatively correlated with the sand content bd and degradation degree fig 5b p 0 001 poor site conditions were the main reason for shelterbelt degradation the higher sand content and the greater bd of the deep layer reduced the soil water holding capacity and the long term soil water deficit led to shelterbelt degradation the different degraded degrees of populus simonii carr had significant effects on soc table 2 soc was mainly distributed in the top 40 cm soil layer and decreased rapidly with soil depth across all degradation degrees the soc decreased with increasing degradation which was mainly reflected in the 0 40 cm soil layer as the soil depth increased the observed differences gradually decreased in the 0 40 cm layer the soc of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 whereas there was no significant difference in the soc among these trees in the 40 160 cm layer 3 2 soil water dynamics of different degradation degrees 3 2 1 vertical distribution the vertical changes in the swc of the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation showed different trends and swc was significantly affected by populus simonii carr degradation fig 6 in the 0 80 cm soil layer of the different populus simonii carr the dead populus simonii carr had the highest soil water storage 128 0 35 7 mm and moderately degraded populus simonii carr had the lowest soil water storage 79 5 23 1 mm table 3 the shallow layer soil water storage of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly lower than that of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 compared with that of healthy populus simonii carr 94 7 26 2 mm the shallow layer soil water storage of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr was restored by 19 4 mm and 33 3 mm increasing by 20 5 and 35 2 respectively in the 80 160 cm soil layer the soil water storage of moderately degraded 84 4 17 5 mm severely degraded 96 8 19 6 mm and dead populus simonii carr 77 13 0 mm was significantly lower than that of healthy populus simonii carr 133 5 22 8 mm p 0 05 deep layer soil water storage was difficult to recover and the dsl gradually developed the dsl indices table 4 were associated with degraded shelterbelts and no dsl formation was found in healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr dslt 0 dsls were wide for the moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr compared with the healthy populus simonii carr the dslt of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr increased by 40 cm and 50 cm respectively and then gradually recovered however the dslt of moderately degraded populus simonii carr 60 cm showed a developing trend below 160 cm below the observation point fig 6 the dsl swc gradually decreased with increasing degradation and the dsl swc of degraded and dead populus simonii carr was only 9 3 11 95 3 2 2 temporal dynamics the response of swc to precipitation decreased with soil depth during the monitored period may 2018 to december 2021 generally shallow layer soil water reacts quickly and dramatically and reaches a peak in a short time the shallow layer swc fluctuated synchronously with the seasonal precipitation trend and showed high temporal variation whereas the temporal changes in the deep layer swc were relatively stable fig 7 the swc showed different peaks and troughs during the monitoring period and the swc peaks and troughs periodically alternated generally keeping pace with the changes between the nongrowing season and the growing season obviously deep layer soil water deficit has a predictable relationship with populus simonii carr degradation in the 0 80 cm layer the temporal characteristics of the swc differed across different levels of degradation fig 7a in comparison to the other populus simonii carr the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr exhibited more dramatic temporal changes in the shallow layer swc the swc of the dead populus simonii carr remained high throughout the growing season and the swc of the moderately degraded populus simonii carr was always lower than that of the populus simonii carr with different degrees degradation different from other degradation degrees the swc of dead populus simonii carr showed a significant downward trend after the end of a precipitation cycle for the 80 160 cm soil layer although the swc of the deep layer was relatively stable the swc of degraded populus simonii carr was always lower than that of healthy populus simonii carr and was lower than the sfc in the long term fig 7b the effect of populus simonii carr degradation on the rew was mainly reflected in the deep layer especially in the nongrowing season fig 8 in the 0 80 cm layer fig 8a the shallow layer rew of populus simonii carr ranged from 0 46 to 0 76 in the growing season except for moderate degradation below 0 4 and the rew of moderately degraded populus simonii carr was significantly lower than that of the trees with the other degrees of degradation p 0 05 in the nongrowing season the shallow layer rew of populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation ranged from 0 14 to 0 44 in the 80 160 cm layer fig 8b the rew of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 in the growing season the deep layer rew of healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr ranged from 0 69 to 0 91 while the deep layer rew of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr ranged from 0 28 to 0 51 in the nongrowing season the deep layer rews of healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr were 0 48 0 14 and 0 65 0 15 respectively while the deep rews of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr were 0 25 0 07 0 30 0 09 and 0 21 0 07 respectively the rew of the deep layer decreased as populus simonii carr degraded which indicated that the negative impact of the soil water supply on shelterbelt degradation was considerable 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties in general soil properties affect soil water retention capacity metzger et al 2017 de queiroz et al 2020 swc was significantly correlated with bd soc and soil texture dai et al 2020 li et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 in this study swc was significantly positively correlated with clay and silt content and significantly negatively correlated with sand content fig 4 p 0 01 clay texture is conducive to soil water retention but the study area has a very low clay content value of approximately 2 sand texture promotes soil water infiltration and increases the distribution of soil water flux moving back to the atmosphere or to groundwater pan et al 2020 sun et al 2015 the results of this study showed that bd and sand content increased at all depths and degradation degrees especially in the deep soil profile our findings are consistent with those of arredondo et al 2018 who found that deep layer swc was significantly negatively correlated with sand content and significantly positively correlated with clay content and silt content the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr had a lower swc a larger bd and a higher proportion of sand content reduced the soil water holding capacity and poor site conditions reduced the resistance of shelterbelts which are more likely to cause the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr during drought this study showed that as the degree of degradation increased the soc content decreased significantly at 0 40 cm the soc of the healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 wu et al 2020 found that decreases in soil temperature and water content affect soc content vegetation degradation reduces plant coverage and increases near surface soil temperature which promotes the decomposition of soc and leads to more soc emissions into the atmosphere ni et al 2019 suyker and verma 2001 in addition deep layer soil water deficits with increasing degradation limit tree photosynthesis flexas 2002 mcdowell et al 2010 the consumption of soc further restricts plant growth resulting in a sharp decrease in soc wu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in addition soc content depends on the input and decomposition rate of organic matter vegetation degradation also reduces soc and enzyme activities mainly affecting the 0 20 cm soil layer ma et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 because a populus simonii carr is a deciduous forest tree the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr had almost no vegetation cover the decrease in plant biomass nutrient input led to a decrease in soc and the deterioration of nutrient conditions also led to the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr 4 2 temporal variations in swc in populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation unlike relatively static soil properties soil water is dynamic and changes in response to precipitation patterns han et al 2021 yin et al 2014 and vegetation stand structure characteristics fang et al 2020 hata et al 2016 pollastrini et al 2016 precipitation within a tree canopy is partitioned into interception loss throughfall and stem flow interception loss remains on the canopy and evaporates back to the atmosphere throughfall is the precipitation portion that reaches the ground by passing directly through or dripping from tree canopies stemflow by trunks and stems reaches the ground crockford and richardson 2000 magliano et al 2018 in various ecosystem types and at multiple scales shallow layer swc is generally more susceptible to external disturbances than deep layer swc in fact precipitation replenishment decreased with soil depth and deep soil water deficit is not significantly supplemented by precipitation cao et al 2021 li et al 2019 the temporal variation in swc decreases with soil depth suo et al 2018 shallow layer swc has strong temporal variability due to precipitation characteristics metzger et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b and deep layer swc fluctuates slowly and shows a relatively stable seasonal pattern huang et al 2016 yin et al 2014 de queiroz et al 2020 in addition to precipitation temperature is an important factor affecting swc in the nongrowing season sun et al 2021 found that there was a freeze thaw phenomenon during the nongrowing season in the study area the freeze thaw process had obvious stratification at a depth of 90 cm and the highest swc 19 79 occurred at a depth of 80 100 cm the rise in spring temperature caused the shallow soil to thaw first while deep soil gradually thawed as the temperature increased therefore the shallow layer swc increased more obviously wang et al 2019 this scenario explains the phenomenon that shallow layer swc still increased sharply from march to may when there was no significant precipitation in the nongrowing season in this study healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr water use was not a problem when rainy season precipitation replenished deep 80 160 cm soil reservoirs however when swc was not replenished the rew of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr was 0 25 0 07 0 30 0 09 and 0 21 0 07 respectively fig 7b far lower than the threshold value of 0 4 which has been widely reported for several ecosystems triggering water stress bernier et al 2002 dang et al 2021 granier et al 1999 ecosystem degradation occurs when the extraction of soil water reaches the limit of sustainable water resources in the region the swc of the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation was significantly different over time in forests the interception of precipitation by a tree canopy could decrease soil water changes during precipitation events magliano et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 compared healthy and unhealthy caragana korshinskii and found that the canopy was the main factor affecting interception loss with shelterbelt degradation a lower canopy density results in lower canopy interception interception loss was significantly reduced and the throughfall increased accordingly and the shallow layer swc of the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr trees recovered transpiration is one of the most basic physiological processes of plants and the dominant variable in the regional hydrological cycle ye et al 2019 for many ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions reduced precipitation is the most direct cause of reduced transpiration productivity and degradation and mortality of trees he et al 2020 several studies have shown that soil water deficits may recover because plant degradation and related physiological activities decline and transpiration is weakened thus extra precipitation may replenish soil water li et al 2021 liang et al 2018 in addition the swc of the dead populus simonii carr showed a significant downward trend after the end of a precipitation cycle which was due to long term exposure to sunlight and the lack of canopy shade 4 3 bidirectional effect of shelterbelt degradation on swc the formation of a dsl is mainly caused by the excessive consumption of deep layer soil water excessive evapotranspiration and long term insufficient precipitation chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2020a this study showed that the swc of the populus simonii carr gradually decreased with degradation and depth and a dsl gradually developed fig 8 which indicated that long term vegetation cover decreased the swc in the deep layer zhang et al 2020b the development of dsls blocks soil water movement when xylem water potential decreases to a certain threshold value soil water transmission is blocked which further restricts tree growth and leads to the degradation and mortality of a shelterbelt anderegg et al 2011 walthert et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in this study the deep layer soil water of moderately severely and dead populus simonii carr was severely deficient and increased severe soil drying caused trees to absorb deeper soil water zhang et al 2019 also found that soil dryness led to the convergence of leaf traits under water limiting conditions thereby balancing the supply and demand of soil water more sensitive stomatal closure during drought may even be a mechanism that exacerbates drought by reducing water flux and circulation mcdowell et al 2010 quentin et al 2012 when plants are facing severe drought stress leaf loss and even branch dieback are involved nardini et al 2013 jacquet et al 2014 defoliation can improve water status by reducing canopy transpiration under drought conditions and long term defoliation reduces tree water potential balducci et al 2020 populus simonii carr usually experience dieback from the top of the crown to reduce transpiration and abandoning higher branches could be viewed as an adjustment to the hydraulic architecture at the entire tree level in response to drought stress which helps to reduce water consumption and delay hydraulic failure fang et al 2020 canopy dieback and root hydraulic damage play an important role in drought induced populus simonii carr mortality and root death may precede canopy death anderegg et al 2011 in general the soil water deficit that occurs with severe defoliation leads to a decrease in nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations jacquet et al 2013 palacio et al 2011 wang et al 2020 the reduction in leaf area affects transpiration thereby reducing soil water consumption the water loss exceeds the increase in soil evaporation caused by the loss of canopy and leaf loss hata et al 2016 in addition populus simonii carr absorbs a large amount of water from the deep layer affecting the dynamics of deep layer swc dovey et al 2011 however this is not the case with light defoliation which could limit the effect of water stress on tree growth by reducing the transpiration requirement of the partially deciduous canopy jacquet et al 2014 iacopetti et al 2019 walthert et al 2020 the improved water status of light defoliation can provide insights to support compensatory physiological responses to defoliation in this study the compensatory effect of degradation on deep layer swc was very transient and observed only with light degradation a dsl changes over time according to water supplementation shao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 seasonal drought may cause temporary dsls that can be restored by precipitation jia et al 2019 a seasonal water absorption pattern may accelerate dslt and soil water deficit causes shelterbelt degradation which can lead to the continued deterioration of soil water conditions dang et al 2021 in this study the profile distribution of sdi during the monitoring period is shown in fig 9 during the monitoring period the dsl with sdi 1 was distributed over the long term in moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr notably although the hydrological cycle caused the restoration of shallow layer swc after populus simonii carr degradation the dsl swc was only 9 3 11 95 table 4 the impermeability of the dsl interrupts the vertical movement of the deep layer soil water huang et al 2016 and the dsl swc rarely recovers to the original swc through the vented zone jia et al 2019 4 4 implications for management in this study indicators such as swc rew and dsl were used to characterize how soil water deficit affects shelterbelt degradation in semiarid regions and the impact of degradation on swc was also analyzed degradation of overmature shelterbelts does not signify failure after 30 years of implementation shelterbelts have provided substantial contributions in terms of preventing wind erosion holding sand and improving soil properties production and daily lives of people gao and huang 2020 moderate degradation is a signal of soil water deficit so effective measures must be taken as soon as possible before moderate degradation occurs to avoid soil water deficit and formation of dsls the best way to address or mitigate excessive soil water depletion may be the thinning of moderately degraded populus simonii carr at the right time which would maintain long term forest sustainability by minimizing soil desiccation for plantation management in semiarid areas for the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr the recovery of shallow swc was greater indicating that degraded populus simonii carr required more water and time to restore the original soil water status the risk of drought in semiarid regions is projected to increase as the climate warms in the future li et al 2020 therefore species that require less water or those that are more drought tolerant can be planted during stand regeneration 5 conclusions in this study we monitored the real time swc of degraded populus simonii carr on the bashang plateau of northern china at a depth of 160 cm for the period 2018 5 2021 12 this study found that the swc of the deep layer 80 160 cm decreased with increasing degradation which was closely related to the soil properties including coarser soils and increased bd poor site conditions reduced the resistance of shelterbelts causing the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr during drought with populus simonii carr degradation transpiration and stand interception decreased and throughfall increased soil water replenishment increased during the rainy season and shallow layer 0 80

is a signal of soil water deficit so effective measures must be taken as soon as possible before moderate degradation occurs to avoid soil water deficit and formation of dsls the research results provide a reference for the afforestation of forest ecosystems that is the changes in water balance and hydrological processes that can be expected after the degradation and mortality of trees credit

3120,large scale afforestation exacerbates soil water scarcity in a semiarid region of northern china causing the formation of a dried soil layer dsl and ecosystem degradation and overmature populus simonii carr 30 years degradation in the three north shelterbelt program tnsp area has recently been observed determining the relationship between degraded populus simonii carr and soil water deficit is essential for afforestation in semiarid regions we monitored soil water content swc to a 160 cm depth in an area with five degradation degrees healthy light degradation moderate degradation severe degradation and dead to investigate soil water dynamics and dsl characteristics from may 2018 to december 2021 the results showed that compared with that of healthy populus simonii carr 94 7 26 2 mm the shallow layer 0 80 cm soil water storage of severely degraded 114 1 29 9 mm and dead populus simonii carr 128 0 35 7 mm was restored by 19 4 mm and 33 3 mm respectively however the deep layer 80 160 cm swc was difficult to recover and a dsl gradually developed the dsl swc was only 9 3 11 95 the deep layer relative extractable soil water rew of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 the deep layer swc decreased with increasing degradation due to coarser soils and increased bd a greater bulk density bd and higher sand proportion reduced the soil water holding capacity poor site conditions reduced the resistance of shelterbelts causing the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr during drought therefore our results improve the understanding of the soil water dynamics and degradation mechanism of populus simonii carr providing a theoretical basis for managing and maintaining the tnsp keywords soil water content relative extractable soil water dry soil layer shelterbelt degradation afforestation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction soil water is a vital component of the hydrological cycle and plays a crucial role in determining ecosystem compositions and functions zhang et al 2020b afforestation alleviates environmental problems to a certain extent but increasing vegetation has great effects on the hydrological cycle deng et al 2016 meng et al 2020 ye et al 2019 natural precipitation is the sole water resource for plant growth in semiarid areas and large scale afforestation has caused soil water deficits in these regions resulting in serious ecosystem degradation dang et al 2021 shao et al 2018 soil desiccation significantly affects the physiological activity of plants chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 deep water reserves are essential for vegetation to be able to withstand dry periods in water limited areas and a severe soil water deficit could cause the degradation and mortality of plants barbeta et al 2014 the water stress that plants face becomes more serious as plants grow and influences root water uptake and plant growth brunner et al 2015 huang et al 2021 the water absorption strategy of plant deep roots in the dry season aggravate a dsl and the reduction of soil water in a dsl in turn threatens plant growth which is not conducive to the restoration of the ecological environment anderegg et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the formation of a dsl leads to insufficient soil water supply which restricts normal plant growth and causes ecosystem degradation chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 liu et al 2020 compared the water sources of populus simonii carr with different degradation degrees and found that the lack of available water may be the main reason for the degeneration of populus simonii carr previous studies have lacked long term continuous monitoring data for the soil water content swc in degraded shelterbelts therefore there is an urgent need for an evaluation of swc dynamics and their interactions in relation to shelterbelt degradation soil water is crucial in the hydrological cycle and is affected by climate dang et al 2021 han et al 2021 soil properties dai et al 2020 pan et al 2020 vegetation characteristics fang et al 2020 pollastrini et al 2016 terrain mei et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a and land use fang et al 2016 the morphology and physiology of trees have changed due to soil water deficits massonnet et al 2020 walthert et al 2020 shelterbelt degradation changes canopy structure and precipitation interception decreases as the leaf area index decreases thus changing the potential mechanism of precipitation redistribution yan et al 2020 a decrease in total leaf area also affects solar radiation input on the soil surface and subsequent soil processes such as transpiration and soil evaporation thus affecting the hydrological cycle hugehes et al 2006 deciduous trees significantly alter the water balance of forest stands by changing the ratio of water input to water output hata et al 2016 in addition during leaf senescence nutrients are resorbed from leaves to perennial organs which also affects important fluxes and may be disrupted by severe soil water deficits estiarte and pe√±uelas 2015 all noted studies state that further integration of information on shelterbelt degradation climate and soil properties is still needed to better understand changes in local swc variability the three north shelterbelt program tnsp is an important ecological project and the bashang plateau shelterbelt is critical part of the program however in recent years 4 5 of the populus simonii carr in this area have been degraded and a near die off of populus simonii carr has occurred in 1 3 of the study area resulting in a decline in ecological functions sun et al 2018 soil water deficit is the main limitation to plant growth in the semiarid areas of north china fang et al 2020 nardini et al 2013 populus simonii carr has been widely established in semiarid areas in northern china song et al 2016 however the reason why some populus simonii carr have died while others have survived drought in this particular region remains unclear hence we aimed to 1 investigate the soil water dynamics and their influencing factors of different degrees of degraded populus simonii carr 2 determine the characteristics of dsls in degraded populus simonii carr and 3 determine the bidirectional effect of shelterbelt degradation and swc through long term continuous soil water monitoring at different degraded populus simonii carr sites in addition the soil properties and dsl characteristics of each stratum among the different degraded populus simonii carr were compared to identify the cause of degradation in the shelterbelts we provided robust evidence that clarifies the interaction mechanisms between shelterbelt degradation and soil water deficits moreover we explored the potential for soil water deficit mitigation via forest management while maintaining ecological benefits 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiments were carried out at the boluosu forest farm 40 57 41 34 n 114 10 115 27 e which is located in zhangbei county hebei province china fig 1 the region has a semiarid zone continental monsoon climate and the meteorological shows the same period of rain and heat the daily precipitation and temperature were obtained from the nearest zhangbei county weather station closest to the sampling point the annual average precipitation in 2018 2021 was 438 8 mm and the cumulative precipitation during the growing season may october was 375 1 mm accounting for 85 5 of the annual average precipitation fig 2 the potential evapotranspiration was 1073 mm the mean annual temperature was 3 2 c the mean annual wind speed was 4 6 m s 1 and the mean desiccation degree was 1 3 with 132 frost free days the soil at the site is mainly sandy loam with a high sand content large areas of shelterbelts dominated by populus simonii carr were planted in the 1980 s there has been varying degrees of degradation in recent years 2 2 experimental design and investigation 2 2 1 tree selection typical populus simonii carr 30 yr were selected based on growth conditions the trees began to show recognizable symptoms of degradation that is many trees experienced defoliation and dieback from the top of the canopy we calculated the number of dead and live branches in each canopy or visually estimated the percentage of canopy dieback jacquet et al 2013 walthert et al 2020 using this as the standard we randomly selected populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation and the defoliation degree of these stands ranged from light to severe fig 3 table 1 among which dead populus simonii carr plots were completely felled after tree death in 2016 2 2 2 monitoring the soil water content three representative trees of each degradation degree were selected and soil water observation points were set up at approximately 30 cm from the sample trees with a total of 15 observation points the seasonal dynamics of swc were monitored using a capacitive probe diviner model 2000 sentek pty ltd australia at depths of 0 160 cm with a depth interval of 10 cm the probe was lowered to the desired depth of the cylindrical tube to acquire data from different soil layers the period from may to october between years was designated the growing season during this time the data were usually collected at least once semimonthly the transition and middle of each month and appropriately encrypted during the rainy season the swc in the nongrowing season was collected at least once every month because it lacked variability in total 68 soil water measurements from may 2018 to december 2021 were conducted at each observation point due to the impact of covid 19 the observation data from february to september 2020 were missing each tube was hermetically sealed at the bottom to prevent possible errors in the readings due to the entry of water because the observation points were relatively concentrated it was assumed that precipitation did not change between these observation points 2 2 3 soil properties soil bulk density bd soil organic carbon soc soil texture sand content silt content and clay content and field capacity fc were measured and are closely related to soil water dynamics at each observation point undisturbed soil cores were collected to measure the soil bd and fc of the 0 160 cm soil profiles at 20 cm intervals using a stainless steel cutting ring yang et al 2021 additional soil samples of representative trees were used to measure the soil texture and soc at each site disturbed soil samples were taken from the 0 160 cm soil layer at an interval of 10 cm for each layer part of the soil samples were brought back to the laboratory and the collected soil samples from three randomly distributed points were mixed together to form a sample all disturbed soil samples were air dried and divided into subsamples which could be passed through 2 mm and 0 25 mm mesh the soil particle composition was determined by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england particle size and composition were described in terms of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm the soil particle size was analyzed three times for each sample and the mean value was used for data analysis the soc of the particles passing through a 0 25 mm mesh was determined using the dichromate oxidation method sparks et al 1996 2 3 evaluation metrics soil water storage sws can more intuitively reflect the soil water supply capacity and the formula is as follows 1 s w s i 10 100 s w c i d i where sws i is the soil water storage capacity of the ith layer mm swc i is the soil volumetric water content of the ith layer cm3 cm 3 10 100 is the unit conversion factor and d i is the thickness of the ith layer cm fc is the mass water content measured by the ring knife method and needs to be converted to volume water content the formula is as follows 2 f c f c m b d where fc is the field capacity mm fcm is the field capacity expressed by the mass water content g g and bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 the relative extractable soil water rew defined as the quotient between the actual extractable water and the maximum extractable water dang et al 2021 granier et al 1999 was also calculated to describe the relative soil moisture conditions at the study sites 3 rew swc swc min fc swc min where swcmin is the minimum soil water during the experimental period and swc is the mean of the soil water value calculated for each soil profile generally the stable field capacity sfc equivalent to 60 of the fc is the most important criterion for determining dsl occurrence and it is simplified to a fixed value in the vertical soil profile jia et al 2019 wang et al 2011 a swc in the soil profile lower than the sfc could be regarded as a dsl wang et al 2015 2018 the soil desiccation index sdi was calculated to evaluate the soil water deficit in the dsl and to determine the distribution range of the dsl in the soil profile the sdi is defined as the ratio of soil water to total available water in a soil layer 4 sdi swc swc min sfc swc min according to the definition of the dsl the upper soil layer 0 100 cm which is susceptible to precipitation and supplementation is not the dsl bai et al 2020 based on the calculation of the sdi an sdi 1 indicates the existence of dsl therefore the swc below the 1 m soil depth was used to calculate indices of dsls in this study dsl thickness dslt dsl formation depth dslfd and dsl average swc dsl swc were used to quantify the dsl based on zhang et al 2020a the following equations were used 5 dslt d i i 1 n s swc i s f c 6 dslfd 10 k k i s d e t e r m i n e d b y i 1 k s swc i s f c 1 7

number of soil samples in the dsl n n 2 4 statistical analysis all data are expressed as the means standard errors we calculated the temporally averaged swc and then compared the soil profiles 0 160 cm of the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation the 80 cm soil depth was the threshold for distinguishing the effects of different degradation degrees on swc therefore we divided the soil profile into two vertical layers for subsequent analysis shallow layer 0 80 cm and deep layer 80 160 cm second we calculated depth average swc for the shallow layer and deep layer at each measurement time and then compared the differences between the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation experimental data were analyzed using spss 21 0 ibm corporation armonk usa one way analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the difference in the soil characteristics with the different degradation degrees the least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 was used to elucidate any significant differences pearson correlation analysis of the swc and soil properties was performed using origin pro 2020 origin lan inc northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 soil properties the soil properties within the two soil layers varied significantly with degradation degree sand content mean 72 66 0 82 was the dominant component across all five degradation degrees followed by silt content mean 25 27 0 75 and clay content mean 2 07 0 08 shallow layer soil properties did not change significantly with increasing degradation but the effect of soil properties on degradation was mainly in the deep layer fig 4 at 80 160 cm the degradation degree was significantly positively correlated with the sand content which was significantly negatively correlated with the clay content and silt content fig 5 b p 0 001 the sand content of the dead populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of trees with other degrees of degradation fig 4b p 0 05 in addition degradation degree was significantly positively correlated with bd p 0 01 and the bd of the dead populus simonii carr in the two soil layers was significantly higher than that of the trees with other degradation degrees fig 4a p 0 05 the swc in the deep layer was significantly negatively correlated with the sand content bd and degradation degree fig 5b p 0 001 poor site conditions were the main reason for shelterbelt degradation the higher sand content and the greater bd of the deep layer reduced the soil water holding capacity and the long term soil water deficit led to shelterbelt degradation the different degraded degrees of populus simonii carr had significant effects on soc table 2 soc was mainly distributed in the top 40 cm soil layer and decreased rapidly with soil depth across all degradation degrees the soc decreased with increasing degradation which was mainly reflected in the 0 40 cm soil layer as the soil depth increased the observed differences gradually decreased in the 0 40 cm layer the soc of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 whereas there was no significant difference in the soc among these trees in the 40 160 cm layer 3 2 soil water dynamics of different degradation degrees 3 2 1 vertical distribution the vertical changes in the swc of the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation showed different trends and swc was significantly affected by populus simonii carr degradation fig 6 in the 0 80 cm soil layer of the different populus simonii carr the dead populus simonii carr had the highest soil water storage 128 0 35 7 mm and moderately degraded populus simonii carr had the lowest soil water storage 79 5 23 1 mm table 3 the shallow layer soil water storage of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly lower than that of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 compared with that of healthy populus simonii carr 94 7 26 2 mm the shallow layer soil water storage of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr was restored by 19 4 mm and 33 3 mm increasing by 20 5 and 35 2 respectively in the 80 160 cm soil layer the soil water storage of moderately degraded 84 4 17 5 mm severely degraded 96 8 19 6 mm and dead populus simonii carr 77 13 0 mm was significantly lower than that of healthy populus simonii carr 133 5 22 8 mm p 0 05 deep layer soil water storage was difficult to recover and the dsl gradually developed the dsl indices table 4 were associated with degraded shelterbelts and no dsl formation was found in healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr dslt 0 dsls were wide for the moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr compared with the healthy populus simonii carr the dslt of severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr increased by 40 cm and 50 cm respectively and then gradually recovered however the dslt of moderately degraded populus simonii carr 60 cm showed a developing trend below 160 cm below the observation point fig 6 the dsl swc gradually decreased with increasing degradation and the dsl swc of degraded and dead populus simonii carr was only 9 3 11 95 3 2 2 temporal dynamics the response of swc to precipitation decreased with soil depth during the monitored period may 2018 to december 2021 generally shallow layer soil water reacts quickly and dramatically and reaches a peak in a short time the shallow layer swc fluctuated synchronously with the seasonal precipitation trend and showed high temporal variation whereas the temporal changes in the deep layer swc were relatively stable fig 7 the swc showed different peaks and troughs during the monitoring period and the swc peaks and troughs periodically alternated generally keeping pace with the changes between the nongrowing season and the growing season obviously deep layer soil water deficit has a predictable relationship with populus simonii carr degradation in the 0 80 cm layer the temporal characteristics of the swc differed across different levels of degradation fig 7a in comparison to the other populus simonii carr the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr exhibited more dramatic temporal changes in the shallow layer swc the swc of the dead populus simonii carr remained high throughout the growing season and the swc of the moderately degraded populus simonii carr was always lower than that of the populus simonii carr with different degrees degradation different from other degradation degrees the swc of dead populus simonii carr showed a significant downward trend after the end of a precipitation cycle for the 80 160 cm soil layer although the swc of the deep layer was relatively stable the swc of degraded populus simonii carr was always lower than that of healthy populus simonii carr and was lower than the sfc in the long term fig 7b the effect of populus simonii carr degradation on the rew was mainly reflected in the deep layer especially in the nongrowing season fig 8 in the 0 80 cm layer fig 8a the shallow layer rew of populus simonii carr ranged from 0 46 to 0 76 in the growing season except for moderate degradation below 0 4 and the rew of moderately degraded populus simonii carr was significantly lower than that of the trees with the other degrees of degradation p 0 05 in the nongrowing season the shallow layer rew of populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation ranged from 0 14 to 0 44 in the 80 160 cm layer fig 8b the rew of healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 in the growing season the deep layer rew of healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr ranged from 0 69 to 0 91 while the deep layer rew of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr ranged from 0 28 to 0 51 in the nongrowing season the deep layer rews of healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr were 0 48 0 14 and 0 65 0 15 respectively while the deep rews of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr were 0 25 0 07 0 30 0 09 and 0 21 0 07 respectively the rew of the deep layer decreased as populus simonii carr degraded which indicated that the negative impact of the soil water supply on shelterbelt degradation was considerable 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties in general soil properties affect soil water retention capacity metzger et al 2017 de queiroz et al 2020 swc was significantly correlated with bd soc and soil texture dai et al 2020 li et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 in this study swc was significantly positively correlated with clay and silt content and significantly negatively correlated with sand content fig 4 p 0 01 clay texture is conducive to soil water retention but the study area has a very low clay content value of approximately 2 sand texture promotes soil water infiltration and increases the distribution of soil water flux moving back to the atmosphere or to groundwater pan et al 2020 sun et al 2015 the results of this study showed that bd and sand content increased at all depths and degradation degrees especially in the deep soil profile our findings are consistent with those of arredondo et al 2018 who found that deep layer swc was significantly negatively correlated with sand content and significantly positively correlated with clay content and silt content the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr had a lower swc a larger bd and a higher proportion of sand content reduced the soil water holding capacity and poor site conditions reduced the resistance of shelterbelts which are more likely to cause the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr during drought this study showed that as the degree of degradation increased the soc content decreased significantly at 0 40 cm the soc of the healthy populus simonii carr was significantly higher than that of the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr p 0 05 wu et al 2020 found that decreases in soil temperature and water content affect soc content vegetation degradation reduces plant coverage and increases near surface soil temperature which promotes the decomposition of soc and leads to more soc emissions into the atmosphere ni et al 2019 suyker and verma 2001 in addition deep layer soil water deficits with increasing degradation limit tree photosynthesis flexas 2002 mcdowell et al 2010 the consumption of soc further restricts plant growth resulting in a sharp decrease in soc wu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in addition soc content depends on the input and decomposition rate of organic matter vegetation degradation also reduces soc and enzyme activities mainly affecting the 0 20 cm soil layer ma et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 because a populus simonii carr is a deciduous forest tree the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr had almost no vegetation cover the decrease in plant biomass nutrient input led to a decrease in soc and the deterioration of nutrient conditions also led to the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr 4 2 temporal variations in swc in populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation unlike relatively static soil properties soil water is dynamic and changes in response to precipitation patterns han et al 2021 yin et al 2014 and vegetation stand structure characteristics fang et al 2020 hata et al 2016 pollastrini et al 2016 precipitation within a tree canopy is partitioned into interception loss throughfall and stem flow interception loss remains on the canopy and evaporates back to the atmosphere throughfall is the precipitation portion that reaches the ground by passing directly through or dripping from tree canopies stemflow by trunks and stems reaches the ground crockford and richardson 2000 magliano et al 2018 in various ecosystem types and at multiple scales shallow layer swc is generally more susceptible to external disturbances than deep layer swc in fact precipitation replenishment decreased with soil depth and deep soil water deficit is not significantly supplemented by precipitation cao et al 2021 li et al 2019 the temporal variation in swc decreases with soil depth suo et al 2018 shallow layer swc has strong temporal variability due to precipitation characteristics metzger et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b and deep layer swc fluctuates slowly and shows a relatively stable seasonal pattern huang et al 2016 yin et al 2014 de queiroz et al 2020 in addition to precipitation temperature is an important factor affecting swc in the nongrowing season sun et al 2021 found that there was a freeze thaw phenomenon during the nongrowing season in the study area the freeze thaw process had obvious stratification at a depth of 90 cm and the highest swc 19 79 occurred at a depth of 80 100 cm the rise in spring temperature caused the shallow soil to thaw first while deep soil gradually thawed as the temperature increased therefore the shallow layer swc increased more obviously wang et al 2019 this scenario explains the phenomenon that shallow layer swc still increased sharply from march to may when there was no significant precipitation in the nongrowing season in this study healthy and lightly degraded populus simonii carr water use was not a problem when rainy season precipitation replenished deep 80 160 cm soil reservoirs however when swc was not replenished the rew of moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr was 0 25 0 07 0 30 0 09 and 0 21 0 07 respectively fig 7b far lower than the threshold value of 0 4 which has been widely reported for several ecosystems triggering water stress bernier et al 2002 dang et al 2021 granier et al 1999 ecosystem degradation occurs when the extraction of soil water reaches the limit of sustainable water resources in the region the swc of the populus simonii carr with different degrees of degradation was significantly different over time in forests the interception of precipitation by a tree canopy could decrease soil water changes during precipitation events magliano et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 compared healthy and unhealthy caragana korshinskii and found that the canopy was the main factor affecting interception loss with shelterbelt degradation a lower canopy density results in lower canopy interception interception loss was significantly reduced and the throughfall increased accordingly and the shallow layer swc of the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr trees recovered transpiration is one of the most basic physiological processes of plants and the dominant variable in the regional hydrological cycle ye et al 2019 for many ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions reduced precipitation is the most direct cause of reduced transpiration productivity and degradation and mortality of trees he et al 2020 several studies have shown that soil water deficits may recover because plant degradation and related physiological activities decline and transpiration is weakened thus extra precipitation may replenish soil water li et al 2021 liang et al 2018 in addition the swc of the dead populus simonii carr showed a significant downward trend after the end of a precipitation cycle which was due to long term exposure to sunlight and the lack of canopy shade 4 3 bidirectional effect of shelterbelt degradation on swc the formation of a dsl is mainly caused by the excessive consumption of deep layer soil water excessive evapotranspiration and long term insufficient precipitation chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2020a this study showed that the swc of the populus simonii carr gradually decreased with degradation and depth and a dsl gradually developed fig 8 which indicated that long term vegetation cover decreased the swc in the deep layer zhang et al 2020b the development of dsls blocks soil water movement when xylem water potential decreases to a certain threshold value soil water transmission is blocked which further restricts tree growth and leads to the degradation and mortality of a shelterbelt anderegg et al 2011 walthert et al 2020 yang et al 2021 in this study the deep layer soil water of moderately severely and dead populus simonii carr was severely deficient and increased severe soil drying caused trees to absorb deeper soil water zhang et al 2019 also found that soil dryness led to the convergence of leaf traits under water limiting conditions thereby balancing the supply and demand of soil water more sensitive stomatal closure during drought may even be a mechanism that exacerbates drought by reducing water flux and circulation mcdowell et al 2010 quentin et al 2012 when plants are facing severe drought stress leaf loss and even branch dieback are involved nardini et al 2013 jacquet et al 2014 defoliation can improve water status by reducing canopy transpiration under drought conditions and long term defoliation reduces tree water potential balducci et al 2020 populus simonii carr usually experience dieback from the top of the crown to reduce transpiration and abandoning higher branches could be viewed as an adjustment to the hydraulic architecture at the entire tree level in response to drought stress which helps to reduce water consumption and delay hydraulic failure fang et al 2020 canopy dieback and root hydraulic damage play an important role in drought induced populus simonii carr mortality and root death may precede canopy death anderegg et al 2011 in general the soil water deficit that occurs with severe defoliation leads to a decrease in nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations jacquet et al 2013 palacio et al 2011 wang et al 2020 the reduction in leaf area affects transpiration thereby reducing soil water consumption the water loss exceeds the increase in soil evaporation caused by the loss of canopy and leaf loss hata et al 2016 in addition populus simonii carr absorbs a large amount of water from the deep layer affecting the dynamics of deep layer swc dovey et al 2011 however this is not the case with light defoliation which could limit the effect of water stress on tree growth by reducing the transpiration requirement of the partially deciduous canopy jacquet et al 2014 iacopetti et al 2019 walthert et al 2020 the improved water status of light defoliation can provide insights to support compensatory physiological responses to defoliation in this study the compensatory effect of degradation on deep layer swc was very transient and observed only with light degradation a dsl changes over time according to water supplementation shao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 seasonal drought may cause temporary dsls that can be restored by precipitation jia et al 2019 a seasonal water absorption pattern may accelerate dslt and soil water deficit causes shelterbelt degradation which can lead to the continued deterioration of soil water conditions dang et al 2021 in this study the profile distribution of sdi during the monitoring period is shown in fig 9 during the monitoring period the dsl with sdi 1 was distributed over the long term in moderately degraded severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr notably although the hydrological cycle caused the restoration of shallow layer swc after populus simonii carr degradation the dsl swc was only 9 3 11 95 table 4 the impermeability of the dsl interrupts the vertical movement of the deep layer soil water huang et al 2016 and the dsl swc rarely recovers to the original swc through the vented zone jia et al 2019 4 4 implications for management in this study indicators such as swc rew and dsl were used to characterize how soil water deficit affects shelterbelt degradation in semiarid regions and the impact of degradation on swc was also analyzed degradation of overmature shelterbelts does not signify failure after 30 years of implementation shelterbelts have provided substantial contributions in terms of preventing wind erosion holding sand and improving soil properties production and daily lives of people gao and huang 2020 moderate degradation is a signal of soil water deficit so effective measures must be taken as soon as possible before moderate degradation occurs to avoid soil water deficit and formation of dsls the best way to address or mitigate excessive soil water depletion may be the thinning of moderately degraded populus simonii carr at the right time which would maintain long term forest sustainability by minimizing soil desiccation for plantation management in semiarid areas for the severely degraded and dead populus simonii carr the recovery of shallow swc was greater indicating that degraded populus simonii carr required more water and time to restore the original soil water status the risk of drought in semiarid regions is projected to increase as the climate warms in the future li et al 2020 therefore species that require less water or those that are more drought tolerant can be planted during stand regeneration 5 conclusions in this study we monitored the real time swc of degraded populus simonii carr on the bashang plateau of northern china at a depth of 160 cm for the period 2018 5 2021 12 this study found that the swc of the deep layer 80 160 cm decreased with increasing degradation which was closely related to the soil properties including coarser soils and increased bd poor site conditions reduced the resistance of shelterbelts causing the degradation and mortality of populus simonii carr during drought with populus simonii carr degradation transpiration and stand interception decreased and throughfall increased soil water replenishment increased during the rainy season and shallow layer 0 80 cm swc recovered deep layer 80 160 cm soil water is difficult to recover impermeability of a dsl interrupts the vertical movement of the soil water the dsl swc was only 9 3 11 95 moderate degradation is a signal of soil water deficit so effective measures must be taken as soon as possible before moderate degradation occurs to avoid soil water deficit and formation of dsls the research results

3121,interest in using biochar in environmental engineering applications has substantially increased with strong evidence emerging for its applicability in water and wastewater treatment the containment of hazardous gases carbon dioxide sequestration and the filtration of microplastics understanding the hydraulic behaviour of sand biochar mixtures is critical for designing biochar based water and wastewater filter systems we present an investigation on the impact of the biochar microstructure on the hydraulic conductivity of sand biochar mixtures focusing on where there are gaps in existing knowledge on how the biochar affects the hydraulic properties a dual porosity concept for sand biochar mixtures is introduced and included in four existing constitutive models for the hydraulic conductivity of soils we have experimentally investigated the hydraulic properties of sand biochar mixtures for uniformly graded sand with three representative grain sizes and one type of hardwood biochar in the uk market based on a series of constant head permeability tests the hydraulic conductivity of the mixtures with biochar content from 0 to 50 has been measured we used randomly generated spherical 3d models representing the same particle distribution of sand biochar systems to characterise the biochar s intraparticle porosity and tortuosity by employing the dual porosity concept and effective porosity instead of the total porosity the accuracy of the four models predictions was considerably improved when compared with the experimental measurements we show that by excluding biochar s intraparticle porosity the hydraulic conductivity prediction accuracy can be significantly improved thus providing a more accurate prediction of the hydraulic behaviour of the soil biochar filters keywords biochar hydraulic conductivity sand filters water flow water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction sand biochar mixtures are of particular interest both from an agriculture application perspective zhou et al 2019 where the soil is mixed with biochar for improved performance and sustainability of the crop yield and environmental engineering perspective for water and wastewater treatment purposes where sand filters are mixed with biochar to enhance the filtration capacity biochar s applications in various engineering areas have substantially expanded in the last decade for example in water purification and wastewater treatment systems zhang et al 2020 and remediation of contaminated soils rajabi et al 2021 recent studies have also shown the potential application of biochar in tackling emerging pollutants such as in the filtration of microplastics from water wang et al 2020 predicting the hydraulic behaviour of sand mixtures or soil mixtures in a broader context is essential for the design of slow and rapid sand filters kramer et al 2021a and the development of sand biochar concepts and applications kramer et al 2021b it can also help evaluate the potential risks of soil loss and deterioration sadeghi et al 2021 studies reported on the effects of adding biochar on the hydraulic conductivity of the mixture indicated a considerable level of uncertainty on how biochar affects the hydraulic conductivity jeffery et al 2015 villagra mendoza and horn 2018 in most cases biochar addition to sand reduced the hydraulic conductivity lim et al 2016 yet contradictory results have also been reported for example hardie et al 2014 reported that biochar amended soil has significantly higher hydraulic conductivity at near saturation state whilst major et al 2012 reported negligible differences between the original soil and the biochar amended soil various models for saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil have been proposed which either use the d10 particle size of 10 passing gradation or porosity chapuis 2004 ren et al 2016 to predict the hydraulic conductivity however most existing models can be applied only to homogeneous and isotropic soils when biochar is mixed with sand there are certain limitations in their applications in sand biochar mixtures as the physical properties of soil particles differ substantially from those of biochar making the mixture heterogeneous in addition the pore spaces inside the biochar particles only participate in water adsorption whilst limitedly contributing to the flow such a dual porosity system occurs in coal xue et al 2021 and shale hu et al 2019 of which the hydraulic conductivity has been well studied luo et al 2021 biochar has porous structure similar to activated carbon and most of its particles are granular and powder form deng et al 2021 compared to sand particles pore volume inside biochar accounts for a large proportion of the total volume liu et al 2016 however water flow in intraparticle pores exhibits different behaviour than in interparticle pores it may require much higher water potential differences to keep water flowing in small pores 30 Œºm downie et al 2011 lim et al 2016 established a prediction model for a biochar and sand mixture based on experimental data and compared it with existing prediction models in geotechnical engineering the model gives an estimation based on the biochar and sand classification it is found that the particle size of biochar is the most critical parameter for the prediction lim et al 2016 previous researchers have found that the correlations between hydraulic conductivity and particle size or porosity in biochar sand mixtures are inconsistent with that in pure sand soil barnes et al 2014 lim et al 2016 however existing prediction models are still applicable if specific criteria are met i the content of biochar is appropriately expressed and ii the dual porosity system is included this paper assesses the impact of biochar on the hydraulic conductivity of sand by incorporating the realistic pore system of the sand biochar mixture the work aims to provide a fundamental understanding of how adding biochar to sandy soils affects the permeability where there is uncertainty on to what extent the hydraulic behaviour is affected by biochar uniformly graded sand with three representative grain sizes and a type of granular hardwood biochar was selected for this study through a series of constant head permeability tests the hydraulic conductivity of the mixtures with biochar content from 0 to 50 was measured the scope of the work is related to the hydraulic behaviour of only fully saturated systems in the experimental programme we have saturated the samples before applying constant water flux and all the measurements and conclusions are related to fully saturated sand biochar by establishing 3d spheres models with the same particle distribution as the biochar particles we present the intraparticle porosity and tortuosity of the biochar we introduce the dual porosity effects on 4 established permeability models and assess the accuracy of the predictions against the experimental results in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 sand and biochar pure sands with a range of particle size distributions were selected in this study the three types of sand used are leighton buzzard silica sand coarse size by garside sands llc play sand medium size from boud materials and the redhill sand fine from british play sand commercial biochar produced in the uk from hardwood was purchased from oxford charcoal company fig a1 biochar has porous structure with hollow interior and a large number of pores on the surface as shown in fig 2 and its surface is negatively charged as shown in table 2 the sand and biochar samples were washed and dried in the oven at 105 for 24 h before use fig a1 the particle size distributions of the sand and biochar are shown in fig 1 the physical properties of the sands are presented in table 1 the particle density was measured by pycnometer according to the british standard bs 1377 2 and the bulk density was calculated by dividing the mass of the mixture added by its volume in the permeability cell due to the low density of biochar 99 5 propan 2 isopropyl alcohol with density of 0 785 mg m3 was used instead of water the specific surface area ssa was measured by the egme method according to cerato and lutenegger 2002 the zeta potential was measured by zetasizer nano zs malvern instrument the scanning electron microscope sem images were taken by fei quanta 650 feg sem and the elemental content was measured by energy dispersive x ray detector edx by oxford instruments 2 2 constant head permeability tests a set of constant head permeability tests were conducted in accordance with the british standard bs 1377 5 fig 3 the sample was packed in a column with diameter of 75 mm and height of 277 mm according to bs 1377 5 section 5 4 2 placing the test sample a hand tamping in three manometers were placed on the column where the upper and lower readings were used to measure the water head differences and the middle one was used to check the validity of the readings whether the water head difference was linear and steady state across the sample has been established during the experiment the water head of the tank and the height of the outlet remained unchanged when the readings of the manometer became constant that is at equilibrium the flow rate was measured at the outlet the volumetric content of biochar in each sand mixture varied from 0 to 50 with an interval of 5 volume ratio the volume ratio was used to quantify the biochar content and particle size distribution rather than the mass ratio this is due to the significant difference between the density of biochar and sand as described in table 1 moreover the size of particles is a key factor affecting hydraulic conductivity therefore the volume ratio is more appropriate in the heterogeneous media studied in this work the d10 size of 10 passing through of the mixtures were calculated pro rata based on the content of biochar and particle size distributions of pure sand and biochar as a validation of the dual porosity concept the measurement of pore volume was conducted using the same column test shown in fig 3 to measure the pore volume of biochar sodium fluorescein cas 518 47 8 was used as a tracer injected at the column s inlet the water flow rate was maintained at 50 ml min and 100 ml min which were the upper and lower flow rates of the constant head permeability tests the sodium fluorescein of 10 ppm was injected from 0 to 30 s while water samples were collected at the outlet point every 30 s the concentration was measured using a fluorometer which at the outlet has a peak the corresponding time of the peak represents the time water travelled from the inlet to the outlet at the current flow rate the pore volume can then be calculated 2 3 prediction models for hydraulic conductivity the relationships chosen to investigate in this study provide

we introduce the dual porosity system of sand biochar mixture in the hydraulic conductivity prediction models described above and assess the accuracy of prediction by such models against the experimental data presented for the case of the commercial granular hardwood biochar 2 4 3d packed granular media by blender software we establish 3d models of the sand biochar mixtures by random assembling 2800 to 3500 spheres using blender software with activated gravity the number and size of the spheres were selected according to the particle size distributions of the soil and biochar used in the experiment to check the effect of particle shape regular icosahedrons and cubes were used as well in assembling the mixtures with blender and the measured porosities and tortuosity were compared in the appendix a as shown in fig 4 the spheres were stirred before packing into a square cylinder to ensure a random packing the spheres were stirred clockwise and anti clockwise by the frictional plate for 10 cycles respectively then the plate was removed and the spheres freely fell into the column apart from the spheres flat plates were used as boundaries which can speed up the calculation compared with cylinders it is noted that the square section columns and circular section columns have negligible effect on porosity once the particles are packed the final frame is baked and a transparent cubic with boolean enabled is used to slice the packed system the material of the spheres is allocated with specific reflectance so that the cross section of sliced spheres has the same colour while the other area void area remains dark 2 5 pore system of biochar sand as described in the introduction adding biochar leads to dual porosity effect due to the intraparticle pore space of biochar in this section we calculate those input parameters required by the prediction model that cannot be directly measured including the interparticle and intraparticle porosity effective specific surface area and tortuosity then we compare the original and dual porosity included output from the prediction models the bulk volume of the mixture v b m i x is not equal to the sum of bulk volumes of biochar v b b i o and sand v b s a n d prior to mixing 9 v b m i x v b b i o v b s a n d on the other hand the volume of solid remained the same before and after mixing regardless of compression 7 v s m i x v s b i o v s s a n d where v s m i x v s b i o and v s s a n d are the solid volume of mixture pure biochar and pure sand respectively the biochar content v is determined by the ratio of bulk volumes prior to mixing and can be derived as the ratio of solid volume of biochar to sand 8 v v b b i o v b b i o v b s a n d v s b i o 1 n bio v s b i o 1 n bio v s s a n d 1 n sand v s b i o v s b i o 1 n bio 1 n sand v s s a n d where n bio and n sand are the porosity of pure biochar and pure sand respectively 9 c 1 n bio 1 n sand 10 v s s a n d 1 v c 1 c v s b i o the porosity of the mixture n mix can be expressed as followed 11 n mix 1 v s s a n d v s b i o v b m i x 1 v s b i o 1 v c 1 c 1 v b m i x the correlation between weight of sand m sand and biochar m bio is 12 v v b b i o v b b i o v b s a n d m bio œÅ b b i o m bio œÅ b b i o m sand œÅ b s a n d 13 m sand œÅ b s a n d œÅ b b i o 1 v 1 m bio 14 q œÅ b s a n d œÅ b b i o 1 v 1 where œÅ b s a n d and œÅ b b i o are the bulk density of pure sand and pure biochar respectively the equation 11 can be derived as below 15 n mix 1 m bio œÅ s b i o 1 v c 1 c 1 m bio m sand œÅ b m i x n mix 1 œÅ b m i x œÅ s b i o 1 v c 1 c 1 1 1 q where œÅ s b i o is the particle density of biochar and œÅ b m i x is the bulk density of the mixture which was calculated by the measured total weight of the mixture and bulk volume the specific surface area ssa of sand and biochar are significantly different due to the porous structure of biochar direct measurement of the internal ssa and external ssa of biochar is not feasible therefore we adopt a calculation based on particle size distribution carrier 2003 16 ssa s f f i d li 0 404 d si 0 595 where d li d si are the larger and smaller sieve sizes cm the sieve sizes in this study are 8 mm 4 mm 2 mm 1 mm 500 ¬µm 250 ¬µm 125 ¬µm and 63 ¬µm f i is the proportion retained between the two sieve sizes sf is the shape factor which was adopted from carrier 2003 as quoted rounded 6 6 medium angularity 7 5 and angular 8 4 in practice the angularity or roundness was classified by visual observation in which particles are then classified based on the angularity chart the biochar particles were angular so the shape factor should be 8 4 with cross section image of packed spheres obtained from blender fig 4 the tortuosity was then calculated by the imagej tortuosity plugin developed by roque and costa 2020 it measures geodesic length divided by the euclidean length in the scan direction each packed system was sliced 5 times yield 5 images and the average value was adopted as input for hydraulic conductivity prediction models overall 150 random configurations of particle packing were created and investigated 2 6 intraparticle porosity of biochar direct characterisation of the microscopic water flow inside a porous particle of biochar by the existing technologies is not feasible due to insufficient resolution therefore we established the pore system of biochar by creating randomly packed particles associated with the grain distribution it was found that intraparticle porosity contributes significantly to the pore system of biochar in the packed pure biochar 59 of the total pore volume is inside the particle according to the results 0 48 0 81 l3 l3 for intraparticle porosity total porosity in granular media the pores smaller than 30 ¬µm in diameter present a high retention capacity to water where water flow becomes stagnant downie et al 2011 based on sem observations observed pores on biochar grains were smaller than 30 ¬µm in addition invisible pores on the wall of honeycomb structure were measured to be 2 nm to 50 nm by n2 adsorption bentley et al 2022 therefore intraparticle pores have negligible contributions to water flow but have great water retention capacity herath et al 2013 which can enhance the water retention of coarse textured soil wang et al 2019 in order to reflect the pore system of biochar sand in the prediction of hydraulic conductivity we consider a dual porosity system in which the water flow inside the biochar particles is negligible the ratio of the intraparticle and interparticle volumes vary with the biochar content however and as shown in fig 5 the ratio of v intra to v s b i o remains unchanged assuming biochar particles are non deformable fig 5 shows a schematic of the pore system of a unit volume of biochar sand mixture where the following relationships can be written 17 v s b i o v intra v inter 1 where v inter is the interparticle void volume v intra is the intraparticle void volume and v s b i o is solid volume the porosity of randomly packed pure biochar n bio was measured to be 0 81 0 02 by measured bulk density œÅ b b i o and particle density œÅ s b i o of biochar according to bs 1377 2 18 n bio 1 œÅ b b i o œÅ s b i o v intra v inter v s b i o v intra v inter 0 81 the intraparticle void is considered to be part of the solid therefore the solid volume becomes 19 v s b i o v s b i o v intra where v s b i o is the pseudo volume of biochar solid the n bio of pure biochar can be obtained from the 3d models fig 4 after the grey scale images are obtained from blender imagej software was used to further edit the images the void area was selected by adjusting the threshold as shown in fig 6 and n was measured to be 0 33 0 03 average over 5 of randomly created configurations 20 n bio v inter v s b i o v inter 0 33 the ratio of solid volume to pseudo solid volume can be calculated 21 v s b i o v s b i o 1 n bio 1 n bio 0 28 to calculate the porosity of the mixture with the intraparticle porosity of biochar excluded a pseudo particle density of biochar œÅ s b i o can be established 22 œÅ s b i o œÅ s b i o v solid v solid 0 37 g c m 3 23

remained constant thus n mix in equation 24 has only two variables the biochar content v and the bulk density of the mixture œÅ b m i x which are easy to measure for other types of biochars or porous particles only a measurement of interparticle porosity of pure packed porous particles is required to get the interparticle porosity of the mixture 3 results and discussions 3 1 experimental results of hydraulic conductivity the results of permeability tests are shown in fig 7 a in coarse sand the hydraulic conductivity of the mixture fluctuates against biochar content a similar trend is observed in medium sand but is much less pronounced compared with pure sand the hydraulic conductivity of medium sand and fine sand decreased for biochar content 10 fig 7 b and c presents the measured hydraulic conductivity vs porosity the original porosity was calculated in equation 15 in which bulk density was obtained by measured bulk volume and weight and particle density of biochar and sand was measured by pycnometer method as described in section 2 1 the corrected porosity was calculated by equation 24 with a pseudo particle density of biochar as described in equation 22 without considering the degree of consolidation the hydraulic conductivity is mainly affected by particle size and porosity as shown in fig 9 both porosity and effective particle size d10 increase with biochar content a previous study indicated that there should be a positive correlation between porosity and hydraulic conductivity vereecken 1995 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 summarised batch data and found that the correlation between hydraulic conductivity and porosity of sand and clay was between 0 9 and 0 99 higher porosity is associated with higher hydraulic conductivity however for medium and fine sand in fig 7 b the increase of porosity does not result in increased hydraulic conductivity before excluding intraparticle porosity of biochar 3 2 characterisation of the pore system the results of calculations of the ssa using equation 16 are shown in fig 8 a the ssa of sand samples varies insignificantly by the addition of biochar the tortuosity is shown in fig 8 b it can be observed that the variations of tortuosity in each sand are not significant the difference between maximum and minimum is less than 10 the increase of the tortuosity with increased biochar content was only evident in the case of fine sand this is related to the particle size difference between the sand and biochar which is the largest for the fine sand the addition of biochar increases the gradation leading to higher tortuosity besides the sphere particles applied in blender regular icosahedron and cube particles were used to investigate the effect of particle shape on tortuosity figs a2 and a3 as shown in fig a5 and table a1 the tortuosity deviation caused by different particle shapes was smaller than 4 3 the corrected porosity calculated in equation 24 and the original porosity calculated in equation 15 are shown in fig 9 the linear fittings of measured porosity original porosity have positive slopes and the fluctuation was due to the difference in the degree of uniformity after the correction the porosity decreased with biochar content the correction was made by excluding the intraparticle porosity of biochar particles therefore the higher the biochar content the more significant the difference between the corrected and the original values the porosity values of the three mixtures are similar while the effective particle size varies significantly in addition the effective size shows increasing trends in the three mixtures due to the fact that biochar particles are larger than sand compared with pure sand the effective grain size of the mixture with 50 biochar content has increased by 12 4 for the coarse sand 20 2 for the medium sand and 34 2 for the fine sand although the difference between the grain size of the fine sand and biochar is the largest the variation in effective particle size is the smallest 3 3 primary and corrected predictions of hydraulic conductivity the predictions significantly deviate from measured data for the chapuis navfac terzaghi and kozeny carman models as shown in fig 10 129 out of 132 predicted hydraulic conductivity values are larger than measured ones and 97 out of 132 predictions are 3 times larger than the measured values all the predictions become closer to the measured values after correction it can be observed from fig 10 that the red data points are closer to the line k k more important besides the predicted value the impact of the addition of biochar on the hydraulic conductivity which is reflected in the trend of the hydraulic conductivity as the content of biochar increases as shown in fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 the overall trends of predicted hydraulic conductivity in each sand have clear positive slopes while those of measured data are negative or flat in other words the four models predict the hydraulic conductivity would increase after mixing with biochar still the measured data shows decline trends in medium sand and fine sand but it fluctuates in coarse sand this means that more biochar although the effective particle size increased will not lead to an increase in the permeability on the contrary biochar would reduce the permeability of sand as shown in figs 11 13 corrected porosity shows downward trends with the increase in biochar content the higher biochar content results in a drop in the effective porosity and a better gradation this explains why adding relatively large sized biochar results in a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 10 predicted values drop significantly and are closer to the measured values as shown in table 3 the ratios of predicted data within 1 3 to 3 times of the measured data increased from 30 30 to 93 94 for chapuis 6 06 to 87 88 for navfac 63 64 to 96 97 for terzaghi and 6 06 to 69 70 for kozeny carman respectively more importantly the trends of predicted hydraulic conductivity against the biochar content are corrected in each type of sand and every model as shown in fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 3 4 validation of the dual porosity concept for sand biochar the breakthrough curves of sodium fluorescein are shown in fig 14 despite the dispersion during the transport the corresponding time of the peak indicates the time needed for water to be transported from inlet to outlet the pore volumes were calculated to be 433 3 ml for 100 ml min flow rate and 362 5 ml for 50 ml min flow rate the bulk volume of the pure biochar was 1104 5 ml therefore the effective porosities pore volume bulk volume were calculated to be 0 39 and 0 33 respectively the porosity calculated by the 3d sphere model was 0 33 0 03 the measured pore volume represents the effective porosity contribute to water flow which was very close to the interparticle porosity obtained from the 3d model although there is no direct connection between the two it is reasonable to conclude the interparticle porosity of biochar is the effective porosity in other words intraparticle porosity has little contribution to water flow in the absence of direct measurement of intraparticle and interparticle porosities the methodology in this research is of value to provide improved prediction considerably toward the measured value if we consider the 50 biochar content samples as an example which is mainly affected by the potential error of excluding intraparticle porosity the range of predicted hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the effective porosity of pure biochar ranged from 0 30 to 0 39 smallest and the highest value obtained in this research as shown in fig 15 it is observed that both the highest and lowest predicted values provide improved predictions against measured hydraulic conductivity the effect of particle shapes sphere regular icosahedron and cube on porosity and tortuosity was evaluated as shown in table a1 and fig a6 the shape induced porosity variation ranged from 0 33 0 03 to 0 35 0 02 and was included in the range evaluated in fig 15 the variation of prediction caused by different shape was no larger than 8 31 which is acceptable mixing different shapes of particles cannot be fully covered in this paper because the number of combinations of variables shapes biochar content and sand to investigate such effects is considerable and require separate work in conclusion the potential error of the 3d model has limited influence on the result the reason is the large void inside biochar particles the measured total porosity of pure biochar was 0 81 which is far larger than the measured calculated effective porosity 0 30 to 0 39 4 conclusions through constant head permeability tests the hydraulic conductivities of sand biochar mixtures were measured for three types of uniformly graded sands with a biochar content ranging from 0 to 50 it was shown that despite the fact that biochar grain sizes and porosity are far larger than that of sand the hydraulic conductivity of the mixtures was not significantly increased this was explained by i mildly elevated effective particle size ii the improved gradation and iii the large intraparticle porosity which contributes limitedly to the water flow the biochar content was expressed as volume ratio to eliminate the substantial density difference between biochar and sand in the absence of direct measurement of interparticle pores 3d models of randomly packed particles were created with grain size distributions associated with the biochar and sand this approach enabled us to statistically evaluate the interparticle porosity and tortuosity of biochar the inclusion of realistic dual pore system of the sand biochar mixture in the four established models resulted in closer approximation to the measured values from the experimental results of this study we show that by excluding biochar s intraparticle porosity the hydraulic conductivity prediction s accuracy can be significantly improved the results presented have important implications for agriculture and water treatment technologies based on biochar applications this paper excluded intraparticle porosity from biochar particles and improved the accuracy of the existing prediction models however further prediction accuracy can be improved if the permeability difference between intraparticle and interparticle pores can be quantified further work will quantify the intraparticle and interparticle porosity ratio in biochar mixtures with more advanced

3121,interest in using biochar in environmental engineering applications has substantially increased with strong evidence emerging for its applicability in water and wastewater treatment the containment of hazardous gases carbon dioxide sequestration and the filtration of microplastics understanding the hydraulic behaviour of sand biochar mixtures is critical for designing biochar based water and wastewater filter systems we present an investigation on the impact of the biochar microstructure on the hydraulic conductivity of sand biochar mixtures focusing on where there are gaps in existing knowledge on how the biochar affects the hydraulic properties a dual porosity concept for sand biochar mixtures is introduced and included in four existing constitutive models for the hydraulic conductivity of soils we have experimentally investigated the hydraulic properties of sand biochar mixtures for uniformly graded sand with three representative grain sizes and one type of hardwood biochar in the uk market based on a series of constant head permeability tests the hydraulic conductivity of the mixtures with biochar content from 0 to 50 has been measured we used randomly generated spherical 3d models representing the same particle distribution of sand biochar systems to characterise the biochar s intraparticle porosity and tortuosity by employing the dual porosity concept and effective porosity instead of the total porosity the accuracy of the four models predictions was considerably improved when compared with the experimental measurements we show that by excluding biochar s intraparticle porosity the hydraulic conductivity prediction accuracy can be significantly improved thus providing a more accurate prediction of the hydraulic behaviour of the soil biochar filters keywords biochar hydraulic conductivity sand filters water flow water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction sand biochar mixtures are of particular interest both from an agriculture application perspective zhou et al 2019 where the soil is mixed with biochar for improved performance and sustainability of the crop yield and environmental engineering perspective for water and wastewater treatment purposes where sand filters are mixed with biochar to enhance the filtration capacity biochar s applications in various engineering areas have substantially expanded in the last decade for example in water purification and wastewater treatment systems zhang et al 2020 and remediation of contaminated soils rajabi et al 2021 recent studies have also shown the potential application of biochar in tackling emerging pollutants such as in the filtration of microplastics from water wang et al 2020 predicting the hydraulic behaviour of sand mixtures or soil mixtures in a broader context is essential for the design of slow and rapid sand filters kramer et al 2021a and the development of sand biochar concepts and applications kramer et al 2021b it can also help evaluate the potential risks of soil loss and deterioration sadeghi et al 2021 studies reported on the effects of adding biochar on the hydraulic conductivity of the mixture indicated a considerable level of uncertainty on how biochar affects the hydraulic conductivity jeffery et al 2015 villagra mendoza and horn 2018 in most cases biochar addition to sand reduced the hydraulic conductivity lim et al 2016 yet contradictory results have also been reported for example hardie et al 2014 reported that biochar amended soil has significantly higher hydraulic conductivity at near saturation state whilst major et al 2012 reported negligible differences between the original soil and the biochar amended soil various models for saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil have been proposed which either use the d10 particle size of 10 passing gradation or porosity chapuis 2004 ren et al 2016 to predict the hydraulic conductivity however most existing models can be applied only to homogeneous and isotropic soils when biochar is mixed with sand there are certain limitations in their applications in sand biochar mixtures as the physical properties of soil particles differ substantially from those of biochar making the mixture heterogeneous in addition the pore spaces inside the biochar particles only participate in water adsorption whilst limitedly contributing to the flow such a dual porosity system occurs in coal xue et al 2021 and shale hu et al 2019 of which the hydraulic conductivity has been well studied luo et al 2021 biochar has porous structure similar to activated carbon and most of its particles are granular and powder form deng et al 2021 compared to sand particles pore volume inside biochar accounts for a large proportion of the total volume liu et al 2016 however water flow in intraparticle pores exhibits different behaviour than in interparticle pores it may require much higher water potential differences to keep water flowing in small pores 30 Œºm downie et al 2011 lim et al 2016 established a prediction model for a biochar and sand mixture based on experimental data and compared it with existing prediction models in geotechnical engineering the model gives an estimation based on the biochar and sand classification it is found that the particle size of biochar is the most critical parameter for the prediction lim et al 2016 previous researchers have found that the correlations between hydraulic conductivity and particle size or porosity in biochar sand mixtures are inconsistent with that in pure sand soil barnes et al 2014 lim et al 2016 however existing prediction models are still applicable if specific criteria are met i the content of biochar is appropriately expressed and ii the dual porosity system is included this paper assesses the impact of biochar on the hydraulic conductivity of sand by incorporating the realistic pore system of the sand biochar mixture the work aims to provide a fundamental understanding of how adding biochar to sandy soils affects the permeability where there is uncertainty on to what extent the hydraulic behaviour is affected by biochar uniformly graded sand with three representative grain sizes and a type of granular hardwood biochar was selected for this study through a series of constant head permeability tests the hydraulic conductivity of the mixtures with biochar content from 0 to 50 was measured the scope of the work is related to the hydraulic behaviour of only fully saturated systems in the experimental programme we have saturated the samples before applying constant water flux and all the measurements and conclusions are related to fully saturated sand biochar by establishing 3d spheres models with the same particle distribution as the biochar particles we present the intraparticle porosity and tortuosity of the biochar we introduce the dual porosity effects on 4 established permeability models and assess the accuracy of the predictions against the experimental results in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 sand and biochar pure sands with a range of particle size distributions were selected in this study the three types of sand used are leighton buzzard silica sand coarse size by garside sands llc play sand medium size from boud materials and the redhill sand fine from british play sand commercial biochar produced in the uk from hardwood was purchased from oxford charcoal company fig a1 biochar has porous structure with hollow interior and a large number of pores on the surface as shown in fig 2 and its surface is negatively charged as shown in table 2 the sand and biochar samples were washed and dried in the oven at 105 for 24 h before use fig a1 the particle size distributions of the sand and biochar are shown in fig 1 the physical properties of the sands are presented in table 1 the particle density was measured by pycnometer according to the british standard bs 1377 2 and the bulk density was calculated by dividing the mass of the mixture added by its volume in the permeability cell due to the low density of biochar 99 5 propan 2 isopropyl alcohol with density of 0 785 mg m3 was used instead of water the specific surface area ssa was measured by the egme method according to cerato and lutenegger 2002 the zeta potential was measured by zetasizer nano zs malvern instrument the scanning electron microscope sem images were taken by fei quanta 650 feg sem and the elemental content was measured by energy dispersive x ray detector edx by oxford instruments 2 2 constant head permeability tests a set of constant head permeability tests were conducted in accordance with the british standard bs 1377 5 fig 3 the sample was packed in a column with diameter of 75 mm and height of 277 mm according to bs 1377 5 section 5 4 2 placing the test sample a hand tamping in three manometers were placed on the column where the upper and lower readings were used to measure the water head differences and the middle one was used to check the validity of the readings whether the water head difference was linear and steady state across the sample has been established during the experiment the water head of the tank and the height of the outlet remained unchanged when the readings of the manometer became constant that is at equilibrium the flow rate was measured at the outlet the volumetric content of biochar in each sand mixture varied from 0 to 50 with an interval of 5 volume ratio the volume ratio was used to quantify the biochar content and particle size distribution rather than the mass ratio this is due to the significant difference between the density of biochar and sand as described in table 1 moreover the size of particles is a key factor affecting hydraulic conductivity therefore the volume ratio is more appropriate in the heterogeneous media studied in this work the d10 size of 10 passing through of the mixtures were calculated pro rata based on the content of biochar and particle size distributions of pure sand and biochar as a validation of the dual porosity concept the measurement of pore volume was conducted using the same column test shown in fig 3 to measure the pore volume of biochar sodium fluorescein cas 518 47 8 was used as a tracer injected at the column s inlet the water flow rate was maintained at 50 ml min and 100 ml min which were the upper and lower flow rates of the constant head permeability tests the sodium fluorescein of 10 ppm was injected from 0 to 30 s while water samples were collected at the outlet point every 30 s the concentration was measured using a fluorometer which at the outlet has a peak the corresponding time of the peak represents the time water travelled from the inlet to the outlet at the current flow rate the pore volume can then be calculated 2 3 prediction models for hydraulic conductivity the relationships chosen to investigate in this study provide

we introduce the dual porosity system of sand biochar mixture in the hydraulic conductivity prediction models described above and assess the accuracy of prediction by such models against the experimental data presented for the case of the commercial granular hardwood biochar 2 4 3d packed granular media by blender software we establish 3d models of the sand biochar mixtures by random assembling 2800 to 3500 spheres using blender software with activated gravity the number and size of the spheres were selected according to the particle size distributions of the soil and biochar used in the experiment to check the effect of particle shape regular icosahedrons and cubes were used as well in assembling the mixtures with blender and the measured porosities and tortuosity were compared in the appendix a as shown in fig 4 the spheres were stirred before packing into a square cylinder to ensure a random packing the spheres were stirred clockwise and anti clockwise by the frictional plate for 10 cycles respectively then the plate was removed and the spheres freely fell into the column apart from the spheres flat plates were used as boundaries which can speed up the calculation compared with cylinders it is noted that the square section columns and circular section columns have negligible effect on porosity once the particles are packed the final frame is baked and a transparent cubic with boolean enabled is used to slice the packed system the material of the spheres is allocated with specific reflectance so that the cross section of sliced spheres has the same colour while the other area void area remains dark 2 5 pore system of biochar sand as described in the introduction adding biochar leads to dual porosity effect due to the intraparticle pore space of biochar in this section we calculate those input parameters required by the prediction model that cannot be directly measured including the interparticle and intraparticle porosity effective specific surface area and tortuosity then we compare the original and dual porosity included output from the prediction models the bulk volume of the mixture v b m i x is not equal to the sum of bulk volumes of biochar v b b i o and sand v b s a n d prior to mixing 9 v b m i x v b b i o v b s a n d on the other hand the volume of solid remained the same before and after mixing regardless of compression 7 v s m i x v s b i o v s s a n d where v s m i x v s b i o and v s s a n d are the solid volume of mixture pure biochar and pure sand respectively the biochar content v is determined by the ratio of bulk volumes prior to mixing and can be derived as the ratio of solid volume of biochar to sand 8 v v b b i o v b b i o v b s a n d v s b i o 1 n bio v s b i o 1 n bio v s s a n d 1 n sand v s b i o v s b i o 1 n bio 1 n sand v s s a n d where n bio and n sand are the porosity of pure biochar and pure sand respectively 9 c 1 n bio 1 n sand 10 v s s a n d 1 v c 1 c v s b i o the porosity of the mixture n mix can be expressed as followed 11 n mix 1 v s s a n d v s b i o v b m i x 1 v s b i o 1 v c 1 c 1 v b m i x the correlation between weight of sand m sand and biochar m bio

b i o 1 v c 1 c 1 1 1 q where œÅ s b i o is the particle density of biochar and œÅ b m i x is the bulk density of the mixture which was calculated by the measured total weight of the mixture and bulk volume the specific surface area ssa of sand and biochar are significantly different due to the porous structure of biochar direct measurement of the internal ssa and external ssa of biochar is not feasible therefore we adopt a calculation based on particle size distribution carrier 2003 16 ssa s f f i d li 0 404 d si 0 595 where d li d si are the larger and smaller sieve sizes cm the sieve

quoted rounded 6 6 medium angularity 7 5 and angular 8 4 in practice the angularity or roundness was classified by visual observation in which particles are then classified based on the angularity chart the biochar particles were angular so the shape factor should be 8 4 with cross section image of packed spheres obtained from blender fig 4 the tortuosity was then calculated by the imagej tortuosity plugin developed by roque and costa 2020 it measures geodesic length divided by the euclidean length in the scan direction each packed system was sliced 5 times yield 5 images and the average value was adopted as input for hydraulic conductivity prediction models overall 150 random configurations of particle packing were created and investigated 2 6 intraparticle porosity of biochar direct characterisation of the microscopic water flow inside a porous particle of biochar by the existing technologies is not feasible due to insufficient resolution therefore we established the pore system of biochar by creating randomly packed particles associated with the grain distribution it was found that intraparticle porosity contributes significantly to the pore system of biochar in the packed pure biochar 59 of the total pore volume is inside the particle according to the results 0 48 0 81 l3 l3 for intraparticle porosity total porosity in granular media the pores smaller than 30 ¬µm in diameter present a high retention capacity to water where water flow becomes stagnant downie et al 2011 based on sem observations observed pores on biochar grains were smaller than 30 ¬µm in addition invisible pores on the wall of honeycomb structure were measured to be 2 nm to 50 nm by n2 adsorption bentley et al 2022 therefore intraparticle pores have negligible contributions to water flow but have great water retention capacity herath et al 2013 which can enhance the water retention of coarse textured soil wang et al 2019 in order to reflect the pore system of biochar sand in the prediction of hydraulic conductivity we consider a dual porosity system in which the water flow inside the biochar particles is negligible the ratio of the intraparticle and interparticle volumes vary with the biochar content however and as shown in fig 5 the ratio of v intra to v s b i o remains unchanged assuming biochar particles are non deformable fig 5 shows a schematic of the pore system of a unit volume of biochar sand mixture where the following relationships can be written 17 v s b i o v intra v inter 1 where v inter is the interparticle void volume v intra is the intraparticle void volume and v s b i o is solid volume the porosity of randomly packed pure biochar n bio was measured to be 0 81 0 02 by measured bulk density œÅ b b i o and particle density œÅ s b i o of biochar according to bs 1377 2 18 n bio 1 œÅ b b i o œÅ s b i o v intra v inter v s b i o v intra v inter 0 81 the intraparticle void is considered to be part of the solid therefore the solid volume becomes 19 v s b i o v s b i o v intra where v s b i o is the pseudo volume of biochar solid the n bio of pure biochar can be obtained from the 3d models fig 4 after the grey scale images are obtained from blender imagej software was used to further edit the images the void area was selected by adjusting the threshold as shown in fig 6 and n was measured to be 0 33 0 03 average over 5 of randomly created configurations 20 n bio v inter v s b i o v inter 0 33 the ratio of solid volume to pseudo solid volume can be calculated 21 v s b i o v s b i o 1 n bio 1 n bio 0 28 to calculate the

remained constant thus n mix in equation 24 has only two variables the biochar content v and the bulk density of the mixture œÅ b m i x which are easy to measure for other types of biochars or porous particles only a measurement of interparticle porosity of pure packed porous particles is required to get the interparticle porosity of the mixture 3 results and discussions 3 1 experimental results of hydraulic conductivity the results of permeability tests are shown in fig 7 a in coarse sand the hydraulic conductivity of the mixture fluctuates against biochar content a similar trend is observed in medium sand but is much less pronounced compared with pure sand the hydraulic conductivity of medium sand and fine sand decreased for biochar content 10 fig 7 b and c presents the measured hydraulic conductivity vs porosity the original porosity was calculated in equation 15 in which bulk density was obtained by measured bulk volume and weight and particle density of biochar and sand was measured by pycnometer method as described in section 2 1 the corrected porosity was calculated by equation 24 with a pseudo particle density of biochar as described in equation 22 without considering the degree of consolidation the hydraulic conductivity is mainly affected by particle size and porosity as shown in fig 9 both porosity and effective particle size d10 increase with biochar content a previous study indicated that there should be a positive correlation between porosity and hydraulic conductivity vereecken 1995 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 summarised batch data and found that the correlation between hydraulic conductivity and porosity of sand and clay was between 0 9 and 0 99 higher porosity is associated with higher hydraulic conductivity however for medium and fine sand in fig 7 b the increase of porosity does not result in increased hydraulic conductivity before excluding intraparticle porosity of biochar 3 2 characterisation of the pore system the results of calculations of the ssa using equation 16 are shown in fig 8 a the ssa of sand samples varies insignificantly by the addition of biochar the tortuosity is shown in fig 8 b it can be observed that the variations of tortuosity in each sand are not significant the difference between maximum and minimum is less than 10 the increase of the tortuosity with increased biochar content was only evident in the case of fine sand this is related to the particle size difference between the sand and biochar which is the largest for the fine sand the addition of biochar increases the gradation leading to higher tortuosity besides the sphere particles applied in blender regular icosahedron and cube particles were used to investigate the effect of particle shape on tortuosity figs a2 and a3 as shown in fig a5 and table a1 the tortuosity deviation caused by different particle shapes was smaller than 4 3 the corrected porosity calculated in equation 24 and the original porosity calculated in equation 15 are shown in fig 9 the linear fittings of measured porosity original porosity have positive slopes and the fluctuation was due to the difference in the degree of uniformity after the correction the porosity decreased with biochar content the correction was made by excluding the intraparticle porosity of biochar particles therefore the higher the biochar content the more significant the difference between the corrected and the original values the porosity values of the three mixtures are similar while the effective particle size varies significantly in addition the effective size shows increasing trends in the three mixtures due to the fact that biochar particles are larger than sand compared with pure sand the effective grain size of the mixture with 50 biochar content has increased by 12 4 for the coarse sand 20 2 for the medium sand and 34 2 for the fine sand although the difference between the grain size of the fine sand and biochar is the largest the variation in effective particle size is the smallest 3 3 primary and corrected predictions of hydraulic conductivity the predictions significantly deviate from measured data for the chapuis navfac terzaghi and kozeny carman models as shown in fig 10 129 out of 132 predicted hydraulic conductivity values are larger than measured ones and 97 out of 132 predictions are 3 times larger than the measured values all the predictions become closer to the measured values after correction it can be observed from fig 10 that the red data points are closer to the line k k more important besides the predicted value the impact of the addition of biochar on the hydraulic conductivity which is reflected in the trend of the hydraulic conductivity as the content of biochar increases as shown in fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 the overall trends of predicted hydraulic conductivity in each sand have clear positive slopes while those of measured data are negative or flat in other words the four models predict the hydraulic conductivity would increase after mixing with biochar still the measured data shows decline trends in medium sand and fine sand but it fluctuates in coarse sand this means that more biochar although the effective particle size increased will not lead to an increase in the permeability on the contrary biochar would reduce the permeability of sand as shown in figs 11 13 corrected porosity shows downward trends with the increase in biochar content the higher biochar content results in a drop in the effective porosity and a better gradation this explains why adding relatively large sized biochar results in a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 10 predicted values drop significantly and are closer to the measured values as shown in table 3 the ratios of predicted data within 1 3 to 3 times of the measured data increased from 30 30 to 93 94 for chapuis 6 06 to 87 88 for navfac 63 64 to 96 97 for terzaghi and 6 06 to 69 70 for kozeny carman respectively more importantly the trends of predicted hydraulic conductivity against the biochar content are corrected in each type of sand and every model as shown in fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 3 4 validation of the dual porosity concept for sand biochar the breakthrough curves of sodium fluorescein are shown in fig 14 despite the dispersion during the transport the corresponding time of the peak indicates the time needed for water to be transported from inlet to outlet the pore volumes were calculated to be 433 3 ml for 100 ml min flow rate and 362 5 ml for 50 ml min flow rate the bulk volume of the pure biochar was 1104 5 ml therefore the effective porosities pore volume bulk volume were calculated to be 0 39 and 0 33 respectively the porosity calculated by the 3d sphere model was 0 33 0 03 the measured pore volume represents the effective porosity contribute to water flow which was very close to the interparticle porosity obtained from the 3d model although there is no direct connection between the two it is reasonable to conclude the interparticle porosity of biochar is the effective porosity in other words intraparticle porosity has little contribution to water flow in the absence of direct measurement of intraparticle and interparticle porosities the methodology in this research is of value to provide improved prediction considerably toward the measured value if we consider the 50 biochar content samples as an example which is mainly affected by the potential error of excluding intraparticle porosity the range of predicted hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the effective porosity of pure biochar ranged from 0 30 to 0 39 smallest and the highest value obtained in this research as shown in fig 15 it is observed that both the highest and lowest predicted values provide improved predictions against measured hydraulic conductivity the effect of particle shapes sphere regular icosahedron and cube on porosity and tortuosity was evaluated as shown in table a1 and fig a6 the shape induced porosity variation ranged from 0 33 0 03 to 0 35 0 02 and was included in the range evaluated in fig 15 the variation of prediction caused by different shape was no larger than 8 31 which is acceptable mixing different shapes of particles cannot be fully covered in this paper because the number of combinations of variables shapes biochar content and sand to investigate such effects is considerable and require separate work in conclusion the potential error of the 3d model has limited influence on the result the reason is the large void inside biochar particles the measured total porosity of pure biochar was 0 81 which is far larger than the measured calculated effective porosity 0 30 to 0 39 4 conclusions through constant head permeability tests the hydraulic conductivities of sand biochar mixtures were measured for three types of uniformly graded sands with a biochar content ranging from 0 to 50 it was shown that despite the fact that biochar grain sizes and porosity are far larger than that of sand the hydraulic conductivity of the mixtures was not significantly increased this was explained by i mildly elevated effective particle size ii the improved gradation and iii the large intraparticle porosity which contributes limitedly to the water flow the biochar content was expressed as volume ratio to eliminate the substantial density difference between biochar and sand in the absence of direct measurement of interparticle pores 3d models of randomly packed particles were created with grain size distributions associated with the biochar and sand this approach enabled us to statistically evaluate the interparticle porosity and tortuosity of biochar the inclusion of realistic dual pore system of the sand biochar mixture in the four established models resulted in closer approximation to the measured values from the experimental results of this study we show that by excluding biochar s intraparticle porosity the hydraulic conductivity prediction s accuracy can be significantly improved the results presented have important implications for agriculture and water treatment technologies based on biochar applications this paper excluded intraparticle porosity from biochar particles and improved the accuracy of the existing prediction models however further prediction accuracy can be improved if the permeability difference between intraparticle and interparticle pores can be quantified further work will quantify the intraparticle and interparticle porosity ratio in biochar mixtures with more advanced

3122,this paper experimentally investigates the variations of the groundwater table when uniform surface recharge with vertical drainage occurs in an unconfined aquifer homogenous and layered soil was considered for the soil profile in the experiments a large scale flume with 5 5 m length 0 6 m width and 1 m height was used for experiments of the groundwater flow the effects of soil type stratification and water level on the groundwater flow were examined under ditch drainage for the layered soil the water table height depends significantly on the properties of the soil layer which is adjacent to the impermeable bed the results of the experiments were compared with the theoretical solutions and the precision of various equations for determining the water table height was evaluated and a reliable equation for different conditions was proposed the results shows that the dupuit approximate is able to precisely predict the water table level in fine sand however it is not capable of predicting the water table level in coarse sand the vertical water velocity which is neglected by dupuit assumption in the coarse sand is considerable so this approximation is not able to appropriately predict the phreatic surface in addition three well known equations of engelund 1951 knight 2005 and castro orgaz et al 2012 are used to predict the phreatic water surface these equations precisely forecast water level height in homogenous coarse sand engelund s solution is applicable merely in free drainage conditions eventually knight 2005 castro orgaz et al 2012 and dupuit

experimental analysis of the two dimensional ditches flow through saturated soil subject to rainfall to generate data and investigate the effects of soil layering on the phreatic surface and then based on the results the validity of well known drainage formulas was tested 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up fig 1 schematically depicts the experimental set up of the present study a relatively large scale standard flume with 5 5 m length 0 6 m width and 1 m height was used for experimental laboratory simulations the left hand and the right hand ends of the sand box were used as ditch drains by maintaining certain water depths h 0 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the impervious bed of the sand box using an adjustable overflow drain pipe in order to prevent transport of soil particles into the drains a number 200 sieve mesh has been installed between the drains and the soil the flume was made from steel with the front wall made from plexiglass material there will be no flow condition at the base of the drainage system because the bottom surface of the flume was an impervious layer the domain of the experiment was limited by the soil surface and by the lower impervious boundary of the aquifer to provide a constant and uniform flux throughout the entire length of the soil sample for the duration of the experiment a precipitation system was used this system consisted of water distribution and water tank sections the water distribution tool included a standard rubber cylinder 15 cm in diameter 466 cm long equipped with a series of standard hypodermic needles almost 250 and it was also secured by a water tank which was continuously supplied by a running tap moreover volumetric tests have been carried out from 3 points of the soil surface to ensure the performance of the uniform recharge system the experiment was initiated by first submerging the whole sand height in the water so as to create a saturated porous media then the water level in the ditches was lowered to a certain depth of 40 cm above the bed simultaneously the entire soil surface was imposed on the uniform rainfall after a certain period during which the groundwater level and water discharge rate from ditches were unchanged it is possible to observe the steady state phreatic line subsequently this process was repeated for various levels of water in the ditches as shown in fig 1 the phreatic line was observed by 39 piezometers which were embedded under the impervious bed a very fine screen mesh 200 was used at the connection point of the sandbox and piezometers to prevent fine grained soil movement into pipes each of these piezometers was installed on the piezometer board volumetric method was carried out in a steady state condition to measure the recharge rate r 2 2 soil types and soil profiles two types of fine and coarse river sand were used in the experiments particle size distribution curves of the soils are indicated in fig 3 based on uscs fine sand was classified as poorly graded sand sp and coarse sand was classified as well graded sand sw hydraulic conductivity of the soils was determined by a constant head permeability test in the experiments five layouts were considered as the soil profile fig 4 two of five layouts are classified as homogeneous soil one model with uniformly compacted fine grain sand with k1 0 0056 cm s and the other one with uniformly compacted coarse grain sand with k2 0 08 cm s three layouts are classified as layered soil two models with horizontally oriented and one layout with vertically oriented configuration the tested layouts are shown as follows 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of water level changes inside ditches on the phreatic surface the experimental results of the steady state water table fluctuations in the homogeneous and layered soil conditions with a uniform surface recharge for five different ditch water levels are indicated in fig 5 in the figure variations of dimensionless hydraulic head h h against dimensionless length x l for five different dimensionless ditch water levels h 0 h h 0 h 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 are presented according to the graphs it is clear that the water table in the soil has an elliptical shape which is due to various water discharge velocity through the soil profile in the vicinity of the ditch drains the flow discharge is quite high and by getting farther from the drains the velocity decreases until reaching its minimum value v 0 at the middle of the flume therefore the minimum water table height is observed near the vertical drains and the maximum heights can be observed about the middle of the flume however the maximum height of the water table was shifted to the right side of the flume approximately at x l 0 6 in vertically layered soil because of the low hydraulic conductivity in fine grain layer compared with coarse sand fig 5a indicates the variation of water level in the homogeneous fine sand for uniform recharge of 0 00175 cm s it is obvious that the water table height in the soil increases with increasing the water level inside the ditches however this rise has a greater effect on the points near the drains rather than the central points this is because of the low hydraulic conductivity fine sand consequently the effects of ditch water level changes on the middle points of the soil can be neglected in other words the variations of h m are approximately equal to zero fig 5b shows the water table fluctuations in the homogeneous coarse sand with r 0 0042 cm s the change of the ditches water level in coarse sand does not just affect the points between drainage and the maximum height of the water table it has a constant effect on the h m because of the high hydraulic conductivity regarding the higher rate of precipitation in coarse sand compared to the fine sand rcoarse sand 2 5 rfine sand in fig 5a and b the water table height in fine sand is significantly higher than the coarse sand owing to the low water discharge rate in fine grain sand with respect to the coarse grain sand in these dimensionless graphs the shape of phreatic surface depends on the quantity r k which r variations were not considered the seepage face sharply reduces almost half value in both homogeneous soils when dimensionless rate of drainage rises from zero to 0 1 besides the seepage face has a gradual reduction from h 0 h 0 1 to h 0 h 0 4 the seepage face of fine grain sand is higher than coarse grain sand in ditches fig 5c and d illustrate the experimental results in the horizontally layered soils for different drainage water levels in these cases the behavior of groundwater height profile significantly depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer as seen in fig 5c and d the variation of water table in layered soil with fine layer at the top are similar to the homogeneous fine sand fig 5a however groundwater variations in layered soil with coarse layer at top is more similar to the homogeneous coarse sand fig 5b although the groundwater heights in layered soil with top layer fine sand are much lower than top layer coarse sand the seepage face of top layer fine sand is greater than top layer coarse sand results of phreatic line variations in vertically layered soil profile due to water level changes in the drains and subjected to the surface recharge with r 0 00175 cm s have been plotted in fig 5e there is a coarse sand layer at the left and a fine sand layer at the right of the soil profile based on the achieved results at the x l 0 5 water table height experienced a rise due to the presence of the fine sand layer the phreatic line level in the fine sand layer is higher than the coarse sand layer due to a difference in water discharge and water drainage properties in the fine and coarse sand moreover for the vertically layered sand the changes in water table height because of different ditch water levels in the vertical fine layer are less than the coarse sand each vertical layer has its water table the internal seepage which may be caused by the high difference between hydraulic conductivities of two vertical layers did not form additionally the chance of the internal seepage appearing in the midway of the soil element is reduced by increasing the water level inside ditches as the h 0 h ratio increases the phreatic line in the coarse layer approaches the water elevation in the fine sand layer it can be observed that the maximum water table height was shifted from the middle of the soil towards the fine sand the seepage faces at the right side of the profile are approximately equal to seepage faces at the left side of the profile 3 2 influence of soil layout on the phreatic line this part deals with the comparison of the water table changes in different soil layouts conditions subjected to equal surface recharge r among the conducted experiments the homogeneous coarse soil and horizontally layered soils were subjected to equal surface recharge rate of r 0 0042 cm s the comparison results are indicated in fig 6 a in h 0 h 0 4 it is obvious that the horizontally layered sand with fine sand at the bottom has higher groundwater level rather than the horizontally layered sand with the coarse sand at the bottom and the homogeneous coarse sand subjected to equal recharge rate the water table height in the horizontally layered soil with coarse sand at the bottom is higher than the water table height in the homogeneous coarse sand however the difference between them is not remarkable the comparison results emphasize on the role of the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in determining the water table height in the homogenous and layered soil profiles fig 6b shows the comparison of experimental data in homogeneous fine sand and vertically layered soil with an equal rate of surface recharge r 0 00175 cm s as specified by the experimental results the phreatic height in homogeneous fine sand is higher than the vertically layered soil due to its lower hydraulic conductivity ditch water level directly affected the groundwater height in the soil although it does not greatly change the maximum water table height in homogeneous fine sand the results also show that the water table is significantly dependent on the under layer s hydraulic conductivity in horizontally layered soils in the vertically layered soils a coarse layer acts as drainage and reduces the water height in the soil profile 4 analysis of well known equations in this part of the study the validity of well known drainage formulas was tested the considered mathematical solutions are introduced as follows dupuit 1886 derived a fundamental equation for determining steady state water table height h df x with vertical drainage and recharge by his well known assumptions the assumptions are that 1 the hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope of the water table and 2 for small water table gradient the streamlines are horizontal and the equipotential lines are vertical the dupuit s equation is as follows childs 1969 rushton and youngs 2010 1 h df x l 2 2 x 2 q k h 0 2 engelund s 1951 conformal mapping solution for the steady state drainage of constant surface recharge r with hydraulic conductivity k to parallel toe drains gives the phreatic line location h e x as youngs 1990 youngs 2012 2 h e x r k l 2 2 1 r k x 2 engelund s solution can only be used in h 0 h equal to zero which in this equation x is equal to zero and l gives height of seepage face knight 2005 gives an equation with modifying the dupuit solution for groundwater level subject to surface recharge with ditches by numerical analyses as castro orgaz et al 2012 3 h k x h 0 2 x r k l x 1 2 n 3 k castro orgaz et al 2012 proposed eq 4 to predict the water table elevation in r k 2 3 condition as follows castro orgaz and hager 2017 4 h co x h 0 2 r k l 2 2 x 2 2 3 r k 2 x 2 1 2 r 3 k 1 all of the aforementioned equations except eq 1 can give the height of the seepage face at x equal to zero and l the normalized objective function nof was used to evaluate the relations above and propose guidelines for practical propose based on this method the more the nof value tends to zero the more consistent the experimental and theoretical results kornecki et al 1999 in order to find an excellent match nof should be less than 1 0 in such a case the theoretical method is still reliable and can be used with acceptable accuracy moutsopoulos et al 2009 sedghi asl et al 2014a nof is defined as 5 n o f r m s e x 6 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 x 1 n i 1 n x i in which n number of experimental data x average of the experimental data x i experimental data value and y i theoretical data value 4 1 evaluating the analytical solutions in homogenous soils this section is dedicated to comparing experimental and mathematical results in homogeneous soil for five values of h 0 h the values of nof for homogenous fine and coarse sand are shown as table 1 as observed table 1 dupuit theory is in very close agreement with experimental results in fine sand however the accuracy of this equation slightly decreases with increasing of the h 0 h value from another point of view the eqs 2 3 and 4 are not reliable in this case moreover all analytical solutions overestimated the water table height in fine sand from the table 1 it can be seen that the eqs 2 3 and 4 have a high accuracy in homogeneous coarse sand although engelund s solution gives the best fitted answer when h 0 h equal to zero in this case dupuit s solution is unable to predict the groundwater height and engelund s analysis also cannot be used when there is water in the ditches standing at a height h 0 rushton 2004 noted that dupuit theory underestimates the maximum height of the water table in this series of comparison the results clearly show that the prediction of the dupuit equation has a good agreement with experimental results in homogenous find sand however it is not suggested for use in homogeneous coarse sand the main reason for that goes back to the dupuit assumption which neglected the vertical component of velocity whereas the portion of vertical flow is relatively high in homogeneous coarse sand and it cannot be ignored it is similar to the results of the previous study bear 1972 lee and leap 1997 which showed dupuit assumption error is great when the ignored vertical flow cannot be neglected fig 7 clearly depicts the variation of coarse and fine sand water table prediction in h 0 h 0 by controversial equations to better understand the performance of equations in different parts of the phreatic surface based on the results the dupuit assumption and knight s solution do not consider a seepage face for a phreatic surface the predicted seepage face heights by knight s equation are so small and can be denied the engelund s solution and eq 4 are recommended for use in prediction of seepage face in homogeneous coarse sand when h 0 h 0 and h 0 h 0 respectively as shown fig 7 knight s modified solution eq 4 and engelund s equation have precise and close predictions in coarse grain sand although these solutions are not expected to be used in fine grain sand as observed fig 7b engelund s equation underestimates the water table elevation from nearly 0 25l to 0 75l 4 2 evaluating the analytical solutions in layered soils finding the water table elevation becomes problematical when the aquifer contains different layers in this case equations are not easy to use and are restricted in specific situations that they cannot be used practically therefore in this section the well known equations which are used in homogeneous soil have been tested to predict the phreatic line subjected to rainfall by equivalent hydraulic conductivity the dupuit approximation was previously analyzed in two layered soil by researchers youngs and rushton 2009a b rushton and ghataora 2009 table 2 indicates the results of nof values in horizontally and vertically layered soil for different h 0 h it can be seen that the accuracy of the entire equation increases by enhancing the value of h 0 h the used solutions give an approximately similar prediction in two layered soil with top layer fine however the knight s solution calculates the groundwater elevation a bit better than others when the top layer of porous media is fine sand the maximum water table height is overestimated by engelund knight and castro orgaz et al s equations and it is also underestimated by the dupuit analysis thus in this case it can be introduced as an upper and lower boundary for real water table locations the dupuit equation fails to find the water table location in two layered soil with coarse layer on top but the other three equations engelund knight and castro orgaz et al are more accurate especially castro orgaz et al s 2012 solution eventually the dupuit solution yields good estimates of steady state water table height due to surface recharge in vertically layered soil although other equations error is considerable the dupuit s equation performed weakly in horizontally layered sand with top layer coarse grain due to the fact that the water infiltration mainly occurs at the top of sand which is comprised of coarse sand so vertical velocity of water is remarkable in this condition which is a neglected factor in this equation the results of experimental data of steady state water table height profiles in the two layered soil are compared with analytical solutions in fig 8 for h 0 h 0 the castro orgaz et al solution has adequate accuracy to predict the seepage face of the top layer fine and top layer coarse soils but its error is great to find a seepage face height in vertically layered soil from fig 8a and b the analytical solutions always yield the same results for horizontally layered soils because in these equations there is not a specified parameter to identify the position of different layers however the analytical equations give a reasonable answer for water table height except the dupuit s equation in the top layer of fine sand the good agreement between the water table locations is indicated in fig 8c for the experimental results and dupuit s solution in the vertically layered sand especially at the right side of the water table profile in which the fine sand layer is used 5 conclusions this paper considers the steady state drainage problem of uniform recharge for ditches overlying an impermeable stratum effects of ditch water levels h 0 soil hydraulic conductivity k and layout of the soil layers on the water table profile under the uniform surface recharge rate were investigated moreover experimental results were compared with well known theoretical equations achieved results are mentioned as follows 1 by increasing the water level inside the ditch in fine sand the water table height in the soil increases however this rise has a greater effect on the points near the drains rather than central points which is due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the fine sand consequently the effects of ditch water level changes on the middle points of the soil can be neglected variations are approximately equal to zero 2 the variations of the water table in the coarse sand due to change of the water level in the drainages are approximately constant along the length of the flume this means that change in the height of the water near the drains is approximately equal to changes in the water level in the middle of the flume 3 for the horizontally layered soil profile with the fine sand as the lower layer the variation of the water table with changes in the drainage water height are like the homogeneous fine sand bottom layer for the horizontally layered soil profile with coarse sand as the bottom layer the changes in the water table are similar to the homogeneous coarse sand bottom layer it was concluded that in the two layered soil profile the changes in groundwater height significantly depend on the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer 4 for the vertically layered sand the phreatic line level in the fine sand layer is higher than the coarse sand layer due to a difference in water discharge and water drainage properties in the fine and coarse sand each vertical layer has its water table the internal seepage which may be caused by the high difference between hydraulic conductivities of two vertical layers did not form in addition the chance of the internal seepage appearing in the midway of the soil element is reduced by increasing the water level inside ditches as the h 0 h ratio increases the phreatic line in the coarse layer approaches the water elevation in the fine sand layer the seepage face sharply declined when the water level in ditches increased from zero to 10 cm and reached its lowest height when the ditch s water level is 40 cm 5 it was concluded that the precision of the theoretical methods strongly depends on the specified method used for prediction hydraulic conductivity of the soil water table height in the drains 6 the dupuit approximation as the most common analytical solution predicts the water table height in homogeneous fine sand and vertically layered sand very well but it is not recommended for use in the homogeneous coarse sand because the dupuit theory ignores the vertical water velocity for the 2 d problems this approximation gives a considerable error to predict the soil water table subject to surface recharge in the coarse sand which in this condition vertical water velocity is high 7 engelund 1951 knight 2005 and castro orgaz 2012 analytical solutions have high accuracy to predict the phreatic line level in homogeneous coarse sand moreover they calculated the water table height with low error in horizontally layered sand engelund 1951 and castro orgaz et al s solutions are suggested to find the seepage face in homogeneous

3122,this paper experimentally investigates the variations of the groundwater table when uniform surface recharge with vertical drainage occurs in an unconfined aquifer homogenous and layered soil was considered for the soil profile in the experiments a large scale flume with 5 5 m length 0 6 m width and 1 m height was used for experiments of the groundwater flow the effects of soil type stratification and water level on the groundwater flow were examined under ditch drainage for the layered soil the water table height depends significantly on the properties of the soil layer which is adjacent to the impermeable bed the results of the experiments were compared with the theoretical solutions and the precision of various equations for determining the water table height was evaluated and a reliable equation for different conditions was proposed the results shows that the dupuit approximate is able to precisely predict the water table level in fine sand however it is not capable of predicting the water table level in coarse sand the vertical water velocity which is neglected by dupuit assumption in the coarse sand is considerable so this approximation is not able to appropriately predict the phreatic surface in addition three well known equations of engelund 1951 knight 2005 and castro orgaz et al 2012 are used to predict the phreatic water surface these equations precisely forecast water level height in homogenous coarse sand engelund s solution is applicable merely in free drainage conditions eventually knight 2005 castro orgaz et al 2012 and dupuit

ditches was lowered to a certain depth of 40 cm above the bed simultaneously the entire soil surface was imposed on the uniform rainfall after a certain period during which the groundwater level and water discharge rate from ditches were unchanged it is possible to observe the steady state phreatic line subsequently this process was repeated for various levels of water in the ditches as shown in fig 1 the phreatic line was observed by 39 piezometers which were embedded under the impervious bed a very fine screen mesh 200 was used at the connection point of the sandbox and piezometers to prevent fine grained soil movement into pipes each of these piezometers was installed on the piezometer board volumetric method was carried out in a steady state condition to measure the recharge rate r 2 2 soil types and soil profiles two types of fine and coarse river sand were used in the experiments particle size distribution curves of the soils are indicated in fig 3 based on uscs fine sand was classified as poorly graded sand sp and coarse sand was classified as well graded sand sw hydraulic conductivity of the soils was determined by a constant head permeability test in the experiments five layouts were considered as the soil profile fig 4 two of five layouts are classified as homogeneous soil one model with uniformly compacted fine grain sand with k1 0 0056 cm s and the other one with uniformly compacted coarse grain sand with k2 0 08 cm s three layouts are classified as layered soil two models with horizontally oriented and one layout with vertically oriented configuration the tested layouts are shown as follows 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of water level changes inside ditches on the phreatic surface the experimental results of the steady state water table fluctuations in the homogeneous and layered soil conditions with a uniform surface recharge for five different ditch water levels are indicated in fig 5 in the figure variations of dimensionless hydraulic head h h against dimensionless length x l for five different dimensionless ditch water levels h 0 h h 0 h 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 are presented according to the graphs it is clear that the water table in the soil has an elliptical shape which is due to various water discharge velocity through the soil profile in the vicinity of the ditch drains the flow discharge is quite high and by getting farther from the drains the velocity decreases until reaching its minimum value v 0 at the middle of the flume therefore the minimum water table height is observed near the vertical drains and the maximum heights can be observed about the middle of the flume however the maximum height of the water table was shifted to the right side of the flume approximately at x l 0 6 in vertically layered soil because of the low hydraulic conductivity in fine grain layer compared with coarse sand fig 5a indicates the variation of water level in the homogeneous fine sand for uniform recharge of 0 00175 cm s it is obvious that the water table height in the soil increases with increasing the water level inside the ditches however this rise has a greater effect on the points near the drains rather than the central points this is because of the low hydraulic conductivity fine sand consequently the effects of ditch water level changes on the middle points of the soil can be neglected in other words the variations of h m are approximately equal to zero fig 5b shows the water table fluctuations in the homogeneous coarse sand with r 0 0042 cm s the change of the ditches water level in coarse sand does not just affect the points between drainage and the maximum height of the water table it has a constant effect on the h m because of the high hydraulic conductivity regarding the higher rate of precipitation in coarse sand compared to the fine sand rcoarse sand 2 5 rfine sand in fig 5a and b the water table height in fine sand is significantly higher than the coarse sand owing to the low water discharge rate in fine grain sand with respect to the coarse grain sand in these dimensionless graphs the shape of phreatic surface depends on the quantity r k which r variations were not considered the seepage face sharply reduces almost half value in both homogeneous soils when dimensionless rate of drainage rises from zero to 0 1 besides the seepage face has a gradual reduction from h 0 h 0 1 to h 0 h 0 4 the seepage face of fine grain sand is higher than coarse grain sand in ditches fig 5c and d illustrate the experimental results in the horizontally layered soils for different drainage water levels in these cases the behavior of groundwater height profile significantly depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer as seen in fig 5c and d the variation of water table in layered soil with fine layer at the top are similar to the homogeneous fine sand fig 5a however groundwater variations in layered soil with coarse layer at top is more similar to the homogeneous coarse sand fig 5b although the groundwater heights in layered soil with top layer fine sand are much lower than top layer coarse sand the seepage face of top layer fine sand is greater than top layer coarse sand results of phreatic line variations in vertically layered soil profile due to water level changes in the drains and subjected to the surface recharge with r 0 00175 cm s have been plotted in fig 5e there is a coarse sand layer at the left and a fine sand layer at the right of the soil profile based on the achieved results at the x l 0 5 water table height experienced a rise due to the presence of the fine sand layer the phreatic line level in the fine sand layer is higher than the coarse sand layer due to a difference in water discharge and water drainage properties in the fine and coarse sand moreover for the vertically layered sand the changes in water table height because of different ditch water levels in the vertical fine layer are less than the coarse sand each vertical layer has its water table the internal seepage which may be caused by the high difference between hydraulic conductivities of two vertical layers did not form additionally the chance of the internal seepage appearing in the midway of the soil element is reduced by increasing the water level inside ditches as the h 0 h ratio increases the phreatic line in the coarse layer approaches the water elevation in the fine sand layer it can be observed that the maximum water table height was shifted from the middle of the soil towards the fine sand the seepage faces at the right side of the profile are approximately equal to seepage faces at the left side of the profile 3 2 influence of soil layout on the phreatic line this part deals with the comparison of the water table changes in different soil layouts conditions subjected to equal surface recharge r among the conducted experiments the homogeneous coarse soil and horizontally layered soils were subjected to equal surface recharge rate of r 0 0042 cm s the comparison results are indicated in fig 6 a in h 0 h 0 4 it is obvious that the horizontally layered sand with fine sand at the bottom has higher groundwater level rather than the horizontally layered sand with the coarse sand at the bottom and the homogeneous coarse sand subjected to equal recharge rate the water table height in the horizontally layered soil with coarse sand at the bottom is higher than the water table height in the homogeneous coarse sand however the difference between them is not remarkable the comparison results emphasize on the role of the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in determining the water table height in the homogenous and layered soil profiles fig 6b shows the comparison of experimental data in homogeneous fine sand and vertically layered soil with an equal rate of surface recharge r 0 00175 cm s as specified by the experimental results the phreatic height in homogeneous fine sand is higher than the vertically layered soil due to its lower hydraulic conductivity ditch water level directly affected the groundwater height in the soil although it does not greatly change the maximum water table height in homogeneous fine sand the results also show that the water table is significantly dependent on the under layer s hydraulic conductivity in horizontally layered soils in the vertically layered soils a coarse layer acts as drainage and reduces the water height in the soil profile 4 analysis of well known equations in this part of the study the validity of well known drainage formulas was tested the considered mathematical solutions are introduced as follows dupuit 1886 derived a fundamental equation for determining steady state water table height h df x with vertical drainage and recharge by his well known assumptions the assumptions are that 1 the hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope of the water table and 2 for small water table gradient the streamlines are horizontal and the equipotential lines are vertical the dupuit s equation is as follows childs 1969 rushton and youngs 2010 1 h df x l 2 2 x 2 q k h 0 2 engelund s 1951 conformal mapping solution for the steady state drainage of constant surface recharge r with hydraulic conductivity k to parallel toe drains gives the phreatic line location h e x as youngs 1990 youngs 2012 2 h e x r k l 2 2 1 r k x 2 engelund s solution can only be used in h 0 h equal to zero which in this equation x is equal to zero and l gives height of seepage face knight 2005 gives an equation with modifying the dupuit solution for groundwater level subject to surface recharge with ditches by numerical analyses as castro orgaz et al 2012 3 h k x h 0 2 x r k l x 1 2 n 3 k castro orgaz et al 2012 proposed eq 4 to predict the water table elevation in r k 2 3 condition as follows castro orgaz and hager 2017 4 h co x h 0 2 r k l 2 2 x 2 2 3 r k 2 x 2 1 2 r 3 k 1 all of the aforementioned equations except eq 1 can give the height of the seepage face at x equal to zero and l the normalized objective function nof was used to evaluate the relations above and propose guidelines for practical propose based on this method the more the nof value tends to zero the more consistent the experimental and theoretical results kornecki et al 1999 in order to find an excellent match nof should be less than 1 0 in such a case the theoretical method is still reliable and can be used with acceptable accuracy moutsopoulos et al 2009 sedghi asl et al 2014a nof is defined as 5 n o f r m s e x 6 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 x 1 n i 1 n x i in which n number of experimental data x average of the experimental data x i experimental data value and y i theoretical data value 4 1 evaluating the analytical solutions in homogenous soils this section is dedicated to comparing experimental and mathematical results in homogeneous soil for five values of h 0 h the values of nof for homogenous fine and coarse sand are shown as table 1 as observed table 1 dupuit theory is in very close agreement with experimental results in fine sand however the accuracy of this equation slightly decreases with increasing of the h 0 h value from another point of view the eqs 2 3 and 4 are not reliable in this case moreover all analytical solutions overestimated the water table height in fine sand from the table 1 it can be seen that the eqs 2 3 and 4 have a high accuracy in homogeneous coarse sand although engelund s solution gives the best fitted answer when h 0 h equal to zero in this case dupuit s solution is unable to predict the groundwater height and engelund s analysis also cannot be used when there is water in the ditches standing at a height h 0 rushton 2004 noted that dupuit theory underestimates the maximum height of the water table in this series of comparison the results clearly show that the prediction of the dupuit equation has a good agreement with experimental results in homogenous find sand however it is not suggested for use in homogeneous coarse sand the main reason for that goes back to the dupuit assumption which neglected the vertical component of velocity whereas the portion of vertical flow is relatively high in homogeneous coarse sand and it cannot be ignored it is similar to the results of the previous study bear 1972 lee and leap 1997 which showed dupuit assumption error is great when the ignored vertical flow cannot be neglected fig 7 clearly depicts the variation of coarse and fine sand water table prediction in h 0 h 0 by controversial equations to better understand the performance of equations in different parts of the phreatic surface based on the results the dupuit assumption and knight s solution do not consider a seepage face for a phreatic surface the predicted seepage face heights by knight s equation are so small and can be denied the engelund s solution and eq 4 are recommended for use in prediction of seepage face in homogeneous coarse sand when h 0 h 0 and h 0 h 0 respectively as shown fig 7 knight s modified solution eq 4 and engelund s equation have precise and close predictions in coarse grain sand although these solutions are not expected to be used in fine grain sand as observed fig 7b engelund s equation underestimates the water table elevation from nearly 0 25l to 0 75l 4 2 evaluating the analytical solutions in layered soils finding the water table elevation becomes problematical when the aquifer contains different layers in this case equations are not easy to use and are restricted in specific situations that they cannot be used practically therefore in this section the well known equations which are used in homogeneous soil have been tested to predict the phreatic line subjected to rainfall by equivalent hydraulic conductivity the dupuit approximation was previously analyzed in two layered soil by researchers youngs and rushton 2009a b rushton and ghataora 2009 table 2 indicates the results of nof values in horizontally and vertically layered soil for different h 0 h it can be seen that the accuracy of the entire equation increases by enhancing the value of h 0 h the used solutions give an approximately similar prediction in two layered soil with top layer fine however the knight s solution calculates the groundwater elevation a bit better than others when the top layer of porous media is fine sand the maximum water table height is overestimated by engelund knight and castro orgaz et al s equations and it is also underestimated by the dupuit analysis thus in this case it can be introduced as an upper and lower boundary for real water table locations the dupuit equation fails to find the water table location in two layered soil with coarse layer on top but the other three equations engelund knight and castro orgaz et al are more accurate especially castro orgaz et al s 2012 solution eventually the dupuit solution yields good estimates of steady state water table height due to surface recharge in vertically layered soil although other equations error is considerable the dupuit s equation performed weakly in horizontally layered sand with top layer coarse grain due to the fact that the water infiltration mainly occurs at the top of sand which is comprised of coarse sand so vertical velocity of water is remarkable in this condition which is a neglected factor in this equation the results of experimental data of steady state water table height profiles in the two layered soil are compared with analytical solutions in fig 8 for h 0 h 0 the castro orgaz et al solution has adequate accuracy to predict the seepage face of the top layer fine and top layer coarse soils but its error is great to find a seepage face height in vertically layered soil from fig 8a and b the analytical solutions always yield the same results for horizontally layered soils because in these equations there is not a specified parameter to identify the position of different layers however the analytical equations give a reasonable answer for water table height except the dupuit s equation in the top layer of fine sand the good agreement between the water table locations is indicated in fig 8c for the experimental results and dupuit s solution in the vertically layered sand especially at the right side of the water table profile in which the fine sand layer is used 5 conclusions this paper considers the steady state drainage problem of uniform recharge for ditches overlying an impermeable stratum effects of ditch water levels h 0 soil hydraulic conductivity k and layout of the soil layers on the water table profile under the uniform surface recharge rate were investigated moreover experimental results were compared with well known theoretical equations achieved results are mentioned as follows 1 by increasing the water level inside the ditch in fine sand the water table height in the soil increases however this rise has a greater effect on the points near the drains rather than central points which is due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the fine sand consequently the effects of ditch water level changes on the middle points of the soil can be neglected variations are approximately equal to zero 2 the variations of the water table in the coarse sand due to change of the water level in the drainages are approximately constant along the length of the flume this means that change in the height of the water near the drains is approximately equal to changes in the water level in the middle of the flume 3 for the horizontally layered soil profile with the fine sand as the lower layer the variation of the water table with changes in the drainage water height are like the homogeneous fine sand bottom layer for the horizontally layered soil profile with coarse sand as the bottom layer the changes in the water table are similar to the homogeneous coarse sand bottom layer it was concluded that in the two layered soil profile the changes in groundwater height significantly depend on the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer 4 for the vertically layered sand the phreatic line level in the fine sand layer is higher than the coarse sand layer due to a difference in water discharge and water drainage properties in the fine and coarse sand each vertical layer has its water table the internal seepage which may be caused by the high difference between hydraulic conductivities of two vertical layers did not form in addition the chance of the internal seepage appearing in the midway of the soil element is reduced by increasing the water level inside ditches as the h 0 h ratio increases the phreatic line in the coarse layer approaches the water elevation in the fine sand layer the seepage face sharply declined when the water level in ditches increased from zero to 10 cm and reached its lowest height when the ditch s water level is 40 cm 5 it was concluded that the precision of the theoretical methods strongly depends on the specified method used for prediction hydraulic conductivity of the soil water table height in the drains 6 the dupuit approximation as the most common analytical solution predicts the water table height in homogeneous fine sand and vertically layered sand very well but it is not recommended for use in the homogeneous coarse sand because the dupuit theory ignores the vertical water velocity for the 2 d problems this approximation gives a considerable error to predict the soil water table subject to surface recharge in the coarse sand which in this condition vertical water velocity is high 7 engelund 1951 knight 2005 and castro orgaz 2012 analytical solutions have high accuracy to predict the phreatic line level in homogeneous coarse sand moreover they calculated the water table height with low error in horizontally layered sand engelund 1951 and castro orgaz et al s solutions are suggested to find the seepage face in homogeneous

3123,hydrological and salinity fluctuations in coastal wetlands induced by climatic change e g drought and anthropogenic activities can significantly affect the blue carbon sink via soil respiration co2 emissions however little information is available on the interactive effects of the groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration in coastal wetlands here in situ soil columns were collected from tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes to conduct a simulated assessment of the effects of fluctuations in the groundwater table 30 cm 20 cm and 10 cm and salinity 0 ppt

in brackish wetlands 0 17 0 9 Œºmol m2 s in all groundwater table and salinity treatments the diurnal variation in soil respiration in the three simulated wetlands showed a unimodal curve while the

projects keywords groundwater table seawater intrusion salinity interactive effects co2 emissions coastal wetlands 1 introduction coastal wetlands have remarkable blue carbon sink functions and have been given the subject of increasing concerns davidson et al 2018 liu et al 2021 spivak et al 2019 although the total area of coastal wetlands is 1 of the ocean they can store blue carbon from marine and atmospheric sources macreadie et al 2019 at a high carbon burial rate of 218 24 g c m 2 yr 1 which is 40 times higher than that of tropical rainforests mcleod et al 2011 rosentreter et al 2018 it is estimated that the upper layer approximately 1 m of salt marshes stores approximately 917 t co2 e ha 1 sapkota and white 2021 which can effectively mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions and climatic change by capturing atmospheric co2 in the soil and sequestering it for thousands of years soil respiration is the primary pathway by which carbon fixed in the soil is returned to the atmosphere the dynamics of soil respiration can highly impact blue carbon sequestration and the carbon balance in coastal wetlands as a hotspot of research on the carbon cycle in coastal wetlands soil respiration has been challenged by multiple environmental factors in recent decades increasingly frequent hydrometeorological disasters e g droughts floods and storm surges have seriously threatened the stability and security of coastal wetland ecosystems under the combined influence of high intensity anthropogenic activities and global climate change seawater intrusion sea level rise and extreme weather events have resulted in groundwater table and salinity fluctuations which will influence the blue carbon sink function of coastal wetlands crooks et al 2018 huang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 ren et al 2021 as one of the important processes in the global carbon cycle soil respiration can be influenced by several environmental factors e g temperature moisture and salinity temperature can affect soil respiration by influencing the activity of microorganisms and associated enzymes allison et al 2010 chen et al 2021 the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration q 10 has attracted widespread attention because it is considered as a key parameter for predicting future climate change scenarios and modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle bond lamberty et al 2018 xie et al 2014 moreover the dramatic water level and salt fluctuations in coastal wetlands can significantly affect the soil co2 emissions yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that soil moisture content can affect soil respiration by controlling the distribution of oxygen redox conditions and aerobic anaerobic boundaries in the soil elberling et al 2011 macreadie et al 2017 setia et al 2011b soil with higher water content has a stronger reducing power which inhibits the decomposition of organic matter stagg et al 2017 xia et al 2021 liu et al 2017 found that dry wet alternation affected soil respiration by influencing soil moisture fluctuations in surface water level and moisture can also cause the change in salinity in coastal wetlands which will alter microbial diversity and community structure thus affecting soil respiration yang et al 2018 reported that within the appropriate salinity threshold for microorganisms increased salinity would stimulate microbial decomposition and thus promote soil respiration however beyond the threshold excessive salinity would decrease microbial activity and inhibit soil respiration recently cui et al 2021 found that groundwater table and salinity in coastal wetlands have interactive effects on soil respiration but the mechanisms of their interactive effects on soil respiration in coastal wetlands remain unclear therefore a more thorough understanding of the response mechanism of soil respiration to groundwater table and salinity fluctuations in coastal wetlands is needed the groundwater table and salinity of the yellow river delta fluctuate drastically in different coastal wetlands such as tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes especially due to intense anthropogenic activities and climate change liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 exploring the spatial temporal patterns and intrinsic mechanisms of soil respiration under the interaction of changes in the groundwater table and salinity can provide theoretical support for assessing the blue carbon sink capacity and estimating the blue carbon pool of coastal wetlands in the context of future global climate change the primary objectives of this study were 1 to explore the effects of changes in the groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes 2 to reveal the response pattern of soil respiration to interactions of the groundwater table and salinity in different coastal wetlands and 3 to identify the main environmental drivers affecting soil respiration to provide clearer options for improving soil carbon sink in coastal wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the yellow river delta 37 40 38 10 n 118 40 119 20 e in dongying

could be formed in this study 8 chambers were connected to the multiplexed system for cyclic soil respiration measurements in different soil columns before the measurement the multiplexed system will automatically clean for 30 s to remove the residual gas in the pipeline and then the chamber will be closed for 3 min to measure the soil respiration afterwards the chamber will open and the multiplexed system will begin a 40 s post measurement cleaning to prepare for the next measurement this cycle continues so that the soil respiration of all soil columns can be monitored and recorded

diurnal changes in soil respiration in the three wetlands under the different groundwater table treatments showed a unimodal curve fig 2 in tidal freshwater wetlands the diurnal variation ranges of soil respiration under the three groundwater table treatments a 30 cm b 20 cm and c 10 cm were 0 49 1 43 Œºmol m2 s 0 64 1 20 Œºmol m2 s and 0 3 1 07 Œºmol m2 s respectively fig 2a the maximum soil respiration occurred at 12 00 noon 1 00 p m and 2 00 p m in the three groundwater table treatments soil respiration in brackish wetlands in deep groundwater table treatments a 30 cm was 0 51 0 90 Œºmol m2 s with the maximum and minimum values appearing at 2 p m and 11p m respectively comparatively soil respiration in the medium b 20 cm and shallow c 30 cm groundwater treatments was in the range of 0 42 0 65 Œºmol m2 s and 0 23 0 55 Œºmolm 2s 1 respectively and the maximum and minimum values were at 3 00 p m and 12 00 midnight respectively fig 2b the fluctuation range of soil respiration in salt marshes under deep groundwater table treatment a 30 cm was 0 62 1 48 Œºmol m2 s and the maximum and minimum values occurred at 2 00 p m and 10 00 p m respectively fig 2c in the medium groundwater table treatment b 20 cm the maximum soil respiration was 0 86 Œºmol m2 s at 12 00 noon and the minimum was 0 43 Œºmol m2 s at 11 00 p m soil respiration in the shallow groundwater table treatments c 10 cm varied from 0 24 Œºmol m2 s at 11 00 p m to 0 65 Œºmol m2 s at 12 00 noon respectively interestingly we found that under the deep groundwater table treatment the diurnal peak value of soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands appeared earlier than that under the other groundwater table treatments however the opposite pattern was observed for salt marshes the highest diurnal rate of soil respiration generally occurred during the period from 12 00 noon to 3 00 p m and the lowest rate appeared during the period from 11 00 p m to 1 00 a m the next day the diurnal variation in soil respiration was greatly affected by soil temperature in general soil respiration gradually increased with increasing soil temperatures brackish wetlands and salt marshes showed the highest soil respiration under deep groundwater table treatments sra followed by medium groundwater table treatments srb while the lowest soil respiration was observed under shallow groundwater table treatments src in tidal freshwater wetlands soil respiration under the deep groundwater table treatments were significantly higher than that under the shallow groundwater table treatments p 0 05 and higher soil respiration under the medium groundwater table treatments was also observed compared with the shallow groundwater table treatments except for soil respiration at 2 00 p m although soil respiration under the medium groundwater table treatments was higher than that under the deep groundwater table treatments at 12 00 midnight to 5 00 a m p 0 05 the overall pattern of soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands was consistent with that in brackish wetlands and salt marshes in all groundwater table treatments the dynamic changes in soil respiration and cumulative co2 emissions in the three types of wetlands under different groundwater table treatments during 72 days of incubation are shown in fig 3 soil respiration in the three types of wetlands showed fluctuations at the early stage of the experiment under different groundwater table treatments fig 3a c after which it remained stable it is noted that soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands showed the greatest fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment soil respiration in the three wetlands showed the highest values under the deep groundwater table treatments followed by the medium groundwater table treatments while the lowest values were observed in the shallow groundwater table treatments similarly the highest and lowest cumulative co2 emissions in each of the three wetlands were observed under the deep and shallow groundwater table treatments respectively fig 3d f although the cumulative co2 emission curves of tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands overlapped at the initial stage of the experiment the cumulative co2 emissions under the three groundwater table treatments showed significant differences after a period of incubation p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in soil respiration between tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands under the medium and deep groundwater table treatments p 0 05 while the differences in soil respiration in salt marshes under the three groundwater table treatments were significant p 0 05 3 2 variations in soil respiration under different salinity treatments as shown in fig 4 the diurnal variation in soil respiration in the three wetlands under different salinity treatments was unimodal with peak values occurring at various time in different salinity treatments the diurnal soil respiration ranged from 0 81 to 1 93 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands from 0 58 to 0 92 Œºmol m2 s in brackish wetlands and from 0 65 to 1 41 Œºmol m2 s in salt marshes under low salinity treatments 0 ppt in the medium salinity treatment 12 ppt the diurnal soil respiration varied from 0 32 to 0 89 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands from 0 40 to 0 73 Œºmol m2 s in brackish wetlands and from 0 36 to 1 04 Œºmol m2 s in salt marshes comparatively the diurnal soil respiration fell within the range of 0 31 0 8 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands 0 20 0 43 Œºmol m2 s in brackish wetlands and 0 18 0 52 Œºmol m2 s in salt marshes in high salinity treatments 26 ppt the highest soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands occurred at 1 00 p m 11 00 a m and 12 00 noon and the lowest value at 12 00 midnight 1 00 a m and 2 00 a m in the low medium and high salinity treatments respectively in brackish wetlands the highest and lowest soil respiration rates were observed at 12 00 noon and 12 00 midnight in the low salinity treatments and at 2 00 p m and 11 00 p m in the medium and high salinity treatments respectively in contrast in salt marshes the highest soil respiration appeared at 1 00 p m in the low salinity treatments and at 12 00 noon in the medium and high salinity treatments while the lowest soil respiration was observed at 12 00 midnight in the low and medium salinity treatments and at 11 00 p m in the high salinity treatments overall the peak of soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands and salt marshes under the low salinity treatments occurred later than that under the medium and high salinity treatments while the opposite pattern was observed in brackish wetlands generally soil respiration in the three types of wetlands showed the highest value in the low salinity treatments followed by the medium salinity treatments while the lowest value was observed in the high salinity treatments in tidal freshwater wetlands soil respiration under the low salinity treatments was significantly higher than that under the medium and high salinity treatments p 0 05 but no significant difference was observed between the medium salinity treatments and the high salinity treatments p 0 05 soil respiration in brackish wetlands under the low and medium salinity treatments was significantly higher than that under the high salinity treatments p 0 05 additionally significant differences were observed in soil respiration in salt marshes among the three salinity treatments p 0 05 we measured the soil respiration and calculated cumulative co2 emissions in the three wetlands under different salinity treatments during the experimental period fig 5 similar to soil respiration under different groundwater table treatments soil respiration under different salinity treatments fluctuated during the first 10 days of incubation and then remained stable fig 5a 5c generally the highest soil respiration in each of the three wetlands was observed under the low salinity treatments sra followed by the medium salinity treatments srb while the lowest soil respiration occurred under the high salinity treatments src the cumulative co2 emissions in brackish wetlands and salt marshes were higher under low salinity treatments than under high salinity treatments p 0 05 the cumulative co2 emissions in tidal freshwater wetlands under the high salinity treatments were higher than those under the medium salinity treatments fig 5d due to the great fluctuation of soil respiration under the high salinity treatments at the early stage of the experiment fig 5a soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands under the low salinity treatments was significantly greater than that under the medium and high salinity treatments p 0 05 and no significant difference in soil respiration was observed between the medium and high salinity treatments p 0 05 soil respiration in brackish wetlands under the low salinity treatments was significantly greater than that under the high salinity treatments p 0 05 soil respiration under the medium salinity treatments was lower than that under the high salinity treatments at the early stage of the experiment 0 13 days but higher than that under the high salinity treatments at the later stage 16 72 days in salt marshes soil respiration was significantly different among the three salinity treatments p 0 05 3 3 response of soil respiration to interactions between the groundwater table and salinity fig 5 shows the changing patterns of soil respiration in the three types of wetlands affected by the interactions between the groundwater table and salinity overall soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands under the same salinity treatment decreased with rising groundwater tables fig 6 a soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands under the medium 20 cm and deep groundwater table 30 cm treatments decreased with increasing salinities while soil respiration under the shallow groundwater table 10 cm treatments showed a decreasing trend first and then increased with increasing salinity and the lowest value appeared when the salinity was 12 ppt the highest soil respiration 2 10 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands was observed in the deep groundwater table 30 cm and low salinity 0 ppt treatments and the lowest value 0 56 Œºmol m2 s appeared in the deep groundwater table 10 cm and medium salinity 12 ppt treatments under the same salinity treatment soil respiration in brackish wetlands in the deep groundwater table treatments was higher than that in the medium and shallow groundwater table treatments fig 6b soil respiration fluctuated with the change in salinity under the same groundwater table treatment with its maximum value 0 9 Œºmol m2 s appearing in the deep groundwater table 30 cm and low salinity 0 ppt treatments and the minimum value 0 17 Œºmol m2 s occurring in the shallow groundwater table 10 cm and high salinity 26 ppt treatments the changing pattern of soil respiration with groundwater table fluctuations in salt marshes under the same salinity treatment was the same as that in brackish wetlands fig 6c with higher soil respiration in deep groundwater table 30 cm treatments than that in medium 20 cm and shallow groundwater table 10 cm treatments under medium and deep groundwater table treatments soil respiration in salt marshes decreased with increasing salinities with the highest soil respiration 2 02 Œºmol m2 s in deep groundwater table 30 cm and low salinity 0 ppt treatments and the lowest value 0 19 Œºmol m2 s in medium groundwater table 20 cm and high salinity 26 ppt treatments 3 4 relationships between soil respiration and physicochemical properties the results of the correlation analysis between soil respiration and physicochemical properties are shown in fig 7 soil respiration in the three wetlands was significantly and negatively correlated with the groundwater table p 0 05 and salinity p 0 05 in addition soil respiration also had a highly significant positive correlation with soc and tn p 0 01 and a significant positive correlation with mbc p 0 05 the two way anova results for the effects of the groundwater table salinity and their interaction on soil respiration in the three types of coastal wetlands are summarized in table 1 the results showed that both the groundwater table and salinity had a significant effect on soil respiration in the three wetlands p 0 01 and the interactive effects between the groundwater table and salinity were also significant in brackish wetlands p 0 05 and salt marshes p 0 01 while there was no significant effect on soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 interactive effects of groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration wetland hydrology is an important factor influencing soil carbon cycling grenfell et al 2016 moomaw et al 2018 in the current study soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes generally decreased with rising groundwater tables figs 1 2 and 7 indicating that groundwater table rise would weaken soil respiration correlation analysis and two way anova analysis also showed the significant negative effects of the groundwater table on soil respiration fig 7 and table 1 a groundwater table rise would increase soil moisture which could limit the decomposition of soil organic matter due to the decline in soil microbial activity chen et al 2021 leading to a decrease in soil co2 emissions from heterotrophic respiration chen et al 2021 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2020a meanwhile the lower soil porosity induced by a rise of the groundwater table would hinder the diffusion of gases i e o2 and co2 in the soil causing a decrease in soil oxygen elberling et al 2011 in the context of global climate change sea level rise seawater intrusion and extreme rainfall events can lead to intense changes in soil salinity and groundwater table in coastal wetlands eswar et al 2021 herbert et al 2015 previous studies have presented that the groundwater table was positively correlated with salinity in coastal wetlands cui et al 2021 yu et al 2020a because the rise of the groundwater table can greatly affect the upward transport of salt in the soil causing soil salt accumulation in the soil surface through capillary action soil salinity fluctuations would affect the rates of soil organic matter accumulation and organic carbon mineralization and thus alter the pathways of organic carbon mineralization weston et al 2011 in the current study we found that soil respiration in the three wetlands decreased with increasing salinities figs 2 4 and 7 with a significantly negative effect of salinity on soil respiration fig 7 and table 1 indicating that increasing or excessive salinity had an inhibitory effect on soil respiration by changing soil microbial activity rath and rousk 2015 zhang et al 2021 which agrees with several previous reports servais et al 2019 wilson et al 2015 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020b also found that soil salinization in the yellow river delta reduced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities changing the composition of bacterial communities with the most dominant phylum of proteobacteria however we observed higher cumulative co2 emissions in tidal freshwater wetlands under the high salinity treatments than that under the medium salinity treatments fig 5d the possible reason for this phenomenon may be that the high salinity stimulated microbial activity yang et al 2018 resulting in a sudden increase in soil respiration at the beginning of the experiment fig 5a a previous study presented that higher salinity increased the activity of soil extracellular enzymes and the rate of microbial decomposition and also reduced the accumulation of soil organic carbon in tidal wetlands morrissey et al 2014 although previous studies have shown that soil respiration in salt marshes was lower than that in freshwater wetlands chambers et al 2013 hu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 it has also been noted that soil respiration in brackish wetlands showed some fluctuations and sometimes exhibited higher respiration than freshwater wetlands due to the different adaptive salinity thresholds of microorganisms prevalent in the soils of different wetlands hu et al 2017 within a suitable salinity range an increase in salinity could stimulate microbial decomposition of organic matter and thus microbial respiration however when a stress threshold is exceeded a continued increase in salinity could lead to a decrease in microbial activity with soil respiration gradually decreasing setia et al 2011a in addition changes in salt ion types caused by seawater intrusion could also have an impact on soil respiration herbert et al 2015 li et al 2019 wen et al 2019 because increased cl concentrations may inhibit microbial activity dang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 it has also been shown that under anaerobic conditions a large input of sulfate can make the reducing process of so4 2 become the main process of anaerobic mineralization of organic carbon which would lead to increased co2 emissions from coastal wetlands chambers et al 2011 comparatively the groundwater table will be raised in summer whereas the soil salinity will be declined in the yellow river delta due to the large amount of freshwater input affected by the flow sediment regulation from the xiaolangdi reservoir chen et al 2022b zhao et al 2018 therefore freshwater restoration will alleviate the salt stresses on microbial communities and their activities effectively increase the microbial community diversity and co occurrence relationships and significantly improve the microbial prediction functions related to carbon cycling huang et al 2021 overall the elevated groundwater table in coastal wetlands would change soil microbial biomass carbon mbc dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial community structure yu et al 2020a and reduce the diversity of microbial community as well as the most microbial functional genes related to carbon degradation zhang et al 2021 leading to a decrease in microbial respiration bridgham et al 2013 negandhi et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the complex influencing mechanisms of groundwater table and salinity are illustrated in fig 8 generally soil respiration in the three wetlands decreased with an elevated groundwater table and increasing salinity additionally we observed that the diurnal variation in soil respiration figs 1 and 3 was unimodal and greatly affected by soil temperature the peak time of diurnal variations of soil respiration in the three types of wetlands and soil were affected by the interaction of the groundwater table and salinity table 1 previous studies have shown that the elevated groundwater table and increased salinity can increase the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration cui et al 2021 yu et al 2020b therefore the effects of groundwater table and salinity on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration need to be investigated by strictly temperature controlled indoor incubation experiments in the future in this study we did not consider the effects of specific microorganisms plant root debris and benthic fauna affected by changes in the groundwater table and salinity which also require further investigation to decrease the uncertainty of the observed results 4 2 effects of soil physicochemical properties on soil respiration ph can affect all biochemical processes in the soil and influence soil respiration mainly by affecting the synthesis and decomposition of organic matter and microbial activities in the soil kang et al 2021 rousk et al 2009 it has been confirmed that soil acidification and lower soil ph reduces the decomposition of soil organic matter and the transformation of soil nutrients by microorganisms lee and jose 2003 soil ph and other physicochemical properties can change the composition of the microbial community and alter the ratio of fungi bacteria and other microorganisms thereby affecting soil respiration meng et al 2019 tan et al 2020 in the current study soil columns from freshwater wetlands had higher ph values than those from brackish wetlands and salt marshes increasing soil ph within the ph range suitable for microbial life may stimulate the growth and reproduction of soil microorganisms cui et al 2021 karimi et al 2018 leading to increased soil co2 emissions soil organic carbon soc is the main substrate of soil respiration and its content is a primary factor in determining the soil respiration rate cui et al 2021 the correlation analysis results showed that soil respiration in coastal wetlands was significantly and positively correlated with soc content fig 7 which also proved the importance of soc for soil respiration coastal wetlands have always been affected by tidal action which can result in the increase in suspensions chen et al 2022a wang et al 2021 similarly tidal currents may also remove leaf litters during ebb tide and new sediment deposits resulting in the reduction of soil organic carbon and soil active carbon in the surface soil of salt marshes seyfferth et al 2020 microbial biomass carbon mbc is the component of soil organic carbon that is most easily mineralized and transformed by microorganisms so it is commonly used to characterize the activity of soil microorganisms yu et al 2020a as with prior studies a significant positive correlation was also observed between soil respiration and mbc in coastal wetlands fig 7 which can be supported by the results of li et al 2022 and zhong et al 2016 5 conclusions in this work we explored the characteristics and response mechanisms of soil respiration in different coastal wetlands by simulating fluctuations in the groundwater table and salinity the diurnal variation in soil respiration in the three coastal wetlands all showed a significantly unimodal curve and the time of peak respiration was greatly influenced by the groundwater table and salinity conditions both the groundwater table and salinity had significant effects on soil respiration in the three wetlands and soil respiration generally decreased with elevated groundwater table and increasing salinity the interactions between the groundwater table and salinity had a significant effect on soil respiration in brackish wetlands and salt marshes these findings suggest that seawater intrusion due to sea level rise may reduce soil carbon emissions from freshwater wetlands while the implementation of freshwater restoration projects may lead to the weakening or even loss of the carbon sink function of salt marshes comparatively the carbon emissions function of brackish wetlands is relatively stable therefore local governments should focus on enhancing the blue carbon sink function of coastal wetlands through hydrological regulation e g groundwater table salinity however in this study we could not consider the effects of litter tidal exogenous inputs and microbial community structure on soil respiration in coastal wetlands future work should consider the underlying mechanisms by which water table and salinity fluctuations and exogenous inputs e g carbon nitrogen and sediment etc caused by tidal action alter coastal soil respiration further study is needed to reveal the response mechanisms of functional microorganisms related to the soil carbon cycle which will help to better understand the effects of the groundwater table and salinity fluctuations on soil respiration at the genetic level this could provide data support and a theoretical basis for the accurate estimation of carbon emissions in coastal wetlands and assist the realization of carbon neutrality credit authorship contribution statement guozhu chen writing original draft data curation formal analysis investigation visualization

3123,hydrological and salinity fluctuations in coastal wetlands induced by climatic change e g drought and anthropogenic activities can significantly affect the blue carbon sink via soil respiration co2 emissions however little information is available on the interactive effects of the groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration in coastal wetlands here in situ soil columns were collected from tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes to conduct a simulated assessment of the effects of fluctuations in the groundwater table 30 cm 20 cm and 10 cm and salinity 0 ppt 12ppt and 26 ppt on soil respiration in the field the results showed that soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands 0 56 2 1 Œºmol m2 s and salt marshes 0 19 2 02 Œºmol m2 s was higher than that in brackish wetlands 0 17 0 9 Œºmol m2 s in all groundwater table and salinity treatments the diurnal variation in soil respiration in the three simulated wetlands showed a unimodal curve while the peak time was influenced by the groundwater table and salinity with the maximum occurring at 11 a m 2 p m soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands was significantly higher in the deep 30 cm and medium 20 cm groundwater table treatments than in the shallow 10 cm groundwater table treatment p 0 05 and significantly higher in the low 0 ppt and medium 12ppt salinity treatments than in the high 26 ppt salinity treatment p 0 05 however soil respiration in salt marshes decreased significantly as the groundwater table and salinity increased p 0 05 the groundwater table and salinity exhibited significant interactive effects on soil respiration in brackish wetlands p 0 05 and salt marshes p 0 01 additionally significantly negative correlations were observed between soil respiration and groundwater table and salinity in three wetlands p 0 05 soil respiration in the three wetlands was significantly and positively correlated with microbial biomass carbon p 0 05 and significantly and positively correlated with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen p 0 01 the findings of this work can help reduce the uncertainty of model to accurately estimate carbon cycling of coastal wetlands at local regional and global scales and improve the blue carbon sink of coastal wetlands by regulating the groundwater table and salinity levels in wetland restoration projects keywords groundwater table seawater intrusion salinity interactive effects co2 emissions coastal wetlands 1 introduction coastal wetlands have remarkable blue carbon sink functions and have been given the subject of increasing concerns davidson et al 2018 liu et al 2021 spivak et al 2019 although the total area of coastal wetlands is 1 of the ocean they can store blue carbon from marine and atmospheric sources macreadie et al 2019 at a high carbon burial rate of 218 24 g c m 2 yr 1 which is 40 times higher than that of tropical rainforests mcleod et al 2011 rosentreter et al 2018 it is estimated that the upper layer approximately 1 m of salt marshes stores approximately 917 t co2 e ha 1 sapkota and white 2021 which can effectively mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions and climatic change by capturing atmospheric co2 in the soil and sequestering it for thousands of years soil respiration is the primary pathway by which carbon fixed in the soil is returned to the atmosphere the dynamics of soil respiration can highly impact blue carbon sequestration and the carbon balance in coastal wetlands as a hotspot of research on the carbon cycle in coastal wetlands soil respiration has been challenged by multiple environmental factors in recent decades increasingly frequent hydrometeorological disasters e g droughts floods and storm surges have seriously threatened the stability and security of coastal wetland ecosystems under the combined influence of high intensity anthropogenic activities and global climate change seawater intrusion sea level rise and extreme weather events have resulted in groundwater table and salinity fluctuations which will influence the blue carbon sink function of coastal wetlands crooks et al 2018 huang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 ren et al 2021 as one of the important processes in the global carbon cycle soil respiration can be influenced by several environmental factors e g temperature moisture and salinity temperature can affect soil respiration by influencing the activity of microorganisms and associated enzymes allison et al 2010 chen et al 2021 the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration q 10 has attracted widespread attention because it is considered as a key parameter for predicting future climate change scenarios and modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle bond lamberty et al 2018 xie et al 2014 moreover the dramatic water level and salt fluctuations in coastal wetlands can significantly affect the soil co2 emissions yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that soil moisture content can affect soil respiration by controlling the distribution of oxygen redox conditions and aerobic anaerobic boundaries in the soil elberling et al 2011 macreadie et al 2017 setia et al 2011b soil with higher water content has a stronger reducing power which inhibits the decomposition of organic matter stagg et al 2017 xia et al 2021 liu et al 2017 found that dry wet alternation affected soil respiration by influencing soil moisture fluctuations in surface water level and moisture can also cause the change in salinity in coastal wetlands which will alter microbial diversity and community structure thus affecting soil respiration yang et al 2018 reported that within the appropriate salinity threshold for microorganisms increased salinity would stimulate microbial decomposition and thus promote soil respiration however beyond the threshold excessive salinity would decrease microbial activity and inhibit soil respiration recently cui et al 2021 found that groundwater table and salinity in coastal wetlands have interactive effects on soil respiration but the mechanisms of their interactive effects on soil respiration in coastal wetlands remain unclear therefore a more thorough understanding of the response mechanism of soil respiration to groundwater table and salinity fluctuations in coastal wetlands is needed the groundwater table and salinity of the yellow river delta fluctuate drastically in different coastal wetlands such as tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes especially due to intense anthropogenic activities and climate change liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 exploring the spatial temporal patterns and intrinsic mechanisms of soil respiration under the interaction of changes in the groundwater table and salinity can provide theoretical support for assessing the blue carbon sink capacity and estimating the blue carbon pool of coastal wetlands in the context of future global climate change the primary objectives of this study were 1 to explore the effects of changes in the groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes 2 to reveal the response pattern of soil respiration to interactions of the groundwater table and salinity in different coastal wetlands and 3 to identify the main environmental drivers affecting soil respiration to provide clearer options for improving soil carbon sink in coastal wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the yellow river delta 37 40 38 10 n 118 40 119 20 e in dongying city shangdong province china fig 1 a the yellow river delta is a globally famous estuarine delta it has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons abundant light hot and rainy summers and cold and dry winters with obvious alternating dry and wet seasons the annual temperature shows a unimodal distribution with an average temperature of 12 9 c the highest temperature occurs in july with an average temperature of 26 7 c han et al 2015 the average annual rainfall is 530 630 mm with large seasonal variations li et al 2020 and approximately 70 of the annual precipitation occurs in summer due to its low elevation and proximity to the sea the yellow river delta is susceptible to tidal action sea level rise seawater intrusion and even drought bai et al 2020 jia et al 2018 the yellow river delta has a rich diversity of wetland and landscape types due to strong interactions between freshwater and saltwater and year round fluctuations in the groundwater table and salinity the main vegetation species are phragmites australis suaeda salsa and tamarix chinensis 2 2 experimental design three plots 5 m 5 m covered by phragmites australis with relatively consistent vegetation coverage density and height were selected in tidal freshwater wetland fw brackish wetland br and salt marsh sm in may as in situ soil column sampling sites fig 1b in situ soil columns were collected to a depth of 50 cm using pvc pipes with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 60 cm fig 1d three layers of 0 149 mm plastic mesh screen were placed on the bottom of each soil column and bundled around the pvc pipe eighteen soil columns were collected from each of the three sampling sites the collected soil columns were transported to the yellow river delta observation station for the control experiment small holes of 10 mm diameter were drilled in pvc pipes at depths of 30 cm 20 cm and 10 cm below the surface of the in situ soil columns to simulate and control different groundwater table gradients we used capital letters a b and c to represent the 30 cm 20 cm and 10 cm groundwater table respectively three different salinity gradients of 0 12 and 26 ppt were set in each groundwater table treatment and are denoted by lowercase letters a b and c respectively fig 1c the salt water in the incubation experiment was prepared with sodium chloride nacl after all the soil columns were collected and set up with different groundwater table and salinity gradients the soil columns were incubated statically for 10 days after that the incubation experiment was

method in which the measurement chamber of the li 8150 automated soil co2 flux multiplexed system 16 chambers ports li cor inc usa was fastened to a pvc pipe so that a closed measurement environment could be formed in this study 8 chambers were connected to the multiplexed system for cyclic soil respiration measurements in different soil columns before the measurement the multiplexed system will automatically clean for 30 s to remove the residual gas in the pipeline and then the chamber will be closed for 3 min to measure the soil respiration afterwards the chamber will open and the multiplexed system will begin a 40 s post measurement cleaning to prepare for the next measurement this cycle continues so that the soil respiration of all soil columns can be monitored and recorded for multiple times 2 3 soil collection and analysis while collecting the in situ soil columns two soil profiles were collected in each sample area the first layer was 0 5 cm of surface soil and the second layer was 5 10 cm of subsurface soil three replicate soil samples were randomly collected from each sampling site and the samples were numbered and placed in plastic zipped bags quickly placed in 4 c biological sample storage boxes and promptly brought back to the laboratory for storage and sorting at 2 4 c similarly soil samples under different groundwater table and salinity treatments

nitrogen mbn and dissolved organic carbon doc and the remaining soil was naturally air dried and impurities such as plant roots and stones were removed ground and passed through a 0 85 mm sieve to determine ph and electrical conductivity ec then the sieved soils were passed through a 0 15 mm sieve and used to measure soil organic carbon soc total nitrogen tn and other soil physicochemical properties the extract solution with a 5 1 soil water ratio was used to measure soil ph and ec by a ph meter sartorius pb 10 germany and a conductivity meter mettler toledo usa respectively soc was

chloroform fumigation k2so4 extraction method vance et al 1987 the supernatant after extraction was filtered through a 0 45 ¬µm membrane and doc in this supernatant was measured on a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan 2 4 data processing and statistical analysis the soil respiration rates of all salinity treatments under the same groundwater table treatment were averaged to explore the effect of groundwater table on soil respiration similarly the average soil respiration rates of all groundwater table treatments under the same salinity treatment were selected to compare the effect of salinity on soil respiration the hourly average values of soil respiration were used to show the diurnal dynamics of soil respiration and the daily average of soil respiration was used to represent the periodic changes of soil respiration the cumulative co2 emissions during the incubation period were obtained by multiplying the daily average of soil respiration by time and then gradually summing up one way anova was used to analyze the significance of differences in soil respiration under different groundwater table or salinity treatments in the same wetland two way anova with tukey s hsd post hoc tests was used to evaluate the effects of different groundwater table treatments salinity treatments and interactions between the groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration bivariate

software packages the 3d colormap surface with projection after smoothing by interpolation was created using originpro2021 software package to show the interactive effects of groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration other figures were also created using originpro2021 software package 3 results 3 1 dynamics of soil respiration under different groundwater table treatments the dynamic diurnal changes in soil respiration in the three wetlands under the different groundwater table treatments showed a unimodal curve fig 2 in tidal freshwater wetlands the diurnal variation ranges of soil respiration under the three groundwater table treatments a 30 cm b 20 cm and c 10 cm were 0 49 1 43 Œºmol m2 s 0 64 1 20 Œºmol m2 s and 0 3 1 07 Œºmol m2 s respectively fig 2a the maximum soil respiration occurred at 12 00 noon 1 00 p m and 2 00 p m in the three groundwater table treatments soil respiration in brackish wetlands in deep groundwater table treatments a 30 cm was 0 51 0 90 Œºmol m2 s with the maximum and minimum values appearing at 2 p m and 11p m respectively comparatively soil respiration in the medium b 20 cm and shallow c 30 cm groundwater treatments was in the range of 0 42 0 65 Œºmol m2 s and 0 23 0 55 Œºmolm 2s 1 respectively and the maximum and minimum values were at 3 00 p m and 12 00 midnight respectively fig 2b the fluctuation range of soil respiration in salt marshes under deep groundwater table treatment a 30 cm was 0 62 1 48 Œºmol m2 s and the maximum and minimum values occurred at 2 00 p m and 10 00 p m respectively fig 2c in the medium groundwater table treatment b 20 cm the maximum soil respiration was 0 86 Œºmol m2 s at 12 00 noon and the minimum was 0 43 Œºmol m2 s at 11 00 p m soil respiration in the shallow groundwater table treatments c 10 cm varied from 0 24 Œºmol m2 s at 11 00 p m to 0 65 Œºmol m2 s at 12 00 noon respectively interestingly we found that under the deep groundwater table treatment the diurnal peak value of soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands appeared earlier than that under the other groundwater table treatments however the opposite pattern was observed for salt marshes the highest diurnal rate of soil respiration generally occurred during the period from 12 00 noon to 3 00 p m and the lowest rate appeared during the period from 11 00 p m to 1 00 a m the next day the diurnal variation in soil respiration was greatly affected by soil temperature in general soil respiration gradually increased with increasing soil temperatures brackish wetlands and salt marshes showed the highest soil respiration under deep groundwater table treatments sra followed by medium groundwater table treatments srb while the lowest soil respiration was observed under shallow groundwater table treatments src in tidal freshwater wetlands soil respiration under the deep groundwater table treatments were significantly higher than that under the shallow groundwater table treatments p 0 05 and higher soil respiration under the medium groundwater table treatments was also observed compared with the shallow groundwater table treatments except for soil respiration at 2 00 p m although soil respiration under the medium groundwater table treatments was higher than that under the deep groundwater table treatments at 12 00 midnight to 5 00 a m p 0 05 the overall pattern of soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands was consistent with that in brackish wetlands and salt marshes in all groundwater table treatments the dynamic changes in soil respiration and cumulative co2 emissions in the three types of wetlands under different groundwater table treatments during 72 days of incubation are shown in fig 3 soil respiration in the three types of wetlands showed fluctuations at the early stage of the experiment under different groundwater table treatments fig 3a c after which it remained stable it is noted that soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands showed the greatest fluctuations at the beginning of the experiment soil respiration in the three wetlands showed the highest values under the deep groundwater table treatments followed by the medium groundwater table treatments while the lowest values were observed in the shallow groundwater table treatments similarly the highest and lowest cumulative co2 emissions in each of the three wetlands were observed under the deep and shallow groundwater table treatments respectively fig 3d f although the cumulative co2 emission curves of tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands overlapped at the initial stage of the experiment the cumulative co2 emissions under the three groundwater table treatments showed significant differences after a period of incubation p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in soil respiration between tidal freshwater wetlands and brackish wetlands under the medium and deep groundwater table treatments p 0 05 while the differences in soil respiration in salt marshes under the three groundwater table treatments were significant p 0 05 3 2 variations in soil respiration under different salinity treatments as shown in fig 4 the diurnal variation in soil respiration in the three wetlands under different salinity treatments was unimodal with peak values occurring at various time in different salinity treatments the diurnal soil respiration ranged from 0 81 to 1 93 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands from 0 58 to 0 92 Œºmol m2 s in brackish wetlands and from 0 65 to 1 41 Œºmol m2 s in salt marshes under low salinity treatments 0 ppt in the medium salinity treatment 12 ppt the diurnal soil respiration varied from 0 32 to 0 89 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands from 0 40 to 0 73 Œºmol m2 s in brackish wetlands and from 0 36 to 1 04 Œºmol m2 s in salt marshes comparatively the diurnal soil respiration fell within the range of 0 31 0 8 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands 0 20 0 43 Œºmol m2 s in brackish wetlands and 0 18 0 52 Œºmol m2 s in salt marshes in high salinity treatments 26 ppt the highest soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands occurred at 1 00 p m 11 00 a m and 12 00 noon and the lowest value at 12 00 midnight 1 00 a m and 2 00 a m in the low medium and high salinity treatments respectively in brackish wetlands the highest and lowest soil respiration rates were observed at 12 00 noon and 12 00 midnight in the low salinity treatments and at 2 00 p m and 11 00 p m in the medium and high salinity treatments respectively in contrast in salt marshes the highest soil respiration appeared at 1 00 p m in the low salinity treatments and at 12 00 noon in the medium and high salinity treatments while the lowest soil respiration was observed at 12 00 midnight in the low and medium salinity treatments and at 11 00 p m in the high salinity treatments overall the peak of soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands and salt marshes under the low salinity treatments occurred later than that under the medium and high salinity treatments while the opposite pattern was observed in brackish wetlands generally soil respiration in the three types of wetlands showed the highest value in the low salinity treatments followed by the medium salinity treatments while the lowest value was observed in the high salinity treatments in tidal freshwater wetlands soil respiration under the low salinity treatments was significantly higher than that under the medium and high salinity treatments p 0 05 but no significant difference was observed between the medium salinity treatments and the high salinity treatments p 0 05 soil respiration in brackish wetlands under the low and medium salinity treatments was significantly higher than that under the high salinity treatments p 0 05 additionally significant differences were observed in soil respiration in salt marshes among the three salinity treatments p 0 05 we measured the soil respiration and calculated cumulative co2 emissions in the three wetlands under different salinity treatments during the experimental period fig 5 similar to soil respiration under different groundwater table treatments soil respiration under different salinity treatments fluctuated during the first 10 days of incubation and then remained stable fig 5a 5c generally the highest soil respiration in each of the three wetlands was observed under the low salinity treatments sra followed by the medium salinity treatments srb while the lowest soil respiration occurred under the high salinity treatments src the cumulative co2 emissions in brackish wetlands and salt marshes were higher under low salinity treatments than under high salinity treatments p 0 05 the cumulative co2 emissions in tidal freshwater wetlands under the high salinity treatments were higher than those under the medium salinity treatments fig 5d due to the great fluctuation of soil respiration under the high salinity treatments at the early stage of the experiment fig 5a soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands under the low salinity treatments was significantly greater than that under the medium and high salinity treatments p 0 05 and no significant difference in soil respiration was observed between the medium and high salinity treatments p 0 05 soil respiration in brackish wetlands under the low salinity treatments was significantly greater than that under the high salinity treatments p 0 05 soil respiration under the medium salinity treatments was lower than that under the high salinity treatments at the early stage of the experiment 0 13 days but higher than that under the high salinity treatments at the later stage 16 72 days in salt marshes soil respiration was significantly different among the three salinity treatments p 0 05 3 3 response of soil respiration to interactions between the groundwater table and salinity fig 5 shows the changing patterns of soil respiration in the three types of wetlands affected by the interactions between the groundwater table and salinity overall soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands under the same salinity treatment decreased with rising groundwater tables fig 6 a soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands under the medium 20 cm and deep groundwater table 30 cm treatments decreased with increasing salinities while soil respiration under the shallow groundwater table 10 cm treatments showed a decreasing trend first and then increased with increasing salinity and the lowest value appeared when the salinity was 12 ppt the highest soil respiration 2 10 Œºmol m2 s in tidal freshwater wetlands was observed in the deep groundwater table 30 cm and low salinity 0 ppt treatments and the lowest value 0 56 Œºmol m2 s appeared in the deep groundwater table 10 cm and medium salinity 12 ppt treatments under the same salinity treatment soil respiration in brackish wetlands in the deep groundwater table treatments was higher than that in the medium and shallow groundwater table treatments fig 6b soil respiration fluctuated with the change in salinity under the same groundwater table treatment with its maximum value 0 9 Œºmol m2 s appearing in the deep groundwater table 30 cm and low salinity 0 ppt treatments and the minimum value 0 17 Œºmol m2 s occurring in the shallow groundwater table 10 cm and high salinity 26 ppt treatments the changing pattern of soil respiration with groundwater table fluctuations in salt marshes under the same salinity treatment was the same as that in brackish wetlands fig 6c with higher soil respiration in deep groundwater table 30 cm treatments than that in medium 20 cm and shallow groundwater table 10 cm treatments under medium and deep groundwater table treatments soil respiration in salt marshes decreased with increasing salinities with the highest soil respiration 2 02 Œºmol m2 s in deep groundwater table 30 cm and low salinity 0 ppt treatments and the lowest value 0 19 Œºmol m2 s in medium groundwater table 20 cm and high salinity 26 ppt treatments 3 4 relationships between soil respiration and physicochemical properties the results of the correlation analysis between soil respiration and physicochemical properties are shown in fig 7 soil respiration in the three wetlands was significantly and negatively correlated with the groundwater table p 0 05 and salinity p 0 05 in addition soil respiration also had a highly significant positive correlation with soc and tn p 0 01 and a significant positive correlation with mbc p 0 05 the two way anova results for the effects of the groundwater table salinity and their interaction on soil respiration in the three types of coastal wetlands are summarized in table 1 the results showed that both the groundwater table and salinity had a significant effect on soil respiration in the three wetlands p 0 01 and the interactive effects between the groundwater table and salinity were also significant in brackish wetlands p 0 05 and salt marshes p 0 01 while there was no significant effect on soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 interactive effects of groundwater table and salinity on soil respiration wetland hydrology is an important factor influencing soil carbon cycling grenfell et al 2016 moomaw et al 2018 in the current study soil respiration in tidal freshwater wetlands brackish wetlands and salt marshes generally decreased with rising groundwater tables figs 1 2 and 7 indicating that groundwater table rise would weaken soil respiration correlation analysis and two way anova analysis also showed the significant negative effects of the groundwater table on soil respiration fig 7 and table 1 a groundwater table rise would increase soil moisture which could limit the decomposition of soil organic matter due to the decline in soil microbial activity chen et al 2021 leading to a decrease in soil co2 emissions from heterotrophic respiration chen et al 2021 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2020a meanwhile the lower soil porosity induced by a rise of the groundwater table would hinder the diffusion of gases i e o2 and co2 in the soil causing a decrease in soil oxygen elberling et al 2011 in the context of global climate change sea level rise seawater intrusion and extreme rainfall events can lead to intense changes in soil salinity and groundwater table in coastal wetlands eswar et al 2021 herbert et al 2015 previous studies have presented that the groundwater table was positively correlated with salinity in coastal wetlands cui et al 2021 yu et al 2020a because the rise of the groundwater table can greatly affect the upward transport of salt in the soil causing soil salt accumulation in the soil surface through capillary action soil salinity fluctuations would affect the rates of soil organic matter accumulation and organic carbon mineralization and thus alter the pathways of organic carbon mineralization weston et al 2011 in the current study we found that soil respiration in the three wetlands decreased with increasing salinities figs 2 4 and 7 with a significantly negative effect of salinity on soil respiration fig 7 and table 1 indicating that increasing or excessive salinity had an inhibitory effect on soil respiration by changing soil microbial activity rath and rousk 2015 zhang et al 2021 which agrees with several previous reports servais et al 2019 wilson et al 2015 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020b also found that soil salinization in the yellow river delta reduced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities changing the composition of bacterial communities with the most dominant phylum of proteobacteria however we observed higher cumulative co2 emissions in tidal freshwater wetlands under the high salinity treatments than that under the medium salinity treatments fig 5d the possible reason for this phenomenon may be that the high salinity stimulated microbial activity yang et al 2018 resulting in a sudden increase in soil respiration at the beginning of the experiment fig 5a a previous study presented that higher salinity increased the activity of soil extracellular enzymes and the rate of microbial decomposition and also reduced the accumulation of soil organic carbon in tidal wetlands morrissey et al 2014 although previous studies have shown that soil respiration in salt marshes was lower than that in freshwater wetlands chambers et al 2013 hu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 it has also been noted that soil respiration in brackish wetlands showed some fluctuations and sometimes exhibited higher respiration than freshwater wetlands due to the different adaptive salinity thresholds of microorganisms prevalent in the soils of different wetlands hu et al 2017 within a suitable salinity range an increase in salinity could stimulate microbial decomposition of organic matter and thus microbial respiration however when a stress threshold is exceeded a continued increase in salinity could lead to a decrease in microbial activity with soil respiration gradually decreasing setia et al 2011a in addition changes in salt ion types caused by seawater intrusion could also have an impact on soil respiration herbert et al 2015 li et al 2019 wen et al 2019 because increased cl concentrations may inhibit microbial activity dang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 it has also been shown that under anaerobic conditions a large input of sulfate can make the reducing process of so4 2 become the main process of anaerobic mineralization of organic carbon which would lead to increased co2 emissions from coastal wetlands chambers et al 2011 comparatively the groundwater table will be raised in summer whereas the soil salinity will be declined in the yellow river delta due to the large amount of freshwater input affected by the flow sediment regulation from the xiaolangdi reservoir chen et al 2022b zhao et al 2018 therefore freshwater restoration will alleviate the salt stresses on microbial communities and their activities effectively increase the microbial community diversity and co occurrence relationships and significantly improve the microbial prediction functions related to carbon cycling huang et al 2021 overall the elevated groundwater table in coastal wetlands would change soil microbial biomass carbon mbc dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial community structure yu et al 2020a and reduce the diversity of microbial community as well as the most microbial functional genes related to carbon degradation zhang et al 2021 leading to a decrease in microbial respiration bridgham et al 2013 negandhi et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the complex influencing mechanisms of groundwater table and salinity are illustrated in fig 8 generally soil respiration in the three wetlands decreased with an elevated groundwater table and increasing salinity additionally we observed that the diurnal variation in soil respiration figs 1 and 3 was unimodal and greatly affected by soil temperature the peak time of diurnal variations of soil respiration in the three types of wetlands and soil were affected by the interaction of the groundwater table and salinity table 1 previous studies have shown that the elevated groundwater table and increased salinity can increase the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration cui et al 2021 yu et al 2020b therefore the effects of groundwater table and salinity on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration need to be investigated by strictly temperature controlled indoor incubation experiments in the future in this study we did not consider the effects of specific microorganisms plant root debris and benthic fauna affected by changes in the groundwater table and salinity which also require further investigation to decrease the uncertainty of the observed results 4 2 effects of soil physicochemical properties on soil respiration ph can affect all biochemical processes in the soil and influence soil respiration mainly by affecting the synthesis and decomposition of organic matter and microbial activities in the soil kang et al 2021 rousk et al 2009 it has been confirmed that soil acidification and lower soil ph reduces the decomposition of soil organic matter and the transformation of soil nutrients by microorganisms lee and jose 2003 soil ph and other physicochemical properties can change the composition of the microbial community and alter the ratio of fungi bacteria and other microorganisms thereby affecting soil respiration meng et al 2019 tan et al 2020 in the current study soil columns from freshwater wetlands had higher ph values than those from brackish wetlands and salt marshes increasing soil ph within the ph range suitable for microbial life may stimulate the growth and reproduction of soil microorganisms cui et al 2021 karimi et al 2018 leading to increased soil co2 emissions soil organic carbon soc is the main substrate of soil respiration and its content is a primary factor in determining the soil respiration rate cui et al 2021 the correlation analysis results showed that soil respiration in coastal wetlands was significantly and positively correlated with soc content fig 7 which also proved the importance of soc for soil respiration coastal wetlands have always been affected by tidal action which can result in the increase in suspensions chen et al 2022a wang et al 2021 similarly tidal currents may also remove leaf litters during ebb tide and new sediment deposits resulting in the reduction of soil organic carbon and soil active carbon in the surface soil of salt marshes seyfferth et al 2020 microbial biomass carbon mbc is the component of soil organic carbon that is most easily mineralized and transformed by microorganisms so it is commonly used to characterize the activity of soil microorganisms yu et al 2020a as with prior studies a significant positive correlation was also observed between soil respiration and mbc in coastal wetlands fig 7 which can be supported by the results of li et al 2022 and zhong et al 2016 5 conclusions in this work we explored the characteristics and response mechanisms of soil respiration in different coastal wetlands by simulating fluctuations in the groundwater table and salinity the diurnal variation in soil respiration in the three coastal wetlands all showed a significantly unimodal curve and the time of peak respiration was greatly influenced by the groundwater table and salinity conditions both the groundwater table and salinity had significant effects on soil respiration in the three wetlands and soil respiration generally decreased with elevated groundwater table and increasing salinity the interactions between the groundwater table and salinity had a significant effect on soil respiration in brackish wetlands and salt marshes these findings suggest that seawater intrusion due to sea level rise may reduce soil carbon emissions from freshwater wetlands while the implementation of freshwater restoration projects may lead to the weakening or even loss of the carbon sink function of salt marshes comparatively the carbon emissions function of brackish wetlands is relatively stable therefore local governments should focus on enhancing the blue carbon sink function of coastal wetlands through hydrological regulation e g groundwater table salinity however in this study we could not consider the effects of litter tidal exogenous inputs and microbial community structure on soil respiration in coastal wetlands future work should consider the underlying mechanisms by which water table and salinity fluctuations and exogenous inputs e g carbon nitrogen and sediment etc caused by tidal action alter coastal soil respiration further study is needed to reveal the response mechanisms of functional microorganisms related to the soil carbon cycle which will help to better understand the effects of the groundwater table and salinity fluctuations on soil respiration at the genetic level this could provide data support and a theoretical basis for the accurate estimation of carbon emissions in coastal wetlands and assist the realization of carbon neutrality credit authorship contribution statement guozhu chen writing original draft data curation formal analysis investigation visualization

3124,the use of co2 as the heat transmission fluid increases the efficiency of geothermal energy extraction from low enthalpy resources such as depletion oil and gas reservoirs in the resulting so called co2 plume geothermal cpg systems the optimal choice of well position and operational parameters represents a strategic decision problem due to its profound effect on efficiency combined simulation optimization so schemes have been recognized as a valuable tool in making these strategic decisions noting that the total lifespan of a cpg system consists of a sequestration and a circulation stage past cpg so studies only focus on the circulation stage assuming that the reservoir is initially saturated with co2 hence they neglect the realistic state of the reservoir following co2 sequestration ignore brine based power generation and either neglect the sequestration costs or assume that the sequestration costs are part of the fixed initial investment this study aims to fill this gap by developing a so algorithm that takes into account both the sequestration and circulation stages of a cpg system lifespan in choosing optimal well location and operations we frame the problem as a probabilistic risk minimization scheme to allow for the consideration of geological uncertainty and solve it through the combined application of a multi phase numerical model artificial neural networks and a hybrid monte carlo genetic algorithm method under this context we successfully minimize the probability of having a negative net present value from the operation we also examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system and show that the net co2 storage income is the economic variable that most affects the risk of non profitability our case study involves a homogeneous fault blocked inclined thin formation that is commonly present in oil and gas fields but has been the subject of a very limited number of cpg studies keywords depleted oil reservoir co2 plume geothermal system risk aware design hybrid monte carlo genetic algorithm neural network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than a century after the first use of geothermal energy for power generation this form of renewable energy accounts for less than one percent of global electricity production barbato et al 2018 geothermal electricity generation increased by 2 in 2020 iea 2021 falling below the growth of wind energy 12 and solar power 23 in the same year chatelin and harada 2021 the problem is not with supply but with the techno economic challenges of extracting geothermal energy and therefore strategies to help reduce costs and mitigate predevelopment risks are needed to increase geothermal based power generation iea 2021 one such strategy is to extract geothermal energy from abandoned wells in depleted oil and gas reservoirs as these reservoirs are generally well explored already have much of the required infrastructure and possess proven capacity and sealing structures sun et al 2018b the potential of geothermal energy extraction from depleted oil and gas reservoirs is huge because many of the previously discovered oil fields throughout the world are now approaching the end of their production period cheng et al 2014 however a key challenge is that depleted oil and gas reservoirs are low enthalpy resources with low efficiency sun et al 2018a c to make the extraction of such low enthalpy geothermal energy economically viable co2 can be used as the heat transmission fluid chen et al 2021 geothermal systems relying on co2 for energy extraction are called co2 plume geothermal cpg systems due to a lower viscosity and higher heat capacity and mobility under supercritical condition co2 results in more effective heat advection compared to brine garapati et al 2015 sun et al 2018a moreover a higher density variation with temperature and pressure creates a stronger thermosiphon between the injection and production wells reducing the need for pumping adams et al 2014 cpg systems can generate more geothermal energy than water based systems in reservoirs with moderate temperature and permeability adams et al 2021 norouzi et al 2022 cpg systems have the additional advantage of sequestrating co2 sun et al 2018b in an era of climate change this is a major side benefit that can lead to a reduction of co2 emissions to the atmosphere and can also result in an additional source of revenue from co2 credits rajabi et al 2021 in a cpg system co2 captured from major point sources such as fossil fuel power plants pan et al 2018 is first compressed to its supercritical point and then injected into the target formation fleming et al 2020 ezekiel et al 2022 deep in the ground and under pressures and temperatures that are beyond the critical point of co2 a co2 plume moves from the injection well s towards the production well s due to the pressure gradient between the wells pruess 2008 the total lifespan of a cpg system consists of two stages a sequestration and a circulation stage chen et al 2021 during sequestration the injected co2 displaces native brine and possibly oil as it moves toward the production well s brine is driven out in an open system or is pumped out of the production well s in a closed system ezekiel et al 2020 when sufficient co2 plume is developed in the reservoir and cold co2 has gained enough energy after the sequestration stage greater than92 c in co2 production well in the example shown in fig 1 the circulation stage starts in which most of the injected co2 is circulated respectively through the injection well geothermal reservoir production well and surface power plant xu et al 2015 chen et al 2021 the performance of cpg systems has been studies extensively by e g adams et al 2014 2021 sun et al 2018a b c pan et al 2018 babaei 2019 liu et al 2020 and norouzi et al 2021 2022 1 1 simulation optimization for cpg design the position of the injection and production wells and well operational parameters such as the injection flow rate and duration are controllable factors that highly affect the performance of a cpg system adams et al 2021 chen et al 2021 2022 therefore their optimal choice represents a strategic decision problem in cpg developing a number of past studies e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 have shown that these strategic decisions can be derived from combined simulation optimization so schemes in so schemes numerical models are employed to analyze the effect of different well location and operation alternatives on cpg performance and an optimization algorithm performs a systematic search for the best alternative based on model outputs numerical codes capable of simulating multi phase flow in the context of cpg so include comsol e g qu et al 2017 tough2 e g hu et al 2020 eclipse e g babaei 2019 and nuft e g chen et al 2021 genetic algorithm has been used as the optimization method for cpg so in e g biagi et al 2015 and rajabi et al 2021 unlike high enthalpy brine based geothermal systems which have been subject to so in numerous studies e g finsterle et al 2017 for low enthalpy co2 based systems the number of studies focusing on the selection of optimal well locations and operation is considerably low and this issue is overlooked in the literature norouzi et al 2022 the few past so studies addressing cpg systems have mostly relied on a deterministic approach e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 however neglecting the inherent geological and market uncertainty carries the risk of non optimality of the solution rajabi et al 2021 is one of the few studies that has utilized a stochastic so strategy to account for uncertainty in cpg design previous so studies e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 rajabi et al 2021 focus on the circulation stage of a cpg system assuming that the reservoir is initially fully saturated with co2 and thereby neglect the realistic state of the reservoir following co2 sequestration in reality a co2 plume forms around the injection well s and spreads upwards beneath the cap rock during sequestration chen et al 2022 moreover these studies ignore brine based power generation and either neglect the sequestration costs or assume that the sequestration costs are part of the fixed initial investment neglecting the co2 sequestration stage of the cpg system in the so process is a key shortcoming because on one hand preparing the reservoir for co2 circulation is a costly endeavor and decisions regarding well location and operations affect this cost and in turn the overall profitability of a cpg system on the other hand revenue from co2 storage and geothermal energy production from hot brine during the sequestration stage can also be significant and should be accounted for in the estimation of the net present value npv outside the context of so a number of studies have employed a scenario based approach often using a one factor at a time method for the study of sequential co2 sequestration and circulation in cpg systems for example babaei 2019 perform scenario based analysis to assess the effects of open versus close boundary conditions and well spacing on a combined carbon sequestration geothermal heat recovery process in a theoretical homogeneous isotropic sedimentary hot aquifer norouzi et al 2021 present the results of sensitivity analysis on a number of parameters including injection temperature and flow rate and the production well bottom hole pressure and analyze their effects on brine backflow and salt precipitation in a similar context norouzi et al 2022 perform scenario based optimization of doublet well spacing in a reservoir with braided fluvial channels for cpg applications the study of norouzi et al 2022 implements the braided type of fluvial channels to account for geological uncertainty and investigated the subsurface performance metrics of a cpg system with a checkers board pattern ezekiel et al 2022 investigate the fluid flow performance of a cpg production well for different reservoir and operational parameters e g maximum flowrate pressure drawdown and borehole diameter adams et al 2021 analyze the time dependent values of cpg power generation for various well pipe diameters reservoir radii thicknesses and permeabilities note that though these studies address sequential carbon sequestration geothermal energy extraction none of them combines the cpg simulation model with a formal optimization algorithm and hence are not based on a so approach to the author s knowledge no past study has employed so for the optimal design of such sequential systems furthermore no previous study has examined the influence of economic uncertainty on the profitability of sequential co2 sequestration and geothermal energy extraction 1 2 study objectives this study aims to employ a so approach for cpg system design through the combined application of a multi phase numerical model and a hybrid monte carlo genetic algorithm method the key novelty of this work is to perform formal so on sequential co2 sequestration and geothermal energy extraction with the aim of choosing well location and operations that is optimal for both stages of a cpg system lifespan we frame the problem as a probabilistic risk minimization scheme to allow for the consideration of geological uncertainty under this context we minimize the probability of having a negative npv from the operation we also examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system our case study involves a homogeneous fault blocked inclined thin formation that characterizes the particular reservoir conditions found in north oman s oil and gas fields a very limited number of studies have been conducted on such reservoirs which are widely available in oil gas fields chen et al 2021 2022 the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the case study and describe the methodology including numerical model development optimization problem formulations and probabilistic so approach in section 3 the results of numerical modeling meta model validation and so are presented the paper is concluded in section 4 with a summary of our main findings 2 methodology 2 1 field description as an oil rich country oman has a considerable number of oil reservoirs that are approaching the end of their production lives these oil depleting reservoirs are potential candidates for cpg energy production because they are well characterized and appropriately sealed chen et al 2021 one such reservoir namely the upper shuaiba formation in daleel field in north oman is chosen for the optimization of sequential co2 storage and circulation in the current study rajabi et al 2021 this block is mainly carbonate and is capped by impermeable shale blocks droste and van steenwinkel 2004 morettini et al 2005 the reservoir is relatively homogeneous and has low permeability and high porosity the block is isolated creating a closed reservoir system al hadhrami et al 2018 2 2 numerical modeling the non isothermal unsaturated saturated flow and transport nuft numerical model nitao 1998 is employed for reservoir simulation nuft is capable of modeling multiphase multi component heat and mass flow and reactive transport in porous media and is based on an integrated finite difference method details about the nuft model can be found in hao et al 2012 as demonstrated in fig 1 the simulated problem domain is 2 500 3 000 25 m with a dip angle of 5 the top left corner of the domain is located at a depth of 1500 m the grid space in the x direction is 20 m for x 0 800 m and 50 m for x 800 2500 m the grid sizes in the y and z directions are 100 and 2 5 m respectively the total number of numerical cells is 22 500 the reservoir has closed boundaries and hence brine cannot be driven to far field and brine production is the only way to free storage space for co2 a constant heat flux of 0 05 w m2 is applied to the bottom boundary as the geothermal heat source the deterministic model input parameter values are as follows residual brine and co2 saturations are 0 3 and 0 05 respectively the van genuchten Œ± and n parameters are 5 1 10 5 pa 1 and 0 46 respectively garapati et al 2015 brine salinity is 180 ppt based on field measurement rock density is 2650 kg m3 rock compressibility is 4 5 10 10 pa 1 specific heat is 1000 j kg oc thermal conductivity is 2 1 w m oc and the geothermal gradient is 40 c km chen et al 2022 a co2 specific enthalpy look up table in a range of pressure and temperature is constructed using the data from national institute of standards and technology nist 2021 a python code is developed to search the look up table to find co2 enthalpy according to temperature and pressure in each model time step produced heat energy flux is then calculated as a product of mass flux and enthalpy in each time step the domain is initially saturated by brine at 180 ppt and the initial pressure and temperature are assigned according to depth hydrostatic conditions surface temperature 30 c and vertical geothermal gradient 40 c km three 1 2 km long horizontal wells i e one injection well one brine and one co2 production well are placed in parallel along the y axis in the middle y range fig 1 in the sequestration stage cold co2 at 30 c is injected under constant overpressure at the injection well in the top left corner of the domain and hot brine is produced from the production well in the bottom right corner the production pressure is fixed at the initial conditions the sequestration stage ends when co2 breaks through the brine production well reservoir pressure temperature component concentration and phase saturation at the end of the sequestration stage are used as initial conditions for the circulation model this choice of the initial conditions for the co2 circulation stage is similar to a number of past sensitivity scenario analysis studies such as babaei 2019 adams et al 2021 norouzi et al 2021 2022 and ezekiel et al 2022 but different from previous cpg so studies e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 rajabi et al 2021 in the circulation stage cold co2 injection continues in the same injection well and with an overpressure equal to that of sequestration the co2 production well is placed on the top layer at a predetermined distance from the injection well the hot co2 production rate is denoted as q pr the circulation stage stops when the produced co2 temperature t prod co 3 t falls below 75 c chen et al 2022 or a maximum of 100 years is reached 2 3 the optimization problem during the sequestration stage the major operational costs are associated

saar 2011 e t c a u h prod t and c a 1 t rej t res where ca and u are carnot efficiency and utilization efficiency respectively h prod t is produced thermal energy mwh t rej is the surface temperature k and t res represents the reservoir temperature k we assume that the decision variable in the sequestration stage is overpressure dp in the injection well and the injection rate is time dependent the brine production rate in the sequestration stage is also time dependent as the bottom hole pressure is fixed as the initial value during the circulation stage the main portion of the produced fluid is co2 and hence thermosiphon effect is enough for fluid production chen et al 2021 the key elements of cost during circulation c cir t are a co2 procurement and injection b brine disposal and c o m of the power plant estimation of c seq t is based on eq 1 without the cost pumping term income during circulation r cir t is mainly from co2 storage credit and electricity generation from produced co2 as in eq 3 the decision variables in the circulation stage are assumed to be injection overpressure dp spacing between the injection and production wells l i p and the production rate q p the following risk based objective function is employed to ensure economic profitability of the selected sequence of decisions in the sequestration and circulations stages 5 minimizepr n p v t 0 where npv t denotes the total net present value and p r npv t 0 represents the probability of a negative npv t npv t is calculated as follows 6 np v t t 1 n seq r seq t c seq t 1 r t t 1 n cir r cir t c cir t 1 r t c 0 1

of the sequestration and circulation stages respectively and r is the fixed annual discount rate the uncertain variables in the optimization process are reservoir porosity e r and permeability k r assuming homogeneity it is also assumed that e r and k r are independent and characterized by uniform probability distribution on the intervals defined in table 1 optimization is subjected to the following contains injection overpressure is regulated according to the geo mechanical conditions of the reservoir a sequestration time of over 100 years is undesirable a circulation stage lifespan lower than 15 years is considered uneconomical due to the capital equipment investment as in chen et al 2022 co2 cut during the circulation stage should be greater than 0 94 for appropriate functioning of the surface co2 turbine welch and boyle 2009 the constant economic and technical parameters are quantified in table 2 2 4 probabilistic simulation optimization methodology to estimate the value of the probabilistic objective function described in eq 5 we employ monte carlo simulations mcss the objective function is minimized using genetic algorithm ga ga employs the value of eq 5 as its fitness function and uses selection crossover and mutation operators to converge to the global minima hassan et al 2005 explanations on how mcs and an optimization algorithm can be hybridized is presented in rajabi and ketabchi 2017 mcss require a large number of independent model simulations to converge to an acceptable accuracy level robert et al 2004 the size of the population and generation in ga should also be large to guarantee that a global minima is reached ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 hence the hybrid mcs ga algorithm results in an extremely high number of model simulations since each nuft simulation described in sub section 2 1 required approximately 5 and 2 h for sequestration and circulation models respectively implementing the algorithm is computationally impractical unless the numerical model is replaced with an appropriate meta model for this purpose artificial neural networks anns are trained using nuft model output realizations and are then used within the context of hybrid mcs ga computations as a surrogate for the numerical model a total of five parameters are considered in parameter sampling e r and k r as uncertain reservoir parameters and dp l i p and q p as the decision variables the parameters e r k r and dp are involved in both the sequestration and circulation stages while parameters l i p and q p are only included in the circulation stage parameter sampling is done via latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 2000 the parameter space sampled for metamodel training is described in table 1 permeability is assumed to have a log uniform distribution and the other four parameters are assigned uniform distributions first 500 co2 sequestration simulations are performed and the outputs are used as the initial condition for 500 co2 circulation simulations 70 of the input output pairs are used for training 20 for validation and the remaining 10 for testing of the ann met models a separate ann is built for each of the following output quantity of interest qoi inj co 2 t q brine t h prod t and n seq in the sequestration stage and inj co 2 t q brine t h prod t pro co 2 t t prod co 3 t and pressure in production well p prod for the circulation stage the anns metamodels are constructed using python s tensorflow framework 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation results we start by analyzing the numerical simulation results for a base case in which the decision variables and the uncertain reservoir parameters are all assigned values at the middle of their respective distribution ranges fig 2 demonstrates the resulting pressure temperature and co2 saturation distribution at the end of sequestration and circulations stages during sequestration under the pressure gradient between the injection and production wells fig 2 a co2 displaces the native brine and spreads to pw 1 brine production well where brine is extracted as co2 is lighter than brine co2 migrates along the top boundary plane and then downward to pw 1 fig 2 c the highest temperature gradient is observed near the injection well at 0 x 200 m fig 2 b the sequestration stage ends in 26 years when co2 breakthrough occurs in pw 1 during the circulation stage production from pw 1 is halted and production from pw 2 co2 production well starts at a constant rate of q p while overpressure in the injection well remains the same the pressure decreases around pw 2 but increases in the downstream side because overpressure in the injection well can bypass pw 2 and propagate to the entire domain fig 2 a partial co2 spread to the downstream during the sequestration stage is attracted backwards to pw 2 during the circulation stage as well as the brine fig 2 c therefore the location and production rate of pw 2 should be optimized to manage co2 cut appropriately as shown in fig 2 b low temperature is constrained in the sweeping region between the injection well and pw 2 the circulation stage ends in 51 years when the temperature of the produced fluids drops below 75 c the above described spatial variations of pressure temperature and co2 saturation are consistent with those reported in past studies such as adams et al 2021 norouzi et al 2022 and chen et al 2022 3 2 metamodel results the numerical model results are subsequently used for metamodel training and validations the chosen ann architecture for all qois is a multilayer perceptron mlp type neural network trained using the adam optimizer the number of layers neurons and type of activation function used for each qoi is presented in table 3 ann outputs are validated through comparison with the nuft model outputs for the test samples graphical comparison of the scatter plots between the simulated and emulated qoi are presented in fig 3 furthermore three statistical diagnostics namely the percentage mean absolute error mae percentage root mean square error rmse and explained variance ev are used for metamodel validation and the results are presented in table 4 as shown the scatter points are perfectly aligned for n seq and all circulation qois and moderately aligned for pr b s e q pr h s e q and in co 2 s e q to the one one line for all qois mae ranges between 0 35 and 16 89 rmse ranges between 0 46 and 18 33 and ev is on the internal 0 79 1 00 due to the higher nonlinear nature of the pr b s e q pr h s e q and in co 2 s e q output time series for the sequestration stage errors for these three are significantly higher than the rest of the qois overall the ann validation results are deemed acceptable and the error metrics are close to those of past studies employing different meta models for cpg system sensitivity analysis e g chen et al 2021 or so e g rajabi et al 2021 3 3 optimization results the validated metamodels are subsequently employed in hybrid msc ga to optimize the cpg decision variables based on a number of trial and errors the hyper parameters of the hybrid mcs ga are chosen as follows the number of mcss for uncertainty propagation analysis is 1 000 the ga population and maximum generation size are 100 and 50 respectively mutation probability is 0 1 elite ratio is 0 01 crossover probability is 0 9 the parents portion is 0 3 and the crossover and mutation types are both assumed to be uniform fig 4 demonstrates how the optimization algorithm gradually decreases the risk of non profitability until it reaches convergence at about the 30th iteration showing the effectiveness of the proposed so approach the computational time of the so process on a personal computer pc with a 1 8 ghz core i7 4500u cpu is approximately 40 min since the so process required about 3 106 simulations for each of the sequestration and circulation stages it would theoretically require 21 106 h to do the same computations by directly incorporating the numerical nuft model in the so procedure without any parallelization hence the time saving ratio rajabi and ketabchi 2017 obtained from replacing the numerical model with the anns metamodels exceeds 0 99 even when the numerical simulation employed for metamodel training are taken into account the minimum risk obtained from so of the cpg system is 0 22 which pertains to a mean and standard deviation of 9 553 and 14 637 mm for npv t respectively the probability density function pdf of the optimal npv t is shown in fig 5 a the pdf is asymmetric with some skewness to the right hence pure reliance on the mean and standard deviation statistics for uncertainty based optimization is not adequate and the entire probability distribution should be taken into account rajabi et al 2021 justifying the risk based approach of the current study the optimal values of the decision variables are d p i 14 11 mpa for both the sequestration and circulation stages and l i p 366 m and q p 5 18 kg s for the circulation stage these optimal values result in mean sequestration and circulation lifespans of 27 and 82 years respectively which are close to the values of lifespan reported in chen et al 2022 for similar values of l i p and q p the pdf of these two lifespans are demonstrated in fig 5 b c the n seq pdf is significantly skewed toward lower lifespans while the n cir pdf is less skewed and closer to a gaussian density the pdf of n cir fig 5 c is in accordance with the conclusion made in chen et al 2021 who state that in general the circulation lifespan is longer than 40 years for reservoirs deeper than 2 km for the optimal values of decision variables the yearly ensemble mean of the brine based power generated during sequestration varies between 0 16 and 0 37 mwe and the yearly ensemble maximum never goes beyond 1 00 mwe fig 6 a during the circulation stage the yearly ensemble mean of the electricity power generated from co2 fluctuates around 11 6 mwe fig 6 b indicating consistent power output and low heat depletion these variation patterns and absolute values of power generation are consistent with those reported in adams et al 2021 for a five well pattern cpg system in sedimentary rock with optimal well spacing obtained from scenario analysis the stored co2 is highest in the first year of the sequestration stage in which based on the ensemble mean about 0 436 mtons of co2 mass is stored in the geothermal reservoir the mean stored co2 drops sharply to 0 215 mtons in the second year and gradually falls to 0 133 mtons by the end of the sequestration stage fig 6 c during circulation the mean stored co2 is significantly lower and fluctuates around 0 007 mtons without a significant increasing decreasing trend fig 6 d the ensemble minimum and maximum of the stored co2 show similar variation patterns however the difference between the ensemble mean and maximum is much higher in the circulation stage and is the order of 0 12 mtons the co2 stored to injected ratio sir is 0 05 for the circulation stages which is consistent with past studies e g babaei 2019 chen et al 2021 rajabi et al 2021 3 4 impact of economic uncertainty to examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system the following six economic variables are assumed to be uncertain the discount rate r price of electricity e p net co2 storage income nsi co 2 which equals cr c o 2 cost proc the constant portion of the cost of co2 injection c 3 brine pumping cost pumping and disposal cost disposal costs for each variable the range of uncertainty is presented in table 5 these hypothetical ranges reflect potential future market variations and the adoption of different technologies discretized values of each economic variable are used as input to a so scenario keeping the other economic variables as their base values to find the associated risk of non profitability the outcome of this analysis is presented in fig 7 the net co2 storage income is the economic variable that most affects the risk of non profitability a net co2 income below 4 ton results in an inevitably negative npv t the risk of non profitability decreases like a second order polynomial function with increase in the net co2 storage income and approaches zero when nsi co 2 reaches 29 ton this high sensitivity of risk to nsi co 2 is due to the fact that in the base case income from co2 storage accounts for 98 and 14 of the npv t in the sequestration and circulation stages respectively the remaining income is the result of electricity sales fig 7 demonstrates that purchase of electricity at higher prices price e 150 m w h or provision of low interest loans 3 can reduce the risk of non profitability to zero fig 8 demonstrates how the risk of non profitability is affected by pairwise variations in the economic factors as shown the effect of lower co2 net storage income can be counterweighed by higher electricity prices fig 8 a moreover with an interest rate below 4 the project will be profitable for the entire presumed range of electricity price fig 8 c assuming that the other economic variables have their base values the cost of brine disposal has more impact on non profitability risk compared to the cost of brine pumping fig 8 c the reason is that both stages of the cpg lifecycle include brine disposal costs however the brine pumping cost is only associated with the sequestration stage fig 8 d demonstrates that government support through either or both lower interest rate loans and higher co2 storage credits has a pronounced effect on the profitability of the proposed cpg system 4 summary and conclusion in this study a so approach was developed for the optimal design of a cpg system taking into account the co2 plume development stage and the associated brine based power generation as well as the subsequent co2 circulation stage we illustrated that anns can be a reliable and accurate surrogate for cpg simulators and they can be used within the framework of so to achieve an overall theoretical speed up ratio beyond 0 999 another key issue addressed in this study is how to properly formulate the objective functions and constraints within the framework of uncertainty based so for cpg design under this context we formulated the problem of estimating the optimal injection overpressure production rate and well spacing as the minimization of the probability of having a negative npv from sequential co2 sequestration and circulation taking into consideration constraints on the injection overpressure lifespan and co2 cut during the circulation stage in our case study of a depleted oil reservoir in north oman the resulting optimal combination of decision variables leads to yearly electricity generation of 0 16 0 37 mwe from hot brine during the sequestration stage and 11 6 mwe yearly electricity production from co2 circulation the stored co2 is 0 436 0 133 mtons during the sequestration stage we also examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system and show that the net co2 storage income is the economic variable that most affects the risk of non profitability followed in second place by the rate of return on investment we demonstrated that government support through either or both lower interest rate loans and higher co2 storage credits has a pronounced effect on the profitability of the proposed cpg system limitations of this study include the assumption of a homogeneous formation and perfectly closed boundary conditions future studies may consider heterogeneous reservoirs and leaky confining units in uncertainty based so credit authorship

3124,the use of co2 as the heat transmission fluid increases the efficiency of geothermal energy extraction from low enthalpy resources such as depletion oil and gas reservoirs in the resulting so called co2 plume geothermal cpg systems the optimal choice of well position and operational parameters represents a strategic decision problem due to its profound effect on efficiency combined simulation optimization so schemes have been recognized as a valuable tool in making these strategic decisions noting that the total lifespan of a cpg system consists of a sequestration and a circulation stage past cpg so studies only focus on the circulation stage assuming that the reservoir is initially saturated with co2 hence they neglect the realistic state of the reservoir following co2 sequestration ignore brine based power generation and either neglect the sequestration costs or assume that the sequestration costs are part of the fixed initial investment this study aims to fill this gap by developing a so algorithm that takes into account both the sequestration and circulation stages of a cpg system lifespan in choosing optimal well location and operations we frame the problem as a probabilistic risk minimization scheme to allow for the consideration of geological uncertainty and solve it through the combined application of a multi phase numerical model artificial neural networks and a hybrid monte carlo genetic algorithm method under this context we successfully minimize the probability of having a negative net present value from the operation we also examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system and show that the net co2 storage income is the economic variable that most affects the risk of non profitability our case study involves a homogeneous fault blocked inclined thin formation that is commonly present in oil and gas fields but has been the subject of a very limited number of cpg studies keywords depleted oil reservoir co2 plume geothermal system risk aware design hybrid monte carlo genetic algorithm neural network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction more than a century after the first use of geothermal energy for power generation this form of renewable energy accounts for less than one percent of global electricity production barbato et al 2018 geothermal electricity generation increased by 2 in 2020 iea 2021 falling below the growth of wind energy 12 and solar power 23 in the same year chatelin and harada 2021 the problem is not with supply but with the techno economic challenges of extracting geothermal energy and therefore strategies to help reduce costs and mitigate predevelopment risks are needed to increase geothermal based power generation iea 2021 one such strategy is to extract geothermal energy from abandoned wells in depleted oil and gas reservoirs as these reservoirs are generally well explored already have much of the required infrastructure and possess proven capacity and sealing structures sun et al 2018b the potential of geothermal energy extraction from depleted oil and gas reservoirs is huge because many of the previously discovered oil fields throughout the world are now approaching the end of their production period cheng et al 2014 however a key challenge is that depleted oil and gas reservoirs are low enthalpy resources with low efficiency sun et al 2018a c to make the extraction of such low enthalpy geothermal energy economically viable co2 can be used as the heat transmission fluid chen et al 2021 geothermal systems relying on co2 for energy extraction are called co2 plume geothermal cpg systems due to a lower viscosity and higher heat capacity and mobility under supercritical condition co2 results in more effective heat advection compared to brine garapati et al 2015 sun et al 2018a moreover a higher density variation with temperature and pressure creates a stronger thermosiphon between the injection and production wells reducing the need for pumping adams et al 2014 cpg systems can generate more geothermal energy than water based systems in reservoirs with moderate temperature and permeability adams et al 2021 norouzi et al 2022 cpg systems have the additional advantage of sequestrating co2 sun et al 2018b in an era of climate change this is a major side benefit that can lead to a reduction of co2 emissions to the atmosphere and can also result in an additional source of revenue from co2 credits rajabi et al 2021 in a cpg system co2 captured from major point sources such as fossil fuel power plants pan et al 2018 is first compressed to its supercritical point and then injected into the target formation fleming et al 2020 ezekiel et al 2022 deep in the ground and under pressures and temperatures that are beyond the critical point of co2 a co2 plume moves from the injection well s towards the production well s due to the pressure gradient between the wells pruess 2008 the total lifespan of a cpg system consists of two stages a sequestration and a circulation stage chen et al 2021 during sequestration the injected co2 displaces native brine and possibly oil as it moves toward the production well s brine is driven out in an open system or is pumped out of the production well s in a closed system ezekiel et al 2020 when sufficient co2 plume is developed in the reservoir and cold co2 has gained enough energy after the sequestration stage greater than92 c in co2 production well in the example shown in fig 1 the circulation stage starts in which most of the injected co2 is circulated respectively through the injection well geothermal reservoir production well and surface power plant xu et al 2015 chen et al 2021 the performance of cpg systems has been studies extensively by e g adams et al 2014 2021 sun et al 2018a b c pan et al 2018 babaei 2019 liu et al 2020 and norouzi et al 2021 2022 1 1 simulation optimization for cpg design the position of the injection and production wells and well operational parameters such as the injection flow rate and duration are controllable factors that highly affect the performance of a cpg system adams et al 2021 chen et al 2021 2022 therefore their optimal choice represents a strategic decision problem in cpg developing a number of past studies e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 have shown that these strategic decisions can be derived from combined simulation optimization so schemes in so schemes numerical models are employed to analyze the effect of different well location and operation alternatives on cpg performance and an optimization algorithm performs a systematic search for the best alternative based on model outputs numerical codes capable of simulating multi phase flow in the context of cpg so include comsol e g qu et al 2017 tough2 e g hu et al 2020 eclipse e g babaei 2019 and nuft e g chen et al 2021 genetic algorithm has been used as the optimization method for cpg so in e g biagi et al 2015 and rajabi et al 2021 unlike high enthalpy brine based geothermal systems which have been subject to so in numerous studies e g finsterle et al 2017 for low enthalpy co2 based systems the number of studies focusing on the selection of optimal well locations and operation is considerably low and this issue is overlooked in the literature norouzi et al 2022 the few past so studies addressing cpg systems have mostly relied on a deterministic approach e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 however neglecting the inherent geological and market uncertainty carries the risk of non optimality of the solution rajabi et al 2021 is one of the few studies that has utilized a stochastic so strategy to account for uncertainty in cpg design previous so studies e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 rajabi et al 2021 focus on the circulation stage of a cpg system assuming that the reservoir is initially fully saturated with co2 and thereby neglect the realistic state of the reservoir following co2 sequestration in reality a co2 plume forms around the injection well s and spreads upwards beneath the cap rock during sequestration chen et al 2022 moreover these studies ignore brine based power generation and either neglect the sequestration costs or assume that the sequestration costs are part of the fixed initial investment neglecting the co2 sequestration stage of the cpg system in the so process is a key shortcoming because on one hand preparing the reservoir for co2 circulation is a costly endeavor and decisions regarding well location and operations affect this cost and in turn the overall profitability of a cpg system on the other hand revenue from co2 storage and geothermal energy production from hot brine during the sequestration stage can also be significant and should be accounted for in the estimation of the net present value npv outside the context of so a number of studies have employed a scenario based approach often using a one factor at a time method for the study of sequential co2 sequestration and circulation in cpg systems for example babaei 2019 perform scenario based analysis to assess the effects of open versus close boundary conditions and well spacing on a combined carbon sequestration geothermal heat recovery process in a theoretical homogeneous isotropic sedimentary hot aquifer norouzi et al 2021 present the results of sensitivity analysis on a number of parameters including injection temperature and flow rate and the production well bottom hole pressure and analyze their effects on brine backflow and salt precipitation in a similar context norouzi et al 2022 perform scenario based optimization of doublet well spacing in a reservoir with braided fluvial channels for cpg applications the study of norouzi et al 2022 implements the braided type of fluvial channels to account for geological uncertainty and investigated the subsurface performance metrics of a cpg system with a checkers board pattern ezekiel et al 2022 investigate the fluid flow performance of a cpg production well for different reservoir and operational parameters e g maximum flowrate pressure drawdown and borehole diameter adams et al 2021 analyze the time dependent values of cpg power generation for various well pipe diameters reservoir radii thicknesses and permeabilities note that though these studies address sequential carbon sequestration geothermal energy extraction none of them combines the cpg simulation model with a formal optimization algorithm and hence are not based on a so approach to the author s knowledge no past study has employed so for the optimal design of such sequential systems furthermore no previous study has examined the influence of economic uncertainty on the profitability of sequential co2 sequestration and geothermal energy extraction 1 2 study objectives this study aims to employ a so approach for cpg system design through the combined application of a multi phase numerical model and a hybrid monte carlo genetic algorithm method the key novelty of this work is to perform formal so on sequential co2 sequestration and geothermal energy extraction with the aim of choosing well location and operations that is optimal for both stages of a cpg system lifespan we frame the problem as a probabilistic risk minimization scheme to allow for the consideration of geological uncertainty under this context we minimize the probability of having a negative npv from the operation we also examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system our case study involves a homogeneous fault blocked inclined thin formation that characterizes the particular reservoir conditions found in north oman s oil and gas fields a very limited number of studies have been conducted on such reservoirs which are widely available in oil gas fields chen et al 2021 2022 the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the case study and describe the methodology including numerical model development optimization problem formulations and probabilistic so approach in section 3 the results of numerical modeling meta model validation and so are presented the paper is concluded in section 4 with a summary of our main findings 2 methodology 2 1 field description as an oil rich country oman has a considerable number of oil reservoirs that are approaching the end of their production lives these oil depleting reservoirs are potential candidates for cpg energy production because they are well characterized and appropriately sealed chen et al 2021 one such reservoir namely the upper shuaiba formation in daleel field in north oman is chosen for the optimization of sequential co2 storage and circulation in the current study rajabi et al 2021 this block is mainly carbonate and is capped by impermeable shale blocks droste and van steenwinkel 2004 morettini et al 2005 the reservoir is relatively homogeneous and has low permeability and high porosity the block is isolated creating a closed reservoir system al hadhrami et al 2018 2 2 numerical modeling the non isothermal unsaturated saturated flow and transport nuft numerical model nitao 1998 is employed for reservoir simulation nuft is capable of modeling multiphase multi component heat and mass flow and reactive transport in porous media and is based on an integrated finite difference method details about the nuft model can be found in hao et al 2012 as demonstrated in fig 1 the simulated problem domain is 2 500 3 000 25 m with a dip angle of 5 the top left corner of the domain is located at a depth of 1500 m the grid space in the x direction is 20 m for x 0 800 m and 50 m for x 800 2500 m the grid sizes in the y and z directions are 100 and 2 5 m respectively the total number of numerical cells is 22 500 the reservoir has closed boundaries and hence brine cannot be driven to far field and brine production is the only way to free storage space for co2 a constant heat flux of 0 05 w m2 is applied to the bottom boundary as the geothermal heat source the deterministic model input parameter values are as follows residual brine and co2 saturations are 0 3 and 0 05 respectively the van genuchten Œ± and n parameters are 5 1 10 5 pa 1 and 0 46 respectively garapati et al 2015 brine salinity is 180 ppt based on field measurement rock density is 2650 kg m3 rock compressibility is 4 5 10 10 pa 1 specific heat is 1000 j kg oc thermal conductivity is 2 1 w m oc and the geothermal gradient is 40 c km chen et al 2022 a co2 specific enthalpy look up table in a range of pressure and temperature is constructed using the data from national institute of standards and technology nist 2021 a python code is developed to search the look up table to find co2 enthalpy according to temperature and pressure in each model time step produced heat energy flux is then calculated as a product of mass flux and enthalpy in each time step the domain is initially saturated by brine at 180 ppt and the initial pressure and temperature are assigned according to depth hydrostatic conditions surface temperature 30 c and vertical geothermal gradient 40 c km three 1 2 km long horizontal wells i e one injection well one brine and one co2 production well are placed in parallel along the y axis in the middle y range fig 1 in the sequestration stage cold co2 at 30 c is injected under constant overpressure at the injection well in the top left corner of the domain and hot brine is produced from the production well in the bottom right corner the production pressure is fixed at the initial conditions the sequestration stage ends when co2 breaks through the brine production well reservoir pressure temperature component concentration and phase saturation at the end of the sequestration stage are used as initial conditions for the circulation model this choice of the initial conditions for the co2 circulation stage is similar to a number of past sensitivity scenario analysis studies such as babaei 2019 adams et al 2021 norouzi et al 2021 2022 and ezekiel et al 2022 but different from previous cpg so studies e g biagi et al 2015 ravilov 2019 rajabi et al 2021 in the circulation stage cold co2 injection continues in the same injection well and with an overpressure equal to that of sequestration the co2 production well is placed on the top layer at a predetermined distance from the injection well the hot co2 production rate is denoted as q pr the circulation stage stops when the produced co2 temperature t prod co 3 t falls below 75 c chen et al 2022 or a maximum of 100 years is reached 2 3 the optimization problem during the sequestration stage the major operational costs are associated

saar 2011 e t c a u h prod t and c a 1 t rej t res where ca and u are carnot efficiency and utilization efficiency respectively h prod t is produced thermal energy mwh t rej is the surface temperature k and t res represents the reservoir temperature k we assume that the decision variable in the sequestration stage is overpressure dp in the injection well and the injection rate is time dependent the brine production rate in the sequestration stage is also time dependent as the bottom hole pressure is fixed as the initial value during the circulation stage the main portion of the produced fluid is co2 and hence thermosiphon effect is enough for fluid production chen et al 2021 the key elements of cost during circulation c cir t are a co2 procurement and injection b brine disposal and c o m of the power plant estimation of c seq t is based on eq 1 without the cost pumping term income during circulation r cir t is mainly from co2 storage credit and electricity generation from produced co2 as in eq 3 the decision variables in the circulation stage are assumed to be injection overpressure dp spacing between the injection and production wells l i p and the production rate q p the following risk based objective function is employed to ensure economic profitability of the selected sequence of decisions in the sequestration and circulations stages 5 minimizepr n p v t 0 where npv t denotes

of the sequestration and circulation stages respectively and r is the fixed annual discount rate the uncertain variables in the optimization process are reservoir porosity e r and permeability k r assuming homogeneity it is also assumed that e r and k r are independent and characterized by uniform probability distribution on the intervals defined in table 1 optimization is subjected to the following contains injection overpressure is regulated according to the geo mechanical conditions of the reservoir a sequestration time of over 100 years is undesirable a circulation stage lifespan lower than 15 years is considered uneconomical due to the capital equipment investment as in chen et al 2022 co2 cut during the circulation stage should be greater than 0 94 for appropriate functioning of the surface co2 turbine welch and boyle 2009 the constant economic and technical parameters are quantified in table 2 2 4 probabilistic simulation optimization methodology to estimate the value of the probabilistic objective function described in eq 5 we employ monte carlo simulations mcss the objective function is minimized using genetic algorithm ga ga employs the value of eq 5 as its fitness function and uses selection crossover and mutation operators to converge to the global minima hassan et al 2005 explanations on how mcs and an optimization algorithm can be hybridized is presented in rajabi and ketabchi 2017 mcss require a large number of independent model simulations to converge to an acceptable accuracy level robert et al 2004 the size of the population and generation in ga should also be large to guarantee that a global minima is reached ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 hence the hybrid mcs ga algorithm results in an extremely high number of model simulations since each nuft simulation described in sub section 2 1 required approximately 5 and 2 h for sequestration and circulation models respectively implementing the algorithm is computationally impractical unless the numerical model is replaced with an appropriate meta model for this purpose artificial neural networks anns are trained using nuft model output realizations and are then used within the context of hybrid mcs ga computations as a surrogate for the numerical model a total of five parameters are considered in parameter sampling e r and k r as uncertain reservoir parameters and dp l i p and q p as the decision variables the parameters e r k r and dp are involved in both the sequestration and circulation stages while parameters l i p and q p are only included in the circulation stage parameter sampling is done via latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 2000 the parameter space sampled for metamodel training is described in table 1 permeability is assumed to have a log uniform distribution and the other four parameters are assigned uniform distributions first 500 co2 sequestration simulations are performed and the outputs are used as the initial condition for 500 co2 circulation simulations 70 of the input output pairs are used for training 20 for validation and the remaining 10 for testing of the ann met models a separate ann is built for each of the following output quantity of interest qoi inj co 2 t q brine t h prod t and n seq in the sequestration stage and inj co 2 t q brine t h prod t pro co 2 t t prod co 3 t and pressure in production well p prod for the circulation stage the anns metamodels are constructed using python s tensorflow framework 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation results we start by analyzing the numerical simulation results for a base case in which the decision variables and the uncertain reservoir parameters are all assigned values at the middle of their respective distribution ranges fig 2 demonstrates the resulting pressure temperature and co2 saturation distribution at the end of sequestration and circulations stages during sequestration under the pressure gradient between the injection and production wells fig 2 a co2 displaces the native brine and spreads to pw 1 brine production well where brine is extracted as co2 is lighter than brine co2 migrates along the top boundary plane and then downward to pw 1 fig 2 c the highest temperature gradient is observed near the injection well at 0 x 200 m fig 2 b the sequestration stage ends in 26 years when co2 breakthrough occurs in pw 1 during the circulation stage production from pw 1 is halted and production from pw 2 co2 production well starts at a constant rate of q p while overpressure in the injection well remains the same the pressure decreases around pw 2 but increases in the downstream side because overpressure in the injection well can bypass pw 2 and propagate to the entire domain fig 2 a partial co2 spread to the downstream during the sequestration stage is attracted backwards to pw 2 during the circulation stage as well as the brine fig 2 c therefore the location and production rate of pw 2 should be optimized to manage co2 cut appropriately as shown in fig 2 b low temperature is constrained in the sweeping region between the injection well and pw 2 the circulation stage ends in 51 years when the temperature of the produced fluids drops below 75 c the above described spatial variations of pressure temperature and co2 saturation are consistent with those reported in past studies such as adams et al 2021 norouzi et al 2022 and chen et al 2022 3 2 metamodel results the numerical model results are subsequently used for metamodel training and validations the chosen ann architecture for all qois is a multilayer perceptron mlp type neural network trained using the adam optimizer the number of layers neurons and type of activation function used for each qoi is presented in table 3 ann outputs are validated through comparison with the nuft model outputs for the test samples graphical comparison of the scatter plots between the simulated and emulated qoi are presented in fig 3 furthermore three statistical diagnostics namely the percentage mean absolute error mae percentage root mean square error rmse and explained variance ev are used for metamodel validation and the results are presented in table 4 as shown the scatter points are perfectly aligned for n seq and all circulation qois and moderately aligned for pr b s e q pr h s e q and in co 2 s e q to the one one line for all qois mae ranges between 0 35 and 16 89 rmse ranges between 0 46 and 18 33 and ev is on the internal 0 79 1 00 due to the higher nonlinear nature of the pr b s e q pr h s e q and in co 2 s e q output time series for the sequestration stage errors for these three are significantly higher than the rest of the qois overall the ann validation results are deemed acceptable and the error metrics are close to those of past studies employing different meta models for cpg system sensitivity analysis e g chen et al 2021 or so e g rajabi et al 2021 3 3 optimization results the validated metamodels are subsequently employed in hybrid msc ga to optimize the cpg decision variables based on a number of trial and errors the hyper parameters of the hybrid mcs ga are chosen as follows the number of mcss for uncertainty propagation analysis is 1 000 the ga population and maximum generation size are 100 and 50 respectively mutation probability is 0 1 elite ratio is 0 01 crossover probability is 0 9 the parents portion is 0 3 and the crossover and mutation types are both assumed to be uniform fig 4 demonstrates how the optimization algorithm gradually decreases the risk of non profitability until it reaches convergence at about the 30th iteration showing the effectiveness of the proposed so approach the computational time of the so process on a personal computer pc with a 1 8 ghz core i7 4500u cpu is approximately 40 min since the so process required about 3 106 simulations for each of the sequestration and circulation stages it would theoretically require 21 106 h to do the same computations by directly incorporating the numerical nuft model in the so procedure without any parallelization hence the time saving ratio rajabi and ketabchi 2017 obtained from replacing the numerical model with the anns metamodels exceeds 0 99 even when the numerical simulation employed for metamodel training are taken into account the minimum risk obtained from so of the cpg system is 0 22 which pertains to a mean and standard deviation of 9 553 and 14 637 mm for npv t respectively the probability density function pdf of the optimal npv t is shown in fig 5 a the pdf is asymmetric with some skewness to the right hence pure reliance on the mean and standard deviation statistics for uncertainty based optimization is not adequate and the entire probability distribution should be taken into account rajabi et al 2021 justifying the risk based approach of the current study the optimal values of the decision variables are d p i 14 11 mpa for both the sequestration and circulation stages and l i p 366 m and q p 5 18 kg s for the circulation stage these optimal values result in mean sequestration and circulation lifespans of 27 and 82 years respectively which are close to the values of lifespan reported in chen et al 2022 for similar values of l i p and q p the pdf of these two lifespans are demonstrated in fig 5 b c the n seq pdf is significantly skewed toward lower lifespans while the n cir pdf is less skewed and closer to a gaussian density the pdf of n cir fig 5 c is in accordance with the conclusion made in chen et al 2021 who state that in general the circulation lifespan is longer than 40 years for reservoirs deeper than 2 km for the optimal values of decision variables the yearly ensemble mean of the brine based power generated during sequestration varies between 0 16 and 0 37 mwe and the yearly ensemble maximum never goes beyond 1 00 mwe fig 6 a during the circulation stage the yearly ensemble mean of the electricity power generated from co2 fluctuates around 11 6 mwe fig 6 b indicating consistent power output and low heat depletion these variation patterns and absolute values of power generation are consistent with those reported in adams et al 2021 for a five well pattern cpg system in sedimentary rock with optimal well spacing obtained from scenario analysis the stored co2 is highest in the first year of the sequestration stage in which based on the ensemble mean about 0 436 mtons of co2 mass is stored in the geothermal reservoir the mean stored co2 drops sharply to 0 215 mtons in the second year and gradually falls to 0 133 mtons by the end of the sequestration stage fig 6 c during circulation the mean stored co2 is significantly lower and fluctuates around 0 007 mtons without a significant increasing decreasing trend fig 6 d the ensemble minimum and maximum of the stored co2 show similar variation patterns however the difference between the ensemble mean and maximum is much higher in the circulation stage and is the order of 0 12 mtons the co2 stored to injected ratio sir is 0 05 for the circulation stages which is consistent with past studies e g babaei 2019 chen et al 2021 rajabi et al 2021 3 4 impact of economic uncertainty to examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system the following six economic variables are assumed to be uncertain the discount rate r price of electricity e p net co2 storage income nsi co 2 which equals cr c o 2 cost proc the constant portion of the cost of co2 injection c 3 brine pumping cost pumping and disposal cost disposal costs for each variable the range of uncertainty is presented in table 5 these hypothetical ranges reflect potential future market variations and the adoption of different technologies discretized values of each economic variable are used as input to a so scenario keeping the other economic variables as their base values to find the associated risk of non profitability the outcome of this analysis is presented in fig 7 the net co2 storage income is the economic variable that most affects the risk of non profitability a net co2 income below 4 ton results in an inevitably negative npv t the risk of non profitability decreases like a second order polynomial function with increase in the net co2 storage income and approaches zero when nsi co 2 reaches 29 ton this high sensitivity of risk to nsi co 2 is due to the fact that in the base case income from co2 storage accounts for 98 and 14 of the npv t in the sequestration and circulation stages respectively the remaining income is the result of electricity sales fig 7 demonstrates that purchase of electricity at higher prices price e 150 m w h or provision of low interest loans 3 can reduce the risk of non profitability to zero fig 8 demonstrates how the risk of non profitability is affected by pairwise variations in the economic factors as shown the effect of lower co2 net storage income can be counterweighed by higher electricity prices fig 8 a moreover with an interest rate below 4 the project will be profitable for the entire presumed range of electricity price fig 8 c assuming that the other economic variables have their base values the cost of brine disposal has more impact on non profitability risk compared to the cost of brine pumping fig 8 c the reason is that both stages of the cpg lifecycle include brine disposal costs however the brine pumping cost is only associated with the sequestration stage fig 8 d demonstrates that government support through either or both lower interest rate loans and higher co2 storage credits has a pronounced effect on the profitability of the proposed cpg system 4 summary and conclusion in this study a so approach was developed for the optimal design of a cpg system taking into account the co2 plume development stage and the associated brine based power generation as well as the subsequent co2 circulation stage we illustrated that anns can be a reliable and accurate surrogate for cpg simulators and they can be used within the framework of so to achieve an overall theoretical speed up ratio beyond 0 999 another key issue addressed in this study is how to properly formulate the objective functions and constraints within the framework of uncertainty based so for cpg design under this context we formulated the problem of estimating the optimal injection overpressure production rate and well spacing as the minimization of the probability of having a negative npv from sequential co2 sequestration and circulation taking into consideration constraints on the injection overpressure lifespan and co2 cut during the circulation stage in our case study of a depleted oil reservoir in north oman the resulting optimal combination of decision variables leads to yearly electricity generation of 0 16 0 37 mwe from hot brine during the sequestration stage and 11 6 mwe yearly electricity production from co2 circulation the stored co2 is 0 436 0 133 mtons during the sequestration stage we also examine the influence of economic factors on the profitability of the proposed system and show that the net co2 storage income is the economic variable that most affects the risk of non profitability followed in second place by the rate of return on investment we demonstrated that government support through either or both lower interest rate loans and higher co2 storage credits has a pronounced effect on the profitability of the proposed cpg system limitations of this study include the assumption of a homogeneous formation and perfectly closed boundary conditions future studies may consider heterogeneous reservoirs and leaky confining units in uncertainty based so credit authorship
