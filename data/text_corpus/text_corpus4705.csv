23525,oscillating water column devices are the most widespread among wave energy converters with an efficiency that is closely related to the performance of its power take off element usually a turbine using unidirectional turbines requires a system of valves to rectify the bidirectional flow so self rectifying turbines are more convenient for an owc device another recent proposal is the use of a twin turbine configuration where an arrangement of two unidirectional turbines could perform this task with each turbine extracting the flow energy alternately to date all the twin turbine configurations studied in the open literature consider unidirectional axial turbines in this paper the use of a radial turbine to improve the system s efficiency by enhancing flow rectification is presented for the first time an experimentally validated numerical model has been used to analyse the flow field of the radial turbine when working in both direct and reverse modes interesting conclusions are extracted finally a performance comparison of the twin turbine configuration using axial or radial turbines has been carried out it is concluded that the good performance of the radial

being made within the wave energy field worldwide many researchers have the potential of this kind of renewable energy in their sights so the presentation of new devices or improvements to old ones often appear in technical literature one of the most promising wave energy concepts is the so called oscillating water column owc see fig 1 top it was one of the first solutions to be developed falcão 2010 and it has currently achieved a significant level of maturity with several projects even reaching a commercial scale falcão 2010 torre enciso et al 2009 this kind of device can be placed on the shoreline near the shore and even offshore although most prototypes are placed onshore because this makes their installation and maintenance easier an interesting review about owc performance from an historical perspective and a complete list of references can be found in falcão and henriques 2016 essentially owc power plants are based on a simple working principle a concrete or steel structure is semi submerged in the sea and opened at the bottom so the water free surface is displaced as a piston inside the structure according to the wave period as a consequence the air contained in the top of the structure is compressed decompressed and pushed outwards aspirated inwards generating a bidirectional air flow which is used to drive a power take off pto the energy conversion from wave to pneumatic is made by the structure and the pneumatic energy is then turned into mechanical energy by means of a pto element typically a turbine to take full advantage of the characteristics of the two way flow generated by the owc the pto element should have some special features in the early years a valve rectification system was used to drive a unidirectional axial turbine maeda et al 2001 setoguchi and takao 2006 however the valve system would lead to maintenance and operational problems two alternatives were suggested to avoid the use of valves self rectifying turbines have been the most popular solution for the pto element in owc converters over the last decades there are several types of these turbines and most of them can be classified in two categories wells turbines raghunathan 1995 wells 1980 and impulse turbines which can be radial pereiras et al 2011b setoguchi et al 2002 or axial babintsev 1975 maeda et al 1999 whatever the case self rectifying turbines have relatively poor efficiency except those equipped with adjustable blades guide vanes curran et al 2000 falcão and gato 2012 setoguchi and takao 2006 unfortunately the use of turbines with moving elements would possibly lead to additional problems in the maintenance of these facilities more information about air turbines for owc systems can be found in falcão and gato 2012 a a twin turbine system was proposed in jayashankar et al 2009 mala et al 2011 this configuration develops the rectification concept with the use of a couple of turbines instead of control valves as backflow preventers recently a third possibility has emerged due to its promising results b a new concept of turbine equipped with rectifying valve presented in falcão et al 2015 the original idea using rectifying valves is reconsidered by means of a sliding valve in combination with a finger manifold to drive the flow the preliminary results are encouraging but the performance of this valve has yet to be tested in tough conditions evidently the lack of moving parts and valves in the second option makes this possibility the most attractive in terms of maintenance costs the twin turbine system is based on the use of two turbines one of them working normally direct mode outflow while the other is working as a backflow preventer reverse mode inflow a sketch of this system is shown in fig 1 basically the air from the chamber is pushed towards the atmosphere in an exhalation process so the flow generated passes through the turbines one of the turbines is working normally in direct mode producing energy whereas the other is working in reverse mode not producing energy once the exhalation process is over inhalation starts the air is sucked from the atmosphere to the chamber with the result that the turbines alternate their roles note that the flow rate distribution between the turbines which are working under the same pressure difference chamber ambient is determined by the performance curve of the turbine which is different for both modes the twin system permits the use of unidirectional turbines which are more efficient than self rectifying ones in fact all the proposals found in the open literature are considering axial turbines takao and setoguchi 2012 although it has been shown pereiras et al 2014 that flow leakage through the turbine working in reverse mode is around 30 of the total flow generated by the owc this important loss of energy hinders the total efficiency of the system due not only to the flow rate through the turbine which is not producing energy but also to the braking torque exerted on that turbine pereiras et al 2014 a fluidic diode is discussed in dudhgaonkar et al 2011 as a possible solution to minimize the reversed flow increasing flow blockage although results combining the diode with the twin turbines are not presented in the present work a comparison of the performance of radial turbines with respect to axial turbines for twin turbine configurations is presented previous studies of self rectifying turbines pereiras et al 2011b reveal that radial turbines show an interesting feature for the twin turbine system the greater pressure drop generated predicts a significant improvement when operated as backflow preventers thus providing a minimum energy loss through the turbine working in reverse mode to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first time that radial turbines have been proposed for use on twin systems for owc converters the performance curve of the radial turbine is required for a comparison to be made with the axial turbine for this purpose a centrifugal turbine has been designed and its performance has been assessed by means of a cfd simulation using the commercial code ansys fluent the model has been validated and shows a good degree of congruence with the experimental results obtained in a test campaign the performance of the turbine working in both direct and reverse modes has been evaluated with special attention being paid to that obtained in reverse mode which was key when selecting a centrifugal turbine instead of a centripetal one finally a numerical estimation of the performance of the whole twin system has been carried out the following sections describe in detail the twin system concept with radial turbines first of all in section two this brand new design is presented to the readers with sound arguments that justify this particular choice next details of the construction and testing of an experimental model are given subsequently the numerical model is fully described the results are shown in section three starting with the cfd model validation by means of the turbine performance curves later a more thorough analysis of the flow pattern is conducted to find the strong and or weak points of the design chosen finally some conclusions are presented in section four 2 experimental tests and numerical model in this section the authors describe the main points related to the experimental tests carried out and the characteristics of the numerical model used in the cfd simulations the turbine for the study has been designed as a centrifugal direct mode rather than centripetal reverse mode rotor in order to reinforce its performance as a backflow preventer previous studies of radial turbines for owc pereiras et al 2011a 2011b reveal that even in a turbine equipped with guide vanes a strong swirling appears in the elbow during centripetal performance when performing off of the best efficiency it should be noted that unlike traditional centripetal turbines the flow rate across owc turbines is highly variable with a very large operational range and as a consequence the flow angle at the rotor outlet is also continuously changing over time between a wide range of values this inherent characteristic in the performance of owc turbines led the authors to consider the use of a radial turbine as a perfect candidate in twin turbine configurations taking advantage of this feature to optimize the reverse mode in line with the idea of reinforcing the reverse mode and in spite of reducing the efficiency in direct mode the turbine is composed of a single blade row so there are no guide vanes upstream or downstream of the rotor the inner guide vanes have been suppressed in order to maximize the swirl generated in centripetal performance reverse mode on the other hand their suppression generates a large incidence loss at the rotor inlet during centrifugal performance direct mode which is minimized by adjusting the inner angle of the blade including outer guide vanes downstream of the rotor in centrifugal performance to work as a diffuser would increase maximum efficiency in direct mode however it is also known that off of the best efficiency point outer fixed guide vanes are an important source of incidence loss in centrifugal performance pereiras et al 2011b moreover the presence of outer guide vanes would facilitate the flow to enter the rotor centripetally reverse mode which it is completely undesirable if the flow blockage is to be strengthened as a result outer guide vanes were not included in the design in the absence of guide vanes blade design was conducted by means of one dimensional theory for turbomachines dixon and hall 2005 several blade profiles were analyzed by 2 d simulations with the ansys fluent code finally a 3 d numerical model of the turbine was developed with the selected blade profile it is appropriate to underline that the design is focused on strengthening blockage in reverse mode even if that means a reduction of efficiency in direct mode because this can make the difference with respect to axial turbines for twin systems 2 1 experimental tests a full 3 d turbine prototype was built according to the scheme shown in fig 2 in a 3 d printer bq witbox with a maximum capacity of 297 210 200 mm3 and maximum resolution of 50 μm the rotor fig 2 top made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs is shrouded by a ring glued at the tip of the blades in order to reduce the tip flow effect the connection of the rotor to the two piece axial tube and the outer diffuser of the turbine was also made in the 3 d printer using polylactic acid pla instead all the components are supported by a central axis fig 2 bottom made of aluminum in a cnc machine the use of pla for printing complex pieces in such experimental facilities is highly recommended due to its high degree of finish and ruggedness alternatively abs can also be used to print out but it is strongly recommended to use a 3 d printer with a heated plate the inner and outer diameters of the radial turbine are 150 and 258 4 mm respectively with a 24 4 mm span for the blades the turbine is composed of 30 blades with inner and outer blade angles of 135 and 175 with respect to tangential direction i e a deflection of 40 deg the turbine is mounted in a test rig as is shown in fig 3 flow is generated by a centrifugal fan of 0 75 kw soler palau cbt 100n flow rate was measured with a venturi meter with pressure taps connected to a differential manometer information regarding the measuring equipment is shown in table 1 turbine input power is determined by the flow rate measured through the venturi tube and the pressure difference between the turbine inlet and the atmosphere assessment of output power was performed by a tachogenerator precilec radio energie re 0444 n1s 006 eg as follows first of all electrical loss was assessed according to the data given by the manufacturer applying the classical theory of electric machines next in order to find a correlation between input power and rotation speed the tachogenerator was tested alone in motor mode at different constant speeds and unloaded by discounting previously assessed electrical loss from the measured input power the mechanical loss of the tachogenerator is found the second step was to assess turbine mechanical loss therefore the turbine was coupled to the tachogenerator to carry out tests at different constant speeds with the tachogenerator running in motor mode both total electrical and mechanical tachogenerator loss was discounted from electrical input power by which mechanical turbine loss was obtained from these tests a correlation was established between turbine mechanical loss and rotation speed final tests were carried out to determine turbine output power the turbine decoupled from the generator was installed in the experimental rig where the fan conducted by a variable frequency drive can supply different flow rates the unloaded turbine is allowed to rotate freely until reaching steady rotation speed the value of which depends on the flow rate since the rotation speed is constant the torque exerted by the flow is equal to turbine mechanical loss which can be assessed by the relation between loss and rotation speed from the previous tests 2 2 numerical model flow simulation is solved with fluent v12 which employs the finite volume numerical method fvm to solve the navier stokes equations by using a segregated solver in order to reduce computational costs simulations were carried out in a periodic domain fig 4 the mesh consists of 2 106 hexaedrical cells with special refinements towards the blade surfaces and was built in gambit 2 4 density was assumed to be constant 1 2 kg m3 once the simulations were over it was checked that mach number was below 0 3 in the whole domain since the computational geometry includes rotating domains ω 500 rpm the sliding mesh technique smm was used to control the relative motion of the rotor in a purely unsteady fashion therefore two interfaces were placed upstream and downstream of the rotor fig 4 although smm was not needed due to the lack of guide vanes it was in fact used because the model was simulated in batch with other geometries which had guide vanes included the realizable k ε turbulence model already validated in previous works pereiras et al 2011a thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 was used for the turbulent closure of the numerical model in addition a non equilibrium wall function approach was adopted so special care was employed in the walls to obtain y values in the corrected range the time dependent term is approximated with a second order implicit scheme the pressure velocity coupling was recreated through the simple algorithm the high order monotone upwind scheme for conservation laws muscl was used for convection term discretization and the classical central difference approximation for diffusion terms the time step was set to 10 4 s resulting in 40 time steps per blade passing period the residuals were set to 10 5 and convergence was achieved after approximately 20 iterations per time step for all the resolved equations six full annulus rotations of the periodical domain were simulated to reach global convergence with approximately 4 h of cpu time per flow rate the simulations were made in a cluster of 4 units with the following characteristics intel i5 2 67 ghz 2 2 gb ram the simulations were performed on the assumption that the turbine rotated unsteadily but under quasi steady flow conditions this assumption is perfectly justified on account of the reduced frequency of the turbine the ratio between the blade passing period and the period of the wave cycle which turns out to be 103 therefore the boundary conditions flow rate and rotational speed remain constant in each simulation although the numerical model is resolved unsteadily since the relative position of the rotor varies with time the performance of the turbine for other through flow conditions is obtained by adjusting the flow rate with the modification of the inlet boundary condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation and general performance the usual non dimensional coefficients are represented below to show the performance of the radial turbine specifically the power and input coefficients c p and c h as well as the flow coefficient ϕ together with aerodynamic efficiency are defined as 1 c p t o ω ρ ω 3 d 5 c h δ p ρ ω 2 d 2 ϕ q a r u r η t o ω δ p q here ρ is the air density t o the mechanical torque δp the total to static pressure difference q the flow rate r r the blade mid chord radius d 2 r r a r the cross flow area at r r and u r is the blade speed at r r efficiency which is the ratio of shaft power output to pneumatic power input can be expressed in terms of the coefficients mentioned above taking into account the data from table 1 and following the classical formulation for uncertainty analysis combined maximum uncertainty is 18 for the input coefficient 5 for the flow coefficient and 8 for the power coefficient these values are attained for maximum flow rates but are reduced to 2 in the case of low flow rates the performance of the turbine under steady flow conditions and for different flow coefficients is shown in fig 5 positive flow coefficients correspond to direct mode while negative values occur for the turbine working in reverse mode the results of the numerical model in direct mode ϕ 0 are compared with the experimental tests made to validate the model in addition results for an axial turbine pereiras et al 2014 have also been included for comparison the numerical power coefficient matches perfectly with the experimental results for the whole range of positive flow coefficients also the development of the input coefficient is accurate with a discrepancy lower than 10 for the highest flow rates only note that this difference is below the maximum experimental uncertainty previously mentioned finally numerical efficiency confirms the excellent agreement with the results in the lab tests validating the numerical model and allowing an in depth analysis of the cfd flow patterns fig 5 bottom plot also reveals the main drawback of the radial turbine for this application its lower efficiency with respect to the axial turbine in effect previous studies of axial turbines for owc report twin systems achieving stationary efficiencies of up to 20 higher pereiras et al 2014 takao and setoguchi 2012 however the radial turbine would become competitive due to the extreme difference in the input coefficient between direct and reverse modes the axial turbine fig 5 top plot exhibits a quite symmetrical distribution of the c h for both positive and negative flow coefficients whereas the radial turbine is more likely to impede the reverse flow because of its higher slope in the c h for negative flow rates this will be translated into a marginal loss of kinetic energy through the radial turbine much lower than in the case of the axial turbine with the result that the radial turbine will perform better as a backflow preventer than the latter more information on this is provided below in addition it must be appreciated that the braking torque for the reverse mode of the turbine is undesirable and this negative torque is greater in the radial turbine however because of the superior performance of the radial turbine as a backflow preventer both flow rate and torque will be much smaller than those produced in the axial turbine 3 2 flow pattern in this section the flow patterns in the radial turbine are analyzed in terms of pressure loss and change of momentum flow angles in the rotor the reference angles and velocity relationships are shown in fig 6 for both direct centrifugal and reverse centripetal modes where α and β represent the angles of absolute and relative flow velocities with respect to the tangential coordinate and β is the geometrical blade angle to complete the analysis of system losses the turbine geometry has been divided into three different parts elbow rotor and diffuser fig 7 kinetic energy has also been taken into account because of its importance as is clearly shown in forthcoming figures note that energy loss is calculated as the total to total pressure difference in terms of every element taking as references the divisions shown in fig 7 hence dynamic pressure at the outlet a in reverse mode and d in direct mode is considered as kinetic energy loss the loss distribution among the different elements of the turbine are shown in fig 8 for direct mode here the contributions of the elbow rotor external diffuser as identified in fig 2 and kinetic energy loss at the outlet are addressed separately it is clear that the rotor accounts for the greater part of the loss for low flow coefficients which is mainly the result of the incidence of the flow the difference between the flow and blade angles at the inlet is shown in fig 9 revealing large incidence losses at the blade leading edge which leads to a critical drop in efficiency when ϕ 1 also it can be observed that the entire turbine has its top efficiency point around ϕ 0 7 which does not exactly correspond to the maximum point of efficiency of the rotor though not shown here it is found to be around ϕ 1 this fact reveals that the diffuser has a critical role in the machine s efficiency especially at large flow coefficients in addition fig 8 illustrates how kinetic energy loss at the outlet increases sharply with the flow rate following a typical parabolic development the rise in kinetic energy loss at the outlet is related not only to the flow rate but is also conditioned by the high values of tangential velocity at the rotor outlet fig 10 indicates that the absolute flow angle is abruptly reduced for flow coefficients higher than 0 3 which leads to a strong tangential component and extremely high values of kinetic energies at the outlet consequently this residual kinetic energy is the main source of loss at a high flow coefficient and is even more important than incidence losses at the rotor they are reduced for large flow coefficients fig 9 furthermore the contribution of loss in the diffuser is only important for flow rates below ϕ 0 5 its relative significance being practically constant for the whole range of large flow rates while losses at the elbow are practically negligible in summary kinetic energy at the outlet is a critical factor that penalizes the efficiency of the radial turbine in direct mode future designs of radial turbines for owc converters must take particular care with this residual energy to increase efficiencies loss distribution is shown for reverse mode in fig 11 in this case air flows through the turbine in the centripetal direction emanating from the diffuser and passing through the rotor and elbow to discharge into the inner duct fig 11 is probably the most important figure in this study because it shows why this kind of turbine might deserve further analysis unlike axial turbines for twin systems where losses are mainly concentrated in the rotor due to the large incidence flow angles pereiras et al 2014 the main source of loss in the radial version is the elbow the rotor also displays significant losses approximately 25 for all the flow rates in fig 11 on account of the large incidence angle at the inlet in reverse mode fig 12 however as the flow leaves the rotor with a large tangential velocity see fig 13 a strong swirling effect takes place and a large amount of loss is generated at the elbow the large flow blockage caused by the elbow in this centripetal mode demonstrates the appropriateness of employing a radial turbine with a centrifugal direct mode instead of a traditional centripetal francis turbine moreover as a result of the large outlet section both energy losses at the outlet are negligible similarly losses at the diffuser are negligible because in reverse mode the incoming flow direction is centripetal 3 3 non steady performance once the analysis of the flow pattern inside the turbine has been completed it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the whole system in non stationary conditions this is achieved by coupling overall turbine performance the curves shown in fig 5 with the behavior of the owc converter for this purpose it has been assumed that the flow rate generated by the owc device is a sinusoidal function of time pereiras et al 2014 takao et al 2011 according to which 2 q t o t a l q m a x sin 2 π t t 3 ω ω 1 ω 2 4 q t o t a l q d i r e c t q r e v e r s e 5 δ p δ p 1 δ p 2 6 φ q m a x a r u r here q total q max t and t represent the total flow rate throughout the whole system the amplitude of the q total time and the period of the owc motion q is the flow rate through a turbine and subscripts direct and reverse denote the performance mode of the turbine ω and δp are the rotation velocity and drop in pressure both being equal for the two turbines of the twin turbines system φ represents the dimension less form of the flow coefficient amplitude for the whole system including both direct and reverse flows note that this non steady analysis is made using a total to static pressure drop between the inlet and outlet sections of the turbine p t o t a l i n p s t a t i c o u t rather than the total pressure differences the authors used in previous studies pereiras et al 2014 therefore kinetic energy losses at the outlet are taken into account the performance of owc turbines is commonly considered quasi steady when working on an owc converter inoue et al 1988 setoguchi and takao 2006 takao et al 2011 this reasonable assumption permits a non steady comparison between turbines based on steady performance data after the previous resolution of the equation system 2 to 5 using the performance curve of the radial turbines it is possible to represent the periodic behavior of the flow rate as well as other variables of interest in fig 14 both sinusoidal distributions of the instantaneous flow rate for both turbines in direct and reverse modes are compared with the total flow rate in the chamber the flow rates are made non dimensional with the maximum flow rate in the owc system q max and the time is divided by the wave period in addition volumetric efficiency defined as η vol q direct q total is plotted for both axial and radial turbines since the η v o l r a d i a l is over 70 less than 30 of the flow generated by the owc escapes through the turbine working in reverse mode this is lower than the flow leakage produced in a twin turbine equipped with axial turbines which reaches values up to 42 it is important to underline as was mentioned before that this leakage is not only untapped energy note that larger flow rates through turbines in reverse modes imply larger breaking torques fig 5 evaluation of the system s performance is in terms of the mean efficiency which is defined as 7 η s y s t e m 1 t 0 t ω t t o t a l d t 1 t 0 t δ p t q t o t a l d t 1 t 0 t δ p t q d i r e c t d t 1 t 0 t δ p t q t o t a l d t η input 1 t 0 t ω t direct t reverse dt 1 t 0 t δ p t q direct dt η tg where t total is the total torque on the electricity generator therefore 8 η s y s t e m η i n p u t η t g mean input efficiency η i n p u t is a parameter closely related to the volumetric efficiency of the system fig 14 whereas twin turbines efficiency η t g is the efficiency of the twin turbine group calculated with regard to the flow rate which is supposed to produce energy q direct there are references takao et al 2011 where the η t g is calculated by not taking into account the torque of the turbine in reverse mode despite the fact that the flow through the turbine in reverse mode is being considered this common hypothesis is a reasonable assumption if the turbine running in reverse mode is disconnected from the rotating axis with some disrupting element in this study and in order to be conservative the torque in reverse mode has been preserved in the definition figure 15 shows the different efficiencies for the twin turbine configuration for both radial and axial turbines the results show that maximum total efficiency of the system η s y s t e m is 24 in the case of the radial turbine as expected the axial turbine using performance data from takao et al 2011 has a significantly higher value reaching 34 at φ 1 solid green line if only efficiency of the turbines is considered the superior performance of the axial machine is demonstrated with enhancement of η t g by up to 20 in the case of axial turbines however the strong feature of the radial turbines is the remarkable η i n p u t close to 80 for the optimal range of flow coefficients around φ 1 4 therefore the poor efficiency of the radial turbine in direct mode is significantly balanced by a superior performance in reverse flow conditions consequently radial turbines can be an interesting option for an owc device with a twin turbine configuration provided that more developments are carried out with regard to turbine blades this would increase the efficiency of the turbine itself with the current design the difference in η t g is still excessively favorable for axial turbines bridging this gap the greater volumetric efficiency of the radial turbines combined with the sharp reduction in flow leaking through the reverse mode turbine may be key factors to justify the development of a new generation of twin turbine prototypes with radial architecture 4 conclusions this paper studies the performance of owc devices based on a twin turbine configuration with radial turbines to the best of the authors knowledge the use of a radial turbine to enhance flow rectification in twin turbine systems is presented for the first time in the open literature firstly a cfd model of the radial turbine has been validated and employed to assess turbine performance in both modes of operation direct centrifugal and reverse centripetal it is shown that the large pressure drop generated in reverse mode implies enhanced exploitation of the energy produced by the owc because only a reduced part of the total flow rate leaks through the turbine working in reverse mode despite of the lower efficiencies found in radial turbines their improved performance as backflow preventers in comparison with axial machines makes radial turbines a promising option for being installed in twin turbines systems to be fully competitive the major challenge is to close the gap in the performance of radial turbines for direct mode in particular a greater effort regarding design is needed to reduce the large kinetic energy loss of radial turbines at the outlet an improvement in the blade profiles combined with a reduction in flow deflection could reduce this detrimental effect and improve efficiency in direct mode alternatively performance in reverse mode could be preserved because the main amount of loss namely the swirl at the elbow is not dependent on the blade s external angle in summary although much work is still required to improve the performance of radial turbines in centrifugal operation this research demonstrates that radial turbines can be a suitable option for use in twin turbine configurations for owc power plants acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support provided by centro integrado de f p mantenimiento y servicios a la producción de

performance curve of the turbine which is different for both modes the twin system permits the use of unidirectional turbines which are more efficient than self rectifying ones in fact all the proposals found in the open literature are considering axial turbines takao and setoguchi 2012 although it has been shown pereiras et al 2014 that flow leakage through the turbine working in reverse mode is around 30 of the total flow generated by the owc this important loss of energy hinders the total efficiency of the system due not only to the flow rate through the turbine which is not producing energy but also to the braking torque exerted on that turbine pereiras et al 2014 a fluidic diode is discussed in dudhgaonkar et al 2011 as a possible solution to minimize the reversed flow increasing flow blockage although results combining the diode with the twin turbines are not presented in the present work a comparison of the performance of radial turbines with respect to axial turbines for twin turbine configurations is presented previous studies of self rectifying turbines pereiras et al 2011b reveal that radial turbines show an interesting feature for the twin turbine system the greater pressure drop generated predicts a significant improvement when operated as backflow preventers thus providing a minimum energy loss through the turbine working in reverse mode to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first time that radial turbines have been proposed for use on twin systems for owc converters the performance curve of the radial turbine is required for a comparison to be made with the axial turbine for this purpose a centrifugal turbine has been designed and its performance has been assessed by means of a cfd simulation using the commercial code ansys fluent the model has been validated and shows a good degree of congruence with the experimental results obtained in a test campaign the performance of the turbine working in both direct and reverse modes has been evaluated with special attention being paid to that obtained in reverse mode which was key when selecting a centrifugal turbine instead of a centripetal one finally a numerical estimation of the performance of the whole twin system has been carried out the following sections describe in detail the twin system concept with radial turbines first of all in section two this brand new design is presented to the readers with sound arguments that justify this particular choice next details of the construction and testing of an experimental model are given subsequently the numerical model is fully described the results are shown in section three starting with the cfd model validation by means of the turbine performance curves later a more thorough analysis of the flow pattern is conducted to find the strong and or weak points of the design chosen finally some conclusions are presented in section four 2 experimental tests and numerical model in this section the authors describe the main points related to the experimental tests carried out and the characteristics of the numerical model used in the cfd simulations the turbine for the study has been designed as a centrifugal direct mode rather than centripetal reverse mode rotor in order to reinforce its performance as a backflow preventer previous studies of radial turbines for owc pereiras et al 2011a 2011b reveal that even in a turbine equipped with guide vanes a strong swirling appears in the elbow during centripetal performance when performing off of the best efficiency it should be noted that unlike traditional centripetal turbines the flow rate across owc turbines is highly variable with a very large operational range and as a consequence the flow angle at the rotor outlet is also continuously changing over time between a wide range of values this inherent characteristic in the performance of owc turbines led the authors to consider the use of a radial turbine as a perfect candidate in twin turbine configurations taking advantage of this feature to optimize the reverse mode in line with the idea of reinforcing the reverse mode and in spite of reducing the efficiency in direct mode the turbine is composed of a single blade row so there are no guide vanes upstream or downstream of the rotor the inner guide vanes have been suppressed in order to maximize the swirl generated in centripetal performance reverse mode on the other hand their suppression generates a large incidence loss at the rotor inlet during centrifugal performance direct mode which is minimized by adjusting the inner angle of the blade including outer guide vanes downstream of the rotor in centrifugal performance to work as a diffuser would increase maximum efficiency in direct mode however it is also known that off of the best efficiency point outer fixed guide vanes are an important source of incidence loss in centrifugal performance pereiras et al 2011b moreover the presence of outer guide vanes would facilitate the flow to enter the rotor centripetally reverse mode which it is completely undesirable if the flow blockage is to be strengthened as a result outer guide vanes were not included in the design in the absence of guide vanes blade design was conducted by means of one dimensional theory for turbomachines dixon and hall 2005 several blade profiles were analyzed by 2 d simulations with the ansys fluent code finally a 3 d numerical model of the turbine was developed with the selected blade profile it is appropriate to underline that the design is focused on strengthening blockage in reverse mode even if that means a reduction of efficiency in direct mode because this can make the difference with respect to axial turbines for twin systems 2 1 experimental tests a full 3 d turbine prototype was built according to the scheme shown in fig 2 in a 3 d printer bq witbox with a maximum capacity of 297 210 200 mm3 and maximum resolution of 50 μm the rotor fig 2 top made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs is shrouded by a ring glued at the tip of the blades in order to reduce the tip flow effect the connection of the rotor to the two piece axial tube and the outer diffuser of the turbine was also made in the 3 d printer using polylactic acid pla instead all the components are supported by a central axis fig 2 bottom made of aluminum in a cnc machine the use of pla for printing complex pieces in such experimental facilities is highly recommended due to its high degree of finish and ruggedness alternatively abs can also be used to print out but it is strongly recommended to use a 3 d printer with a heated plate the inner and outer diameters of the radial turbine are 150 and 258 4 mm respectively with a 24 4 mm span for the blades the turbine is composed of 30 blades with inner and outer blade angles of 135 and 175 with respect to tangential direction i e a deflection of 40 deg the turbine is mounted in a test rig as is shown in fig 3 flow is generated by a centrifugal fan of 0 75 kw soler palau cbt 100n flow rate was measured with a venturi meter with pressure taps connected to a differential manometer information regarding the measuring equipment is shown in table 1 turbine input power is determined by the flow rate measured through the venturi tube and the pressure difference between the turbine inlet and the atmosphere assessment of output power was performed by a tachogenerator precilec radio energie re 0444 n1s 006 eg as follows first of all electrical loss was assessed according to the data given by the manufacturer applying the classical theory of electric machines next in order to find a correlation between input power and rotation speed the tachogenerator was tested alone in motor mode at different constant speeds and unloaded by discounting previously assessed electrical loss from the measured input power the mechanical loss of the tachogenerator is found the second step was to assess turbine mechanical loss therefore the turbine was coupled to the tachogenerator to carry out tests at different constant speeds with the tachogenerator running in motor mode both total electrical and mechanical tachogenerator loss was discounted from electrical input power by which mechanical turbine loss was obtained from these tests a correlation was established between turbine mechanical loss and rotation speed final tests were carried out to determine turbine output power the turbine decoupled from the generator was installed in the experimental rig where the fan conducted by a variable frequency drive can supply different flow rates the unloaded turbine is allowed to rotate freely until reaching steady rotation speed the value of which depends on the flow rate since the rotation speed is constant the torque exerted by the flow is equal to turbine mechanical loss which can be assessed by the relation between loss and rotation speed from the previous tests 2 2 numerical model flow simulation is solved with fluent v12 which employs the finite volume numerical method fvm to solve the navier stokes equations by using a segregated solver in order to reduce computational costs simulations were carried out in a periodic domain fig 4 the mesh consists of 2 106 hexaedrical cells with special refinements towards the blade surfaces and was built in gambit 2 4 density was assumed to be constant 1 2 kg m3 once the simulations were over it was checked that mach number was below 0 3 in the whole domain since the computational geometry includes rotating domains ω 500 rpm the sliding mesh technique smm was used to control the relative motion of the rotor in a purely unsteady fashion therefore two interfaces were placed upstream and downstream of the rotor fig 4 although smm was not needed due to the lack of guide vanes it was in fact used because the model was simulated in batch with other geometries which had guide vanes included the realizable k ε turbulence model already validated in previous works pereiras et al 2011a thakker and dhanasekaran 2005 was used for the turbulent closure of the numerical model in addition a non equilibrium wall function approach was adopted so special care was employed in the walls to obtain y values in the corrected range the time dependent term is approximated with a second order implicit scheme the pressure velocity coupling was recreated through the simple algorithm the high order monotone upwind scheme for conservation laws muscl was used for convection term discretization and the classical central difference approximation for diffusion terms the time step was set to 10 4 s resulting in 40 time steps per blade passing period the residuals were set to 10 5 and convergence was achieved after approximately 20 iterations per time step for all the resolved equations six full annulus rotations of the periodical domain were simulated to reach global convergence with approximately 4 h of cpu time per flow rate the simulations were made in a cluster of 4 units with the following characteristics intel i5 2 67 ghz 2 2 gb ram the simulations were performed on the assumption that the turbine rotated unsteadily but under quasi steady flow conditions this assumption is perfectly justified on account of the reduced frequency of the turbine the ratio between the blade passing period and the period of the wave cycle which turns out to be 103 therefore the boundary conditions flow rate and rotational speed remain constant in each simulation although the numerical model is resolved unsteadily since the relative position of the rotor varies with time the performance of the turbine for other through flow conditions is obtained by adjusting the flow rate with the modification of the inlet boundary condition 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation and general performance the usual non dimensional coefficients are represented below to show the performance of the radial turbine specifically the power and input coefficients c p and c h as well as the flow coefficient ϕ together with aerodynamic efficiency are defined as 1 c p t o ω ρ ω 3 d 5 c h δ p ρ ω 2 d 2 ϕ q a r u r η t o ω δ p q here ρ is the air density t o the mechanical torque δp the total to static pressure difference q the flow rate r r the blade mid chord radius d 2 r r a r the cross flow area at r r and u r is the blade speed at r r efficiency which is the ratio of shaft power output to pneumatic power input can be expressed in terms of the coefficients mentioned above taking into account the data from table 1 and following the classical formulation for uncertainty analysis combined maximum uncertainty is 18 for the input coefficient 5 for the flow coefficient and 8 for the power coefficient these values are attained for maximum flow rates but are reduced to 2 in the case of low flow rates the performance of the turbine under steady flow conditions and for different flow coefficients is shown in fig 5 positive flow coefficients correspond to direct mode while negative values occur for the turbine working in reverse mode the results of the numerical model in direct mode ϕ 0 are compared with the experimental tests made to validate the model in addition results for an axial turbine pereiras et al 2014 have also been included for comparison the numerical power coefficient matches perfectly with the experimental results for the whole range of positive flow coefficients also the development of the input coefficient is accurate with a discrepancy lower than 10 for the highest flow rates only note that this difference is below the maximum experimental uncertainty previously mentioned finally numerical efficiency confirms the excellent agreement with the results in the lab tests validating the numerical model and allowing an in depth analysis of the cfd flow patterns fig 5 bottom plot also reveals the main drawback of the radial turbine for this application its lower efficiency with respect to the axial turbine in effect previous studies of axial turbines for owc report twin systems achieving stationary efficiencies of up to 20 higher pereiras et al 2014 takao and setoguchi 2012 however the radial turbine would become competitive due to the extreme difference in the input coefficient between direct and reverse modes the axial turbine fig 5 top plot exhibits a quite symmetrical distribution of the c h for both positive and negative flow coefficients whereas the radial turbine is more likely to impede the reverse flow because of its higher slope in the c h for negative flow rates this will be translated into a marginal loss of kinetic energy through the radial turbine much lower than in the case of the axial turbine with the result that the radial turbine will perform better as a backflow preventer than the latter more information on this is provided below in addition it must be appreciated that the braking torque for the reverse mode of the turbine is undesirable and this negative torque is greater in the radial turbine however because of the superior performance of the radial turbine as a backflow preventer both flow rate and torque will be much smaller than those produced in the axial turbine 3 2 flow pattern in this section the flow patterns in the radial turbine are analyzed in terms of pressure loss and change of momentum flow angles in the rotor the reference angles and velocity relationships are shown in fig 6 for both direct centrifugal and reverse centripetal modes where α and β represent the angles of absolute and relative flow velocities with respect to the tangential coordinate and β is the geometrical blade angle to complete the analysis of system losses the turbine geometry has been divided into three different parts elbow rotor and diffuser fig 7 kinetic energy has also been taken into account because of its importance as is clearly shown in forthcoming figures note that energy loss is calculated as the total to total pressure difference in terms of every element taking as references the divisions shown in fig 7 hence dynamic pressure at the outlet a in reverse mode and d in direct mode is considered as kinetic energy loss the loss distribution among the different elements of the turbine are shown in fig 8 for direct mode here the contributions of the elbow rotor external diffuser as identified in fig 2 and kinetic energy loss at the outlet are addressed separately it is clear that the rotor accounts for the greater part of the loss for low flow coefficients which is mainly the result of the incidence of the flow the difference between the flow and blade angles at the inlet is shown in fig 9 revealing large incidence losses at the blade leading edge which leads to a critical drop in efficiency when ϕ 1 also it can be observed that the entire turbine has its top efficiency point around ϕ 0 7 which does not exactly correspond to the maximum point of efficiency of the rotor though not shown here it is found to be around ϕ 1 this fact reveals that the diffuser has a critical role in the machine s efficiency especially at large flow coefficients in addition fig 8 illustrates how kinetic energy loss at the outlet increases sharply with the flow rate following a typical parabolic development the rise in kinetic energy loss at the outlet is related not only to the flow rate but is also conditioned by the high values of tangential velocity at the rotor outlet fig 10 indicates that the absolute flow angle is abruptly reduced for flow coefficients higher than 0 3 which leads to a strong tangential component and extremely high values of kinetic energies at the outlet consequently this residual kinetic energy is the main source of loss at a high flow coefficient and is even more important than incidence losses at the rotor they are reduced for large flow coefficients fig 9 furthermore the contribution of loss in the diffuser is only important for flow rates below ϕ 0 5 its relative significance being practically constant for the whole range of large flow rates while losses at the elbow are practically negligible in summary kinetic energy at the outlet is a critical factor that penalizes the efficiency of the radial turbine in direct mode future designs of radial turbines for owc converters must take particular care with this residual energy to increase efficiencies loss distribution is shown for reverse mode in fig 11 in this case air flows through the turbine in the centripetal direction emanating from the diffuser and passing through the rotor and elbow to discharge into the inner duct fig 11 is probably the most important figure in this study because it shows why this kind of turbine might deserve further analysis unlike axial turbines for twin systems where losses are mainly concentrated in the rotor due to the large incidence flow angles pereiras et al 2014 the main source of loss in the radial version is the elbow the rotor also displays significant losses approximately 25 for all the flow rates in fig 11 on account of the large incidence angle at the inlet in reverse mode fig 12 however as the flow leaves the rotor with a large tangential velocity see fig 13 a strong swirling effect takes place and a large amount of loss is generated at the elbow the large flow blockage caused by the elbow in this centripetal mode demonstrates the appropriateness of employing a radial turbine with a centrifugal direct mode instead of a traditional centripetal francis turbine moreover as a result of the large outlet section both energy losses at the outlet are negligible similarly losses at the diffuser are negligible because in reverse mode the incoming flow direction is centripetal 3 3 non steady performance once the analysis of the flow pattern inside the turbine has been completed it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the whole system in non stationary conditions this is achieved by coupling overall turbine performance the curves shown in fig 5 with the behavior of the owc converter for this purpose it has been assumed that the flow rate generated by the owc device is a sinusoidal function of time pereiras et al 2014 takao et al 2011 according to which 2 q t o t a l q m a x sin 2 π t t 3 ω ω 1 ω 2 4 q t o t a l q d i r e c t q r e v e r s e 5 δ p δ p 1 δ p 2 6 φ q m a x a r u r here q total q max t and t represent the total flow rate throughout the whole system the amplitude of the q total time and the period of the owc motion q is the flow rate through a turbine and subscripts direct and reverse denote the performance mode of the turbine ω and δp are the rotation velocity and drop in pressure both being equal for the two turbines of the twin turbines system φ represents the dimension less form of the flow coefficient amplitude for the whole system including both direct and reverse flows note that this non steady analysis is made using a total to static pressure drop between the inlet and outlet sections of the turbine p t o t a l i n p s t a t i c o u t rather than the total pressure differences the authors used in previous studies pereiras et al 2014 therefore kinetic energy losses at the outlet are taken into account the performance of owc turbines is commonly considered quasi steady when working on an owc converter inoue et al 1988 setoguchi and takao 2006 takao et al 2011 this reasonable assumption permits a non steady comparison between turbines based on steady performance data after the previous resolution of the equation system 2 to 5 using the performance curve of the radial turbines it is possible to represent the periodic behavior of the flow rate as well as other variables of interest in fig 14 both sinusoidal distributions of the instantaneous flow rate for both turbines in direct and reverse modes are compared with the total flow rate in the chamber the flow rates are made non dimensional with the maximum flow rate in the owc system q max and the time is divided by the wave period in addition volumetric efficiency defined as η vol q direct q total is plotted for both axial and radial turbines since the η v o l r a d i a l is over 70 less than 30 of the flow generated by the owc escapes through the turbine working in reverse mode this is lower than the flow leakage produced in a twin turbine equipped with axial turbines which reaches values up to 42 it is important to underline as was mentioned before that this leakage is not only untapped energy note that larger flow rates through turbines in reverse modes imply larger breaking torques fig 5 evaluation of the system s performance is in terms of the mean efficiency which is defined as 7 η s y s t e m 1 t 0 t ω t t o t a l d t 1 t 0 t δ p t q t o t a l d t 1 t 0 t δ p t q d i r e c t d t 1 t 0 t δ p t q t o t a l d t η input 1 t 0 t ω t direct t reverse dt 1 t 0 t δ p t q direct dt η tg where t total is the total torque on the electricity generator therefore 8 η s y s t e m η i n p u t η t g mean input efficiency η i n p u t is a parameter closely related to the volumetric efficiency of the system fig 14 whereas twin turbines efficiency η t g is the efficiency of the twin turbine group calculated with regard to the flow rate which is supposed to produce energy q direct there are references takao et al 2011 where the η t g is calculated by not taking into account the torque of the turbine in reverse mode despite the fact that the flow through the turbine in reverse mode is being considered this common hypothesis is a reasonable assumption if the turbine running in reverse mode is disconnected from the rotating axis with some disrupting element in this study and in order to be conservative the torque in reverse mode has been preserved in the definition figure 15 shows the different efficiencies for the twin turbine configuration for both radial and axial turbines the results show that maximum total efficiency of the system η s y s t e m is 24 in the case of the radial turbine as expected the axial turbine using performance data from takao et al 2011 has a significantly higher value reaching 34 at φ 1 solid green line if only efficiency of the turbines is considered the superior performance of the axial machine is demonstrated with enhancement of η t g by up to 20 in the case of axial turbines however the strong feature of the radial turbines is the remarkable η i n p u t close to 80 for the optimal range of flow coefficients around φ 1 4 therefore the poor efficiency of the radial turbine in direct mode is significantly balanced by a superior performance in reverse flow conditions consequently radial turbines can be an interesting option for an owc device with a twin turbine configuration provided that more developments are carried out with regard to turbine blades this would increase the efficiency of the turbine itself with the current design the difference in η t g is still excessively favorable for axial turbines bridging this gap the greater volumetric efficiency of the radial turbines combined with the sharp reduction in flow leaking through the reverse mode turbine may be key factors to justify the development of a new generation of twin turbine prototypes with radial architecture 4 conclusions this paper studies the performance of owc devices based on a twin turbine configuration with radial turbines to the best of the authors knowledge the use of a radial turbine to enhance flow rectification in twin turbine systems is presented for the first time in the open literature firstly a cfd model of the radial turbine has been validated and employed to assess turbine performance in both modes of operation direct centrifugal and reverse centripetal it is shown that the large pressure drop generated in reverse mode implies enhanced exploitation of the energy produced by the owc because only a reduced part of the total flow rate leaks through the turbine working in reverse mode despite of the lower efficiencies found in radial turbines their improved performance as backflow preventers in comparison with axial machines makes radial turbines a promising option for being installed in twin turbines systems to be fully competitive the major challenge is to close the gap in the performance of radial turbines for direct mode in particular a greater effort regarding design is needed to reduce the large kinetic energy loss of radial turbines at the outlet an improvement in the blade profiles combined with a reduction in flow deflection could reduce this detrimental effect and improve efficiency in direct mode alternatively performance in reverse mode could be preserved because the main amount of loss namely the swirl at the elbow is not dependent on the blade s external angle in summary although much work is still required to improve the performance of radial turbines in centrifugal operation this research demonstrates that radial turbines can be a suitable option for use in twin turbine configurations for owc power plants acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support provided by centro integrado de f p mantenimiento y servicios a la producción de

23526,ship grounding is a major maritime hazard that poses great consequences risk and sustainability associated with ship grounding need to be rationally assessed for a safe and sustainable maritime traffic this paper presents a probabilistic risk analysis of ship grounding hazard considering damage caused by bottom penetration sustainability is introduced for ship grounding risk analysis for a synthesized assessment of the damage consequences sustainability indicators assess the economic social and environmental performance following a hazard event in terms of ship grounding incident this includes the ship damage repair operational delay cargo loss injury or fatality of crew and environmental impact such as clean up of oil spill the economical social and environmental metrics are evaluated separately and then converted into an integrated monetary metric utility function that can incorporate attitude towards risk taking is used in the analysis for decision making purposes in risk control the proposed approach is illustrated using a hypothetical oil tanker grounding in the delaware bay region keywords risk analysis sustainability ship grounding marine traffic utility analysis 1 introduction ship groundings accounting for about one third of commercial ship accidents are significant structural hazard events that put maritime system at risk considering the vital importance of ship transportation activities in global economic it is necessary to develop a risk informed model of ship grounding accident that properly accounts for uncertainty and helps to manage risk in pertinent hazard consequences this paper aims to investigate the ship grounding of oil tankers and assess overall damages in an utility informed risk and sustainability assessment framework ship grounding is a marine accident that describes the impact of ship on seabed or waterway side this impact applies extreme loads and hence damage on the submerged ship hull in particularly the bottom structure in severe damage scenarios grounding might lead to hull breach and result in cargo spills loss of vessel and human casualties in the worst case ship grounding incident is a complex phenomenon in its causality as it involves numerous initiators such as human error machine failure or system failure though human error martins and maturana 2010 is considered the major reason of the grounding incident researchers have been studying other factors in grounding for probabilistic analysis of the event probabilistic grounding models were first presented by fujii et al 1970 and macduff 1974 based on ship geometrical probability and causation probability function pedersen 1995 and simonsen 1997 adopted and extended grounding models for wide applications the probabilistic powered grounding and drift grounding are discussed in fowler and sørgård 2000 and cowi 2008 from scenario based analysis infrequent and rare as the ship grounding seems eleftheria et al 2016 s statistics revealed that ship grounding accidents actually increased over the last decade despite of the improved navigation technology therefore continued investigation on the safety of maritime waterway against grounding hazard is necessary the consequence of ship grounding can be evaluated in many ways otto et al 2002 evaluated grounding consequences of ferry ship with damage criteria based on damage size and location yamada 2009 proposed a method to estimate the cost of oil spill with regression analysis using historical oil spill data however the existing evaluation models of ship grounding consequence do not provide a comprehensive assessment of the overall damage associated with the grounding incident a rational assessment model for calculating the result of grounding is still in need pedersen 2010 the ultimate implications of an incident should be defined in terms of the environmental economic and social consequences of the event to address these aspects this paper presents a framework for risk analysis of ship grounding that includes the consideration of sustainability sustainability is generally defined as meeting the needs of present without compromising the future lounis and mcallister 2016 it is being recognized as an important performance indicator assessing the life cycle performance of infrastructure systems brundtland and khalid 1987 maritime community has also started promoting the sustainability principles across maritime transport activities unctad 2015 sustainability metric has been introduced to investigate marine incidents like collision in dong and frangopol 2015 as sustainability concept spans a broad range of issues investigating relevant sustainability indicators for ship grounding is in need for an applicable and comprehensive risk assessment in this paper the sustainability metrics are integrated into risk assessment of ship grounding to determine the overall hazard impact for risk management and decision making purposes appropriate risk assessment also requires the consideration of risk attitude of decision makers the attitude towards risk can be described as risk averse risk neutral or risk taking pratt 1992 depending on the decision maker utility theory von neumann and morgenstern 1953 has proved to be very effective in reflecting risk attitude in risk evaluation sabatino et al 2016 ruan et al 2015 frangopol and soliman 2016 frangopol et al 2017 utility theory is incorporated in this paper to examine the preference of decision makers the effects of the risk attitude in ship grounding risk and sustainability analysis are considered in the proposed framework a model for preliminary assessment of risk and sustainability associated with ship grounding hazard is presented the probabilistic damage of ship grounding is computed by considering the penetration extent in double hull tanker design the consequences of ship grounding are evaluated in terms of the environmental economic and social impacts in a sustainability perspective risk attitude of decision maker is incorporated into the risk assessment by applying utility theory including both single attribute utility and multi attribute utility analysis the proposed framework is illustrated through a hypothetical oil tanker grounding scenario in the delaware bay region 2 risk analysis of ship grounding with sustainability and utility the general framework for the risk based decision process is illustrated in fig 1 risk based assessment for maritime safety decision making process was proposed in imo 2002 extreme events like grounding collision fire and flooding despite of their low probability of occurrence cause significant damage on maritime systems risk metric is aimed to quantify hazard events with low probability high consequence like ship grounding risk assessment of maritime hazard received growing attention from scholars paik et al 2012 silveira et al 2013 mazaheri et al 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 dong and frangopol 2015 generally risk of single hazard event can be quantified as follows ellingwood 2009 1 r p h d s i c c o n s d s i p d s i h where p h is the probability of occurrence of the hazard event c c o n s d s i is the conditional consequence given the damage state d s i and p d s i h gives the conditional probability in a damage state when the hazard h occurred risk assessment requires not only the calculation of probability of hazard occurrence but also a rational way in evaluating the consequences grounding incidents can cause major social economic and environmental problems the consequences include the damage on ship structure for example rupture on ship bottom and penetration of hull for passenger ships fatalities are more likely associated with grounding than other incidents vanem and ellis 2010 severe grounding incidents also raise environmental issues the exxon valdez grounding led to significant oil spill that caused devastating environmental impact peterson et al 2003 the concept of sustainability of infrastructure attracts growing attention due to its emphasis on the balanced performance on various metrics hence it is argued that sustainability concept should be adopted for damage assessment on the ship grounding hazard event sustainability indicators that cover the major consequences associated with grounding are shown in fig 2 the introduced sustainability metrics are integrated into a probabilistic grounding damage model the quantified probability based risk and sustainability will help to give insight of risk management on maritime waterway safety to policy makers the perception of risk is also a major component in the risk assessment the attitude towards risk can be classified into risk aversion risk neutral and risk taking based on decision makers utility theory can well represent the risk attitude in risk assessment process the trend of utility value is effective in reflecting the impact of risk attitude and providing feedback to decision makers in the overall risk framework shown in fig 1 the remaining of this paper will illustrate the process of computing the risk and sustainability associated with a ship grounding incident and the utility analysis of various risk taking attitudes and decision making criteria 3 probabilistic ship grounding model most ship grounding models are inherited from the study of macduff 1974 as follows 2 p p a p c where p is the probability that a ship is involved in an accident in its waterway p a is the geometrical probability that a vessel encounters an object and p c is the causation probability which is the conditional probability that grounding occurs in the accident scenario many scholars have conducted research on estimating geometrical probability and calibrating the causation probability from accidents statistics mazaheri 2009 research on estimating geometrical probability and calibrating the causation probability from accidents statistics have been reported in macduff 1974 pedersen 1995 cowi 2008 kristiansen 2013 considering practical application and availability of input parameters the grounding model presented in cowi 2008 is adopted in this paper to calculate the grounding probability cowi follows pedersen 1995 s approach by performing fault tree analysis in grounding accidents in cowi s model grounding is due to two causes imprecise navigation and missed turn in the route probability of ship grounding is computed with the distribution of ship course over ground which is defined in normal distribution for ship s heading the maneuverability of ship in avoiding the grounding is not considered in this model however cowi calibrated the accuracy of the model with causation probability from accident statistics the grounding model proposed by cowi 2008 is described herein based on two grounding scenarios 3 1 imprecise navigation the geometrical grounding model is built by analyzing the behavior of ships a few nautical miles before they pass a ground due to traveling in difficult waters a small number of ships may head to the ground this event is visualized in fig 3 the corresponding geometric grounding probability can be computed as 3 p g f α 1 f α 2 where a normal distribution n μ σ is used to describe the course over ground of the ship the mean value μ and standard deviation σ are based on traffic density data in the ship channel f is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the ship s course over ground with regard to clockwise angle α and α 1 and α 2 are critical angles in the ship s trajectory towards grounding indicated in fig 3 the annual grounding frequency is expressed as 4 p x n p g p c k d c k r r where n is the annual number of ship passing the route p c is the causation probability that vessels do not take evasive actions in the grounding course k d c is distance factor used to calibrate the grounding frequency based on statistics expressed as 5 k d c x d i s t a n c e where x 10 nautical miles d i s t a n c e is defined as the length between the observation point where the distribution of course over ground is measured and the ground the equation 4 using k r r takes risk reducing factors such as pilotage effect into account k r r often is considered 0 5 according to cowi 2008 3 2 missed turn another typical grounding scenario is when sea routes make a turn in this situation lack of attention from crew can lead to a missed turn and run aground as seen in fig 4 the frequency of missed turn grounding is calculated as 6 p x n p n t p g p c k r r where n is the number of annual passing ships p g is geometrical grounding probability computed in equation 3 p c is causation probability and k r r is risk reduction factor p n t is annual frequency of ships misses a turn and do not correct the error a commonly used missed turn frequency can be expressed as 7 p n t e λ x v where λ is check frequency 0 5 1 min x is distance between missed turning point and ground v is ship traveling speed detailed information regarding the parameter choices in the grounding model is proposed in cowi 2008 in the adopted geometric grounding model in this paper the local density of ship transit does not affect the probabilistic grounding calculation the condition of local ship traffic is critical in other ship hazard events such as crossing and parallel collisions goerlandt and kujala 2011 silveira et al 2013 4 probabilistic grounding damage extent in grounding scenarios damage extent is critical to determine the severity of the consequence catastrophic consequences of ship grounding are usually related with the event when the damage ruptures the cargo block in this paper a probabilistic grounding damage extent is examined considering the damage penetration on the bottom structure a representative grounding damage on the bottom structure of double hull ship is illustrated in fig 5 the double hull arrangement is commonly used for protection of cargo tanks from the vertical damage the damage extent in the longitudinal and transverse directions is also considered as a factor determining the number of cargo tanks penetrated the potential damage on the ship bottom is assumed to be box shaped and affecting only the area of cargo tanks as illustrated in fig 6 this geometrical damage assumption is made on the computational perspective in order to calculate the damage on the cargo tanks the damage is described with the following geometrical characteristics see figs 5 and 6 longitudinal position of foward end of damage x f longitudinal extent of damage l x transverse center position of damage y c transverse extent of damage l y vertical extent of damage l z in order to calculate the damage extent each of the characteristics are assigned with a probabilistic distribution the longitudinal and transverse damage distributions are inherited from analysis of the goalds grounding damage database papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 an exponential distribution of vertical damage extent is assumed such that the majority of damages are below the inner hull the five distributions considered are listed in tables 1 5 where cdf and pdf denote the cumulative distribution function and probability density function respectively note that all random variables are dimensionless with regard to corresponding ship geometry the damage characteristics are assumed to be independent random variables based on damage statistics lützen and simonsen 2003 the longitudinal forward end of the damage and transverse center of damage are assumed to be within cargo tanks blocks restricted by cargo block length l c a r g o and breadth b c a r g o damage characteristics x f l x are taken from papanikolaou et al 2011 for full ships y c is assumed uniformly distributed imo 2012 l y is fitted with the reported data in imo 2012 for full ships with breadth 25 m and follows the same distribution form with l x vertical damage position is fixed at the bottom the vertical damage extent l z is assumed to follow exponential distribution such that the 77 68 of damage is below the inner hull if the double bottom height is 0 1d this is in accordance with the probability of penetrating the double bottom structure calculated in imo 2008 these damage distributions describing the location and extent are integrated into the risk assessment to account for the uncertainty in grounding damage given a grounding incident happened in this paper the damage condition is defined with the number of penetrated cargo tanks p t it is reasonably to assume that more penetrated cargo tanks will lead to more severe consequences such as oil outflow amount and ship structural damaged condition can be aggravated with increasing p t the definition of ship damage state is provided in table 6 a grounded ship is considered in minor damage damage states 1 and 2 when the damage is below inner hull and p t is zero among minor damages damage state 2 is defined when damage area affects more than one cargo tank in plane view see fig 6 for major damage that leads to tank penetration damage state 3 describes single tank penetration cases while damage states 4 and 5 describe multiple tank penetrations a maximum number of 4 for p t is defined for the most severe damage state d s 6 with the probabilistic models to estimate the damage location and extent it is straightforward to calculate the probability of a grounded ship in each of the damage states described given the ship s dimensions and cargo tank arrangements the probability of a grounded ship being in a specific damage state is expressed as 8 p d s i p d e i d e d e i 1 after the hull damage state is determined the consequence of the grounding associated with specific damage state can then be evaluated using sustainability metrics 5 utility informed risk and sustainability assessment the consequences associated with different damage extent are evaluated with sustainability metrics environmental economic and social metrics are considered dominant ones in sustainable perspective and hence adopted for analysis a crude oil tanker is investigated because the grounded oil tanker poses great danger with the possibility of oil spill model uncertainties on the sustainability metrics are imposed to account for the epistemic uncertainties evaluated sustainability metrics are summarized within utility function to combine all the risks into single term and also reveal the effects of various risk attitudes 5 1 environmental metric in this paper the impact of grounding on the environment is associated with the amount of dangerous chemical spilled such as oil grounding incident is the major cause of oil spill huijer 2005 the spilled oil causes disastrous impact on marine environment the clean up process is also very costly the amount of oil spilled is modeled as random based on the damage extent analysis the amount of oil spilled can be estimated for each ship class 9 q s p i l l q i n d s i where q i is the size of one tank n d s i is the number of tanks penetrated in damage state i the statistical parameters of one typical tank size in tones are listed in table 7 for representative tankers along with the total carrying capacities imo 2008 environmental impact can be expressed as the comprehensive clean up cost of the spilled oil 10 c e n v m e n v c s p i l l m s p i l l q s p i l l where m s p i l l is spillage model uncertainty c s p i l l is the cost function of the spilled oil and m e n v is model uncertainty associated with cost function c s p i l l various cost models to represent the environmental consequences were discussed in kim et al 2015 herein the cost function is adopted from ventikos and sotiropoulos 2014 as 11 c s p i l l x 24 020 x 0 8447 where x is oil spill size in tonnes and c s p i l l is cost unit in usd 5 2 economic metric economic loss following a grounding is evaluated regarding ship grounding damage extent the direct economic loss includes several aspects like repair cost loss of earning due to repair loss of cargo when cargo blocks are penetrated the assumed repair time and costs associated with each damage state are listed in table 8 repair cost for grounded ships is expressed as 12 c r e p m r e p p d s v s h i p where m r e p is model uncertainty of the repair p d s is the damage cost relative to ship value by assumption table 8 representative ship values v s h i p are provided in imo 2008 economic loss of earning due to repair can be evaluated as 13 c l e m l e n r e p c d a y where m l e is model uncertainty for earning loss n r e p is assumed repair days corresponding to damage state and c d a y is daily capital cost of oil tanker economic loss of cargo is associated with the properties loss of crude oil spilled 14 c l c m l c m s p i l l q s p i l l c o i l where m l c is model uncertainty of cargo loss m s p i l l is spillage model uncertainty q s p i l l is the amount of spilled oil estimated in equation 9 and c o i l is crude oil price per tonnage 5 3 social metric in terms of social impact following the grounding incident the risk to be accounted for is the potential loss of life and non fatal injuries of crew members past accidents have shown that grounding has catastrophic social consequences according to the 826 accidents of passenger ships vanem and ellis 2010 fatalities are more likely with grounding incident accounting for 17 of the fatalities in those incidents the degree of fatality is calculated based on the damage severity indicated in table 6 for scenarios of minor damage damage states 1 and 2 there is no expectation for loss of life in major damage states where oil spillage occur the expected number of fatalities given a spillage incident is 0 01 e n l l d s i i 3 0 01 based on cowi 2008 s report as for injury of crew in grounding accident an expected number of crew injuries is assumed e n i n j 2 0 for all damage cases dong and frangopol 2015 consequence of social impact can be converted into monetary loss as suggested in cowi 2008 the cost of fatalities is expressed as 15 c l l m l l n l l v l l where m l l is the fatality model uncertainty v l l is the statistical value of life suggested by cowi the cost metric is adopted to reflect the total loss in monetary terms while it is reasonably to argue that loss of life poses greater threat in hazard compared with environmental and economic losses this concern can be addressed in multi attribute utility analysis discussed later similarly cost of non fatal injuries can be expressed as 16 c i n j m i n j n i n j c i n j where m i n j is injury model uncertainty c i n j is the average cost per injured crew 5 4 utility analysis of risk assessment the total sustainability metrics of ship grounding incident is the sum of the environmental cost associated with oil spill c e n v the repair cost of ship damage c r e p loss of earning due to repair c l e loss of cargo in breach event c l c and cost associated with crew injury c i n j and fatality c l l thus the total sustainability metrics can be expressed with one single monetary term 17 c g c e n v environmental c r e p c l e c l c economic c l l c i n j social the risk of grounding incident is therefore defined with the product of sustainability consequences and the probability of grounding occurrence 18 r g c g p g r d where c g is the total sustainability consequences and p g r d is the probability of grounding as the grounding damage computation process is probabilistic the risk metric can be expressed as a random variable the expected risk is computed as 19 e r g r g l r g u r g f r g r g d r g where r g is the probabilistic risk and f r g r g is the pdf of r g r g l and r g u are lower and upper bounds respectively of specific risk interval under consideration 5 4 1 single attribute utility function utility function can help to reflect the attitude of decision maker towards the risk outcomes an exponential utility formulation ang and tang 1984 given single attribute of concern is expressed as 20 u x 1 1 e x p ρ 1 e x p ρ x m a x x x m a x where x is the attribute value e g monetary loss and x m a x is the maximum value of the attribute x m a x is chosen to normalize the utility value so that it takes values between 0 and 1 ρ indicates the decision maker s attitude a positive value of ρ represents a risk averse attitude while a negative value represents the risk taking attitude an illustration of utility function with x m a x 1 is shown in fig 7 with different risk attitudes if the sustainability metrics are integrated into a single monetary value i e equation 17 the expected utility associated with grounding risk can be computed as 21 e u r g l r g u u r g f r g r g d r g where u r g is the utility function associated with ship grounding combining all metrics r g l r g u is the risk interval 5 4 2 multi attribute utility function multiple attributes such as the three different sustainability metrics often lead to multiple criteria decision makings the multi attribute utility function can be employed to reveal the risk attitude regarding various risk attributes a multi attribute utility function is formed by a combination of each of the utility attributes multiplied by associated weighting factor in this context the utility function associated with risk of environmental cost u e n v economical cost u e c o n and social cost u s o c are established separately using equation 20 then the utility value effectively combines multiple risks can be expressed as 22 u m k e c o u e c o k s o c u s o c k e n v u e n v where k e c o k s o c k e n v are weights associated with individual utility values in sustainability framework the weighting factors are chosen based on the information provided by the decision maker 6 an illustrative example the framework for risk assessment in sustainability perspective is illustrated using a hypothetical oil tanker grounding accident in a region of the delaware bay the studied location for grounding case is plotted in fig 8 delaware bay is a relatively hazardous traffic region with high density of ships transit through a restricted ship channel and shoal water around this identified region expressed the highest risk for vessel traffic in delaware shipping channel according to altiok et al 2012 delaware shipping channel is a very important waterway in the east coastal area the marine traffic of delaware water accounts for about 12 of the nation s crude oil import u s army corps of engineers 2011 therefore ensuring sustainable maritime traffic in the delaware shipping channel that is safe environmental friendly and affordable is of paramount importance to this area it is to this end that the oil tanker grounding incident is examined within a sustainability based risk evaluation model 6 1 probability of ship grounding the imprecise navigation model described in cowi 2008 is used here to calculate the probability of grounding the hypothetical grounding scenario is plotted in fig 9 where oil tanker hits the shoal and run aground ship traffic is assumed to follow a normal distribution where 99 7 of the traffic is included in the channel breadth of 180 m the observation point is assumed to be 6 0 nautical miles away from grounding location thus the critical angles in the trajectory towards the shoal is estimated to be 1 563 rad and 1 514 rad respectively consequently based on equation 3 the geometric probability of grounding p g is 0 00387 using equation 5 the distant factor k d c is computed as 1 67 with the distance being 6 nautical miles causation probability and risk reduction factor are taken from cowi 2008 where p c 3 0 10 4 and k r r 0 5 the number of tankers transit in this water area is assumed as 1000 per year according to u s port calls by vessel type chamber 2010 using equation 4 the annual grounding frequency p x is 9 67 10 4 6 2 probability of damage state a representative aframax type oil tanker imo 2008 is used for this hypothetical grounding case study aframax is the largest carrier allowable to enter us ports when fully loaded the basic ship characteristics of the aframax type tanker are a length overall 250m b breadth 43m c depth 21m d double bottom height 2 1m e double sides width 2 18m f cargo block length 186m g number of tanks 12 h capacity of tank 8500 t a simplified tank arrangement is plotted in fig 10 with side view and plane view with the definition of damage state listed in table 6 the probability of the grounded aframax oil tanker in each damage state can be computed by performing monte carlo simulation of probabilistic damage characteristic variables a large number of damage samples are collected and classified by damage extent criteria the probability of this grounded aframax tank being in each damage state is listed in table 9 6 3 risk and sustainability assessment the probabilistic consequences are evaluated in the environmental economic and social metrics previously introduced the model uncertainties and random variables related with sustainability metrics are listed in table 10 model uncertainties are assumed to follow normal distribution while other cost parameters are assumed lognormal the model uncertainty associated with oil spillage m s p i l l is computed considering the fact that double hull design helps reduce the oil spill amount the mean value of injury cost per person are adopted from altiok et al 2012 statistical value of life daily capital cost are based on cowi 2008 crude oil price is based on annual brent oil price of 2016 as 43 55 barrel u s energy information administration 2017 equals to 320 t for each damage state monte carlo sampling is performed to account for the variability of model and parameter uncertainties the number of samples collected for each damage state is decided from the damage state probability indicated in table 9 the total number of samples for each random variable is 100 000 the consequences for each damage state are evaluated based on equations 10 16 the environmental metric associated with oil spillage in the grounding damage is shown in fig 11 samples in damage states 1 and 2 are not evaluated as there is no tank penetration and oil spillage involved similar to environmental metric that is related with the spillage amount the loss of cargo cost evaluates the spillage oil in economic terms loss of cargo metric is shown in fig 12 the other two economic metrics the repair cost and loss of earning are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively the value of the aframax ship is 65 000 000 usd imo 2008 the repair cost metric and loss of earning metric cover both no spillage and spillage cases the social metrics evaluate the injury and fatalities involved in the grounding among them fatality is only considered in damages associated with spillage probabilistic consequences of these two social metrics are plotted in figs 15 and 16 with a brief comparison of the evaluated sustainability consequences it is obvious that the environmental cost is significantly larger than economic metric and social metric thus the sustainability metric listed in equation 17 depends considerably on whether the cargo tank is penetrated or not a detailed analysis of the damage evaluations is presented in table 11 where the expected costs for monetary loss are summarized for both no spillage and spillage cases the expected monetary loss for no spillage damages are 1 296 usd million while the expected total loss for spillage cases are 34 087 usd million due to the probabilistic distribution of damage state the majority of damages are in the no spillage zone thus the expected total loss for all the damage samples is reduced to 8 532 usd million in the no spillage cases the comparison of the sustainability metrics involved is plotted in fig 17 it is seen that repair costs is the major monetary loss in no spillage damage cases followed by loss of earning and injury cost as for spillage cases the oil outflow clean up costs dominate the total sustainability metric in monetary perspective environmental metric is larger than other sustainability metrics by one or two orders of magnitude therefore it is necessary to carefully evaluate the parameters in oil outflow calculation the current model does not consider the time of oil outflow under damage condition the oil outflow in ship grounding damages can be reduced by taking effective response actions the results associated spillage cases could be updated when more reliable with spillage models become available 6 3 1 utility analysis of grounding risks after generating the probabilistic profiles of grounding damage consequences the probabilistic risk defined in equation 18 can be computed the probability of risk of total monetary loss due to grounding hazard is computed in terms of risk intervals the results of expected risk are presented in table 12 the expected value of annual risk of total monetary loss regarding grounding hazard is 8 309 usd utility analysis is conducted following the risk assessment to reveal the impact of risk attitude utility associated with the total monetary loss is evaluated using equation 21 x m a x is assumed to be 120 000 usd two different risk attitudes are compared in the utility assessment ρ 2 0 and ρ 2 0 the expected utility for different risk interval are presented in table 13 the utility values clearly indicate that risk attitude affects the expected total loss the expected utility value for risk aversion is 0 9678 while the risk taking attitude reduces the expected utility to 0 8801 the effect of e u reduction is more obvious in large risk interval values as seen in table 13 that means the risk attitude has greater impact on grounding damage cases that have more severe damages subsequently multi attribute utility analysis is conducted the risk of monetary loss in environmental economic and social aspects are transferred to their respective utilities u e n v u e c o and u s o c using single attribute utility function x m a x for the three risk attributes are 100 000 10 000 and 2 000 usd respectively in the combination into the multi attribute utility value two sets of weighting factors are considered k e n v k e c o k s o c 0 4 0 3 0 3 and k e n v k e c o k s o c 0 1 0 1 0 8 various risk attitudes are examined for the multi attribute utility analysis the results are plotted in fig 18 as the decision maker becomes more risk averse increase of ρ value the multi attribute utility value also increases correspondingly the effects of different weighting factors are also shown in fig 18 the risk attitude has an obvious effects at risk taking values for the set 0 1 0 1 0 8 that means when social impact is dominant 0 1 0 1 0 8 in decision maker s consideration the risk attitude has a greater effect on utility loss compared to a more equal weighted distribution such as 0 4 0 3 0 3 7 conclusions this paper presents a methodology for preliminary risk and sustainability assessment of the ship grounding damage utility analysis is presented to reveal the impact of decision maker s risk attitude and multi criteria decision making the framework is illustrated with a hypothetical oil tanker grounding scenario in the delaware bay region several conclusions can be drawn 1 sustainability principle is applied to assess the consequences of ship grounding a major maritime hazard the environmental economic and social aspects of ship grounding damage impact are analyzed in probabilistic terms associated with various damage scenarios in grounding this procedure helps to understand the key factors driving the sustainability impact in ship accidents 2 sustainability metrics are highly sensitive to the parameters used in the computation as revealed from the results the oil outflow amount contributes significantly to the environmental metric and hence to the total sustainability metric the parameters in the oil outflow in grounding scenarios are therefore worth more detailed examination 3 utility analysis of the risk and sustainability metric provides insight into the risk management and mitigation for maritime safety further work has to be focused on investigating the maximization of utility metrics for optimal risk control options 4 the multi attribute utility analysis shows promising in multi criteria decision makings in the proposed risk analysis the attitude of decision maker and decision criteria can both be reflected through multi attribute utility analysis in the case study a following pareto analysis to reveal the overall pareto front regarding various decision criteria needs further investigation 5 the probabilistic grounding damage is applied in the risk model to account for damage uncertainties other factors that contribute to grounding damage such as impact speed tidal condition could also be modeled into the probabilistic framework to update the grounding risk assessment also the structural deterioration due to aging of ships should be considered in the damage assessment during grounding hazard future work that integrates the instantaneous hazard such as grounding with gradual hazard associated with deteriorated ships is worth investigating

23526,ship grounding is a major maritime hazard that poses great consequences risk and sustainability associated with ship grounding need to be rationally assessed for a safe and sustainable maritime traffic this paper presents a probabilistic risk analysis of ship grounding hazard considering damage caused by bottom penetration sustainability is introduced for ship grounding risk analysis for a synthesized assessment of the damage consequences sustainability indicators assess the economic social and environmental performance following a hazard event in terms of ship grounding incident this includes the ship damage repair operational delay cargo loss injury or fatality of crew and environmental impact such as clean up of oil spill the economical social and environmental metrics are evaluated separately and then converted into an integrated monetary metric utility function that can incorporate attitude towards risk taking is used in the analysis for decision making purposes in risk control the proposed approach is illustrated using a hypothetical oil tanker grounding in the delaware bay region keywords risk analysis sustainability ship grounding marine traffic utility analysis 1 introduction ship groundings accounting for about one third of commercial ship accidents are significant structural hazard events that put maritime system at risk considering the vital importance of ship transportation activities in global economic it is necessary to develop a risk informed model of ship grounding accident that properly accounts for uncertainty and helps to manage risk in pertinent hazard consequences this paper aims to investigate the ship grounding of oil tankers and assess overall damages in an utility informed risk and sustainability assessment framework ship grounding is a marine accident that describes the impact of ship on seabed or waterway side this impact applies extreme loads and hence damage on the submerged ship hull in particularly the bottom structure in severe damage scenarios grounding might lead to hull breach and result in cargo spills loss of vessel and human casualties in the worst case ship grounding incident is a complex phenomenon in its causality as it involves numerous initiators such as human error machine failure or system failure though human error martins and maturana 2010 is considered the major reason of the grounding incident researchers have been studying other factors in grounding for probabilistic analysis of the event probabilistic grounding models were first presented by fujii et al 1970 and macduff 1974 based on ship geometrical probability and causation probability function pedersen 1995 and simonsen 1997 adopted and extended grounding models for wide applications the probabilistic powered grounding and drift grounding are discussed in fowler and sørgård 2000 and cowi 2008 from scenario based analysis infrequent and rare as the ship grounding seems eleftheria et al 2016 s statistics revealed that ship grounding accidents actually increased over the last decade despite of the improved navigation technology therefore continued investigation on the safety of maritime waterway against grounding hazard is necessary the consequence of ship grounding can be evaluated in many ways otto et al 2002 evaluated grounding consequences of ferry ship with damage criteria based on damage size and location yamada 2009 proposed a method to estimate the cost of oil spill with regression analysis using historical oil spill data however the existing evaluation models of ship grounding consequence do not provide a comprehensive assessment of the overall damage associated with the grounding incident a rational assessment model for calculating the result of grounding is still in need pedersen 2010 the ultimate implications of an incident should be defined in terms of the environmental economic and social consequences of the event to address these aspects this paper presents a framework for risk analysis of ship grounding that includes the consideration of sustainability sustainability is generally defined as meeting the needs of present without compromising the future lounis and mcallister 2016 it is being recognized as an important performance indicator assessing the life cycle performance of infrastructure systems brundtland and khalid 1987 maritime community has also started promoting the sustainability principles across maritime transport activities unctad 2015 sustainability metric has been introduced to investigate marine incidents like collision in dong and frangopol 2015 as sustainability concept spans a broad range of issues investigating relevant sustainability indicators for ship grounding is in need for an applicable and comprehensive risk assessment in this paper the sustainability metrics are integrated into risk assessment of ship grounding to determine the overall hazard impact for risk management and decision making purposes appropriate risk assessment also requires the consideration of risk attitude of decision makers the attitude towards risk can be described as risk averse risk neutral or risk taking pratt 1992 depending on the decision maker utility theory von neumann and morgenstern 1953 has proved to be very effective in reflecting risk attitude in risk evaluation sabatino et al 2016 ruan et al 2015 frangopol and soliman 2016 frangopol et al 2017 utility theory is incorporated in this paper to examine the preference of decision makers the effects of the risk attitude in ship grounding risk and sustainability analysis are considered in the proposed framework a model for preliminary assessment of risk and sustainability associated with ship grounding hazard is presented the probabilistic damage of ship grounding is computed by considering the penetration extent in double hull tanker design the consequences of ship grounding are evaluated in terms of the environmental economic and social impacts in a sustainability perspective risk attitude of decision maker is incorporated into the risk assessment by applying utility theory including both single attribute utility and multi attribute utility analysis the proposed framework is illustrated through a hypothetical oil tanker grounding scenario in the delaware bay region 2 risk analysis of ship grounding with sustainability and utility the general framework for the risk based decision process is illustrated in fig 1 risk based assessment for maritime safety decision making process was proposed in imo 2002 extreme events like grounding collision fire and flooding despite of their low probability of occurrence cause significant damage on maritime systems risk metric is aimed to quantify hazard events with low probability high consequence like ship grounding risk assessment of maritime hazard received growing attention from scholars paik et al 2012 silveira et al 2013 mazaheri et al 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 dong and frangopol 2015 generally risk of single hazard event can be quantified as follows ellingwood 2009 1 r p h d s i c c o n s d s i p d s i h where p h is the probability of occurrence of the hazard event c c o n s d s i is the conditional consequence given the damage state d s i and p d s i h gives the conditional probability in a damage state when the hazard h occurred risk assessment requires not only the calculation of probability of hazard occurrence but also a rational way in evaluating the consequences grounding incidents can cause major social economic and environmental problems the consequences include the damage on ship structure for example rupture on ship bottom and penetration of hull for passenger ships fatalities are more likely associated with grounding than other incidents vanem and ellis 2010 severe grounding incidents also raise environmental issues the exxon valdez grounding led to significant oil spill that caused devastating environmental impact peterson et al 2003 the concept of sustainability of infrastructure attracts growing attention due to its emphasis on the balanced performance on various metrics hence it is argued that sustainability concept should be adopted for damage assessment on the ship grounding hazard event sustainability indicators that cover the major consequences associated with grounding are shown in fig 2 the introduced sustainability metrics are integrated into a probabilistic grounding damage model the quantified probability based risk and sustainability will help to give insight of risk management on maritime waterway safety to policy makers the perception of risk is also a major component in the risk assessment the attitude towards risk can be classified into risk aversion risk neutral and risk taking based on decision makers utility theory can well represent the risk attitude in risk assessment process the trend of utility value is effective in reflecting the impact of risk attitude and providing feedback to decision makers in the overall risk framework shown in fig 1 the remaining of this paper will illustrate the process of computing the risk and sustainability associated with a ship grounding incident and the utility analysis of various risk taking attitudes and decision making criteria 3 probabilistic ship grounding model most ship grounding models are inherited from the study of macduff 1974 as follows 2 p p a p c where p is the probability that a ship is involved in an accident in its waterway p a is the geometrical probability that a vessel encounters an object and p c is the causation probability which is the conditional probability that grounding occurs in the accident scenario many scholars have conducted research on estimating geometrical probability and calibrating the causation probability from accidents statistics mazaheri 2009 research on estimating geometrical probability and calibrating the causation probability from accidents statistics have been reported in macduff 1974 pedersen 1995 cowi 2008 kristiansen 2013 considering practical application and availability of input parameters the grounding model presented in cowi 2008 is adopted in this paper to calculate the grounding probability cowi follows pedersen 1995 s approach by performing fault tree analysis in grounding accidents in cowi s model grounding is due to two causes imprecise navigation and missed turn in the route probability of ship grounding is computed with the distribution of ship course over ground which is defined in normal distribution for ship s heading the maneuverability of ship in avoiding the grounding is not considered in this model however cowi calibrated the accuracy of the model with causation probability from accident statistics the grounding model proposed by cowi 2008 is described herein based on two grounding scenarios 3 1 imprecise navigation the geometrical grounding model is built by analyzing the behavior of ships a few nautical miles before they pass a ground due to traveling in difficult waters a small number of ships may head to the ground this event is visualized in fig 3 the corresponding geometric grounding probability can be computed as 3 p g f α 1 f α 2 where a normal distribution n μ σ is used to describe the course over ground of the ship the mean value μ and standard deviation σ are based on traffic density data in the ship channel f is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the ship s course over ground with regard to clockwise angle α and α 1 and α 2 are critical angles in the ship s trajectory towards grounding indicated in fig 3 the annual grounding frequency is expressed as 4 p x n p g p c k d c k r r where n is the annual number of ship passing the route p c is the causation probability that vessels do not take evasive actions in the grounding course k d c is distance factor used to calibrate the grounding frequency based on statistics expressed as 5 k d c x d i s t a n c e where x 10 nautical miles d i s t a n c e is defined as the length between the observation point where the distribution of course over ground is measured and the ground the equation 4 using k r r takes risk reducing factors such as pilotage effect into account k r r often is considered 0 5 according to cowi 2008 3 2 missed turn another typical grounding scenario is when sea routes make a turn in this situation lack of attention from crew can lead to a missed turn and run aground as seen in fig 4 the frequency of missed turn grounding is calculated as 6 p x n p n t p g p c k r r where n is the number of annual passing ships p g is geometrical grounding probability computed in equation 3 p c is causation probability and k r r is risk reduction factor p n t is annual frequency of ships misses a turn and do not correct the error a commonly used missed turn frequency can be expressed as 7 p n t e λ x v where λ is check frequency 0 5 1 min x is distance between missed turning point and ground v is ship traveling speed detailed information regarding the parameter choices in the grounding model is proposed in cowi 2008 in the adopted geometric grounding model in this paper the local density of ship transit does not affect the probabilistic grounding calculation the condition of local ship traffic is critical in other ship hazard events such as crossing and parallel collisions goerlandt and kujala 2011 silveira et al 2013 4 probabilistic grounding damage extent in grounding scenarios damage extent is critical to determine the severity of the consequence catastrophic consequences of ship grounding are usually related with the event when the damage ruptures the cargo block in this paper a probabilistic grounding damage extent is examined considering the damage penetration on the bottom structure a representative grounding damage on the bottom structure of double hull ship is illustrated in fig 5 the double hull arrangement is commonly used for protection of cargo tanks from the vertical damage the damage extent in the longitudinal and transverse directions is also considered as a factor determining the number of cargo tanks penetrated the potential damage on the ship bottom is assumed to be box shaped and affecting only the area of cargo tanks as illustrated in fig 6 this geometrical damage assumption is made on the computational perspective in order to calculate the damage on the cargo tanks the damage is described with the following geometrical characteristics see figs 5 and 6 longitudinal position of foward end of damage x f longitudinal extent of damage l x transverse center position of damage y c transverse extent of damage l y vertical extent of damage l z in order to calculate the damage extent each of the characteristics are assigned with a probabilistic distribution the longitudinal and transverse damage distributions are inherited from analysis of the goalds grounding damage database papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 an exponential distribution of vertical damage extent is assumed such that the majority of damages are below the inner hull the five distributions considered are listed in tables 1 5 where cdf and pdf denote the cumulative distribution function and probability density function respectively note that all random variables are dimensionless with regard to corresponding ship geometry the damage characteristics are assumed to be independent random variables based on damage statistics lützen and simonsen 2003 the longitudinal forward end of the damage and transverse center of damage are assumed to be within cargo tanks blocks restricted by cargo block length l c a r g o and breadth b c a r g o damage characteristics x f l x are taken from papanikolaou et al 2011 for full ships y c is assumed uniformly distributed imo 2012 l y is fitted with the reported data in imo 2012 for full ships with breadth 25 m and follows the same distribution form with l x vertical damage position is fixed at the bottom the vertical damage extent l z is assumed to follow exponential distribution such that the 77 68 of damage is below the inner hull if the double bottom height is 0 1d this is in accordance with the probability of penetrating the double bottom structure calculated in imo 2008 these damage distributions describing the location and extent are integrated into the risk assessment to account for the uncertainty in grounding damage given a grounding incident happened in this paper the damage condition is defined with the number of penetrated cargo tanks p t it is reasonably to assume that more penetrated cargo tanks will lead to more severe consequences such as oil outflow amount and ship structural damaged condition can be aggravated with increasing p t the definition of ship damage state is provided in table 6 a grounded ship is considered in minor damage damage states 1 and 2 when the damage is below inner hull and p t is zero among minor damages damage state 2 is defined when damage area affects more than one cargo tank in plane view see fig 6 for major damage that leads to tank penetration damage state 3 describes single tank penetration cases while damage states 4 and 5 describe multiple tank penetrations a maximum number of 4 for p t is defined for the most severe damage state d s 6 with the probabilistic models to estimate the damage location and extent it is straightforward to calculate the probability of a grounded ship in each of the damage states described given the ship s dimensions and cargo tank arrangements the probability of a grounded ship being in a specific damage state is expressed as 8 p d s i p d e i d e d e i 1 after the hull damage state is determined the consequence of the grounding associated with specific damage state can then be evaluated using sustainability metrics 5 utility informed risk and sustainability assessment the consequences associated with different damage extent are evaluated with sustainability metrics environmental economic and social metrics are considered dominant ones in sustainable perspective and hence adopted for analysis a crude oil tanker is investigated because the grounded oil tanker poses great danger with the possibility of oil spill model uncertainties on the sustainability metrics are imposed to account for the epistemic uncertainties evaluated sustainability metrics are summarized within utility function to combine all the risks into single term and also reveal the effects of various risk attitudes 5 1 environmental metric in this paper the impact of grounding on the environment is associated with the amount of dangerous chemical spilled such as oil grounding incident is the major cause of oil spill huijer 2005 the spilled oil causes disastrous impact on marine environment the clean up process is also very costly the amount of oil spilled is modeled as random based on the damage extent analysis the amount of oil spilled can be estimated for each ship class 9 q s p i l l q i n d s i where q i is the size of one tank n d s i is the number of tanks penetrated in damage state i the statistical parameters of one typical tank size in tones are listed in table 7 for representative tankers along with the total carrying capacities imo 2008 environmental impact can be expressed as the comprehensive clean up cost of the spilled oil 10 c e n v m e n v c s p i l l m s p i l l q s p i l l where m s p i l l is spillage model uncertainty c s p i l l is the cost function of the spilled oil and m e n v is model uncertainty associated with cost function c s p i l l various cost models to represent the environmental consequences were discussed in kim et al 2015 herein the cost function is adopted from ventikos and sotiropoulos 2014 as 11 c s p i l l x 24 020 x 0 8447 where x is oil spill size in tonnes and c s p i l l is cost unit in usd 5 2 economic metric economic loss following a grounding is evaluated regarding ship grounding damage extent the direct economic loss includes several aspects like repair cost loss of earning due to repair loss of cargo when cargo blocks are penetrated the assumed repair time and costs associated with each damage state are listed in table 8 repair cost for grounded ships is expressed as 12 c r e p m r e p p d s v s h i p where m r e p is model uncertainty of the repair p d s is the damage cost relative to ship value by assumption table 8 representative ship values v s h i p are provided in imo 2008 economic loss of earning due to repair can be evaluated as 13 c l e m l e n r e p c d a y where m l e is model uncertainty for earning loss n r e p is assumed repair days corresponding to damage state and c d a y is daily capital cost of oil tanker economic loss of cargo is associated with the properties loss of crude oil spilled 14 c l c m l c m s p i l l q s p i l l c o i l where m l c is model uncertainty of cargo loss m s p i l l is spillage model uncertainty q s p i l l is the amount of spilled oil estimated in equation 9 and c o i l is crude oil price per tonnage 5 3 social metric in terms of social impact following the grounding incident the risk to be accounted for is the potential loss of life and non fatal injuries of crew members past accidents have shown that grounding has catastrophic social consequences according to the 826 accidents of passenger ships vanem and ellis 2010 fatalities are more likely with grounding incident accounting for 17 of the fatalities in those incidents the degree of fatality is calculated based on the damage severity indicated in table 6 for scenarios of minor damage damage states 1 and 2 there is no expectation for loss of life in major damage states where oil spillage occur the expected number of fatalities given a spillage incident is 0 01 e n l l d s i i 3 0 01 based on cowi 2008 s report as for injury of crew in grounding accident an expected number of crew injuries is assumed e n i n j 2 0 for all damage cases dong and frangopol 2015 consequence of social impact can be converted into monetary loss as suggested in cowi 2008 the cost of fatalities is expressed as 15 c l l m l l n l l v l l where m l l is the fatality model uncertainty v l l is the statistical value of life suggested by cowi the cost metric is adopted to reflect the total loss in monetary terms while it is reasonably to argue that loss of life poses greater threat in hazard compared with environmental and economic losses this concern can be addressed in multi attribute utility analysis discussed later similarly cost of non fatal injuries can be expressed as 16 c i n j m i n j n i n j c i n j where m i n j is injury model uncertainty c i n j is the average cost per injured crew 5 4 utility analysis of risk assessment the total sustainability metrics of ship grounding incident is the sum of the environmental cost associated with oil spill c e n v the repair cost of ship damage c r e p loss of earning due to repair c l e loss of cargo in breach event c l c and cost associated with crew injury c i n j and fatality c l l thus the total sustainability metrics can be expressed with one single monetary term 17 c g c e n v environmental c r e p c l e c l c economic c l l c i n j social the risk of grounding incident is therefore defined with the product of sustainability consequences and the probability of grounding occurrence 18 r g c g p g r d where c g is the total sustainability consequences and p g r d is the probability of grounding as the grounding damage computation process is probabilistic the risk metric can be expressed as a random variable the expected risk is computed as 19 e r g r g l r g u r g f r g r g d r g where r g is the probabilistic risk and f r g r g is the pdf of r g r g l and r g u are lower and upper bounds respectively of specific risk interval under consideration 5 4 1 single attribute utility function utility function can help to reflect the attitude of decision maker towards the risk outcomes an exponential utility formulation ang and tang 1984 given single attribute of concern is expressed as 20 u x 1 1 e x p ρ 1 e x p ρ x m a x x x m a x where x is the attribute value e g monetary loss and x m a x is the maximum value of the attribute x m a x is chosen to normalize the utility value so that it takes values between 0 and 1 ρ indicates the decision maker s attitude a positive value of ρ represents a risk averse attitude while a negative value represents the risk taking attitude an illustration of utility function with x m a x 1 is shown in fig 7 with different risk attitudes if the sustainability metrics are integrated into a single monetary value i e equation 17 the expected utility associated with grounding risk can be computed as 21 e u r g l r g u u r g f r g r g d r g where u r g is the utility function associated with ship grounding combining all metrics r g l r g u is the risk interval 5 4 2 multi attribute utility function multiple attributes such as the three different sustainability metrics often lead to multiple criteria decision makings the multi attribute utility function can be employed to reveal the risk attitude regarding various risk attributes a multi attribute utility function is formed by a combination of each of the utility attributes multiplied by associated weighting factor in this context the utility function associated with risk of environmental cost u e n v economical cost u e c o n and social cost u s o c are established separately using equation 20 then the utility value effectively combines multiple risks can be expressed as 22 u m k e c o u e c o k s o c u s o c k e n v u e n v where k e c o k s o c k e n v are weights associated with individual utility values in sustainability framework the weighting factors are chosen based on the information provided by the decision maker 6 an illustrative example the framework for risk assessment in sustainability perspective is illustrated using a hypothetical oil tanker grounding accident in a region of the delaware bay the studied location for grounding case is plotted in fig 8 delaware bay is a relatively hazardous traffic region with high density of ships transit through a restricted ship channel and shoal water around this identified region expressed the highest risk for vessel traffic in delaware shipping channel according to altiok et al 2012 delaware shipping channel is a very important waterway in the east coastal area the marine traffic of delaware water accounts for about 12 of the nation s crude oil import u s army corps of engineers 2011 therefore ensuring sustainable maritime traffic in the delaware shipping channel that is safe environmental friendly and affordable is of paramount importance to this area it is to this end that the oil tanker grounding incident is examined within a sustainability based risk evaluation model 6 1 probability of ship grounding the imprecise navigation model described in cowi 2008 is used here to calculate the probability of grounding the hypothetical grounding scenario is plotted in fig 9 where oil tanker hits the shoal and run aground ship traffic is assumed to follow a normal distribution where 99 7 of the traffic is included in the channel breadth of 180 m the observation point is assumed to be 6 0 nautical miles away from grounding location thus the critical angles in the trajectory towards the shoal is estimated to be 1 563 rad and 1 514 rad respectively consequently based on equation 3 the geometric probability of grounding p g is 0 00387 using equation 5 the distant factor k d c is computed as 1 67 with the distance being 6 nautical miles causation probability and risk reduction factor are taken from cowi 2008 where p c 3 0 10 4 and k r r 0 5 the number of tankers transit in this water area is assumed as 1000 per year according to u s port calls by vessel type chamber 2010 using equation 4 the annual grounding frequency p x is 9 67 10 4 6 2 probability of damage state a representative aframax type oil tanker imo 2008 is used for this hypothetical grounding case study aframax is the largest carrier allowable to enter us ports when fully loaded the basic ship characteristics of the aframax type tanker are a length overall 250m b breadth 43m c depth 21m d double bottom height 2 1m e double sides width 2 18m f cargo block length 186m g number of tanks 12 h capacity of tank 8500 t a simplified tank arrangement is plotted in fig 10 with side view and plane view with the definition of damage state listed in table 6 the probability of the grounded aframax oil tanker in each damage state can be computed by performing monte carlo simulation of probabilistic damage characteristic variables a large number of damage samples are collected and classified by damage extent criteria the probability of this grounded aframax tank being in each damage state is listed in table 9 6 3 risk and sustainability assessment the probabilistic consequences are evaluated in the environmental economic and social metrics previously introduced the model uncertainties and random variables related with sustainability metrics are listed in table 10 model uncertainties are assumed to follow normal distribution while other cost parameters are assumed lognormal the model uncertainty associated with oil spillage m s p i l l is computed considering the fact that double hull design helps reduce the oil spill amount the mean value of injury cost per person are adopted from altiok et al 2012 statistical value of life daily capital cost are based on cowi 2008 crude oil price is based on annual brent oil price of 2016 as 43 55 barrel u s energy information administration 2017 equals to 320 t for each damage state monte carlo sampling is performed to account for the variability of model and parameter uncertainties the number of samples collected for each damage state is decided from the damage state probability indicated in table 9 the total number of samples for each random variable is 100 000 the consequences for each damage state are evaluated based on equations 10 16 the environmental metric associated with oil spillage in the grounding damage is shown in fig 11 samples in damage states 1 and 2 are not evaluated as there is no tank penetration and oil spillage involved similar to environmental metric that is related with the spillage amount the loss of cargo cost evaluates the spillage oil in economic terms loss of cargo metric is shown in fig 12 the other two economic metrics the repair cost and loss of earning are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively the value of the aframax ship is 65 000 000 usd imo 2008 the repair cost metric and loss of earning metric cover both no spillage and spillage cases the social metrics evaluate the injury and fatalities involved in the grounding among them fatality is only considered in damages associated with spillage probabilistic consequences of these two social metrics are plotted in figs 15 and 16 with a brief comparison of the evaluated sustainability consequences it is obvious that the environmental cost is significantly larger than economic metric and social metric thus the sustainability metric listed in equation 17 depends considerably on whether the cargo tank is penetrated or not a detailed analysis of the damage evaluations is presented in table 11 where the expected costs for monetary loss are summarized for both no spillage and spillage cases the expected monetary loss for no spillage damages are 1 296 usd million while the expected total loss for spillage cases are 34 087 usd million due to the probabilistic distribution of damage state the majority of damages are in the no spillage zone thus the expected total loss for all the damage samples is reduced to 8 532 usd million in the no spillage cases the comparison of the sustainability metrics involved is plotted in fig 17 it is seen that repair costs is the major monetary loss in no spillage damage cases followed by loss of earning and injury cost as for spillage cases the oil outflow clean up costs dominate the total sustainability metric in monetary perspective environmental metric is larger than other sustainability metrics by one or two orders of magnitude therefore it is necessary to carefully evaluate the parameters in oil outflow calculation the current model does not consider the time of oil outflow under damage condition the oil outflow in ship grounding damages can be reduced by taking effective response actions the results associated spillage cases could be updated when more reliable with spillage models become available 6 3 1 utility analysis of grounding risks after generating the probabilistic profiles of grounding damage consequences the probabilistic risk defined in equation 18 can be computed the probability of risk of total monetary loss due to grounding hazard is computed in terms of risk intervals the results of expected risk are presented in table 12 the expected value of annual risk of total monetary loss regarding grounding hazard is 8 309 usd utility analysis is conducted following the risk assessment to reveal the impact of risk attitude utility associated with the total monetary loss is evaluated using equation 21 x m a x is assumed to be 120 000 usd two different risk attitudes are compared in the utility assessment ρ 2 0 and ρ 2 0 the expected utility for different risk interval are presented in table 13 the utility values clearly indicate that risk attitude affects the expected total loss the expected utility value for risk aversion is 0 9678 while the risk taking attitude reduces the expected utility to 0 8801 the effect of e u reduction is more obvious in large risk interval values as seen in table 13 that means the risk attitude has greater impact on grounding damage cases that have more severe damages subsequently multi attribute utility analysis is conducted the risk of monetary loss in environmental economic and social aspects are transferred to their respective utilities u e n v u e c o and u s o c using single attribute utility function x m a x for the three risk attributes are 100 000 10 000 and 2 000 usd respectively in the combination into the multi attribute utility value two sets of weighting factors are considered k e n v k e c o k s o c 0 4 0 3 0 3 and k e n v k e c o k s o c 0 1 0 1 0 8 various risk attitudes are examined for the multi attribute utility analysis the results are plotted in fig 18 as the decision maker becomes more risk averse increase of ρ value the multi attribute utility value also increases correspondingly the effects of different weighting factors are also shown in fig 18 the risk attitude has an obvious effects at risk taking values for the set 0 1 0 1 0 8 that means when social impact is dominant 0 1 0 1 0 8 in decision maker s consideration the risk attitude has a greater effect on utility loss compared to a more equal weighted distribution such as 0 4 0 3 0 3 7 conclusions this paper presents a methodology for preliminary risk and sustainability assessment of the ship grounding damage utility analysis is presented to reveal the impact of decision maker s risk attitude and multi criteria decision making the framework is illustrated with a hypothetical oil tanker grounding scenario in the delaware bay region several conclusions can be drawn 1 sustainability principle is applied to assess the consequences of ship grounding a major maritime hazard the environmental economic and social aspects of ship grounding damage impact are analyzed in probabilistic terms associated with various damage scenarios in grounding this procedure helps to understand the key factors driving the sustainability impact in ship accidents 2 sustainability metrics are highly sensitive to the parameters used in the computation as revealed from the results the oil outflow amount contributes significantly to the environmental metric and hence to the total sustainability metric the parameters in the oil outflow in grounding scenarios are therefore worth more detailed examination 3 utility analysis of the risk and sustainability metric provides insight into the risk management and mitigation for maritime safety further work has to be focused on investigating the maximization of utility metrics for optimal risk control options 4 the multi attribute utility analysis shows promising in multi criteria decision makings in the proposed risk analysis the attitude of decision maker and decision criteria can both be reflected through multi attribute utility analysis in the case study a following pareto analysis to reveal the overall pareto front regarding various decision criteria needs further investigation 5 the probabilistic grounding damage is applied in the risk model to account for damage uncertainties other factors that contribute to grounding damage such as impact speed tidal condition could also be modeled into the probabilistic framework to update the grounding risk assessment also the structural deterioration due to aging of ships should be considered in the damage assessment during grounding hazard future work that integrates the instantaneous hazard such as grounding with gradual hazard associated with deteriorated ships is worth investigating

23527,a de coupled technique is applied to the analysis of mooring damping of taut mooring systems and two types of hybrid mooring systems the effects of mooring damping on low frequency motion responses as well as mooring tensions are also investigated besides the effects of mooring pretensions on floating systems dynamics are discussed irregular wave model tests were carried out in beam and heading seas to simulate a semi submersible operating in 200 m water depth in typical south china sea wave conditions first the characteristics of mooring line models were checked to determine if they satisfy model test requirements free decay model tests and numerical simulations are carried out to obtain the critical damping of different systems the 6 dof motion responses obtained from model tests are input to solve mooring dynamics with de coupled method and the accuracy of the numerical methods is validated mooring tensions as well as mooring motions at fairleads in horizontal directions are obtained to study mooring damping the damping of all mooring systems in real sea states are then obtained and compared the relation between mooring damping with horizontal motion responses are studied keywords mooring damping free decay model tests de coupled technique dynamics motion response 1 introduction the mooring system is an essential part of floating structures which aims to keep the floating structures in position and helps to ensure the safety of operations generally the catenary and taut are two commonly used mooring systems in ocean engineering the catenary mooring system is composed by several long mooring lines which are arranged symmetrically in most cases normally the material of catenary mooring line is chain or composed by several segments including chain and wire the restoring force of catenary mooring system comes from the weights of suspended segments and the length of lay down part should be long enough since the length of lay down part is varying with the motions of floating vessel and the lay down part is forbidden to be fully lifted up due to the fact that the anchor of catenary mooring line cannot be subjected to the vertical load in this case the length of the catenary mooring line is extremely large which could be several times to the water depth apparently some drawbacks can be found when the catenary mooring system is adopted in deepwater first of all the cost of mooring line increases considerably with mooring length besides the excessive vertical load that comes from the chain weight decreases the vessel useful payload effectively furthermore the mooring line may interfere with other engineering activities and bring the risk of collision due to the large mooring radius unlike the catenary mooring line the taut mooring acts like a straight line under the effect of pretension and the restoring force comes from the axial stretching the wire is the major material to be used in the taut mooring line however the synthetic mooring line is getting more and more attention in recent decades banfield and casey 1998 petruska et al 2004 bugg et al 2004 due to its economy and good performance the characteristics of synthetic mooring line are very complex and an intensive study is needed to investigate the stress strain properties liu et al 2014 huang et al 2015 fatigue banfield et al 2000 bottorff et al 2016 durability banfield et al 2005 flory and banfield 2006 weller et al 2012 and creep huang et al 2013 among others the taut mooring line is a good choice for deepwater mooring solution however the suction anchor or other special anchor is needed for taut mooring line since the anchor needs to handle large vertical load however the costs of these anchors are significantly increased including manufacturing and installation the mooring system stiffness and mooring damping are two factors closely related to horizontal motion responses surge and sway of floating structures mooring damping plays a significant role in reducing slow drift motions responses which are the main components of horizontal motion responses especially when the structure operates in deep water furthermore mooring damping estimation is also a crucial step in hybrid model tests ji and xu 2014 xu and ji 2014 therefore the mooring damping should be studied carefully the pioneer work about mooring line damping can be found in huse 1986 who applied the quasi static method to investigate mooring damping in his study the damping force was represented by the drag force which could be calculated with the morison equation similarly bauduin and naciri 2000 applied a sophisticated quasi static method to study the mooring damping however it should be noticed that the quasi static method is not suitable to study mooring damping if nonlinear responses are prominent noticing the drawbacks of the quasi static method webster 1995 applied a time domain finite element method to study the influence of pretension forced oscillations current and drag coefficients on mooring line damping where the mooring damping was calculated with the indicator diagram method the study was carried out in dimensionless form the equivalent linear damping coefficient in one period was obtained as d awh where d is the dissipated energy of mooring line in one oscillation period a is the amplitude of oscillation w is the per unit length submerged mooring line weight h is the water depth according to webster 1995 the non dimensional mooring induced damping was first increased with non dimensional pretension then started to decrease after reaching its peak value the effects of drag coefficients on mooring damping induced damping was related to mooring pretension the drag coefficients played positive role in improving mooring damping for low pretension despite the oscillation directions however for the high pretension cases the mooring damping were reduced with drag coefficient for the horizontal oscillation the influence of drag coefficient on mooring damping are neglected for vertical oscillations the mooring induced damping can be easily obtained from the indicator diagram and the indicator diagram method was widely used in mooring line damping estimation johanning et al 2007 yang et al 2016 johanning et al 2007 applied experimental methods as well as a time domain numerical method to study the mooring damping of wave energy converters wec and their research showed that the top end oscillation frequency had a significant effect on mooring damping when the ratio of oscillation and natural frequency is over 1 the mooring line damping increased dramatically besides when the mooring line was fully lifted from the bottom the mooring line stretching gave rise to an increase of mooring damping recently yang et al 2016 implemented a time domain numerical method to study the damping of single mooring line connected to a fpso the effects of wave frequency current and hydrodynamic coefficients on mooring line damping are discussed in their study the effect of the superimposed wave frequency random motion on the low frequency mooring line damping were investigated the wave frequency random motion were transferred to an equivalent sinusoidal motion in order to apply the indicator diagram method conveniently the results showed that the effects of random wave on mooring induced damping are closed related to its significant wave height and zero crossing period for the random waves with small significant wave height and low zero crossing period the effects on mooring induced damping are limited pascoal et al 2005 2006 have developed an equivalent mooring model to synthetize the response of various mooring lines into a combined equivalent model which can be a practical approach for various types of situations in addition to the numerical methods the experimental method is another important approach to study mooring damping raaijmakers and battjes 1997 johanning et al 2007 it is noticed that most existing studies study the single mooring line damping only and the forced oscillation on the top end of mooring line is very simple i e sinusoidal in the real situations this scenario cannot be satisfied since the floating structure is attached to mooring systems the dynamics of each mooring line influence each other furthermore the motion responses of a floating structure are 6 dof which are very irregular and coupled with mooring lines rather than sinusoidal as described above the commonly used mooring systems have some drawbacks and it is very important to design mooring systems with high performance ji et al 2011 and yuan et al 2011 2014 proposed a novel mooring system integrating both catenary and taut mooring systems and fully coupled numerical methods are adopted to study the properties of this hybrid mooring system furthermore hydrodynamic experiments were conducted to study the performance of hybrid mooring systems and the dynamics of these two systems were then compared with traditional taut mooring systems ji and yuan 2015 however the mooring induced damping which could be as large as 80 of the total damping in surge huse 1991 and plays a significant role on low frequency motion responses were not studied this study focus on the damping of hybrid and taut mooring systems the effects of mooring induced damping on low frequency translational motion responses as well as the related mooring tensions are also investigated by noticing the deficiencies of the existing method in mooring induced damping prediction this paper deals with mooring damping in real sea states and investigates the relations between mooring damping and floating semi submersible motion responses model tests are is the most convincing methods to study the dynamics of floating structure guedes soares et al 2005 pascoal et al 2004 ji and xu 2014 however it is not easy to measure the mooring tensions and fairlead displacements in different directions which are essential information in mooring induced damping calculations in this paper a de coupled procedure is proposed to combine model tests and numerical method the motion responses are obtained from model tests then the de coupled technique is applied to study the mooring damping of different mooring systems in real sea states the relations between mooring damping and low frequency translational motion responses are discussed and the effects of pretension on system dynamics are studied furthermore the preferable mooring systems are recommended based on the discussions 2 model description in this study the sixth generation semi submersible ultra deepwater drilling rig hysy 981 is selected as the research object the platform is composed by two pontoons four columns and four braces the maximum operating water depth is 3000 m and maximum drilling depth is10 000 m the real operation water depth for the platform is 1000 m and it is impossible to carry out the model test in the wave basin of china ship scientific research center cssrc a water depth of 200 m is needed for the 1 50 model tests while the maximum water depth of wave basin is 4 m ji and yuan 2015 so the full scale system was truncated at 200 m water depth in the following study the truncated taut mooring system as well as hybrid mooring systems the mooring line material identical to taut mooring but with weight buoy considered will be studied the main dimensions of this floating structure are shown in table 1 the mooring system of the semi submersible is composed by 12 mooring lines arranged fully symmetrically about the x and y axis as shown in fig 1 three different types of mooring systems are discussed in this paper the first one is the taut mooring system ta which is composed by wire the parameters of the taut mooring line are shown in table 2 where ea is the axial stiffness and φ is diameter besides two types of hybrid mooring systems are also studied in this paper which are constructed by installing weight weight buoy on taut mooring line the first type is denoted as tm which is composed by attaching five different weights at uniform intervals on the end 100 m of the taut mooring line in other words the distance between each pair of weights is 20 m the mass of these weights are 4 tonnes 10 tones 20 tonnes 30 tonnes and 40 tonnes respectively which diminish gradually from seabed upwards the other hybrid mooring system denoted tmb it is constructed by adding a buoy to the tm the segment length from fairlead to the node where the buoy been installed is 40 m and the buoyancy of buoy is 191 1 kn the drag coefficients of mooring line and buoy are defined as 1 1 and 1 respectively the drag coefficients of weights are supposed to be 0 8 the schematics of these mooring systems are shown in fig 2 furthermore the effect of pretension on mooring system damping will also be investigated the description of the mooring system cases are shown in table 3 the hybrid mooring systems tm p and tmb p have the same pretension to ta while the mooring radius of tm f and tmb f are identical to ta which means the tm p and tm f are the same mooring line but with different mooring radius so does tmb p and tmb f 3 research methodology 3 1 mooring statics the catenary equation is implemented to calculate mooring statics the governing equations of mooring segment statics are written as in faltinsen 1993 the forces acting on a mooring line segment are shown in fig 3 applying the equilibrium conditions to the free body diagram of fig 3 leads to 1 d t ρ g a d z w sin φ f 1 t e a d s 2 t ρ g a z d φ w cos φ d 1 t e a d s by introducing 3 t t ρ g z a from the former equations the following two equations can be written with current forces neglected 4 d t w sin φ d s 5 t d φ w cos φ d s by dividing eq 4 and eq 5 6 d t t sin φ cos φ d φ by integrating eq 5 7 s s 0 1 w φ 0 φ t 0 cos θ cos φ 0 cos θ d θ t h w tan φ t a

2 by applying these equations from the fairlead point to the touchdown point the following equation can be deduced and the mooring statics can be solved 14 t v l w t v 0 15 x t h w sinh 1 t v t h sinh

mooring line the catenary equation is applied to each segment which is separated by the weight buoy the effect of the weight buoy is modelled as the concentrated forces which can be easily applied at the segment intersections during the solution of the initial value problem for easy understanding the schematic of two segments mooring line with a weight is given in fig 4 the top tension at node 1 is first solved by applying catenary equation to segment 1 the force at the top end of segment 2 is analysed by considering the effects of weight 17 t h 2 t h w t h 1 0 18 t v 2 t v w t v 1 0 where subscript 1 and 2 stand for the top end of segment 1 and segment 2 respectively and subscript w denoted as the weight the profiles of these mooring cases are then obtained and plotted in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be clearly seen the end part of hybrid mooring lines lay down on seabed under the action of weights 3 2 governing equation the deepc dnv 2015 will be adopted to analyse semi submersible

determining the energy dissipation at the top of the mooring line the indicator diagram method which is proposed by webster 1995 is widely used to estimate energy dissipation of mooring lines brown and mavrakos 1999 johanning et al 2007 yang et al 2016 by applying a sinusoidal surge oscillation at the top end of mooring line and recording the top end horizontal motion and tension time series the indicator diagram is then derived by plotting tension against motion the energy dissipation is the area of this indicator diagram and defined as 37 e t t τ f h d ζ d t d t where f h is the horizontal tension τ is the period of oscillation ζ is the horizontal displacements however this method may not be suitable when the top motion of the mooring line is not sinusoidal since the indicator diagram is not easy to get unfortunately the mooring motion and tension are irregular in real sea states other method should be presented to study mooring damping the relation between equivalent linear damping coefficient and tension is 38 f h b d ζ d t the mean dissipated energy during one period of this motion are represented as 39 e a v 1 τ t t τ f h d ζ d t d t applying eq 38 to eq 39 the mean

is the index of time series and b μ is the average linear mooring line damping during these periods 4 experiments a series of model tests were carried out in the seakeeping basin of china ship scientific research center cssrc which has a length width and water depth of 69 m 46 m and 4 m respectively and the model scale is chosen to be 1 50 ji and yuan 2015 the mooring and platform model were made according to the model scale the models and shown in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 shows the ta model and clump weight models which were made by standard weights the tm model was made by adding the weights to the pre designed position on ta model the tmb model was made by adding the buoy to the pre designed position of tm model the picture of semi submersible moored with tmb is shown in fig 7 4 1 validation of mooring statics before carrying out other model tests the characteristics of mooring line model should be calibrated first to test mooring line model characteristics in the wave basin is not an easy job this test was conducted out of basin in order to simply the model procedure firstly the mooring models were installed according to the design radius with the azimuth angles equal to zero then the top end is moved horizontally in the x direction to different positions and the top tension was recorded until the mooring was stable the top tension horizontal displacement curve can then be obtained by repeating the same procedures the statics of the mooring models were checked and compared with the numerical results and the comparisons are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the statics of mooring line model agree very well with the numerical simulations which indicates that the mooring line models satisfy the requirement of experiments and the simulation results are accurate the mooring line models were then installed according to the design plan in the wave basin and the mooring system stiffness in surge can be obtained by applying a given force in surge x direction and measuring the offset until the system were in equilibrium in calm water the surge restoring curve were then obtained by giving the different surge force and measuring the corresponding displacement the results given in fig 9 show that the surge resorting forces of all these mooring systems increase linearly with offsets and the tm f has the greatest surge stiffness 4 2 surge free decay the surge free decay model tests were carried out to get the natural surge periods and damping ratios of these systems since all free decay time series are similar and not easy to distinguish these curves will not be presented however the key information obtained from surge free decay tests are displayed in table 4 the period denoted as t and the critical damping cc are defined as 43 t 2 π m m a d d e d k 44 c c 2 m m a d d e d k where m is the model displacement m a d d e d is the added mass in surge and k is the mooring system stiffness in surge as shown in table 4 the damping ratio of each system is similar which is around 4 of the critical damping however the damping ratio of tm f is relatively small compared to other cases 4 3 irregular wave model tests the 100 year typhoon condition in south china sea is chosen as the environmental condition which is given by the jonswap spectrum with a significant wave height 13 7 m a peak period of 16s and a peak enhancement factor of 2 4 totally two wave headings were considered including beam sea wave heading is 90 and head sea wave heading is 180 the results will be discussed below 5 mooring system damping the model tests are always considered as the most credible method to study the dynamics of floating structures however it is not easy to apply an experimental method to study the mooring induced damping directly in a real sea states since it is difficult to measure the mooring tensions in x y and z direction as well as fairlead motion responses in this study the de coupled technique is used to deal with this problem this method includes two steps to obtain mooring induced damping first the platform 6dof motion responses were measured in the irregular wave model tests then the platform motion responses are considered as the input to calculate the horizontal motions and horizontal tensions at fairlead point of each mooring line with the de coupled method the flow chart is given in fig 10 for easier understanding the procedure of the de coupled technique used in this paper the waves generated in the basin should be validated before the irregular wave model tests were carried out the measured wave elevations and spectrum are compared with the targets and the results are given in fig 11 it can be observed that the waves generated in the basin agreed well with the target value and the irregular and satisfied to the requirement of model tests 5 1 beam sea the platform motion responses were measured with a 6 dof non contact optical system furthermore the mooring tensions were recorded simultaneously by the tension sensors installed at the top end of each mooring line the results of model tests should be checked first to get rid of the obvious errors as shown in fig 12 abnormal signals were found during 500s 700s in the irregular wave model test of tmb p which was due to the problem of wave maker therefore only the responses after 800s the full scale value is about 5657s will be studied and compared in beam sea after measuring the 6 dof motion responses of the floating structure the numerical mooring tensions can be solved by applying the de coupled method given in fig 10 however the accuracy of the numerical methods should be validated the most loaded mooring line of each model tests are selected investigation object the numerical results are then compared to the corresponding measured values the mooring tensions time series during the period of 6 000s 8 000s are plotted and shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the main variations trends of the numerical simulations curves match well with model tests results despite of amplitudes discrepancies furthermore from the results in table 5 it can be found that the deviations are less than 14 which can be considered a validation of the accuracy of the simulation results the critical damping of the floating structure in sway can be obtained once the stiffness of the mooring system in sway and system mass are known the numerical mooring system restoring force curves in sway are shown in fig 14 the sway stiffness of the systems can then be obtained from sway restoring curves in fig 14 and the details are given in table 6 it can be observed that tm f and tmb f have similar stiffness values while the stiffness of tm p is the smallest among all these systems the numerical sway free decay simulations were performed to obtain the natural periods and damping the sway decay curves are given in fig 15 and the results are shown in table 6 it is found that ta has the greatest damping while the amount of tm p damping is small compared to the other systems furthermore it is observed that the damping is increasing with pretension for the same mooring line the equivalent mooring line damping of the different mooring systems are given in fig 16 it can be clearly seen that the tmb lines especially tmb f induced considerable larger mooring damping than the other type mooring lines the damping induced by mooring lines of ta are close to tm p except for the mooring lines installed in the upwind side 1 6 where it can be seen that the mooring damping of ta are greater than tm p it may be explained that the mooring lines of ta have greater dynamics compared to the tm p mooring lines because the weights added at the end tm p mooring lines provide additional restoring force to the system and prevent the mooring line from stretching as a result the differences between dynamics of upwind mooring lines of these two mooring systems will be enlarged since they contribute most to keep the platform in position and suffer much more loads to the mooring lines installed in opposite side furthermore it can also be observed that pretension increase could improve mooring damping to some extent it is understood that the mooring line with higher pretension will have additional stretching and more sensitive to wave frequency motion johanning et al 2007 and these two factors would induce the improvement of mooring dynamics the mooring system damping can then be obtained by adding each mooring line damping and the results are shown in table 7 and plotted in fig 17 as shown in table 7 the tm p system induces the smallest damping and the amount of ta damping is slightly greater than tm p however an opposite result can be found in the damping ratio between these two systems besides it is seen that the effects of mooring line pretensions on mooring damping are significant for detail it is found that by increasing the pretension the tm mooring system damping is increased by 25 7 while the damping ratio is increased by 6 7 while for tmb the damping and damping ratio are increased 26 and 11 6 respectively an interesting phenomenon can be observed that the damping of tmb p is 34 6 greater than ta despite they have equal pretensions furthermore by comparing the damping results in table 6 with table 7 it is found that the mooring system damping will be considerably underestimated by free decay tests method the irregular wave method is essential to study mooring induced damping the relation between damping and low frequency motion response is very a complicated problem the raising of the amplitude of low frequency can improve the damping value webster 1995 yang et al 2016 but on the other hand the amplitude of low frequency motion response would decrease with damping increasing in this paper the analysis of the relations between them is carried out the spectral analysis is carried out and the results are given in fig 18 which shows that the sway motions are dominated by low frequency responses a significant peak can be found near the natural frequency of each system the tm f has the largest spectral peak value located in the low frequency which is followed by tmb f furthermore another apparent spectral peak can be found in the range of wave frequency which would contribute to mooring damping increasing huse and matsumoto 1988 yang et al 2016 the effect of wave frequency components motions on tmb damping are more significant than other mooring systems due to additional hydrodynamic effects from buoys and weights which could be one of the reasons why the damping of tmb are always greater than other systems for better presenting the sway responses the statistics are calculated and given in table 8 where the maximum heights are the gaps between maximum and minimum responses amplitudes as shown in table 8 it can be observed that the sway response of tm f is the severest on the contrary tmb f is the most stable type owing to its great damping value furthermore by comparing table 7 with table 8 it can be seen that the sway standard deviations are closely related to mooring damping i e the system with great sway standard deviations always induce more mooring damping except for the tmb systems in the following discussion the study is focused on low frequency components and the wave frequency components are filtered from the original sway motion responses with the cutoff frequency of 0 21 rad s the low frequency components of sway motions are plotted in fig 19 which shows that the low frequency sway motion peaks of ta and tm systems occur at around 10 000s while the peaks of tmb systems occur among 6 500s 7 000s but smaller than the peaks of others the statistics are given in table 9 which shows clearly that the low frequency motions are reduced with the mooring damping increasing except for tm f the results indicate that the mooring system damping play significant role in low frequency motions reduction another interesting topic is the relation between mooring damping and mooring tensions and they are also interacted with each other the mooring line axial stretching can improve mooring tensions as well as mooring line damping johanning et al 2007 on the other hand the increased mooring line damping can reduce the motion response which would cause of mooring tension to decrease in this paper the relation between these two is studied the mooring tensions at the mooring line top ends as well as the platform sway motions are plotted in fig 20 the time series durations are selected as 1 000s which contain the maximum tensions and maximum sway motions fig 20 shows that the maximum tension of all these systems occur almost simultaneously with the maximum sway motions which shows that the mooring tensions are closely related to sway motions and the axial stretching is an important factor to induce mooring dynamics the maximum mooring tensions of each system are given in table 10 the static tensions are obtained by moving the platform to the positions where the maximum tensions occur and then solving the static equations at this position the dynamic tensions are then obtained by subtracting the static tensions from total tensions as shown in table 10 the mooring tensions are dominated by static tensions the dynamic tensions are small parts compared with the static components especially for tmb p system furthermore it is found tmb f has greater tension than tmb p despite it has smaller sway motion this phenomenon may be explained that the tension of tmb f is more sensitive to motion responses which can be clearly seen in fig 9 besides it can be clearly observed that mooring lines with greater pretensions would be easier to onset mooring dynamics if compare the results of tm f and tm p tmb f and tmb p 5 2 head sea similar to beam sea the accuracy of the numerical results in head sea should be first validated before carrying out the next work the mooring lines which have the greatest tension of each mooring system will be studied the comparisons of mooring tensions time series among the range of 6000s 8000s between numerical results and model results are shown in fig 21 as shown in fig 21 the numerical results match well with the measured data and if observed carefully it can be found that the results of the hybrid systems with low pretension tm p tmb p have more satisfactory results compared to other systems this may be mainly due to two reasons firstly compared to the taut mooring system which has the identical pretension to tm p and tmb p the weights added on the end mooring lines could in some extent prevent mooring line from stretching which is the main factor to induce mooring dynamics secondly the mooring dynamics of these two mooring lines are less sensitive to floater motion responses compared to the tm f and tmb f besides it can also be noticed that the axial stiffness of the mooring lines in this paper are small and the springs used to simulate mooring stiffness could be stretched largely for the mooring lines with great pretensions during model tests which cannot considered in the numerical model and could bring deviations the relevant research can be found in chen et al 2001 the statics of mooring line tensions are shown in table 11 the greatest difference can be found in the maximum tension of the ta system which equals to 17 4 while the errors of other values are under 16 however the numerical results are still convincing the mooring line damping of different systems are then calculated according to eq 42 each mooring line damping of each mooring system are shown in fig 22 according to fig 22 it is found that the mooring damping of tmb f are larger than other systems which is followed by tm f when the pretension of the hybrid mooring system is kept the same to ta it can be observed that the leeward mooring lines 4 10 of the hybrid mooring system dissipate either greater or similar energy to ta however for the mooring line being installed in the upwind side the mooring line damping induced by ta is going to overtake hybrid mooring line damping due to the effects of line stretching the mooring systems damping can then be obtained by adding the damping of each mooring line where the details can be found in table 11 and fig 23 in table 11 it can be seen that for three mooring system cases with identical pretension the ta has a comparable damping level to tm p and tmb p which accounts for about 15 of system critical damping for details the damping of tmb p is slightly greater than ta due to the contributions of buoys furthermore as described above for these mooring lines to suffer relatively large loads being installed in the upwind side the weights could cause a decrease of mooring damping which leads to total system damping reduction the system damping of ta is a little bigger than tm p however the damping ratio of tm p is slightly greater than ta in the meanwhile it is observed that the pretensions have significant effects on mooring damping the damping of tm and tmb increased by 21 9 and 24 1 when the pretension increase from 2122 kn to 2700 kn and 2535 kn respectively as shown in fig 24 the surge motions are dominated by low frequency components the wave frequency peaks can be found around 0 38 rad s which contribute to the improvement of mooring damping level the low frequency peaks of different systems occur on almost the same frequency due to their similar nature periods which can be found in table 4 the surge motion statistics are given in table 12 which shows that unlike to beam sea case the surge motion standard deviations decrease with the increase of mooring system damping it may be explained that mooring systems damping have already developed to a considerable level and the effects of mooring damping on motion responses are dominate to the effects of motions on mooring damping the mooring tensions at the mooring line top ends as well as the platform surge motions are plotted in fig 25 as shown in the figures below the maximum mooring tensions and surge responses peaks occur almost simultaneously which show that the surge motion responses have direct effects on mooring tensions the mooring tensions are then calculated and presented in table 13 the static mooring tensions are obtained with the method described above as shown in table 13 the tm p has the smallest mooring tension despite it has a relatively large surge motion which is owing to the influences of installed weights and the low pretension adopted make it is less sensitive to surge motion by comparing the tensions of tmb p and ta it can be found that the mooring tension and mooring dynamics are reduced by 9 3 and 20 4 respectively it can be understood that there are two factors contribute to the phenomenon that tmb p has smaller tensions compared to ta firstly the greater mooring damping of tmb p would induce more moderate surge motion secondly by referring to fig 9 it can be found that the tension of tmb p is less sensitive to the sway motion than ta the results show that the tmb p is a quite competitive design case which reduces both motion responses and mooring tensions see table 14 besides the effects of mooring pretention on mooring tension could be clearly seen by comparing the results of tm f tm p and also tmb f tmb p for details the mooring tension and dynamics are increased by 26 1 and 50 4 when the pretension of tm is improved from 2122 kn to 2700 kn for the tmb systems these two values are increased slightly which are 13 2 and 10 4 respectively the reason for tension increase with pretensions has been explained above which can be understood that the mooring lines with high pretension are more sensitive to surge motion and are easier to onset mooring dynamics besides the results also demonstrate that the mooring tensions of tmb are less sensitive to pretension increasing compared to tm system especially for the dynamic component 6 conclusions the mooring top tensions comparisons between numerical simulations and model tests results indicate that the numerical method is capable of predicting the mooring damping and dynamics accurately despite of small discrepancies both friction between weights and seabed as well as the uncertain drag and added mass coefficients could contribute to the differences besides the current numerical method is not capable to simulate large mooring line stretching which could induce errors the free decay method is an efficient method to obtain system critical damping the damping ratio can be read from still water free decay curves then the system damping can be easily obtained by multiplying the damping ratio to the critical damping however it should be noticed the system damping obtained by free decay could be underestimated so a further study needs to be carried out to carry out model tests to study dynamics of semi submersible moored with different mooring systems and then apply de coupled technique is a novel and quite efficient way to study mooring damping in real sea states the results indicate that the mooring tensions and induced damping are closely related when considering the weights being installed on taut mooring line but keeping the pretension as a constant tm p the attached weights will provide restoring forces to the system and prevent the mooring line from stretching which may reduce mooring damping the buoys play positive role in increasing the mooring induced damping by noticing that the sway and surge motions of all systems have non negligible wave frequency components which could increase drag forces and inertial forces due to the added buoy and mooring damping is increased as a consequence on the other hand once the buoy is being installed the hanging angle at the top end of mooring line would be reduced which could increase horizontal tensions even if the axial tensions are the same the mooring damping would increase accordingly the mooring systems damping interacts with sway and surge motions by comparing the mooring system damping and sway motions of different systems it can be concluded that the sway motions increase would give rise to mooring system damping increase however when the mooring system damping is increased to a certain level that would in turn to reduce sway motions however by removing the effects of wave frequency components motions it can be seen that the low frequency components of sway motions of different systems would mainly be reduced with mooring damping increasing tmb f system has the largest sway damping which is 13 9 of system critical damping furthermore it should be kept in mind that the standard deviation of low frequency motion is the significant factor to measure the amount of mooring system damping as for the surge motion responses the mooring line damping always play a significant positive role in the reduction of motion responses standard deviation due to considerable amount of mooring damping besides the tmb f system has the largest surge damping which amount to 18 2 system critical damping mooring tensions are closely related to platform motion responses and mooring line properties the tmb mooring is a very desirable design since they have greater damping and the motion responses are more stable besides the mooring tensions are less sensitive to motion response indeed mooring pretension has significant effect on mooring damping and mooring tensions the design case with great mooring pretension would induce larger mooring system stiffness as well as mooring damping which would reduce floating structure motion response without no doubt however it does not mean the dynamic mooring tension would be reduced in contrast mooring line dynamics would be more sensitive to motion response the mooring may have large loads despite small motions which may cause mooring line failure therefore it should be taken great care to choose

23527,a de coupled technique is applied to the analysis of mooring damping of taut mooring systems and two types of hybrid mooring systems the effects of mooring damping on low frequency motion responses as well as mooring tensions are also investigated besides the effects of mooring pretensions on floating systems dynamics are discussed irregular wave model tests were carried out in beam

they satisfy model test requirements free decay model tests and numerical simulations are carried out to obtain the critical damping of different systems the 6 dof motion responses obtained from model tests are input to solve mooring dynamics with de coupled method and the accuracy of the numerical methods is validated mooring tensions as well as mooring motions at fairleads in horizontal directions are obtained to study mooring damping the damping of all mooring systems in real sea states are then obtained and compared the relation between mooring damping with horizontal motion responses are studied keywords mooring damping free decay model tests de coupled technique dynamics motion response 1 introduction the mooring system is an essential part of floating structures which aims to keep the floating structures in position and helps to ensure the safety of operations generally the catenary and taut are two commonly used mooring systems in ocean engineering the catenary mooring system is composed by several long mooring lines which are arranged symmetrically in most cases normally the material of catenary mooring line is chain or composed by several segments including chain and wire the restoring force of catenary mooring system comes from the weights of suspended segments and the length of lay down part should be long enough since the length of lay down part is varying with the motions of floating vessel and the lay down part is forbidden to be fully lifted up due to the fact that the anchor of catenary mooring line cannot be subjected to the vertical load in this case the length of the catenary mooring line is extremely large which could be several times to the water depth apparently some drawbacks can be found when the catenary mooring system is adopted in deepwater first of all the cost of mooring line increases considerably with mooring length besides the excessive vertical load that comes from the chain weight decreases the vessel useful payload effectively furthermore the mooring line may interfere with other engineering activities and bring the risk of collision due to the large mooring radius unlike the catenary mooring line the taut mooring acts like a straight line under the effect of pretension and the restoring force comes from the axial stretching the wire is the major material to be used in the taut mooring line however the synthetic mooring line is getting more and more attention in recent decades banfield and casey 1998 petruska et al 2004 bugg et al 2004 due to its economy and good performance the characteristics of synthetic mooring line are very complex and an intensive study is needed to investigate the stress strain properties liu et al 2014 huang et al 2015 fatigue banfield et al 2000 bottorff et al 2016 durability banfield et al 2005 flory and banfield 2006 weller et al 2012 and creep huang et al 2013 among others the taut mooring line is a good choice for deepwater mooring solution however the suction anchor or other special anchor is needed for taut mooring line since the anchor needs to handle large vertical load however the costs of these anchors are significantly increased including manufacturing and installation the mooring system stiffness and mooring damping are two factors closely related to horizontal motion responses surge and sway of floating structures mooring damping plays a significant role in reducing slow drift motions responses which are the main components of horizontal motion responses especially when the structure operates in deep water furthermore mooring damping estimation is also a crucial step in hybrid model tests ji and xu 2014 xu and ji 2014 therefore the mooring damping should be studied carefully the pioneer work about mooring line damping can be found in huse 1986 who applied the quasi static method to investigate mooring damping in his study the damping force was represented by the drag force which could be calculated with the morison equation similarly bauduin and naciri 2000 applied a sophisticated quasi static method to study the mooring damping however it should be noticed that the quasi static method is not suitable to study mooring damping if nonlinear responses are prominent noticing the drawbacks of the quasi static method webster 1995 applied a time domain finite element method to study the influence of pretension forced oscillations current and drag coefficients on mooring line damping where the mooring damping was calculated with the indicator diagram method the study was carried out in dimensionless form the equivalent linear damping coefficient in one period was obtained as d awh where d is the dissipated energy of mooring line in one oscillation period a is the amplitude of oscillation w is the per unit length submerged mooring line weight h is the water depth according to webster 1995 the non dimensional mooring induced damping was first increased with non dimensional pretension then started to decrease after reaching its peak value the effects of drag coefficients on mooring damping induced damping was related to mooring pretension the drag coefficients played positive role in improving mooring damping for low pretension despite the oscillation directions however for the high pretension cases the mooring damping were reduced with drag coefficient for the horizontal oscillation the influence of drag coefficient on mooring damping are neglected for vertical oscillations the mooring induced damping can be easily obtained from the indicator diagram and the indicator diagram method was widely used in mooring line damping estimation johanning et al 2007 yang et al 2016 johanning et al 2007 applied experimental methods as well as a time domain numerical method to study the mooring damping of wave energy converters wec and their research showed that the top end oscillation frequency had a significant effect on mooring damping when the ratio of oscillation and natural frequency is over 1 the mooring line damping increased dramatically besides when the mooring line was fully lifted from the bottom the mooring line stretching gave rise to an increase of mooring damping recently yang et al 2016 implemented a time domain numerical method to study the damping of single mooring line connected to a fpso the effects of wave frequency current and hydrodynamic coefficients on mooring line damping are discussed in their study the effect of the superimposed wave frequency random motion on the low frequency mooring line damping were investigated the wave frequency random motion were transferred to an equivalent sinusoidal motion in order to apply the indicator diagram method conveniently the results showed that the effects of random wave on mooring induced damping are closed related to its significant wave height and zero crossing period for the random waves with small significant wave height and low zero crossing period the effects on mooring induced damping are limited pascoal et al 2005 2006 have developed an equivalent mooring model to synthetize the response of various mooring lines into a combined equivalent model which can be a practical approach for various types of situations in addition to the numerical methods the experimental method is another important approach to study mooring damping raaijmakers and battjes 1997 johanning et al 2007 it is noticed that most existing studies study the single mooring line damping only and the forced oscillation on the top end of mooring line is very simple i e sinusoidal in the real situations this scenario cannot be satisfied since the floating structure is attached to mooring systems the dynamics of each mooring line influence each other furthermore the motion responses of a floating structure are 6 dof which are very irregular and coupled with mooring lines rather than sinusoidal as described above the commonly used mooring systems have some drawbacks and it is very important to design mooring systems with high performance ji et al 2011 and yuan et al 2011 2014 proposed a novel mooring system integrating both catenary and taut mooring systems and fully coupled numerical methods are adopted to study the properties of this hybrid mooring system furthermore hydrodynamic experiments were conducted to study the performance of hybrid mooring systems and the dynamics of these two systems were then compared with traditional taut mooring systems ji and yuan 2015 however the mooring induced damping which could be as large as 80 of the total damping in surge huse 1991 and plays a significant role on low frequency motion responses were not studied this study focus on the damping of hybrid and taut mooring systems the effects of mooring induced damping on low frequency translational motion responses as well as the related mooring tensions are also investigated by noticing the deficiencies of the existing method in mooring induced damping prediction this paper deals with mooring damping in real sea states and investigates the relations between mooring damping and floating semi submersible motion responses model tests are is the most convincing methods to study the dynamics of floating structure guedes soares et al 2005 pascoal et al 2004 ji and xu 2014 however it is not easy to measure the mooring tensions and fairlead displacements in different directions which are essential information in mooring induced damping calculations in this paper a de coupled procedure is proposed to combine model tests and numerical method the motion responses are obtained from model tests then the de coupled technique is applied to study the mooring damping of different mooring systems in real sea states the relations between mooring damping and low frequency translational motion responses are discussed and the effects of pretension on system dynamics are studied furthermore the preferable mooring systems are recommended based on the discussions 2 model description in this study the sixth generation semi submersible ultra deepwater drilling rig hysy 981 is selected as the research object the platform is composed by two pontoons four columns and four braces the maximum operating water depth is 3000 m and maximum drilling depth is10 000 m the real operation water depth for the platform is 1000 m and it is impossible to carry out the model test in the wave basin of china ship scientific research center cssrc a water depth of 200 m is needed for the 1 50 model tests while the maximum water depth of wave basin is 4 m ji and yuan 2015 so the full scale system was truncated at 200 m water depth in the following study the truncated taut mooring system as well as hybrid mooring systems the mooring line material identical to taut mooring but with weight buoy considered will be studied the main dimensions of this floating structure are shown in table 1 the mooring system of the semi submersible is composed by 12 mooring lines arranged fully symmetrically about the x and y axis as shown in fig 1 three different types of mooring systems are discussed in this paper the first one is the taut mooring system ta which is composed by wire the parameters of the taut mooring line are shown in table 2 where ea is the axial stiffness and φ is diameter besides two types of hybrid mooring systems are also studied in this paper which are constructed by installing weight weight buoy on taut mooring line the first type is denoted as tm which is composed by attaching five different weights at uniform intervals on the end 100 m of the taut mooring line in other words the distance between each pair of weights is 20 m the mass of these weights are 4 tonnes 10 tones 20 tonnes 30 tonnes and 40 tonnes respectively which diminish gradually from seabed upwards the other hybrid mooring system denoted tmb it is constructed by adding a buoy to the tm the segment length from fairlead to the node where the buoy been installed is 40 m and the buoyancy of buoy is 191 1 kn the drag coefficients of mooring line and buoy are defined as 1 1 and 1 respectively the drag coefficients of weights are supposed to be 0 8 the schematics of these mooring systems are shown in fig 2 furthermore the effect of pretension on mooring system damping will also be investigated the description of the mooring system cases are shown in table 3 the hybrid mooring systems tm p and tmb p have the same pretension to ta while the mooring radius of tm f and tmb f are identical to ta which means the tm p and tm f are the same mooring line but with different mooring radius so does tmb p and tmb f 3 research methodology 3 1 mooring statics the catenary equation is implemented to calculate mooring statics the governing equations of mooring segment statics are written as in faltinsen 1993 the forces acting on a mooring line segment are shown in fig 3 applying the equilibrium conditions to the free body

mooring line the catenary equation is applied to each segment which is separated by the weight buoy the effect of the weight buoy is modelled as the concentrated forces which can be easily applied at the segment intersections during the solution of the initial value problem for easy understanding the schematic of two segments mooring line with a weight is given in fig 4 the top tension at node 1 is first solved by applying catenary equation to segment 1 the force at the top end of segment 2 is analysed by considering the effects of weight 17 t h 2 t h w t h 1 0 18 t v 2 t v w t v 1 0 where subscript 1 and 2 stand for the top end of segment 1 and segment 2 respectively and subscript w denoted as the weight the profiles of these mooring cases are then obtained and plotted in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be clearly seen the end part of hybrid mooring lines lay down on seabed under the action of weights 3 2 governing equation the deepc dnv 2015 will be adopted to analyse semi submersible

determining the energy dissipation at the top of the mooring line the indicator diagram method which is proposed by webster 1995 is widely used to estimate energy dissipation of mooring lines brown and mavrakos 1999 johanning et al 2007 yang et al 2016 by applying a sinusoidal surge oscillation at the top end of mooring line and recording the top end horizontal motion and tension time series the indicator diagram is then derived by plotting tension against motion the energy dissipation is the area of this indicator diagram and defined as 37 e t t τ f h d ζ d t d t where f h is the horizontal tension τ is the period of oscillation ζ is the horizontal displacements however this method may not be suitable when the top motion of the mooring line is not sinusoidal since the indicator diagram is not easy to get unfortunately the mooring motion and tension are irregular in real sea states other method should be presented to study mooring damping the relation between equivalent linear damping coefficient and tension is 38 f h b d ζ d t the mean dissipated energy during one period of this motion are represented as 39 e a v 1 τ t t τ f h d ζ d t d t applying eq 38 to eq 39 the mean

scientific research center cssrc which has a length width and water depth of 69 m 46 m and 4 m respectively and the model scale is chosen to be 1 50 ji and yuan 2015 the mooring and platform model were made according to the model scale the models and shown in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 shows the ta model and clump weight models which were made by standard weights the tm model was made by adding the weights to the pre designed position on ta model the tmb model was made by adding the buoy to the pre designed position of tm model the picture of semi submersible moored with tmb is shown in fig 7 4 1 validation of mooring statics before carrying out other model tests the characteristics of mooring line model should be calibrated first to test mooring line model characteristics in the wave basin is not an easy job this test was conducted out of basin in order to simply the model procedure firstly the mooring models were installed according to the design radius with the azimuth angles equal to zero then the top end is moved horizontally in the x direction to different positions and the top tension was recorded until the mooring was stable the top tension horizontal displacement curve can then be obtained by repeating the same procedures the statics of the mooring models were checked and compared with the numerical results and the comparisons are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the statics of mooring line model agree very well with the numerical simulations which indicates that the mooring line models satisfy the requirement of experiments and the simulation results are accurate the mooring line models were then installed according to the design plan in the wave basin and the mooring system stiffness in surge can be obtained by applying a given force in surge x direction and measuring the offset until the system were in equilibrium in calm water the surge restoring curve were then obtained by giving the different surge force and measuring the corresponding displacement the results given in fig 9 show that the surge resorting forces of all these mooring systems increase linearly with offsets and the tm f has the greatest surge stiffness 4 2 surge free decay the surge free decay model tests were carried out to get the natural surge periods and damping ratios of these systems since all free decay time series are similar and not easy to distinguish these curves will not be presented however the key information obtained from surge free decay tests are displayed in table 4 the period denoted as t and the critical damping cc are defined as 43 t 2 π m m a d d e d k 44 c c 2 m m a d d e d k where m is the model displacement m a d d e d is the added mass in surge and k is the mooring system stiffness in surge as shown in table 4 the damping ratio of each system is similar which is around 4 of the critical damping however the damping ratio of tm f is relatively small compared to other cases 4 3 irregular wave model tests the 100 year typhoon condition in south china sea is chosen as the environmental condition which is given by the jonswap spectrum with a significant wave height 13 7 m a peak period of 16s and a peak enhancement factor of 2 4 totally two wave headings were considered including beam sea wave heading is 90 and head sea wave heading is 180 the results will be discussed below 5 mooring system damping the model tests are always considered as the most credible method to study the dynamics of floating structures however it is not easy to apply an experimental method to study the mooring induced damping directly in a real sea states since it is difficult to measure the mooring tensions in x y and z direction as well as fairlead motion responses in this study the de coupled technique is used to deal with this problem this method includes two steps to obtain mooring induced damping first the platform 6dof motion responses were measured in the irregular wave model tests then the platform motion responses are considered as the input to calculate the horizontal motions and horizontal tensions at fairlead point of each mooring line with the de coupled method the flow chart is given in fig 10 for easier understanding the procedure of the de coupled technique used in this paper the waves generated in the basin should be validated before the irregular wave model tests were carried out the measured wave elevations and spectrum are compared with the targets and the results are given in fig 11 it can be observed that the waves generated in the basin agreed well with the target value and the irregular and satisfied to the requirement of model tests 5 1 beam sea the platform motion responses were measured with a 6 dof non contact optical system furthermore the mooring tensions were recorded simultaneously by the tension sensors installed at the top end of each mooring line the results of model tests should be checked first to get rid of the obvious errors as shown in fig 12 abnormal signals were found during 500s 700s in the irregular wave model test of tmb p which was due to the problem of wave maker therefore only the responses after 800s the full scale value is about 5657s will be studied and compared in beam sea after measuring the 6 dof motion responses of the floating structure the numerical mooring tensions can be solved by applying the de coupled method given in fig 10 however the accuracy of the numerical methods should be validated the most loaded mooring line of each model tests are selected investigation object the numerical results are then compared to the corresponding measured values the mooring tensions time series during the period of 6 000s 8 000s are plotted and shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the main variations trends of the numerical simulations curves match well with model tests results despite of amplitudes discrepancies furthermore from the results in table 5 it can be found that the deviations are less than 14 which can be considered a validation of the accuracy of the simulation results the critical damping of the floating structure in sway can be obtained once the stiffness of the mooring system in sway and system mass are known the numerical mooring system restoring force curves in sway are shown in fig 14 the sway stiffness of the systems can then be obtained from sway restoring curves in fig 14 and the details are given in table 6 it can be observed that tm f and tmb f have similar stiffness values while the stiffness of tm p is the smallest among all these systems the numerical sway free decay simulations were performed to obtain the natural periods and damping the sway decay curves are given in fig 15 and the results are shown in table 6 it is found that ta has the greatest damping while the amount of tm p damping is small compared to the other systems furthermore it is observed that the damping is increasing with pretension for the same mooring line the equivalent mooring line damping of the different mooring systems are given in fig 16 it can be clearly seen that the tmb lines especially tmb f induced considerable larger mooring damping than the other type mooring lines the damping induced by mooring lines of ta are close to tm p except for the mooring lines installed in the upwind side 1 6 where it can be seen that the mooring damping of ta are greater than tm p it may be explained that the mooring lines of ta have greater dynamics compared to the tm p mooring lines because the weights added at the end tm p mooring lines provide additional restoring force to the system and prevent the mooring line from stretching as a result the differences between dynamics of upwind mooring lines of these two mooring systems will be enlarged since they contribute most to keep the platform in position and suffer much more loads to the mooring lines installed in opposite side furthermore it can also be observed that pretension increase could improve mooring damping to some extent it is understood that the mooring line with higher pretension will have additional stretching and more sensitive to wave frequency motion johanning et al 2007 and these two factors would induce the improvement of mooring dynamics the mooring system damping can then be obtained by adding each mooring line damping and the results are shown in table 7 and plotted in fig 17 as shown in table 7 the tm p system induces the smallest damping and the amount of ta damping is slightly greater than tm p however an opposite result can be found in the damping ratio between these two systems besides it is seen that the effects of mooring line pretensions on mooring damping are significant for detail it is found that by increasing the pretension the tm mooring system damping is increased by 25 7 while the damping ratio is increased by 6 7 while for tmb the damping and damping ratio are increased 26 and 11 6 respectively an interesting phenomenon can be observed that the damping of tmb p is 34 6 greater than ta despite they have equal pretensions furthermore by comparing the damping results in table 6 with table 7 it is found that the mooring system damping will be considerably underestimated by free decay tests method the irregular wave method is essential to study mooring induced damping the relation between damping and low frequency motion response is very a complicated problem the raising of the amplitude of low frequency can improve the damping value webster 1995 yang et al 2016 but on the other hand the amplitude of low frequency motion response would decrease with damping increasing in this paper the analysis of the relations between them is carried out the spectral analysis is carried out and the results are given in fig 18 which shows that the sway motions are dominated by low frequency responses a significant peak can be found near the natural frequency of each system the tm f has the largest spectral peak value located in the low frequency which is followed by tmb f furthermore another apparent spectral peak can be found in the range of wave frequency which would contribute to mooring damping increasing huse and matsumoto 1988 yang et al 2016 the effect of wave frequency components motions on tmb damping are more significant than other mooring systems due to additional hydrodynamic effects from buoys and weights which could be one of the reasons why the damping of tmb are always greater than other systems for better presenting the sway responses the statistics are calculated and given in table 8 where the maximum heights are the gaps between maximum and minimum responses amplitudes as shown in table 8 it can be observed that the sway response of tm f is the severest on the contrary tmb f is the most stable type owing to its great damping value furthermore by comparing table 7 with table 8 it can be seen that the sway standard deviations are closely related to mooring damping i e the system with great sway standard deviations always induce more mooring damping except for the tmb systems in the following discussion the study is focused on low frequency components and the wave frequency components are filtered from the original sway motion responses with the cutoff frequency of 0 21 rad s the low frequency components of sway motions are plotted in fig 19 which shows that the low frequency sway motion peaks of ta and tm systems occur at around 10 000s while the peaks of tmb systems occur among 6 500s 7 000s but smaller than the peaks of others the statistics are given in table 9 which shows clearly that the low frequency motions are reduced with the mooring damping increasing except for tm f the results indicate that the mooring system damping play significant role in low frequency motions reduction another interesting topic is the relation between mooring damping and mooring tensions and they are also interacted with each other the mooring line axial stretching can improve mooring tensions as well as mooring line damping johanning et al 2007 on the other hand the increased mooring line damping can reduce the motion response which would cause of mooring tension to decrease in this paper the relation between these two is studied the mooring tensions at the mooring line top ends as well as the platform sway motions are plotted in fig 20 the time series durations are selected as 1 000s which contain the maximum tensions and maximum sway motions fig 20 shows that the maximum tension of all these systems occur almost simultaneously with the maximum sway motions which shows that the mooring tensions are closely related to sway motions and the axial stretching is an important factor to induce mooring dynamics the maximum mooring tensions of each system are given in table 10 the static tensions are obtained by moving the platform to the positions where the maximum tensions occur and then solving the static equations at this position the dynamic tensions are then obtained by subtracting the static tensions from total tensions as shown in table 10 the mooring tensions are dominated by static tensions the dynamic tensions are small parts compared with the static components especially for tmb p system furthermore it is found tmb f has greater tension than tmb p despite it has smaller sway motion this phenomenon may be explained that the tension of tmb f is more sensitive to motion responses which can be clearly seen in fig 9 besides it can be clearly observed that mooring lines with greater pretensions would be easier to onset mooring dynamics if compare the results of tm f and tm p tmb f and tmb p 5 2 head sea similar to beam sea the accuracy of the numerical results in head sea should be first validated before carrying out the next work the mooring lines which have the greatest tension of each mooring system will be studied the comparisons of mooring tensions time series among the range of 6000s 8000s between numerical results and model results are shown in fig 21 as shown in fig 21 the numerical results match well with the measured data and if observed carefully it can be found that the results of the hybrid systems with low pretension tm p tmb p have more satisfactory results compared to other systems this may be mainly due to two reasons firstly compared to the taut mooring system which has the identical pretension to tm p and tmb p the weights added on the end mooring lines could in some extent prevent mooring line from stretching which is the main factor to induce mooring dynamics secondly the mooring dynamics of these two mooring lines are less sensitive to floater motion responses compared to the tm f and tmb f besides it can also be noticed that the axial stiffness of the mooring lines in this paper are small and the springs used to simulate mooring stiffness could be stretched largely for the mooring lines with great pretensions during model tests which cannot considered in the numerical model and could bring deviations the relevant research can be found in chen et al 2001 the statics of mooring line tensions are shown in table 11 the greatest difference can be found in the maximum tension of the ta system which equals to 17 4 while the errors of other values are under 16 however the numerical results are still convincing the mooring line damping of different systems are then calculated according to eq 42 each mooring line damping of each mooring system are shown in fig 22 according to fig 22 it is found that the mooring damping of tmb f are larger than other systems which is followed by tm f when the pretension of the hybrid mooring system is kept the same to ta it can be observed that the leeward mooring lines 4 10 of the hybrid mooring system dissipate either greater or similar energy to ta however for the mooring line being installed in the upwind side the mooring line damping induced by ta is going to overtake hybrid mooring line damping due to the effects of line stretching the mooring systems damping can then be obtained by adding the damping of each mooring line where the details can be found in table 11 and fig 23 in table 11 it can be seen that for three mooring system cases with identical pretension the ta has a comparable damping level to tm p and tmb p which accounts for about 15 of system critical damping for details the damping of tmb p is slightly greater than ta due to the contributions of buoys furthermore as described above for these mooring lines to suffer relatively large loads being installed in the upwind side the weights could cause a decrease of mooring damping which leads to total system damping reduction the system damping of ta is a little bigger than tm p however the damping ratio of tm p is slightly greater than ta in the meanwhile it is observed that the pretensions have significant effects on mooring damping the damping of tm and tmb increased by 21 9 and 24 1 when the pretension increase from 2122 kn to 2700 kn and 2535 kn respectively as shown in fig 24 the surge motions are dominated by low frequency components the wave frequency peaks can be found around 0 38 rad s which contribute to the improvement of mooring damping level the low frequency peaks of different systems occur on almost the same frequency due to their similar nature periods which can be found in table 4 the surge motion statistics are given in table 12 which shows that unlike to beam sea case the surge motion standard deviations decrease with the increase of mooring system damping it may be explained that mooring systems damping have already developed to a considerable level and the effects of mooring damping on motion responses are dominate to the effects of motions on mooring damping the mooring tensions at the mooring line top ends as well as the platform surge motions are plotted in fig 25 as shown in the figures below the maximum mooring tensions and surge responses peaks occur almost simultaneously which show that the surge motion responses have direct effects on mooring tensions the mooring tensions are then calculated and presented in table 13 the static mooring tensions are obtained with the method described above as shown in table 13 the tm p has the smallest mooring tension despite it has a relatively large surge motion which is owing to the influences of installed weights and the low pretension adopted make it is less sensitive to surge motion by comparing the tensions of tmb p and ta it can be found that the mooring tension and mooring dynamics are reduced by 9 3 and 20 4 respectively it can be understood that there are two factors contribute to the phenomenon that tmb p has smaller tensions compared to ta firstly the greater mooring damping of tmb p would induce more moderate surge motion secondly by referring to fig 9 it can be found that the tension of tmb p is less sensitive to the sway motion than ta the results show that the tmb p is a quite competitive design case which reduces both motion responses and mooring tensions see table 14 besides the effects of mooring pretention on mooring tension could be clearly seen by comparing the results of tm f tm p and also tmb f tmb p for details the mooring tension and dynamics are increased by 26 1 and 50 4 when the pretension of tm is improved from 2122 kn to 2700 kn for the tmb systems these two values are increased slightly which are 13 2 and 10 4 respectively the reason for tension increase with pretensions has been explained above which can be understood that the mooring lines with high pretension are more sensitive to surge motion and are easier to onset mooring dynamics besides the results also demonstrate that the mooring tensions of tmb are less sensitive to pretension increasing compared to tm system especially for the dynamic component 6 conclusions the mooring top tensions comparisons between numerical simulations and model tests results indicate that the numerical method is capable of predicting the mooring damping and dynamics accurately despite of small discrepancies both friction between weights and seabed as well as the uncertain drag and added mass coefficients could contribute to the differences besides the current numerical method is not capable to simulate large mooring line stretching which could induce errors the free decay method is an efficient method to obtain system critical damping the damping ratio can be read from still water free decay curves then the system damping can be easily obtained by multiplying the damping ratio to the critical damping however it should be noticed the system damping obtained by free decay could be underestimated so a further study needs to be carried out to carry out model tests to study dynamics of semi submersible moored with different mooring systems and then apply de coupled technique is a novel and quite efficient way to study mooring damping in real sea states the results indicate that the mooring tensions and induced damping are closely related when considering the weights being installed on taut mooring line but keeping the pretension as a constant tm p the attached weights will provide restoring forces to the system and prevent the mooring line from stretching which may reduce mooring damping the buoys play positive role in increasing the mooring induced damping by noticing that the sway and surge motions of all systems have non negligible wave frequency components which could increase drag forces and inertial forces due to the added buoy and mooring damping is increased as a consequence on the other hand once the buoy is being installed the hanging angle at the top end of mooring line would be reduced which could increase horizontal tensions even if the axial tensions are the same the mooring damping would increase accordingly the mooring systems damping interacts with sway and surge motions by comparing the mooring system damping and sway motions of different systems it can be concluded that the sway motions increase would give rise to mooring system damping increase however when the mooring system damping is increased to a certain level that would in turn to reduce sway motions however by removing the effects of wave frequency components motions it can be seen that the low frequency components of sway motions of different systems would mainly be reduced with mooring damping increasing tmb f system has the largest sway damping which is 13 9 of system critical damping furthermore it should be kept in mind that the standard deviation of low frequency motion is the significant factor to measure the amount of mooring system damping as for the surge motion responses the mooring line damping always play a significant positive role in the reduction of motion responses standard deviation due to considerable amount of mooring damping besides the tmb f system has the largest surge damping which amount to 18 2 system critical damping mooring tensions are closely related to platform motion responses and mooring line properties the tmb mooring is a very desirable design since they have greater damping and the motion responses are more stable besides the mooring tensions are less sensitive to motion response indeed mooring pretension has significant effect on mooring damping and mooring tensions the design case with great mooring pretension would induce larger mooring system stiffness as well as mooring damping which would reduce floating structure motion response without no doubt however it does not mean the dynamic mooring tension would be reduced in contrast mooring line dynamics would be more sensitive to motion response the mooring may have large loads despite small motions which may cause mooring line failure therefore it should be taken great care to choose

23528,wake induced vibrations are considered distinctively different from well known vortex induced vibrations where bluff body structures vibrate under vortex shedding in the wake of flows passing through them understanding characteristics of wake induced vibrations plays an important role in design of marine offshore structures such as platform columns risers operating at high reynolds number currents this work presents an extensive study of wake induced vibrations using a computational fluid dynamics approach the numerical model is based on an incompressible navier stokes flow solver with a hybrid detached eddy simulation des approach for turbulence modelling of high reynold number flows the hybrid des approach is first validated for wake induced vibrations at subcritical reynolds number ranging from 10 3 10 5 comparison between numerical results and experiment shows very good agreement in prediction of downstream cylinder responses including amplitudes frequency and phase angle data from numerical simulations is then used to characterize and study mechanisms of wake induced vibrations by looking at detailed force components and their frequencies in relation to cylinder responses the effect of different reynolds number flow conditions in tandem cylinder responses are also analysed in the present work it is found that reynolds number has strong influence in changing response amplitude and frequency of cylinders in wake induced vibrations keywords flow induced vibrations vortex induced vibrations computational fluid dynamics detached eddy simulations high reynolds number flows fluid structure interactions 1 introduction understanding of environment loads due to waves and currents is important in designing offshore structures such as cables risers mooring line systems apart from hydrostatic pressure forces offshore structures under cross currents are normally subjected to dynamic load due to the well known vortex shedding phenomena coupled interaction of vortex shedding from bluff bodies with its structural flexibility causes vibration responses of the structure this vortex induced vibration viv is widely observed in various types of cylindrical structures in oceans heat exchanger tubes as well as chimney stacks among others these vibrations have been extensively studied in the literature williamson and govardhan 2004 and are modelled as resonant vibrations of elastically mounted and isolated rigid cylinders vibrations associated with the viv phenomenon are known to have large amplitudes in an extended lock in frequency region where the response frequency f is maintained at near the natural frequency f n of the structure over a range of driving frequencies f f in most of offshore installations including deep sea oil rig platforms risers are arranged in bundles and arrays under array arrangement risers and similar cylindrical structures under cross flows may not only be affected by viv but they also interfere with each other it has been observed and noted paidoussis and price 1988 that arrays of cylinders are further subject to fluid elastic instabilities that arise from interactions between adjacent cylinders in the array also termed wake induced vibrations wiv these instabilities have been recognized as a distinct phenomenon from viv and have been investigated extensively as well zdravkovich 1977 bokaian and geoola 1984 brika and laneville 1999 mittal and kumar 2001 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 assi et al 2010a 2010b huera huarte and bearman 2011 assi et al 2013 chaplin and batten 2014 assi 2014 however to date no coherent theory has emerged on the wiv phenomenon even though analyses involving nonlinear oscillators facchinetti et al 2002 armin and srinil 2013 gallardo et al 2014 and wake stiffness assi et al 2010b 2013 assi 2014 have been proposed in particular it has been suggested that wiv is not a resonant phenomenon and that the response and driving frequencies are equivalent assi et al 2010b 2013 assi 2014 in addition due to the coupling between the motion of the structure and the flow of the surrounding fluid particularly the generation of vortices from the interaction between the fluid and the structure it is conceivable that the frequency decomposition of the driving force is time varying and possibly a harmonic majority of earlier work on wake induced vibrations are physical experiment listed above including many scaled model as well as full scale tests while computational fluid dynamics cfd has become popular in engineering applications over the past few decades its application in modelling and simulations of wake induced vibrations is still limited and lacking behind experimental work among those limitations of cfd models for wake induced vibration simulations is its predictive capabilities at high reynolds number flows in the range of re 10 4 10 6 corresponding to operational conditions of most offshore structures direct numerical simulations dns have been attempted for vortex induced vibrations at re 10 4 dong et al 2006 however at the range of higher reynolds number conditions dns becomes inhibited due to unrealistic computational demand even with present powerful computing infrastructures significance of resolving flows past cylinders at high reynolds number has increasingly motivated the cfd community to explore various advanced turbulent modelling techniques from traditional industrial unsteady reynolds average navier stokes urans rosetti et al 2012 models to large eddy simulations les feymark et al 2012 in rans all turbulence is modelled and it solves for ensemble average quantities by separating flows to mean and fluctuating parts rans models normally require some empirical approximation to model turbulent fluctuations in les larger turbulent scales are resolved while small scales called subgrid scales sgs are modelled a spatial filtering is then employed to separate the resolved turbulence from its modelled counterpart for accurate les predictions it requires a suitable filtering mechanism to separate large wave components from smaller ones at a cut off frequency moreover it also restricts the time step and grid sizes especially for wall bounded flows as an attempt to strike a balance between resolving and modelling detached eddy simulations des travin et al 2000 spalart 2009 was introduced as a hybrid rans les approach one can refer to those work as well as references cited therein for more details on the applications of various turbulence models for simulations of flow induced vibrations in this work a fluid structure interactions numerical model is presented as an alternative tool for investigation of wake induced vibrations here a fluid flow solver based on a des approach nguyen et al 2015 for turbulence modelling at high reynolds number flows was used for simulations of wake induced vibrations the main objectives of the current work is two fold it is first to validate the fsi model through extensive benchmarking with experimental studies in prediction of wiv responses of tandem cylinders at the same flow conditions with physical experiment set ups the numerical model is capable of predicting wiv responses with pronounced agreement to earlier experimental data thus making it a suitable alternative tool for further study of wiv phenomena secondly it is to demonstrate the application of the developed model for investigation of wake induced vibrations in complementing physical experiment in particular the numerical model is capable of providing more detailed analysis of flow features while allowing more control in setting up the experiment it is with this expectation that the numerical model can further advance physical understanding of wake interactions on tandem cylinder s responses the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in the next section a brief introduction about the fsi model and numerical experiment s set up are presented this includes details of numerical methodologies as well as grid generation boundary conditions in section 3 we present the validation of the model with earlier experimental studies to establish model s fidelity for subsequent analysis of forces and responses of wake induced vibrations the following section 4 discuses a study of reynolds number effects on wiv different from most of physical experimental set up reynolds number in the numerical study is maintained for variation of reduced velocities to decouple their effects on wiv responses the effect of reynolds number conditions on different wiv tests are investigated in details to provide insights on characteristics and mechanism of wiv responses some conclusion remarks from the current study are presented in the last section 2 model and methodology 2 1 physical setup in this work a canonical setup of cylinders in tandem arrangement was constructed in the numerical model similar to many earlier experimental studies here we consider effects of a long slender cylinder cylinder 1 on vibrations of an elastically mounted and parallel downstream cylinder of the same length l cylinder 2 as briefly illustrated in fig 1 generally cylinder 1 with diameter d 1 is fixed to a rigid frame while cylinder 2 with diameter d 2 is mounted to the rigid frame with effective spring constant k and effective damping constant c structural responses of the downstream cylinder are characterized by its natural frequency and damping ratio defined as follows 1 ω n k m ζ n c 2 k m here m is the effective mass of the downstream cylinder taking the direction of the cylinder axes to be the z axis and the downstream direction to be the x axis we further define cylinder 2 to be of distance x 0 downstream of cylinder 1 in the x direction and distance y 0 above cylinder 1 in the y direction in the present work we consider the two cylinders are of the same diameters d 1 d 2 d the problem is further simplified by restricting the motion of the downstream cylinder 2 to the y direction and call its instantaneous displacement from the equilibrium position y ˆ as previously studied by various authors zdravkovich 1977 bokaian and geoola 1984 hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010b we assume that both cylinders are completely immersed in a newtonian fluid with density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ in addition the fluid is moving uniformly in the x direction and has a speed of u far away from the cylinders under cross flows conditions characterized by reynolds number re d ρ u d μ vortex shedding from cylinders result in force fluctuations acting on the cylinder causing vibrations which in turns change vortex shedding modes and flow dynamics generally frequency of vortex shedding from a cylinder can be defined as 2 f v st u d where st is the dimensionless strouhal number associated with the flow and bluff body geometry u is the characteristic in flow velocity in addition we define the reduced velocity 3 u r u d f 0 which is another dimensionless number describing the ratio of the characteristic in flow velocity to the characteristic cross flow velocity scale here f 0 is the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder in this work we consider an in line arrangement where both cylinders lie on the x axis in a tandem arrangement giving y 0 0 for tandem arrangement between the cylinders the spacing distance x 0 is taken to be sufficiently large that vortices develop between the two cylinders this excludes the scenario of near wake interference considered by some authors borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 huera huarte and bearman 2011 responses of downstream cylinders in tandem arrangement can be written as a function of non dimensional numbers assi et al 2010b 4 y ˆ d g re d st x 0 d f f 0 ζ n m here f denotes response frequency of the downstream cylinder and m is the mass ratio measuring the ratio of cylinder mass to the displaced fluid mass it is clear that multiple factors influence characteristics and responses of a cylinder in a wake of another upstream cylinder in this work we first focused on validating the numerical models with experimental data at selected flow regimes and physical parameters subsequently a detailed analysis of flows at different reynolds numbers were conducted to understand its effects on wiv responses table 1 summarizes different conditions considered in this work 2 2 fluid structure interaction computational model we propose to use a strong coupled fluid structured interaction fsi computational model to investigate response of cylinders in tandem arrangement under different conditions the numerical model based on our earlier work nguyen and nguyen 2016 strongly couples a hybrid detached eddy simulation des flow solver with six degree of freedoms 6dof solver for solving fsi response of downstream cylinders under cross flows and wakes from upstream cylinder here flows over cylinders are modelled as viscous incompressible fluids governed by the incompressible navier stokes equations that express the conservation of mass and momentum using reynolds decomposition the governing navier stokes equations can be written as follows 5 u 0 6 u t uu 1 ρ p ν 2 u 1 ρ τ r in these equations velocity vector is denoted by u ρ is the density p is the pressure and ν is the kinemtaic viscosity of the fluid the overbar denotes time averages of the variables in the present work water is considered as newtonian fluid of density ρ 1000 kg m 3 and kinematic viscosity of ν 1 0 10 6 m 2 s 1 the last term on the above momentum equation is normally referred to as the reynolds stress tensor τ r ρ u u the system is closed with appropriate boundary conditions imposed on the boundary of the domain γ δ ω 7 u u in γ d 8 σ n t in γ n where domain boundary is separated as γ γ n γ d denoting a neumann and dirichlet boundary respectively more detailed boundary conditions for the simulations are described in the next section in this work a hybrid rans les model is employed for turbulence modelling for hybrid rans les approach a des formulation is implemented and based on menter s k ω sst model strelets 2001 and later modified in menter and kuntz 2004 by making the rans model become length scale aware in this implementation in the les mode the turbulent length scale is no longer a pure les length scale but based on the subgrid scale turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate in order to prevent the grid induced separation in pure des form due to fine grid resolution near wall spalart 2009 causing unsteadiness in the boundary layer the des length scale is modified to disable les in boundary layer region using the model blending function the system of governing equations is then solved using the unstructured collocated finite volume method in arbitrary lagragian eulerian framework with pressure implicit with splitting operators piso for pressure velocity coupling responses of the downstream cylinder in transverse direction represented as spring mass damper system are governed by the equation of motion written as 9 m 2 y ˆ c 2 y ˆ k 2 y ˆ f y here y ˆ is the transverse cylinder displacement and f y is the force component in y direction the force acting on the cylinder is evaluated by integrating pressure and viscous force obtained from the navier stokes flow solver 10 f y γ c y l e y p i τ n d s here i is the identity tensor and e y is the unit vector in y direction the equation of motion is discretized in time using leapfrog scheme and coupled with the flow solver in each of the pressure velocity coupling outer corrector iteration thus rendering a strong coupling approach for the fluid structure interaction system for detailed description of the hybrid des model used in this work one can refer to the earlier work nguyen and nguyen 2016 and references cited therein 2 3 computational grid and numerical schemes the computational domain and typical mesh topology for all simulations of flows over tandem cylinder arrangement in the present work are shown in fig 2 the domain is extended to 15 d in upstream and 30 d in the wake direction from the downstream cylinder where d is the diameter of the downstream cylinder in the cross flow direction typically it is extended to about 20 d depending on the blockage ratio used in experimental set ups velocity inlet condition was specified at the inlet boundary and pressure outlet condition was applied in the downstream boundary on the cylinder walls no slip conditions were specified while slip conditions are for the top and bottom boundaries hybrid rans les simulations require strict mesh grading of boundary layer mesh with y 1 while sufficient mesh resolution in the wake to enable les model here hexahedral dominated grids with topology shown in fig 2 b are generated with higher resolution closer to the cylinders to save computational cost the focus region is typically about 20 10 d in most of the simulations flows in the current range of reynolds number are inherently three dimensional and the span size of cylinder strongly affects the flow dynamics especially lift fluctuations it was recommended that an aspect ratio of l d 9 12 is required to fully capture the three dimensional flow features norberg 2003 from our earlier study nguyen and nguyen 2016 the aspect ratio of l d 9 was used in all of the current simulations except otherwise specified a hexahedral dominated mesh is generated for the above computational domain using snappyhexmesh tool in openfoam for hybrid rans les simulations extra care is required for mesh generation to avoid ambiguous grid densities spalart et al 2006 in this work the near wall boundary layer mesh resolution is always maintained a y 1 for a given reynolds number flow regime the first layer thickness δ y 1 can be estimated a priori based on y and a friction velocity u as δ y 1 y μ ρ u in which friction velocity is computed from a skin friction formula for flatplate at the specified reynolds number from the first boundary layer thickness the mesh resolution in the focus region can be determined based on a user defined stretching ratio δ s δ x δ y 1 thus providing number of necessary refinement levels in this region it is worth noticing that the mesh is not further stretched in spanwise direction as isotropic refinement is applied in the computational domain flows over cylinders at this range of reynolds number exhibits highly unsteady characteristics and were simulated using the transient dynamic mesh motion solver implemented in openfoam framework nguyen and nguyen 2016 similarly to our earlier work a second order linear interpolation scheme was used for convective terms while a cell limiting scheme determining the limited gradient along a line connecting adjacent cell centres was used for the discretization of diffusive terms non orthogonal and skewness correctors were also employed to maintain second order accuracy on unstructured meshes for all the simulations in this work the linear solvers of geometric algebraic multi grid solvers gamg and preconditioned bi conjugate gradient pbicg were used to solve the pressure and velocity respectively in addition the turbulence equations were solved by the smooth solver in each step until a convergence tolerance was met the convergence criterion was set to 10 8 for turbulence variables and 10 6 for other quantities to give reasonably good convergent results from prior experience second order implicit backward scheme is employed to advance the system in time with maximum cfl number of 0 5 0 75 for all of the simulations for handling 6 dof motions of cylinder under wake induced vibration a dynamic morphing mesh approach was used to deform computational meshes where mesh motion is interpolated from cylinder s motions using spherical linear interpolation using this approach the mesh is deformed according to cylinder motions while maintaining its smoothness and preserving mesh quality in boundary layer regions of solid body motions 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 verification and validation for fixed cylinders in tandem arrangement while the model had been well validated for vortex induced vibrations of single cylinders at sub critical reynolds numbers in our previous work nguyen and nguyen 2016 it was again further validated for the present setting of tandem cylinder arrangement there are numerous experimental work in literature on investigation of flows over tandem cylinders igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 alam et al 2003 including a comprehensive review sumner 2010 and many other references cited therein a similar set up of cylinders in tandem as in ljungkrona et al 1991 was chosen for benchmarking of the current model the set up comprises two cylinders with the same diameter of d 20 mm arranged in line with separation distance of x d 4 and blockage ratio of 6 3 the cylinders were under flows of reynolds number re 2 10 4 with inlet turbulent intensity of t u 0 1 a similar set up was also used in recent work kitagawa and ohta 2008 for validation of large eddy simulations les for flows over tandem cylinders with slightly higher reynolds number of r e 2 2 10 4 fig 3 shows an instantaneous profile of three dimensional wake structures for the tandem cylinder arrangement in more details fig 4 depicts flow velocity contour at the center cut plane of the domain and the des indicator contour here the des indicator is measured as the ratio of the length scale between les and rans from fig 4b the dark region in the wake is the active les region while the rans model is only activated in the boundary layer regions around the cylinders as well as the far field this has demonstrated that the hybrid rans les model works as expected to resolve the wake flows with les while rans is employed to model wall bounded flows it is believed that resolving the wakes appropriately well and their interaction with the downstream cylinder provides more accurate computations of forces acting on the cylinder thus giving good prediction of wake induced vibrations table 2 summarizes results of the force coefficients on the upstream and downstream cylinders for different mesh sizes the meshes were refined by reducing the stretching ratio between the cell size in the focus region and the first boundary layer thickness which is kept at a constant value of δ y 1 1 58 10 4 m to maintain y 1 at this reynolds number in the current work c d denotes the mean of drag force coefficient and c l is the root mean squared r m s lift coefficient measuring fluctuation of lift forces on the cylinders as the mesh was refined from δ s 60 to 30 the mean drag coefficient and lift fluctuation on the upstream and downstream cylinder approached a converged value the grid convergence index gci was computed from the mean drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder on the two consecutive grids and shown in the table as the grid was refined from level 3 to 4 the gci value is less than 1 it shows that the numerical prediction is approaching the asymptotic numerical value in our subsequent simulations grid level 3 or equivalent at different reynolds numbers was employed to sufficiently guarantee numerical grid convergence it is noted that there is a discrepancy between asymptotic numerical prediction and experimental data especially for the mean drag coefficient on the downstream cylinder pressure distribution on downstream cylinder is plotted in fig 5 along the circumference of cylinder the mean and root mean square fluctuation of pressure coefficients c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 2 are compared between the present computation with experimental data as well as les results obtained from the similar reynolds number in good agreement it can be seen that the mean pressure coefficient tends to flatten out in the back of the downstream cylinder with lower fluctuation as compared to the front part which is in direct impingement of upstream wakes this results in much higher lift fluctuation and lower drag on the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 6 force coefficients c l d f l d 1 2 ρ l d u 2 on the upstream and downstream cylinder are compared with experimental data as depicted in table 3 the current numerical model provides lower predictions of force coefficient for upstream cylinder as compared to experiment as well as les at the reynolds number re 2 10 4 for downstream cylinder the present results show higher mean drag and lower fluctuations as compared to experimental data given uncertainties in force measurement on the cylinder due to various factors such as aspect ratio and blocking ratio the numerical prediction for force coefficients are consistently well within the range of data reported in literatures sumner 2010 in fig 7 a power spectra of cross flow velocity are plotted at a point in between the separation between two cylinders and a point in the wake of the downstream cylinder the strouhal frequency was clearly shown in the flow spectra for both points higher frequency peaks are also clearly present more in velocity spectrum in the wake of downstream cylinder probably due to interaction of upstream wakes with downstream cylinder shear layers however a single frequency response is observed from force spectrum of lift coefficients on both upstream and downstream cylinders as shown in fig 7 b fig 8 depicted the variation of force coefficients on the cylinders for a fixed arrangement of x 0 d 4 awith the offset distance of y 0 d 1 similar to one of the conditions tested in the earlier experiment assi et al 2010b different to the above in line tandem arrangement the mean lift coefficient of the downstream cylinder is negative in this case and it acts as a restoring force to pull the cylinder towards the centerline this is believe is one of the key mechanism explaining wake induced vibrations this observation is consistent with the earlier experimental data it can also be seen that the fluctuation of lift force coefficient on the downstream cylinder is much higher than the upstream s one while the force frequency is the same on both cylinders corresponding to strouhal number of around s t 0 2 the increment in lift force is due to interactions of upstream cylinder wakes with the downstream cylinder showing effects of vortices from the upstream cylinder on the downstream one in fig 9 wake structures of the cylinders in tandem are plotted at the maximum and minimum lift force conditions at the maximum lift condition in fig 9 a upstream vortices induce a high speed flow at the bottom side of the cylinder and accelerate a shear layer from the same side thus increasing lift force on the downstream cylinder when the upstream vortices impinge on the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 9 b it interact with the shedded vortex from downstream cylinder and resulted in a smaller lift force a similar wake structures was also observed in the experiment assi et al 2010b where a complex vortex structure interaction resulted in enhancing and diminishing the lift force acting on the downstream cylinder 3 2 validation for wake induced vibration cylinders in tandem arrangement we next consider a case of a vibrating cylinder in a tandem arrangement with an upstream cylinder and zero transvered offset distance the test case follows the same experimental setup in assi et al 2010b in which a cylinder of distance x 0 d 5 from upstream and fixed cylinder is free to move in cross flow direction under different reduced velocities in the numerical study the downstream cylinder is modelled as six degree of freedom rigid body with the same mass ratio m 2 6 and structural damping of ζ 0 7 as in the experiment here the cylinder was constrained to only oscillate in the cross flow direction the history of displacement and lift force coefficients of the downstream cylinder was plotted in fig 10 for reduced velocity of u r 15 corresponding to reynolds number of r e 1 5 10 4 it can be seen that the downstream cylinder oscillated with a single frequency close to its natural frequency while power spectrum of lift coefficient shows multiple frequency components in the driving force acting on the cylinder comparison of response amplitude between present numerical simulations and experimental study is shown in fig 11 for downstream cylinder at different reduced velocities it is noted from fig 11 that displacement amplitude increases with increase of reduced velocity for the cylinder in tandem this is a distinct behaviour of wake induced vibrations as compared to single cylinder vortex induced vibrations in viv response amplitude is large only in a range of reduced velocity where natural frequency matches with vortex shedding frequency away from this locked in region cylinder response amplitude is negligibly small for cylinders in wake induced vibrations the response is similar to viv in the region of low reduced velocity u r 8 while wakes from the upstream cylinder played a critical role in downstream cylinder s response at higher reduced velocity thus causing high amplitude responses fig 12 showed amplitude response of downstream cylinder with reduced velocities at different spacing between two cylinders numerical results showed the same trend as experiment data assi et al 2010b where response amplitude expectedly reduces with spacing distance it is clear that the present numerical results generally agrees well with the experimental data extracted from the earlier work assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 in prediction of wake induced vibration response for cylinder in tandem arrangement 3 3 force and displacement of cylinders in tandem distinctive responses of cylinder in tandem at high reduced velocity as shown in fig 11 have been attributed to complex interactions of cylinder wakes and its motions assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 outside of viv lock in regions wakes from upstream cylinder interacts with downstream cylinder s vortices causing downstream cylinder vibrations amplitude of downstream cylinder motions at high reduced velocity is dependent on distance between the two cylinders as shown in earlier work assi et al 2010b and the current numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data in fig 12 the response displacement of downstream cylinder was plotted against its lift force coefficient at different reduced velocities in fig 13 overlaying the data over one cycle of displacement shows multiple frequency modes in lift force coefficient the difference in phase and frequency between mean lift coefficient and mean displacement is clearly observed for all reduced velocities to further illustrate this characteristic of downstream cylinder in tandem fig 14 shows displacement spectral density as well as lift force spectrum of the downstream cylinder at different reduced velocities it is noted that the magnitude of displacement measured in root mean square gets higher with increase of reduced velocity as seen from the power spectral density plots the displacement response is at a single frequency while there are consistently two dominant frequencies in lift force component of the downstream cylinder at various reduced velocities one of the two dominant frequencies is the same as motion frequency of the downstream cylinder while the other frequency matches with vortex shedding frequency from upstream cylinder the presence of second frequency in lift force power spectrum demonstrates the effect of upstream wakes on the downstream cylinder response frequency of the downstream cylinder and the phase angle between the cylinder s lift coefficient and displacement were plotted in fig 15 for the same case of x d 5 it is found that the response frequency of the cylinder increases with reduced velocity and consistently matching with earlier experimental data moreover the response frequency of cylinder in wiv shown in fig 15 increasingly deviates from its natural frequency with increase of reduced velocity a shift in phase angle between force and displacement was observed at u r 6 similar to viv phenomena and it is noted that phase difference is measured only for the force component at the same frequency with response frequency the plots clearly showed that our results corroborate well with those obtained from experimental data assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 it is well understood that wiv responses of cylinders in tandem depends on many parameters including flow conditions as well as geometric configurations as illustrated in eq 4 coupled effects of those parameters results in complex and distinctive behaviours of wake induced vibrations responses with pronounced agreement in comparison to experimental data the present numerical model is capable of resolving key flow physics involved in wake induced vibrations additionally it provides an alternative analysis tool to further investigate mechanisms of wake induced vibrations in the next sections the numerical model is employed to further characterize as well as to study the effects of reynolds number on responses of cylinders in wake induced motions 3 4 effect of reynolds number on wake induced vibrations in most of the studies on wake induced vibrations assi et al 2010b assi 2014 chaplin and batten 2014 responses of the downstream cylinder are characterized with variation of reduced velocity while flow velocity conditions were normally altered to accommodate this variation due to changes in free stream velocity cylinders are effectively under varying reynolds number conditions during those test conditions it is believed that changes in reynolds number together with reduced velocity variation will have coupled effects on responses of cylinders in wake induced vibrations the dependence of vortex induced vibrations on reynolds number was experimentally studied in earlier work raghavan and bernitsas 2011 in which the authors showed a strong influence of reynolds number of viv response and characters of elastically mounted cylinder as reynolds number increases towards the end spectrum of subcritical region shear layers are fully turbulent with high lift fluctuations thus inducing higher response amplitude even under large damping ratios recently effects of reynolds number on wake induced vibration was investigated in assi et al 2013 to understand the concept of wake stiffness in response of cylinders in tandem it was interestingly concluded that the response of cylinder in wiv region is directly influenced by reynolds number and not reduced velocity in an attempt to further understanding on the effects of reynolds number on wake induced vibrations a numerical model of tandem cylinders was set up following earlier experiment except that the reynolds number was kept constant and the natural frequency of cylinder changed according to reduced velocity variation in this work numerical tests were performed at two fixed reynolds number of 10 4 and 3 10 4 similar to the earlier experiment hover et al 1997 hover and triantafyllou 2001 in which a force feedback system was employed to control cylinder structural response while towing at a constant speed in a tank these two reynolds number regimes were also chosen as representatives of average and maximum reynolds number conditions in assi et al 2010b experiment fig 16 shows the response amplitude and frequency of cylinder under in line tandem arrangement at x d 5 with varying and constant reynolds number the numerical results at constant reynolds number r e 10 4 was plotted against results from experiment for tandem cylinder at the varying reynolds number conditions assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 and single cylinder vortex induced vibration hover et al 1997 there are clear discrepancies in results of response amplitudes and frequencies of downstream cylinder in wake induced vibrations under constant and varying reynolds number conditions in the present constant reynolds number tests the amplitude response of downstream cylinder depicts similar trend as compared with single cylinder case at low reduced velocity u r 6 obtained from earlier experiment hover et al 1997 as shown in fig 16 a the peak response of cylinder in tandem a d 1 0 is observed at u r 6 and very close to response of single cylinder in viv lock in region this peak amplitude response of downstream cylinder at r e 10 4 is higher than cylinder in tandem with varying flow velocity test assi et al 2010b in viv regime due to difference of reynold number conditions in earlier experiment assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 reynolds number is less than 5 10 3 for u r 6 thus it is expected that response amplitude is lower as it was shown earlier for single cylinder test at varying reynolds number assi et al 2010b the peak response amplitude of a d 0 8 was also lower than single cylinder study at r e 10 4 hover et al 1997 the reynolds number effect is consistently observed in the viv regime of cylinder in tandem amplitude data for constant reynolds number study is closer to experimental data for reduced velocity around u r 10 where reynolds number is around 10 4 in experimental study at higher reduce velocities u r 10 response amplitude of downstream cylinder in the condition of constant reynolds number deviates further from experimental data as reduced velocity increases in contrast to increasing trend of response amplitude for varying reynold number experiment under constant reynolds number condition the response amplitude is maintained at a d 0 8 for a range of reduced velocity 10 u r 20 before decreasing further with increases of reduced velocity in fig 16 b response frequency of downstream cylinder was plotted against reduced velocity a similar trend in frequency is observed in both set ups where frequency is increasing with reduced velocity by deviating further from natural frequency however the response frequency of the downstream cylinder under constant reynolds number is lower than that in varying reynolds number conditions at high reduced velocity the reduction in response amplitude and frequency can be attributed to the difference in reynolds number at high reduced velocity in wake induced motions fig 17 showed spectrum of lift forces on the cylinders and response amplitude of downstream cylinder at the same reduced velocity condition of u r 20 but different reynolds number conditions response behaviour of the two cases are very similar with single frequency amplitude response under multiple frequency force as consistently found in wake induced motions the strouhal frequency of lift force component is higher with increasing of reynolds number it was reported in literature xu and zhou 2004 that there is strong dependency of strouhal number on reynolds number for cylinders in tandem at different tandem arrangement x d xu and zhou 2004 classified relationship of st on re into four categories based on the spacing distance between upstream and downstream cylinders for x d 3 5 there is a jump in st at re 5 10 3 1 5 10 4 dependent on x d the st number continues increasing after the jump until it tapers to a constant value at re 1 8 10 4 for all the spacing distances it is believed that the jump and increase of st number may contribute to the difference in response amplitude and frequency of cylinders in comparison between constant and varying re number wake induced motions higher shedding frequency from upstream and downstream cylinder resulted in increasing of response amplitude as well as frequency as shown in fig 17 fig 18 further illustrated the effect of reynolds number on forcing frequency and responses with increase of reduced velocity it can be seen that the force frequency of upstream cylinder increases with increase of reduced velocity in varying re number study while it remains the same for all reduced velocities in the case of constant re number this trend is consistently reflected in force spectrum of downstream cylinder including a shedding frequency and a lower frequency corresponding to its response frequency the present numerical results have been consistent with earlier analysis assi et al 2013 that wiv response amplitude is dependant on reynolds number the increase in amplitude at high reduced velocity is directly caused by the change in reynolds number in order to investigate further the effect of re number on wake induced motions a constant re number test was carried out at higher reynolds number re 3 05 10 4 to compare with hover and triantafyllou 2001 experiment and earlier study at re 10 4 the other conditions of the test are following the experimental setup where the mass ratio in this case is taken at m 3 0 slightly higher than the earlier varying re number test the distance between the two cylinders is adjusted to follow the experiment with x d 4 75 fig 19 shows comparison of numerical prediction of response amplitude and frequency with experiment at the same re number condition here the average 10 maximum amplitude a d 1 10 is calculated from numerical simulation data and compared with the same data from earlier experiment hover and triantafyllou 2001 the data was also plotted against data from hover and triantafyllou 2001 for x d 4 75 numerical agrees well with experiment data at the same re number condition for lower reduced velocity u r 6 where vortex induced motions is dominated at higher reduced velocity the average 1 10 amplitude is under predicted in numerical simulations for the range of 8 u r 17 tested in experiment results from present numerical study at higher reduced velocities u r 17 showed that the amplitude is reaching to the maximum value of a d 1 10 1 9 at u r 22 and stays in that range until u r 35 though the current numerical results does not match well with experiment it confirms a speculation from earlier experiment that large response amplitudes remains at higher reduced velocity the response frequency is similarly found to be the same between numerical and experimental data at high reduced velocity the response frequency could be twice of the cylinder natural frequency as observed in both numerical simulations and experiment fig 20 showed response amplitude and phase angle of downstream cylinder at two different reynolds number conditions of re 10 4 and 3 05 10 4 the response amplitude was computed as the standard root mean square values of motions and the reynolds numbers were kept constant for varying of reduced velocities the typical phase shift is observed in all the cases at reduced velocity corresponding to peak viv response the numerical results of phase shift agree well with experimental data the response amplitudes show discrepancies between different reynolds number conditions for a wide range of reduced velocities however the amplitude tends to converge to a finite value of a d 0 9 for re 3 05 10 4 higher than a d 0 5 for re 10 4 as the reduced velocity increases the current results is consistent with earlier similar constant reynolds number test in assi et al 2013 where response amplitudes asymptotically reach the values of free vibrating cylinders spectrum of response amplitude at different reduced velocities were plotted in fig 21 showing similar trend of increasing response frequencies with reduced velocity the frequencies is slightly higher at higher reynolds number conditions it is clear that wiv response amplitude increases with increase of reynolds number fig 22 showed variation of root mean square values of lift force coefficient on the downstream cylinder with reduced velocities at re 10 4 and re 3 05 10 4 in both cases the peak value of force coefficients on cylinder in tandem was obtained in the viv dominated region at low reduce velocity as reduced velocity increases lift force coefficient further reduces from the peak value and converges to a finite value of c l r m s for downstream cylinder in tandem at different reynolds number conditions the constant lift coefficients are slightly lower in higher reynolds number cases thus inducing higher response amplitudes in wake induced motions 4 conclusions this work had presented the application of numerical simulation approach for investigation of wake induced vibrations in high reynolds number flows the hybrid rans les approach has been successful in predicting wake induced motions of cylinders in tandem at spacing distance x d 4 5 and reynolds number r e 5 10 3 3 10 4 we validated the numerical results against two representative experiment with reasonably good agreement distinct wiv responses of large amplitude outside of typical viv lock in regions was well captured in numerical model it was also able to predict increase of response frequency with velocity increases as reported in various experimental study complex interactions between cylinders wakes and downstream cylinder motions resulted in finite cross flow forces acting on the cylinder the numerical results further illustrate the analysis on the mechanism of wiv where the vibration of downstream cylinder is cased by restoring lift fluctuation resulted from its interaction with upstream cylinder wake the effect of reynolds number in wake induced vibrations were analysed using the proposed numerical approach it confirmed that reynolds number has a strong influence on wake induced motions higher reynolds number caused larger wake induced vibration amplitude responses of tandem cylinders in varying reduced velocity at constant reynolds number revealed a different characteristic of response amplitude at high reduced velocity while the wiv amplitude was shown to remain large at high reduced velocities it tends to gradually taper off with increase of reduced velocity to a finite amplitude considered as free wiv amplitude this free vibration amplitude decreases as reynolds number reduces the current study has illustrated great potential of numerical simulation tools for investigation of wake induced vibration through extensive study of the phenomena however there remains many outstanding issues to be addressed in order to fully understanding the wake induced vibrations including the key mechanism governing the response frequency of a cylinder in tandem it will form the main scope of our future work in this direction acknowledgement the authors would like to express gratitude to many fruitful discussions

23528,wake induced vibrations are considered distinctively different from well known vortex induced vibrations where bluff body structures vibrate under vortex shedding in the wake of flows passing through them understanding characteristics of wake induced vibrations plays an important role in design of marine offshore structures such as platform columns risers operating at high reynolds number currents this work presents an extensive study of wake induced vibrations using a computational fluid dynamics approach the numerical model is based on an incompressible navier stokes flow solver with a hybrid detached eddy simulation des approach for turbulence modelling of high reynold number flows the hybrid des approach is first validated for wake induced vibrations at subcritical reynolds number ranging from 10 3 10 5 comparison between numerical results and experiment shows very good agreement in prediction of downstream cylinder responses including amplitudes frequency and phase angle data from numerical simulations is then used to characterize and study mechanisms of wake induced vibrations by looking at detailed force components and their frequencies in relation to cylinder responses the effect of different reynolds number flow conditions in tandem cylinder responses are also analysed in the present work it is found that reynolds number has strong influence in changing response amplitude and frequency of cylinders in wake induced vibrations keywords flow induced vibrations vortex induced vibrations computational fluid dynamics detached eddy simulations high reynolds number flows fluid structure interactions 1 introduction understanding of environment loads due to waves and currents is important in designing offshore structures such as cables risers mooring line systems apart from hydrostatic pressure forces offshore structures under cross currents are normally subjected to dynamic load due to the well known vortex shedding phenomena coupled interaction of vortex shedding from bluff bodies with its structural flexibility causes vibration responses of the structure this vortex induced vibration viv is widely observed in various types of cylindrical structures in oceans heat exchanger tubes as well as chimney stacks among others these vibrations have been extensively studied in the literature williamson and govardhan 2004 and are modelled as resonant vibrations of elastically mounted and isolated rigid cylinders vibrations associated with the viv phenomenon are known to have large amplitudes in an extended lock in frequency region where the response frequency f is maintained at near the natural frequency f n of the structure over a range of driving frequencies f f in most of offshore installations including deep sea oil rig platforms risers are arranged in bundles and arrays under array arrangement risers and similar cylindrical structures under cross flows may not only be affected by viv but they also interfere with each other it has been observed and noted paidoussis and price 1988 that arrays of cylinders are further subject to fluid elastic instabilities that arise from interactions between adjacent cylinders in the array also termed wake induced vibrations wiv these instabilities have been recognized as a distinct phenomenon from viv and have been investigated extensively as well zdravkovich 1977 bokaian and geoola 1984 brika and laneville 1999 mittal and kumar 2001 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 assi et al 2010a 2010b huera huarte and bearman 2011 assi et al 2013 chaplin and batten 2014 assi 2014 however to date no coherent theory has emerged on the wiv phenomenon even though analyses involving nonlinear oscillators facchinetti et al 2002 armin and srinil 2013 gallardo et al 2014 and wake stiffness assi et al 2010b 2013 assi 2014 have been proposed in particular it has been suggested that wiv is not a resonant phenomenon and that the response and driving frequencies are equivalent assi et al 2010b 2013 assi 2014 in addition due to the coupling between the motion of the structure and the flow of the surrounding fluid particularly the generation of vortices from the interaction between the fluid and the structure it is conceivable that the frequency decomposition of the driving force is time varying and possibly a harmonic majority of earlier work on wake induced vibrations are physical experiment listed above including many scaled model as well as full scale tests while computational fluid dynamics cfd has become popular in engineering applications over the past few decades its application in modelling and simulations of wake induced vibrations is still limited and lacking behind experimental work among those limitations of cfd models for wake induced vibration simulations is its predictive capabilities at high reynolds number flows in the range of re 10 4 10 6 corresponding to operational conditions of most offshore structures direct numerical simulations dns have been attempted for vortex induced vibrations at re 10 4 dong et al 2006 however at the range of higher reynolds number conditions dns becomes inhibited due to unrealistic computational demand even with present powerful computing infrastructures significance of resolving flows past cylinders at high reynolds number has increasingly motivated the cfd community to explore various advanced turbulent modelling techniques from traditional industrial unsteady reynolds average navier stokes urans rosetti et al 2012 models to large eddy simulations les feymark et al 2012 in rans all turbulence is modelled and it solves for ensemble average quantities by separating flows to mean and fluctuating parts rans models normally require some empirical approximation to model turbulent fluctuations in les larger turbulent scales are resolved while small scales called subgrid scales sgs are modelled a spatial filtering is then employed to separate the resolved turbulence from its modelled counterpart for accurate les predictions it requires a suitable filtering mechanism to separate large wave components from smaller ones at a cut off frequency moreover it also restricts the time step and grid sizes especially for wall bounded flows as an attempt to strike a balance between resolving and modelling detached eddy simulations des travin et al 2000 spalart 2009 was introduced as a hybrid rans les approach one can refer to those work as well as references cited therein for more details on the applications of various turbulence models for simulations of flow induced vibrations in this work a fluid structure interactions numerical model is presented as an alternative tool for investigation of wake induced vibrations here a fluid flow solver based on a des approach nguyen et al 2015 for turbulence modelling at high reynolds number flows was used for simulations of wake induced vibrations the main objectives of the current work is two fold it is first to validate the fsi model through extensive benchmarking with experimental studies in prediction of wiv responses of tandem cylinders at the same flow conditions with physical experiment set ups the numerical model is capable of predicting wiv responses with pronounced agreement to earlier experimental data thus making it a suitable alternative tool for further study of wiv phenomena secondly it is to demonstrate the application of the developed model for investigation of wake induced vibrations in complementing physical experiment in particular the numerical model is capable of providing more detailed analysis of flow features while allowing more control in setting up the experiment it is with this expectation that the numerical model can further advance physical understanding of wake interactions on tandem cylinder s responses the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in the next section a brief introduction about the fsi model and numerical experiment s set up are presented this includes details of numerical methodologies as well as grid generation boundary conditions in section 3 we present the validation of the model with earlier experimental studies to establish model s fidelity for subsequent analysis of forces and responses of wake induced vibrations the following section 4 discuses a study of reynolds number effects on wiv different from most of physical experimental set up reynolds number in the numerical study is maintained for variation of reduced velocities to decouple their effects on wiv responses the effect of reynolds number conditions on different wiv tests are investigated in details to provide insights on characteristics and mechanism of wiv responses some conclusion remarks from the current study are presented in the last section 2 model and methodology 2 1 physical setup in this work a canonical setup of cylinders in tandem arrangement was constructed in the numerical model similar to many earlier experimental studies here we consider effects of a long slender cylinder cylinder 1 on vibrations of an elastically mounted and parallel downstream cylinder of the same length l cylinder 2 as briefly illustrated in fig 1 generally cylinder 1 with diameter d 1 is fixed to a rigid frame while cylinder 2 with diameter d 2 is mounted to the rigid frame with effective spring constant k and effective damping constant c structural responses of the downstream cylinder are characterized by its natural frequency and damping ratio defined as follows 1 ω n k m ζ n c 2 k m here m is the effective mass of the downstream cylinder taking the direction of the cylinder axes to be the z axis and the downstream direction to be the x axis we further define cylinder 2 to be of distance x 0 downstream of cylinder 1 in the x direction and distance y 0 above cylinder 1 in the y direction in the present work we consider the two cylinders are of the same diameters d 1 d 2 d the problem is further simplified by restricting the motion of the downstream cylinder 2 to the y direction and call its instantaneous displacement from the equilibrium position y ˆ as previously studied by various authors zdravkovich 1977 bokaian and geoola 1984 hover and triantafyllou 2001 assi et al 2010b we assume that both cylinders are completely immersed in a newtonian fluid with density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ in addition the fluid is moving uniformly in the x direction and has a speed of u far away from the cylinders under cross flows conditions characterized by reynolds number re d ρ u d μ vortex shedding from cylinders result in force fluctuations acting on the cylinder causing vibrations which in turns change vortex shedding modes and flow dynamics generally frequency of vortex shedding from a cylinder can be defined as 2 f v st u d where st is the dimensionless strouhal number associated with the flow and bluff body geometry u is the characteristic in flow velocity in addition we define the reduced velocity 3 u r u d f 0 which is another dimensionless number describing the ratio of the characteristic in flow velocity to the characteristic cross flow velocity scale here f 0 is the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder in this work we consider an in line arrangement where both cylinders lie on the x axis in a tandem arrangement giving y 0 0 for tandem arrangement between the cylinders the spacing distance x 0 is taken to be sufficiently large that vortices develop between the two cylinders this excludes the scenario of near wake interference considered by some authors borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 huera huarte and bearman 2011 responses of downstream cylinders in tandem arrangement can be written as a function of non dimensional numbers assi et al 2010b 4 y ˆ d g re d st x 0 d f f 0 ζ n m here f denotes response frequency of the downstream cylinder and m is the mass ratio measuring the ratio of cylinder mass to the displaced fluid mass it is clear that multiple factors influence characteristics and responses of a cylinder in a wake of another upstream cylinder in this work we first focused on validating the numerical models with experimental data at selected flow regimes and physical parameters subsequently a detailed analysis of flows at different reynolds numbers were conducted to understand its effects on wiv responses table 1 summarizes different conditions considered in this work 2 2 fluid structure interaction computational model we propose to use a strong coupled fluid structured interaction fsi computational model to investigate response of cylinders in tandem arrangement under different conditions the numerical model based on our earlier work nguyen and nguyen 2016 strongly couples a hybrid detached eddy simulation des flow solver with six degree of freedoms 6dof solver for solving fsi response of downstream cylinders under cross flows and wakes from upstream cylinder here flows over cylinders are modelled as viscous incompressible fluids governed by the incompressible navier stokes equations that express the conservation of mass and momentum using reynolds decomposition the governing navier stokes equations can be written as follows 5 u 0 6 u t uu 1 ρ p ν 2 u 1 ρ τ r in these equations velocity vector is denoted by u ρ is the density p is the pressure and ν is the kinemtaic viscosity of the fluid the overbar denotes time averages of the variables in the present work water is considered as newtonian fluid of density ρ 1000 kg m 3 and kinematic viscosity of ν 1 0 10 6 m 2 s 1 the last term on the above momentum equation is normally referred to as the reynolds stress tensor τ r ρ u u the system is closed with appropriate boundary conditions imposed on the boundary of the domain γ δ ω 7 u u in γ d 8 σ n t in γ n where domain boundary is separated as γ γ n γ d denoting a neumann and dirichlet boundary respectively more detailed boundary conditions for the simulations are described in the next section in this work a hybrid rans les model is employed for turbulence modelling for hybrid rans les approach a des formulation is implemented and based on menter s k ω sst model strelets 2001 and later modified in menter and kuntz 2004 by making the rans model become length scale aware in this implementation in the les mode the turbulent length scale is no longer a pure les length scale but based on the subgrid scale turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate in order to prevent the grid induced separation in pure des form due to fine grid resolution near wall spalart 2009 causing unsteadiness in the boundary layer the des length scale is modified to disable les in boundary layer region using the model blending function the system of governing equations is then solved using the unstructured collocated finite volume method in arbitrary lagragian eulerian framework with pressure implicit with splitting operators piso for pressure velocity coupling responses of the downstream cylinder in transverse direction represented as spring mass damper system are governed by the equation of motion written as 9 m 2 y ˆ c 2 y ˆ k 2 y ˆ f y here y ˆ is the transverse cylinder displacement and f y is the force component in y direction the force acting on the cylinder is evaluated by integrating pressure and viscous force obtained from the navier stokes flow solver 10 f y γ c y l e y p i τ n d s here i is the identity tensor and e y is the unit vector in y direction the equation of motion is discretized in time using leapfrog scheme and coupled with the flow solver in each of the pressure velocity coupling outer corrector iteration thus rendering a strong coupling approach for the fluid structure interaction system for detailed description of the hybrid des model used in this work one can refer to the earlier work nguyen and nguyen 2016 and references cited therein 2 3 computational grid and numerical schemes the computational domain and typical mesh topology for all simulations of flows over tandem cylinder arrangement in the present work are shown in fig 2 the domain is extended to 15 d in upstream and 30 d in the wake direction from the downstream cylinder where d is the diameter of the downstream cylinder in the cross flow direction typically it is extended to about 20 d depending on the blockage ratio used in experimental set ups velocity inlet condition was specified at the inlet boundary and pressure outlet condition was applied in the downstream boundary on the cylinder walls no slip conditions were specified while slip conditions are for the top and bottom boundaries hybrid rans les simulations require strict mesh grading of boundary layer mesh with y 1 while sufficient mesh resolution in the wake to enable les model here hexahedral dominated grids with topology shown in fig 2 b are generated with higher resolution closer to the cylinders to save computational cost the focus region is typically about 20 10 d in most of the simulations flows in the current range of reynolds number are inherently three dimensional and the span size of cylinder strongly affects the flow dynamics especially lift fluctuations it was recommended that an aspect ratio of l d 9 12 is required to fully capture the three dimensional flow features norberg 2003 from our earlier study nguyen and nguyen 2016 the aspect ratio of l d 9 was used in all of the current simulations except otherwise specified a hexahedral dominated mesh is generated for the above computational domain using snappyhexmesh tool in openfoam for hybrid rans les simulations extra care is required for mesh generation to avoid ambiguous grid densities spalart et al 2006 in this work the near wall boundary layer mesh resolution is always maintained a y 1 for a given reynolds number flow regime the first layer thickness δ y 1 can be estimated a priori based on y and a friction velocity u as δ y 1 y μ ρ u in which friction velocity is computed from a skin friction formula for flatplate at the specified reynolds number from the first boundary layer thickness the mesh resolution in the focus region can be determined based on a user defined stretching ratio δ s δ x δ y 1 thus providing number of necessary refinement levels in this region it is worth noticing that the mesh is not further stretched in spanwise direction as isotropic refinement is applied in the computational domain flows over cylinders at this range of reynolds number exhibits highly unsteady characteristics and were simulated using the transient dynamic mesh motion solver implemented in openfoam framework nguyen and nguyen 2016 similarly to our earlier work a second order linear interpolation scheme was used for convective terms while a cell limiting scheme determining the limited gradient along a line connecting adjacent cell centres was used for the discretization of diffusive terms non orthogonal and skewness correctors were also employed to maintain second order accuracy on unstructured meshes for all the simulations in this work the linear solvers of geometric algebraic multi grid solvers gamg and preconditioned bi conjugate gradient pbicg were used to solve the pressure and velocity respectively in addition the turbulence equations were solved by the smooth solver in each step until a convergence tolerance was met the convergence criterion was set to 10 8 for turbulence variables and 10 6 for other quantities to give reasonably good convergent results from prior experience second order implicit backward scheme is employed to advance the system in time with maximum cfl number of 0 5 0 75 for all of the simulations for handling 6 dof motions of cylinder under wake induced vibration a dynamic morphing mesh approach was used to deform computational meshes where mesh motion is interpolated from cylinder s motions using spherical linear interpolation using this approach the mesh is deformed according to cylinder motions while maintaining its smoothness and preserving mesh quality in boundary layer regions of solid body motions 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 verification and validation for fixed cylinders in tandem arrangement while the model had been well validated for vortex induced vibrations of single cylinders at sub critical reynolds numbers in our previous work nguyen and nguyen 2016 it was again further validated for the present setting of tandem cylinder arrangement there are numerous experimental work in literature on investigation of flows over tandem cylinders igarashi 1981 ljungkrona et al 1991 alam et al 2003 including a comprehensive review sumner 2010 and many other references cited therein a similar set up of cylinders in tandem as in ljungkrona et al 1991 was chosen for benchmarking of the current model the set up comprises two cylinders with the same diameter of d 20 mm arranged in line with separation distance of x d 4 and blockage ratio of 6 3 the cylinders were under flows of reynolds number re 2 10 4 with inlet turbulent intensity of t u 0 1 a similar set up was also used in recent work kitagawa and ohta 2008 for validation of large eddy simulations les for flows over tandem cylinders with slightly higher reynolds number of r e 2 2 10 4 fig 3 shows an instantaneous profile of three dimensional wake structures for the tandem cylinder arrangement in more details fig 4 depicts flow velocity contour at the center cut plane of the domain and the des indicator contour here the des indicator is measured as the ratio of the length scale between les and rans from fig 4b the dark region in the wake is the active les region while the rans model is only activated in the boundary layer regions around the cylinders as well as the far field this has demonstrated that the hybrid rans les model works as expected to resolve the wake flows with les while rans is employed to model wall bounded flows it is believed that resolving the wakes appropriately well and their interaction with the downstream cylinder provides more accurate computations of forces acting on the cylinder thus giving good prediction of wake induced vibrations table 2 summarizes results of the force coefficients on the upstream and downstream cylinders for different mesh sizes the meshes were refined by reducing the stretching ratio between the cell size in the focus region and the first boundary layer thickness which is kept at a constant value of δ y 1 1 58 10 4 m to maintain y 1 at this reynolds number in the current work c d denotes the mean of drag force coefficient and c l is the root mean squared r m s lift coefficient measuring fluctuation of lift forces on the cylinders as the mesh was refined from δ s 60 to 30 the mean drag coefficient and lift fluctuation on the upstream and downstream cylinder approached a converged value the grid convergence index gci was computed from the mean drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder on the two consecutive grids and shown in the table as the grid was refined from level 3 to 4 the gci value is less than 1 it shows that the numerical prediction is approaching the asymptotic numerical value in our subsequent simulations grid level 3 or equivalent at different reynolds numbers was employed to sufficiently guarantee numerical grid convergence it is noted that there is a discrepancy between asymptotic numerical prediction and experimental data especially for the mean drag coefficient on the downstream cylinder pressure distribution on downstream cylinder is plotted in fig 5 along the circumference of cylinder the mean and root mean square fluctuation of pressure coefficients c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 2 are compared between the present computation with experimental data as well as les results obtained from the similar reynolds number in good agreement it can be seen that the mean pressure coefficient tends to flatten out in the back of the downstream cylinder with lower fluctuation as compared to the front part which is in direct impingement of upstream wakes this results in much higher lift fluctuation and lower drag on the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 6 force coefficients c l d f l d 1 2 ρ l d u 2 on the upstream and downstream cylinder are compared with experimental data as depicted in table 3 the current numerical model provides lower predictions of force coefficient for upstream cylinder as compared to experiment as well as les at the reynolds number re 2 10 4 for downstream cylinder the present results show higher mean drag and lower fluctuations as compared to experimental data given uncertainties in force measurement on the cylinder due to various factors such as aspect ratio and blocking ratio the numerical prediction for force coefficients are consistently well within the range of data reported in literatures sumner 2010 in fig 7 a power spectra of cross flow velocity are plotted at a point in between the separation between two cylinders and a point in the wake of the downstream cylinder the strouhal frequency was clearly shown in the flow spectra for both points higher frequency peaks are also clearly present more in velocity spectrum in the wake of downstream cylinder probably due to interaction of upstream wakes with downstream cylinder shear layers however a single frequency response is observed from force spectrum of lift coefficients on both upstream and downstream cylinders as shown in fig 7 b fig 8 depicted the variation of force coefficients on the cylinders for a fixed arrangement of x 0 d 4 awith the offset distance of y 0 d 1 similar to one of the conditions tested in the earlier experiment assi et al 2010b different to the above in line tandem arrangement the mean lift coefficient of the downstream cylinder is negative in this case and it acts as a restoring force to pull the cylinder towards the centerline this is believe is one of the key mechanism explaining wake induced vibrations this observation is consistent with the earlier experimental data it can also be seen that the fluctuation of lift force coefficient on the downstream cylinder is much higher than the upstream s one while the force frequency is the same on both cylinders corresponding to strouhal number of around s t 0 2 the increment in lift force is due to interactions of upstream cylinder wakes with the downstream cylinder showing effects of vortices from the upstream cylinder on the downstream one in fig 9 wake structures of the cylinders in tandem are plotted at the maximum and minimum lift force conditions at the maximum lift condition in fig 9 a upstream vortices induce a high speed flow at the bottom side of the cylinder and accelerate a shear layer from the same side thus increasing lift force on the downstream cylinder when the upstream vortices impinge on the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 9 b it interact with the shedded vortex from downstream cylinder and resulted in a smaller lift force a similar wake structures was also observed in the experiment assi et al 2010b where a complex vortex structure interaction resulted in enhancing and diminishing the lift force acting on the downstream cylinder 3 2 validation for wake induced vibration cylinders in tandem arrangement we next consider a case of a vibrating cylinder in a tandem arrangement with an upstream cylinder and zero transvered offset distance the test case follows the same experimental setup in assi et al 2010b in which a cylinder of distance x 0 d 5 from upstream and fixed cylinder is free to move in cross flow direction under different reduced velocities in the numerical study the downstream cylinder is modelled as six degree of freedom rigid body with the same mass ratio m 2 6 and structural damping of ζ 0 7 as in the experiment here the cylinder was constrained to only oscillate in the cross flow direction the history of displacement and lift force coefficients of the downstream cylinder was plotted in fig 10 for reduced velocity of u r 15 corresponding to reynolds number of r e 1 5 10 4 it can be seen that the downstream cylinder oscillated with a single frequency close to its natural frequency while power spectrum of lift coefficient shows multiple frequency components in the driving force acting on the cylinder comparison of response amplitude between present numerical simulations and experimental study is shown in fig 11 for downstream cylinder at different reduced velocities it is noted from fig 11 that displacement amplitude increases with increase of reduced velocity for the cylinder in tandem this is a distinct behaviour of wake induced vibrations as compared to single cylinder vortex induced vibrations in viv response amplitude is large only in a range of reduced velocity where natural frequency matches with vortex shedding frequency away from this locked in region cylinder response amplitude is negligibly small for cylinders in wake induced vibrations the response is similar to viv in the region of low reduced velocity u r 8 while wakes from the upstream cylinder played a critical role in downstream cylinder s response at higher reduced velocity thus causing high amplitude responses fig 12 showed amplitude response of downstream cylinder with reduced velocities at different spacing between two cylinders numerical results showed the same trend as experiment data assi et al 2010b where response amplitude expectedly reduces with spacing distance it is clear that the present numerical results generally agrees well with the experimental data extracted from the earlier work assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 in prediction of wake induced vibration response for cylinder in tandem arrangement 3 3 force and displacement of cylinders in tandem distinctive responses of cylinder in tandem at high reduced velocity as shown in fig 11 have been attributed to complex interactions of cylinder wakes and its motions assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 outside of viv lock in regions wakes from upstream cylinder interacts with downstream cylinder s vortices causing downstream cylinder vibrations amplitude of downstream cylinder motions at high reduced velocity is dependent on distance between the two cylinders as shown in earlier work assi et al 2010b and the current numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data in fig 12 the response displacement of downstream cylinder was plotted against its lift force coefficient at different reduced velocities in fig 13 overlaying the data over one cycle of displacement shows multiple frequency modes in lift force coefficient the difference in phase and frequency between mean lift coefficient and mean displacement is clearly observed for all reduced velocities to further illustrate this characteristic of downstream cylinder in tandem fig 14 shows displacement spectral density as well as lift force spectrum of the downstream cylinder at different reduced velocities it is noted that the magnitude of displacement measured in root mean square gets higher with increase of reduced velocity as seen from the power spectral density plots the displacement response is at a single frequency while there are consistently two dominant frequencies in lift force component of the downstream cylinder at various reduced velocities one of the two dominant frequencies is the same as motion frequency of the downstream cylinder while the other frequency matches with vortex shedding frequency from upstream cylinder the presence of second frequency in lift force power spectrum demonstrates the effect of upstream wakes on the downstream cylinder response frequency of the downstream cylinder and the phase angle between the cylinder s lift coefficient and displacement were plotted in fig 15 for the same case of x d 5 it is found that the response frequency of the cylinder increases with reduced velocity and consistently matching with earlier experimental data moreover the response frequency of cylinder in wiv shown in fig 15 increasingly deviates from its natural frequency with increase of reduced velocity a shift in phase angle between force and displacement was observed at u r 6 similar to viv phenomena and it is noted that phase difference is measured only for the force component at the same frequency with response frequency the plots clearly showed that our results corroborate well with those obtained from experimental data assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 it is well understood that wiv responses of cylinders in tandem depends on many parameters including flow conditions as well as geometric configurations as illustrated in eq 4 coupled effects of those parameters results in complex and distinctive behaviours of wake induced vibrations responses with pronounced agreement in comparison to experimental data the present numerical model is capable of resolving key flow physics involved in wake induced vibrations additionally it provides an alternative analysis tool to further investigate mechanisms of wake induced vibrations in the next sections the numerical model is employed to further characterize as well as to study the effects of reynolds number on responses of cylinders in wake induced motions 3 4 effect of reynolds number on wake induced vibrations in most of the studies on wake induced vibrations assi et al 2010b assi 2014 chaplin and batten 2014 responses of the downstream cylinder are characterized with variation of reduced velocity while flow velocity conditions were normally altered to accommodate this variation due to changes in free stream velocity cylinders are effectively under varying reynolds number conditions during those test conditions it is believed that changes in reynolds number together with reduced velocity variation will have coupled effects on responses of cylinders in wake induced vibrations the dependence of vortex induced vibrations on reynolds number was experimentally studied in earlier work raghavan and bernitsas 2011 in which the authors showed a strong influence of reynolds number of viv response and characters of elastically mounted cylinder as reynolds number increases towards the end spectrum of subcritical region shear layers are fully turbulent with high lift fluctuations thus inducing higher response amplitude even under large damping ratios recently effects of reynolds number on wake induced vibration was investigated in assi et al 2013 to understand the concept of wake stiffness in response of cylinders in tandem it was interestingly concluded that the response of cylinder in wiv region is directly influenced by reynolds number and not reduced velocity in an attempt to further understanding on the effects of reynolds number on wake induced vibrations a numerical model of tandem cylinders was set up following earlier experiment except that the reynolds number was kept constant and the natural frequency of cylinder changed according to reduced velocity variation in this work numerical tests were performed at two fixed reynolds number of 10 4 and 3 10 4 similar to the earlier experiment hover et al 1997 hover and triantafyllou 2001 in which a force feedback system was employed to control cylinder structural response while towing at a constant speed in a tank these two reynolds number regimes were also chosen as representatives of average and maximum reynolds number conditions in assi et al 2010b experiment fig 16 shows the response amplitude and frequency of cylinder under in line tandem arrangement at x d 5 with varying and constant reynolds number the numerical results at constant reynolds number r e 10 4 was plotted against results from experiment for tandem cylinder at the varying reynolds number conditions assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 and single cylinder vortex induced vibration hover et al 1997 there are clear discrepancies in results of response amplitudes and frequencies of downstream cylinder in wake induced vibrations under constant and varying reynolds number conditions in the present constant reynolds number tests the amplitude response of downstream cylinder depicts similar trend as compared with single cylinder case at low reduced velocity u r 6 obtained from earlier experiment hover et al 1997 as shown in fig 16 a the peak response of cylinder in tandem a d 1 0 is observed at u r 6 and very close to response of single cylinder in viv lock in region this peak amplitude response of downstream cylinder at r e 10 4 is higher than cylinder in tandem with varying flow velocity test assi et al 2010b in viv regime due to difference of reynold number conditions in earlier experiment assi et al 2010b chaplin and batten 2014 reynolds number is less than 5 10 3 for u r 6 thus it is expected that response amplitude is lower as it was shown earlier for single cylinder test at varying reynolds number assi et al 2010b the peak response amplitude of a d 0 8 was also lower than single cylinder study at r e 10 4 hover et al 1997 the reynolds number effect is consistently observed in the viv regime of cylinder in tandem amplitude data for constant reynolds number study is closer to experimental data for reduced velocity around u r 10 where reynolds number is around 10 4 in experimental study at higher reduce velocities u r 10 response amplitude of downstream cylinder in the condition of constant reynolds number deviates further from experimental data as reduced velocity increases in contrast to increasing trend of response amplitude for varying reynold number experiment under constant reynolds number condition the response amplitude is maintained at a d 0 8 for a range of reduced velocity 10 u r 20 before decreasing further with increases of reduced velocity in fig 16 b response frequency of downstream cylinder was plotted against reduced velocity a similar trend in frequency is observed in both set ups where frequency is increasing with reduced velocity by deviating further from natural frequency however the response frequency of the downstream cylinder under constant reynolds number is lower than that in varying reynolds number conditions at high reduced velocity the reduction in response amplitude and frequency can be attributed to the difference in reynolds number at high reduced velocity in wake induced motions fig 17 showed spectrum of lift forces on the cylinders and response amplitude of downstream cylinder at the same reduced velocity condition of u r 20 but different reynolds number conditions response behaviour of the two cases are very similar with single frequency amplitude response under multiple frequency force as consistently found in wake induced motions the strouhal frequency of lift force component is higher with increasing of reynolds number it was reported in literature xu and zhou 2004 that there is strong dependency of strouhal number on reynolds number for cylinders in tandem at different tandem arrangement x d xu and zhou 2004 classified relationship of st on re into four categories based on the spacing distance between upstream and downstream cylinders for x d 3 5 there is a jump in st at re 5 10 3 1 5 10 4 dependent on x d the st number continues increasing after the jump until it tapers to a constant value at re 1 8 10 4 for all the spacing distances it is believed that the jump and increase of st number may contribute to the difference in response amplitude and frequency of cylinders in comparison between constant and varying re number wake induced motions higher shedding frequency from upstream and downstream cylinder resulted in increasing of response amplitude as well as frequency as shown in fig 17 fig 18 further illustrated the effect of reynolds number on forcing frequency and responses with increase of reduced velocity it can be seen that the force frequency of upstream cylinder increases with increase of reduced velocity in varying re number study while it remains the same for all reduced velocities in the case of constant re number this trend is consistently reflected in force spectrum of downstream cylinder including a shedding frequency and a lower frequency corresponding to its response frequency the present numerical results have been consistent with earlier analysis assi et al 2013 that wiv response amplitude is dependant on reynolds number the increase in amplitude at high reduced velocity is directly caused by the change in reynolds number in order to investigate further the effect of re number on wake induced motions a constant re number test was carried out at higher reynolds number re 3 05 10 4 to compare with hover and triantafyllou 2001 experiment and earlier study at re 10 4 the other conditions of the test are following the experimental setup where the mass ratio in this case is taken at m 3 0 slightly higher than the earlier varying re number test the distance between the two cylinders is adjusted to follow the experiment with x d 4 75 fig 19 shows comparison of numerical prediction of response amplitude and frequency with experiment at the same re number condition here the average 10 maximum amplitude a d 1 10 is calculated from numerical simulation data and compared with the same data from earlier experiment hover and triantafyllou 2001 the data was also plotted against data from hover and triantafyllou 2001 for x d 4 75 numerical agrees well with experiment data at the same re number condition for lower reduced velocity u r 6 where vortex induced motions is dominated at higher reduced velocity the average 1 10 amplitude is under predicted in numerical simulations for the range of 8 u r 17 tested in experiment results from present numerical study at higher reduced velocities u r 17 showed that the amplitude is reaching to the maximum value of a d 1 10 1 9 at u r 22 and stays in that range until u r 35 though the current numerical results does not match well with experiment it confirms a speculation from earlier experiment that large response amplitudes remains at higher reduced velocity the response frequency is similarly found to be the same between numerical and experimental data at high reduced velocity the response frequency could be twice of the cylinder natural frequency as observed in both numerical simulations and experiment fig 20 showed response amplitude and phase angle of downstream cylinder at two different reynolds number conditions of re 10 4 and 3 05 10 4 the response amplitude was computed as the standard root mean square values of motions and the reynolds numbers were kept constant for varying of reduced velocities the typical phase shift is observed in all the cases at reduced velocity corresponding to peak viv response the numerical results of phase shift agree well with experimental data the response amplitudes show discrepancies between different reynolds number conditions for a wide range of reduced velocities however the amplitude tends to converge to a finite value of a d 0 9 for re 3 05 10 4 higher than a d 0 5 for re 10 4 as the reduced velocity increases the current results is consistent with earlier similar constant reynolds number test in assi et al 2013 where response amplitudes asymptotically reach the values of free vibrating cylinders spectrum of response amplitude at different reduced velocities were plotted in fig 21 showing similar trend of increasing response frequencies with reduced velocity the frequencies is slightly higher at higher reynolds number conditions it is clear that wiv response amplitude increases with increase of reynolds number fig 22 showed variation of root mean square values of lift force coefficient on the downstream cylinder with reduced velocities at re 10 4 and re 3 05 10 4 in both cases the peak value of force coefficients on cylinder in tandem was obtained in the viv dominated region at low reduce velocity as reduced velocity increases lift force coefficient further reduces from the peak value and converges to a finite value of c l r m s for downstream cylinder in tandem at different reynolds number conditions the constant lift coefficients are slightly lower in higher reynolds number cases thus inducing higher response amplitudes in wake induced motions 4 conclusions this work had presented the application of numerical simulation approach for investigation of wake induced vibrations in high reynolds number flows the hybrid rans les approach has been successful in predicting wake induced motions of cylinders in tandem at spacing distance x d 4 5 and reynolds number r e 5 10 3 3 10 4 we validated the numerical results against two representative experiment with reasonably good agreement distinct wiv responses of large amplitude outside of typical viv lock in regions was well captured in numerical model it was also able to predict increase of response frequency with velocity increases as reported in various experimental study complex interactions between cylinders wakes and downstream cylinder motions resulted in finite cross flow forces acting on the cylinder the numerical results further illustrate the analysis on the mechanism of wiv where the vibration of downstream cylinder is cased by restoring lift fluctuation resulted from its interaction with upstream cylinder wake the effect of reynolds number in wake induced vibrations were analysed using the proposed numerical approach it confirmed that reynolds number has a strong influence on wake induced motions higher reynolds number caused larger wake induced vibration amplitude responses of tandem cylinders in varying reduced velocity at constant reynolds number revealed a different characteristic of response amplitude at high reduced velocity while the wiv amplitude was shown to remain large at high reduced velocities it tends to gradually taper off with increase of reduced velocity to a finite amplitude considered as free wiv amplitude this free vibration amplitude decreases as reynolds number reduces the current study has illustrated great potential of numerical simulation tools for investigation of wake induced vibration through extensive study of the phenomena however there remains many outstanding issues to be addressed in order to fully understanding the wake induced vibrations including the key mechanism governing the response frequency of a cylinder in tandem it will form the main scope of our future work in this direction acknowledgement the authors would like to express gratitude to many fruitful discussions

23529,this paper proposed the stabilization control of the tension leg platform tlp which is one of the most common types of offshore floating wind turbines the main problem which exists in the installation of this kind of turbines is how to control and float them on water owing to the collision of turbulent waves of the sea for this purpose to design the controller on mentioned system first a nonlinear function is introduced as a candidate of lyapunov then it is proved if tlp system is stable using robust control in the presence of uncertainties time delays and disturbances then phase takagi sugeno t s model as a controller is provided for the mentioned system in this case using linear matrix inequalities lmis the required feedback efficiency of the fuzzy controller can be obtained finally by simulating in simulink matlab environment it can be seen that not only the controller design is performed more easily but all the state variables are asymptotically stable keywords tlp systems robust control lmi uncertainty time delays t s fuzzy 1 introduction global warming is arguably the most worrying threat to the world at the present time one of the predominant factors causing global warming is burning of fossil fuels makino et al 2017 this factor has made man to look for alternative sources of energy which are clean cheap and renewable wind energy resources are one of them this renewable energy has been utilized a long time ago with the installation of turbines on land developers of wind turbines industry have been faced with great difficulties in installing these turbines onshore these turbines have large height nozzle diameter and rotor that can be sources of problems including special visual effects and sound created with spinning pinwheel blades karimirad 2011 because of the perfect capabilities at sea in recent years installation of wind turbines in the sea floating wind turbines is taken into consideration reiszadeh and motaha 2011 the first offshore floating wind turbine was built in 1990 initially the location of these turbines was in shallow waters of the north sea henderson and argyriadis 2010 at first it seemed that the utilization of turbines in deep water because of expensive installation and operation costs are not affordable but today these turbines are frequently used for power generation perez and fossen 2011 among the areas that have the potential for using this type of turbine countries like netherlands denmark norway and the northeast coast of the united states can be mentioned jonkman and matha 2010 as seen in fig 1 it is observed that in general installation of floating offshore wind turbines is carried out in three ways and the stabilization process of each of these methods has its own techniques the first approach represents the floating tower which is stabilized by the accumulation of sand on the bottom side of the tower causing it to be heavy then using powerful cable the end of tower is attached to the sea floor the second method is associated with tlps that are anchored to the sea floor by strong cable connections finally the third type is related to the towers which have been placed on floating platforms and these floats are connected to the sea floor by cables in this paper stabilization and control of type ii floating wind turbines have been studied one of the aims for the study and review of tlp systems is that such systems owing to their light weight in collision with turbulent waves of the sea demonstrate unwanted oscillatory movements and this leads to instability of the turbine location in tlp systems like most real systems time constant or time varying delays and uncertainties occur causing degraded performance and instability in the location of the system mobayen 2014 2015a so a method is proposed in this paper using advanced tools based on which tlp systems can be controlled in the presence of uncertainty delay and disturbance in chen 2006 the conditions of stability of fuzzy systems and its application in structural and functional systems were discussed in chen 2011 chen et al 2010 followed by a brief explanation on the system model the stability of the system using lyapunov theorem and fuzzy rules was proven finally controller design was studied in the presence of constant delays in zhou et al 2011 adaptive control of nonlinear systems with time delay was studied using fuzzy approximation method in han 2008 using lyapunov candidate function in discrete time domain the stability of nonlinear systems was discussed in chen and chen 2010 after introducing the system model the robust controller with uncertainty was designed in guo et al 2012 the problem of asymptotic analysis and verification of continuous systems with variable delay with time and uncertainty has been investigated in ni and lie 2006 with a direct approach for tracking a delayed system the robust controller design was discussed in he et al 2013 the problem of synchronization of the complex time delay system is studied using the lyapunov stability theory and the strong comparative principle in wu 2004 utilizing adaptive control tracking of delayed systems with uncertainty in their dynamical model was discussed in chiang and liu 2012 tracking output by an allowed input based on a takagi sugeno model for discrete time systems with time delay was studied according to studies conducted coherent and comprehensive work that considers all aspects of offshore floating wind turbines has not been carried out for instance in tsai et al 2016 a very simple model for designing a controller is introduced the paper doesn t discuss parameters such as time delays and uncertainty that often occur in real systems and tlp systems in chen 2011 chen et al 2010 model offered only by adding a fixed delay term to improve the model chen 2006 has helped also in chen and chen 2010 wu 2004 the parametric uncertainty is not applied to all state matrices and time delays considered were fixed or only a delay has been defined on the system the aim of this paper is that by designing the controller the effect of disturbances caused by the collision of sea waves to offshore wind turbines are controlled to achieve this purpose tools like candidate lyapunov function fuzzy controller and lmis are utilized takagi sugeno method is employed in fuzzy controller in this method in order to establish a linear relationship between the controller and state variable efficiency index which is obtained from lmi method is required it is expected that the simultaneous utilization of lmi and fuzzy controller methods has significant impact on the spatial fluctuations cause by the collision of waves to the tower the rest of the article is organized as follows in sec 2 after introducing the system a comprehensive model is taken into consideration for tlp systems including the uncertainties time varying delays and disturbances in sec 3 the stability of the system is proved in sec 4 after designing the fuzzy controller by simulating in simulink matlab environment it is observed that all of the state variables become stable the final section of the paper includes conclusions 2 mathematical model of tlp systems general description of tlp systems used in this article is based on garrad hassan proposal karimirad 2011 in this paper to achieve the state space equations of floating offshore wind turbines time and frequency domains including two aerodynamic and hydrodynamic models have been exploited in this regard to model the mentioned system it was necessary to take advantage of a series of relationships especially the taylor expansion and by taking reasonable assumptions high orders and nonlinear terms are discarded nazir 2017 after applying uncertainty and time varying delays to tlp systems standard state space model of the system in the presence of noise can be expressed as follows wu 2004 1 x t a δ a t x t i 1 n a d i δ a d i t x t τ i

disturbance matrix φ t is the applied disturbance u t is a m 1 vector and τ i t are time delays of the above system so that for all values of i 1 2 n derivative value of time delay in the range of ζ k according to inequality τ k t ζ k ζ a top band is assigned for ζ k the uncertainties of the system eq 1 can be considered as follows 2 δ a t δ b t δ a d i t d f l t e 1 e 2 h i in the above equation d e 1 e 2 and h i are constant matrices and f l t is defined as an uncertain and variable time matrix as the following inequality is always true 3 f l t t f l t i t 3 design of lmi based robust controller takagi and sugeno introduced a simple t s fuzzy model by taking into consideration new conditions for fuzzy inference which describes the system performance via combining language rules in this method each fuzzy implication is introduced in the form of a linear system model such that the studied system can be stabilized by linearizing the feedback an advantage of using ts models is that they are able to exactly represent a nonlinear model in a compact set of the state space via the sector nonlinearity approach guerra et al 2015 in order to obtain the feedback efficiency initially using takagi sugeno fuzzy model and lyapunov theorem which is based on the structure of the system and many applications can be considered as observers state space controllers and stability analysis by lyapunov technique qiu and ji 2017 the stability of tlp system with uncertainty and time varying multiple delays have been proved in the presence of disturbances after the stages of stability proof at the end a matrix inequality is achieved this matrix inequality technique provides requirements for lmi as a powerful tool for calculating the complex issues of control the technique lmi is not only very effective in achieving sustainability criteria but it can solve problems such as finding a definite positive function of the lyapunov for stability conditions mobayen 2015b khan and mahmoud 2018 at the end of this procedure fuzzy optimal controller is designed using this method and mathematical computations lemma 1 chen and chen 2010 for each x and y defined as a matrix or vector the following inequality is always true 4 x t y y t x α x t x α 1 y t y holds for any constant α 0 lemma 2 song and zhu 2018 the set of non linear inequalities in the form of q x s x r 1 x s t x 0 r x 0 where r x r t x and s x s t x can be converted to lmi 5 q x s x s x r x 0 in the following in order to reduce the effect of disturbance on the output the following inequality is considered for f e t 0

complexity a number of fuzzy rules utilized in the system have been minimized according to eq 28 two fuzzy rules for tlp systems with delay are employed as 28 r u l e 1 i f x 2 t i s m 11 x 2 t t h e

functions associated with rules one and two are shown in fig 3 in order to be able to better demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the controller design the simulation process has been implemented based on the two scenarios scenario 1 in the first case the initial state of the system is considered as x 0 0 25 0 1 0 07 0 5 0 35 0 6 0 4 t disturbance applied to the system is considered as φ t 100 sin π t and according to fig 4 time delays of the system is in the sinus form of τ 1 t sin π 3 t and another delay is in the form of sawtooth with amplitude of 1 and the last delay was considered as a pulse signal with amplitude of 1 afterwards after insertion of calculated values and presence of uncertainty time delays and disturbance the system is simulated in simulink matlab environment and the behavior of the state variables in figs 5 and 6 to converge to zero with little fluctuations is observed scenario 2 in the next case the initial conditions is intended with the form of x 0 0 9 0 2 0 1 0 05 0 6 0 7 0 8 t disturbance is considered as φ t 100 60 cos 3 π t x 4 80 sin 2 π t and time delays of the system are a pulse wave with an amplitude of 1 as illustrated in fig 7 for sawtooth with an amplitude of 1 and τ 3 t cos π t in this case like the conditions before applying these values the system was simulated in simulink matlab environment and its results can be seen in figs 8 and 9 as seen in the fig 9 the stability of the system can be analyzed and examined in two scenarios in the presence of uncertainty time delays and disturbance the major purpose of this discussion was stabilization and control of tension leg platforms so as to avoid moving from their location and this important issue was achieved by considering the appropriate conditions for lmis and writing minimum rules in the t s fuzzy controller based on the results of all system state variables especially the second state variable plotted in figs 5 and 8 which represents the average deviation of the wave position and fuzzy rules are written based on it after passing through the transition state that converges toward its equilibrium point moreover by the design done in figs 5 and 8 it can be seen that wave motion velocity in a collision with such platforms after a short period of time has gradually decreased and moves towards zero according to figs 6 and 9 it was observed that memory effects applied on tlp systems are lost in a very short period of time 5 conclusions increasing use of offshore floating wind turbines was a motive for presenting a comprehensive model for this system in this paper in this study a 5 mw turbine of the tension leg was structurally controlled based on fuzzy controller and structural behavior was evaluated in the presence of uncertainty time delays and disturbances initially after introducing tlp systems model lmi control law was directly obtained by lyapunov stability and using schur s lemma moreover a non linear function was proposed as a candidate lyapunov function and the theory of asymptotic stability was improved by this selection at the end with the conditions provided and with the help of fuzzy controller the system was simulated in the simulink matlab and based on the results obtained in both scenarios it was observed that not only all system state variables after a short period of time crossed the transition state but we were able to provide a mechanism to eliminate the vibration generated by the collision of sea waves to offshore floating wind turbine towers with low amplitude 
23529,this paper proposed the stabilization control of the tension leg platform tlp which is one of the most common types of offshore floating wind turbines the main problem which exists in the installation of this kind of turbines is how to control and float them on water owing to the collision of turbulent waves of the sea for this purpose to design the controller on mentioned system first a nonlinear function is introduced as a candidate of lyapunov then it is proved if tlp system is stable using robust control in the presence of uncertainties time delays and disturbances then phase takagi sugeno t s model as a controller is provided for the mentioned system in this case using linear matrix inequalities lmis the required feedback efficiency of the fuzzy controller can be obtained finally by simulating in simulink matlab environment it can be seen that not only the controller design is performed more easily but all the state variables are asymptotically stable keywords tlp systems robust control lmi uncertainty time delays t s fuzzy 1 introduction global warming is arguably the most worrying threat to the world at the present time one of the predominant factors causing global warming is burning of fossil fuels makino et al 2017 this factor has made man to look for alternative sources of energy which are clean cheap and renewable wind energy resources are one of them this renewable energy has been utilized a long time ago with the installation of turbines on land developers of wind turbines industry have been faced with great difficulties in installing these turbines onshore these turbines have large height nozzle diameter and rotor that can be sources of problems including special visual effects and sound created with spinning pinwheel blades karimirad 2011 because of the perfect capabilities at sea in recent years installation of wind turbines in the sea floating wind turbines is taken into consideration reiszadeh and motaha 2011 the first offshore floating wind turbine was built in 1990 initially the location of these turbines was in shallow waters of the north sea henderson and argyriadis 2010 at first it seemed that the utilization of turbines in deep water because of expensive installation and operation costs are not affordable but today these turbines are frequently used for power generation perez and fossen 2011 among the areas that have the potential for using this type of turbine countries like netherlands denmark norway and the northeast coast of the united states can be mentioned jonkman and matha 2010 as seen in fig 1 it is observed that in general installation of floating offshore wind turbines is carried out in three ways and the stabilization process of each of these methods has its own techniques the first approach represents the floating tower which is stabilized by the accumulation of sand on the bottom side of the tower causing it to be heavy then using powerful cable the end of tower is attached to the sea floor the second method is associated with tlps that are anchored to the sea floor by strong cable connections finally the third type is related to the towers which have been placed on floating platforms and these floats are connected to the sea floor by cables in this paper stabilization and control of type ii floating wind turbines have been studied one of the aims for the study and review of tlp systems is that such systems owing to their light weight in collision with turbulent waves of the sea demonstrate unwanted oscillatory movements and this leads to instability of the turbine location in tlp systems like most real systems time constant or time varying delays and uncertainties occur causing degraded performance and instability in the location of the system mobayen 2014 2015a so a method is proposed in this paper using advanced tools based on which tlp systems can be controlled in the presence of uncertainty delay and disturbance in chen 2006 the conditions of stability of fuzzy systems and its application in structural and functional systems were discussed in chen 2011 chen et al 2010 followed by a brief explanation on the system model the stability of the system using lyapunov theorem and fuzzy rules was proven finally controller design was studied in the presence of constant delays in zhou et al 2011 adaptive control of nonlinear systems with time delay was studied using fuzzy approximation method in han 2008 using lyapunov candidate function in discrete time domain the stability of nonlinear systems was discussed in chen and chen 2010 after introducing the system model the robust controller with uncertainty was designed in guo et al 2012 the problem of asymptotic analysis and verification of continuous systems with variable delay with time and uncertainty has been investigated in ni and lie 2006 with a direct approach for tracking a delayed system the robust controller design was discussed in he et al 2013 the problem of synchronization of the complex time delay system is studied using the lyapunov stability theory and the strong comparative principle in wu 2004 utilizing adaptive control tracking of delayed systems with uncertainty in their dynamical model was discussed in chiang and liu 2012 tracking output by an allowed input based on a takagi sugeno model for discrete time systems with time delay was studied according to studies conducted coherent and comprehensive work that considers all aspects of offshore floating wind turbines has not been carried out for instance in tsai et al 2016 a very simple model for designing a controller is introduced the paper doesn t discuss parameters such as time delays and uncertainty that often occur in real systems and tlp systems in chen 2011 chen et al 2010 model offered only by adding a fixed delay term to improve the model chen 2006 has helped also in chen and chen 2010 wu 2004 the parametric uncertainty is not applied to all state matrices and time delays considered were fixed or only a delay has been defined on the system the aim of this paper is that by designing the controller the effect of disturbances caused by the collision of sea waves to offshore wind turbines are controlled to achieve this purpose tools like candidate lyapunov function fuzzy controller and lmis are utilized takagi sugeno method is employed in fuzzy controller in this method in order to establish a linear relationship between the controller and state variable efficiency index which is obtained from lmi method is required it is expected that the simultaneous utilization of lmi and fuzzy controller methods has significant impact on the spatial fluctuations cause by the collision of waves to the tower the rest of the article is organized as follows in sec 2 after introducing the system a comprehensive model is taken into consideration for tlp systems including the uncertainties time varying delays and disturbances in sec 3 the stability of the system is proved in sec 4 after designing the fuzzy controller by simulating in simulink matlab environment it is observed that all of the state variables become stable the final section of the paper includes conclusions 2 mathematical model of tlp systems general description of tlp systems used in this article is based on garrad hassan proposal karimirad 2011 in this paper to achieve the state space equations of floating offshore wind turbines time and frequency domains including two aerodynamic and hydrodynamic models have been exploited in this regard to model the mentioned system it was necessary to take advantage of a series of relationships especially the taylor expansion and by taking reasonable assumptions high orders and nonlinear terms are discarded nazir 2017 after applying uncertainty and time varying delays to tlp systems standard state space model of the system in the presence of noise can be expressed as follows wu 2004 1 x t a δ a t x t i 1 n a d i δ a d i t x t τ i t b δ b t u t e φ t y t c x t where x t is the vector of the state variables with dimensions of n 1 a and a d i are n n state matrices b is n m matrix c is the m n matrix e is the n m dimensional disturbance matrix φ t is the applied disturbance u t is a m 1 vector and τ i t are time delays of the above system so that for all values of i 1 2 n derivative value of time delay in the range of ζ k according to inequality τ k t ζ k ζ a top band is assigned for ζ k the uncertainties of the system eq 1 can be considered as follows 2 δ a t δ b t δ a d i t d f l t e 1 e 2 h i in the above equation d e 1 e 2 and h i are constant matrices and f l t is defined as an uncertain and variable time matrix as the following inequality is always true 3 f l t t f l t i t 3 design of lmi based robust controller takagi and sugeno introduced a simple t s fuzzy model by taking into consideration new conditions for fuzzy inference which describes the system performance via combining language rules in this method each fuzzy implication is introduced in the form of a linear system model such that the studied system can be stabilized by linearizing the feedback an advantage of using ts models is that they are able to exactly represent a nonlinear model in a compact set of the state space via the sector nonlinearity approach guerra et al 2015 in order to obtain the feedback efficiency initially using takagi sugeno fuzzy model and lyapunov theorem which is based on the structure of the system and many applications can be considered as observers state space controllers and stability analysis by lyapunov technique qiu and ji 2017 the stability of tlp system with uncertainty and time varying multiple delays have been proved in the presence of disturbances after the stages of stability proof at the end a matrix inequality is achieved this matrix inequality technique provides requirements for lmi as a powerful tool for calculating the complex issues of control the technique lmi is not only very effective in achieving sustainability criteria but it can solve problems such as finding a definite positive function of the lyapunov for stability conditions mobayen 2015b khan and mahmoud 2018 at the end of this procedure fuzzy optimal controller is designed using this method and mathematical computations lemma 1 chen and chen 2010 for each x and y defined as a matrix or vector the following inequality is always true 4 x t y y t x α x t x α 1 y t y holds for any constant α 0 lemma 2 song and zhu 2018 the set of non linear inequalities in the form of q x s x r 1 x s t x 0 r x 0 where r x r t x and s x s t x can be converted to lmi 5 q x s x s x r x 0 in the following in order to reduce the effect of disturbance on the output the following inequality is considered for f e t 0 and 0 sup f e t 2 6 y t 2 f e t 2 γ 1 where γ is a positive constant then we have 7 y t t y t γ 2 f e t t f e t or equivalently 8 y t t γ y t f e t t γ 1 f e t 0 now the candidate lyapunov function v

delay was considered as a pulse signal with amplitude of 1 afterwards after insertion of calculated values and presence of uncertainty time delays and disturbance the system is simulated in simulink matlab environment and the behavior of the state variables in figs 5 and 6 to converge to zero with little fluctuations is observed scenario 2 in the next case the initial conditions is intended with the form of x 0 0 9 0 2 0 1 0 05 0 6 0 7 0 8 t disturbance is considered as φ t 100 60 cos 3 π t x 4 80 sin 2 π t and time delays of the system are a pulse wave with an amplitude of 1 as illustrated in fig 7 for sawtooth with an amplitude of 1 and τ 3 t cos π t in this case like the conditions before applying these values the system was simulated in simulink matlab environment and its results can be seen in figs 8 and 9 as seen in the fig 9 the stability of the system can be analyzed and examined in two scenarios in the presence of uncertainty time delays and disturbance the major purpose of this discussion was stabilization and control of tension leg platforms so as to avoid moving from their location and this important issue was achieved by considering the appropriate conditions for lmis and writing minimum rules in the t s fuzzy controller based on the results of all system state variables especially the second state variable plotted in figs 5 and 8 which represents the average deviation of the wave position and fuzzy rules are written based on it after passing through the transition state that converges toward its equilibrium point moreover by the design done in figs 5 and 8 it can be seen that wave motion velocity in a collision with such platforms after a short period of time has gradually decreased and moves towards zero according to figs 6 and 9 it was observed that memory effects applied on tlp systems are lost in a very short period of time 5 conclusions increasing use of offshore floating wind turbines was a motive for presenting a comprehensive model for this system in this paper in this study a 5 mw turbine of the tension leg was structurally controlled based on fuzzy controller and structural behavior was evaluated in the presence of uncertainty time delays and disturbances initially after introducing tlp systems model lmi control law was directly obtained by lyapunov stability and using schur s lemma moreover a non linear function was proposed as a candidate lyapunov function and the theory of asymptotic stability was improved by this selection at the end with the conditions provided and with the help of fuzzy controller the system was simulated in the simulink matlab and based on the results obtained in both scenarios it was observed that not only all system state variables after a short period of time crossed the transition state but we were able to provide a mechanism to eliminate the vibration generated by the collision of sea waves to offshore floating wind turbine towers with low amplitude
