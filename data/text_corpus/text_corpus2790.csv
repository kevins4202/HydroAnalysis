13950,this study compared the membrane performances and water quality of gravity driven membrane gdm systems in treating algae polluted lake water under different operation conditions microfiltration mf vs ultrafiltration uf chlorella vulgaris green algae vs phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom different algal amounts in the lake water the results showed the cake layer fouling was predominant in the uf gdm systems while irreversible fouling contributed majorly to the mf gdm fouling as a result the uf gdm systems achieved 1 5 time higher permeate flux compared to the mf gdm systems in treating algae polluted lake water compared to the green algae the presence of the diatom cells in the feed water had more negative impacts on the uf permeate flux increasing the cake layer resistance and water quality containing more low molecule weight neutrals the analysis of cake layer foulants revealed that more aromatic protein based biopolymers were accumulated on the membranes during filtration of algae polluted lake water and the biopolymer amounts were almost linearly associated with membrane fouling potential of the gdm systems keywords algae pollution gravity driven membrane filtration lc ocd membrane fouling surface water treatment 1 introduction membrane based processes such as ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro has received increasing attention in treating various types of surface water for drinking water production especially with improved membrane performance and decreased membrane cost 1 however membrane fouling is a major drawback in membrane based water treatment processes therefore periodically physical and chemical cleaning are required in order to achieve sustainable membrane operation which results in consuming high energy and shortening membrane lifespan 2 in addition the high frequent cleaning procedures increase the operation complexity of pressure driven membrane processes such shortcomings of pressure driven membrane processes may limit their applications in developing countries especially for decentralized drinking water treatment in remote rural areas recently gravity driven membrane gdm filtration has shown a great potential as an extremely low energy surface water treatment process because of water gravity 40 100 cm as a driving force 3 importantly gdm filtration can achieve relatively stable flux without any physical and chemical cleaning during a long period of operation time this flux stabilization phenomenon is associated with the biological behaviors of the biofilm i e a mini ecological system developed on the membrane in detail in the biofilm layer the prokaryotes play roles in degrading organics from the feed water and are predated by the eukaryotes whose movement leads to form more heterogeneous and porous biofilm layer as a consequence the stable membrane flux is maintained 4 7 because of low cost and easy maintenance the gdm systems have been successfully scaled up and applied in treating surface water for drinking water production in remote areas of developing countries 8 and in case of disaster 9 nowadays the surface water contaminations are unexpectedly occurred which are caused by the discharges of untreated insufficient treated industrial municipal agricultural wastewaters illegal garbage disposal and leakage of leachate from landfills 10 one of typical pollutants in the surface water was algae and especially harmful cyanobacterial bloom has been paid great attention due to their production of toxic microcystins harmful to living creatures for example previous studies focusing on gdm systems in treating cyanobacteria bloom microcystis aeruginosa lake water found that the biofilms on the membranes could successfully reduce the amount of microcystins in the permeate water critical threshold concentration of 1 mg l this was attributed to well development of the microcystin degrading bacteria in the biofilm assemblages nevertheless such algal cells could decrease the permeate flux of the gdm systems 11 12 however effects of non harmful algae in the surface water on the gdm membrane performance and their membrane fouling mechanisms have not been well explored the who also pointed that blooms of other algae in surface water may causing coloration turbidity and taste change of water after filtration because of their producing other chemicals 13 although the gravity driven membranes microfiltration mf or uf are capable to highly reject most of algal cells in the surface waters due to their special nature fine pore size surface property the effects of these algal metabolic products on the gdm water quality also need to be illustrated this study aims to study the effects of algal species and amounts in the surface water on the performances of the different gdm systems mf and uf membranes two non harmful algal species chlorella vulgaris green algae and phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom were used as model algae which represents the algae in fresh surface water and brackish surface water e g seawater infusion into the fresh water source near coastal areas respectively the membrane performance water quality and membrane fouling mechanisms of the gdm systems were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal culture axenic p tricornutum diatom and c vulgaris green algae were grown with f 2 si and bold s basal medium respectively their cultivations were conducted using fmt50 photobioreactors photon systems instruments czech republic with constant illumination by 630 nm red led 100 μmol m2 s controlled at a temperature of 22 and aeration of 1 l air l medium min according to methods described in the previous studies 14 15 when the algal growth reached to the stationary phase the algal solution was collected for use the optical density od of the algal solution was measured by a spectrometer hach us at a wavelength of 750 nm i e od750 the morphologies of the algal cells were observed by a microscopy nikon japan shown in fig s1 it is noted that the c vulgaris cells were not aggregated in the culture solution which was dissimilar to those in reactor culturing conditions 16 while p tricornutum tended to aggregate in the culture solution to form relatively large flocs 2 2 gdm filtration system setup and operation a schematic diagram of the gdm setup was described in fig s2 in each gdm setup the feed water was added to a storage tank periodically and pumped to a feed tank the constant water level in the feed tank was controlled by an overflow line which was connected to the storage tank the overflow rate was minimized by regulating the feed pump flow rate in terms of the permeate flow rate the membrane filtration cell was connected to the feed tank and the distance between its permeate outlet and the feed tank water level was 75 cm i e hydrostatic pressure of 75 mbar the permeate of membrane filtration cell was collected in a plastic bottle and weighed using an electric scale ohaus usa daily the membrane filtration cell was made of transparent acrylic and the top had a glass window which allowed observation of the biofouling layer morphology a flat sheet polysulfone uf membrane 100 kda microdyn nadir germany or a flat sheet hydrophilized polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf mf membrane 0 1 μm synder filtration us with a membrane area of 20 7 cm2 was placed in the filtration cell the clean membranes were soaked in distilled water for 24 h to remove impurities before use the feed surface water was collected from a lake vatnsmýrin nature reserve near university of iceland weekly and stored at the lab for use the algae polluted lake water was prepared by dosing certain volume of the algal culture solution od750 at 0 5 into the lake water in the lab the temperature was kept at 20 1 c and the light dark cycle was almost at 8 h 16 h nature light condition i e the light intensity may change due to weather condition table 1 summarizes the operation conditions of the gdm systems in this study in the stage i six gdm systems were operated in parallel for 10 days in order to illustrate the effects of membrane types and algal species on the gdm performance in the following stage ii five gdm systems were operated in parallel for 34 days in order to examine the effect of algal amount in the lake water on the uf gdm performance 2 3 fouling resistance analysis the intrinsic membrane resistance rm cake layer resistance fouling resistance rc irreversible fouling resistance rir and irremovable fouling resistance rim were evaluated using resistance in series model based on darcy s law which was described in our previous studies 17 18 in detail at the end of a filtration experiment the total hydraulic resistance rt rm rc rir rim was calculated based on rt tmp μj in which μ is the permeate viscosity j is the measured permeate flux and tmp is the transmembrane pressure 75 mbar after that the membrane was physically washed using distilled water 5 min to remove cake layer foulants the flux of the physically cleaned membrane was examined using distilled water at the hydrostatic pressure of 75 mbar and the resistance rm rir rim was calculated then the physical cleaned membrane was soaked at 0 25 of naclo solution for 2 h the flux of the chemically cleaned membrane was examined using distilled water at the hydrostatic pressure of 75 mbar and the resistance rm rim was calculated the intrinsic membrane resistance rm was measured using distilled water before use the cake layer fouling resistance rc was derived from the difference between rt and rm rir rim the irreversible fouling resistance rir was achieved based on the difference between rm rir rim and rm rim the irremovable fouling resistance rim was achieved based on the difference between rm rim and rm 2 4 water quality analysis the turbidity ph dissolved oxygen do and conductivity measurements were conducted with a turbidity meter hach us a ph meter hach us a do meter hach us and a conductivity meter hach us respectively the water samples were periodically taken from the gdm systems operated at the stage ii for water quality examination the dissolved total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen in the water samples were measured by a toc tn analyzer shimadzu japan after the samples was filtered with a syringe membrane 0 45 μm millipore usa soluble organic fractions in the water sample were measured by an lc ocd analyzer doc labor germany which consists of a size exclusion chromatography an organic carbon detector and an organic nitrogen detector the organic matters were identified into five different fraction groups according to their molecular weights mw namely biopolymers mw 20 kda humic substances mw 1000 da building blocks mw 300 500 da low molecular weight lmw acids and neutrals mw 350 da the detailed lc ocd operation and analysis methods were described in the literature 19 in addition the composition of soluble organic fractions in the water sample was further identified by an eem fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent usa at the excitation wavelength of 220 450 nm and the emission wavelength of 280 550 nm the aromatic proteins region i ex 250 nm em 330 nm and region ii ex 250 nm em 380 nm fulvic acid like matters region iii ex 250 nm em 380 nm soluble microbial byproduct like matters region iv ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and humic acid like matters region v ex 250 nm em 380 nm were identified 20 to illustrate statistical significance a two sample t test was performed by comparing the sampling data groups under two different conditions the p value for the two sample t test was calculated at a significance level at 5 2 5 biofilm analysis at the end of the gdm filtration the membrane was taken from the filtration cell the biofilm cake layer was physically removed from the membrane by rinsing with 10 ml of distilled water 10 min which was considered as biofilm solution the soluble components in the biofilm solution were separated from the pellets by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 min the soluble organic compositions in the biofilm were further analyzed as the methods described in section 2 4 the pellet foulants were collected and dried for weight measurement 21 the specific cake resistance m kg was calculated by dividing the cake layer resistance m 1 to the cake layer foulant mass load on the membrane kg m2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of membrane type and algal species on gdm performance in this study chlorella vulgaris unicellular eukaryotic green algae with a spherical shape at sizes of 2 10 μm in diameter and phaeodactylum tricornutum fusiform shape a very widely studied marine diatom were selected as model pollutant algae in fresh surface water and in brackish surface water respectively shown in fig 1 during 10 day s gdm filtration stage i the permeate fluxes dramatically dropped during initial period of filtration within the first day before they stabilized regardless of membrane type and algal species this phenomenon has well been observed in the gdm systems in treating different types of water surface water 6 seawater 22 rainwater 23 grey water 24 wastewater 17 it was thought the initial membrane fouling was mainly induced by pore constriction in the gdm systems significantly limiting water passing through the membranes and subsequently leading to a sudden drop of the permeate flux 25 after 10 day operation the averaged permeate flux remained considerably stable at 2 54 1 45 2 03 l m2h in the mf gdm systems treating the lake water green algae polluted lake water and diatom polluted lake water respectively which were relatively lower than those in the uf gdm systems 6 55 9 42 5 53 l m2h for the lake water green algae polluted lake water and diatom polluted lake water respectively table s1 obviously the presence of both types of algae in the lake water led to an obvious decrease of the mf gdm permeate fluxes in the uf gdm systems the permeate flux was slightly improved when a low amount of green algae was dosed in the lake water while a low amount of diatom in the lake water caused a slightly reduced permeate flux of the uf gdm system furthermore the fouled membrane morphologies were recorded fig s3 and the fouling resistance distribution was evaluated fig 2 in the mf gdm systems treating the lake water i e mf control the irreversible fouling was predominant contributing to 52 of total fouling resistance when the lake water was dosed with algae both irreversible fouling resistance 1 2 1 3 1013 m 1 and irremovable fouling resistance 1 9 2 2 1012 m 1 greatly increased in the mf gdm systems while their cake layer fouling resistances were much lower than that in the mf control in contrast the cake layer fouling contributed majorly to the total fouling in the uf gdm systems in the absence and presence of additional algal species ranging from 87 to 93 compared to the control uf gdm system 3 6 1012 m 1 the dosed green algae in the uf gdm system led to a slight decrease of cake layer fouling resistance 2 6 1012 m 1 while the dosed diatom caused an increase of cake layer fouling 4 7 1012 m 1 such observations suggest that the uf gdm systems had better membrane performance and experienced less negative effects by the low amount of dosed algae in the lake water compared to the mf gdm systems it is noticed that the pristine uf membrane averaged at 90 l m2h had a higher clean water flux than the mf membrane averaged at 27 l m2h at a hydrostatic pressure of 75 mbar while the clean membrane resistances only contributed 10 of the total fouling resistance for both types of membranes fig 2 thus such difference in the clean membrane permeability may not be the major reason for the better performance of the uf membrane indeed the different fouling mechanisms of the mf and uf membranes appeared to be associated with their performances as shown in figs 2 and s3 most of the potential foulants in the lake water could be rejected by the uf membrane to form a cake layer while these foulants appeared to predominantly plug or narrow the pores of the mf membrane possibly due to their relatively comparable sizes to the mf membrane pore sizes furthermore the rejected organics on the uf membrane surface could benefit the prokaryotes development as a result promoting the eukaryotic predation and movement activity accordingly more heterogeneous and porous biofilm layer was formed on the uf membrane although more biofilm mass which resulted in a higher permeate flux 4 5 22 additionally the lower amount of algal cells especially green algae may behave as dosed particles which could facilitate the formed cake layer with much more heterogeneous nature as a result leading to less cake layer filtration resistance 26 27 it is also observed that the influences of algal species on the performances of the mf gdm and uf gdm systems behaved in different patterns in the mf gdm system fed with green algae dosed lake water a lower permeate flux was observed due to more cake layer irreversible and irremovable fouling resistances compared to those with diatom dosed lake water while the presence of the green algae in the lake water benefited to increase the permeate flux in the uf gdm systems by reducing reversible fouling 3 2 effect of algal concentration on gdm performance 3 2 1 membrane performance and fouling resistance distribution as the uf gdm systems had better membrane performance than the mf gdm systems and a lower amount of algae in the lake water had insignificant impacts on the uf gdm performance stage i in the stage ii the effect of higher algal concentration 2 time and 4 time of the algal concentration in the stage i on the uf gdm performance was further explored the gdm permeate flux development profiles were presented in fig 3 similarly the permeate fluxes dramatically dropped during initial period of filtration within the first day before they stabilized under all testing conditions fig 3 compared to the stable flux in the control gdm 9 00 l m2h the presence of more algal cells in the lake water could lead to decreased permeate fluxes for both algal species 2 97 7 23 l m2h it is noted that the control uf gdm systems in the stage i and ii had slightly different stable fluxes 6 22 and 9 00 l m2h respectively table s1 because the feed lake water taken at different periods of time had slightly dissimilar compositions e g turbidity 23 3 8 8 ntu vs 6 2 7 6 ntu tables s2 and 2 to make a fair comparison the flux incline or decline ratio was calculated and illustrated in table s1 obviously when a lower concentration of green algae was present in the lake water the permeate flux increased 44 while with further increasing its concentration to 2 and 4 the permeate flux dropped 20 and 23 respectively in the presence of the diatom in the lake water the permeate flux decreased from 16 to 34 to 67 with elevating the diatom concentration from 1 to 2 to 4 respectively at the end of experiments day 34 the fouling resistance distribution was further examined shown in fig 4 the cake layer fouling was predominant in the higher amount of algae dosed gdm systems at the stage ii similar to the control gdm system and the gdm system with the lower amount of algae uf membrane stage i it was also observed that the permeate flux decline was associated with an increased cake layer fouling moreover the amounts of the diatom cells in the feed lake water had a more significant impact on the gdm performance than those of the green algae 3 2 2 permeate water quality the water samples from the feed water tanks and permeate bottles were periodically monitored during 34 day operation stage ii and their water quality parameters were presented in the table 2 as shown in table 2 dosing both algal cells into the feed water could not significantly influence turbidity ph and do levels compared to the control feed i e without dosing algae p values 0 05 in contrast dosing the diatom cell solution including cultural medium could significantly increase the feed water conductivity p value 0 05 because the dosed cultural medium was at a high salinity level while the conductivity of the feed water dosed with the green algae was not significantly varied p value 0 05 the permeate water in all tested gdm systems was almost turbidity free due to excellent rejection of the uf membranes in addition the ph do or conductivity level in the permeate water was comparable to that in its respective feed water in addition compared to the control feed water the diatom dosed feed water had greatly more soluble organic carbon and total nitrogen p value 0 05 while the feed water dosed with the green algae had similar amounts of soluble organic carbon and total nitrogen p value 0 05 table 2 as the diatom culture medium f 2 si contains na2edta c10h14n2na2o8 trace element 1 48 mgc l in the culture medium it could contribute soluble organic carbon in the diatom dosed feed water contributing 15 30 μgc l in the feed water as 50 100 times dilution of the culture medium in addition it has been reported that marine diatoms can secrete large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps and their quantity and quality are environmental dependent 28 29 after the marine diatom cells were dosed into the lake water their growth conditions shifted from favorable high salinity to unfavorable low salinity as a result they may regulate their metabolic behaviors by producing more eps to tolerate such environmental stress especially these led to great amount of lmw neutral substances in the diatom dosed feed water almost 50 100 times higher than those in the control feed water furthermore the averaged soluble toc 15 7 18 9 and tn 7 7 11 6 removal ratios of the green algae dosed gdm systems were slightly higher than those in the control gdm 12 5 and 2 4 respectively both removal ratios were improved with increasing dosing amount of the green algae previous studies have pointed out that the green algae c vulgaris could utilize organic carbon sources to promote their growth i e heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth 14 30 and enhance nutrient removal from the wastewater 31 this characteristics of green algae promoted the organic removal efficiencies in the gdm systems while in the diatom dosed gdm systems the averaged soluble toc removal ratios 3 8 7 6 were lower than that in the control gdm 12 5 and tn removal ratios 2 3 were comparable to that in the control gdm 2 4 to further investigate the effect of algal species and concentrations on doc removal compositions of doc were analyzed by lc ocd table 2 and eem fig 5 table 2 shows that in both control gdm and algae dosed gdm systems the concentrations of all five organic components in the permeate were slightly higher than or comparable to those in respective feed water similarly the eem analysis results fig 5 also indicated that almost comparable amounts of five types of organic components in the feed and permeate water this phenomenon was also observed in the previous studies 17 18 32 34 it was speculated that 1 the particulate organics not measured by the toc analyzer due to pretreatment procedure of toc analysis in the feed water could decomposed or hydrolyzed into the smaller sized soluble substances and 2 the microorganisms on the membrane surface utilized greater sized organics and produced smaller sized soluble substances these soluble substances could not be effectively retained by the uf membranes and therefore were present in the permeate 3 2 3 cake layer foulants characteristics the cake layer morphologies were directly observed via the glass windows of the gdm filtration cells and their photos were recorded in fig s4 clearly the algal cells covered the membrane surface within the first day of filtration showing being highly retained by the membranes with more particulates from the lake water accumulated on the membranes the algal presence especially green algae was not obviously noticed at the end of filtration experiments the cake layer was carefully removed from the membrane surface and the foulant characteristics were examined the microscopic images in the fig s5 revealed the presence of the eukaryotes in the cake layer regardless of the absence and presence of dosed algal cells shown in table 3 much more cake layer foulants were deposited on the membrane surface in the gdm systems treating algae dosed lake water compared to those in the control gdm system this was attributed to the accumulation of the rejected algal cells on the uf membranes fig s3 in terms of the accumulated foulant mass load on the membrane the specific cake resistance was calculated and presented in table 3 apparently the specific cake resistances in the gmd systems treating the green algae dosed lake water and the diatom dosed lake water were almost 7 8 time and 3 4 time lower than that fed with the control lake water respectively this implies that in the presence of algal cells especially the green algae in the lake water the formed cake layer on the uf membrane would be more porous compared to that in the control condition furthermore the accumulated organic substances on the membrane surfaces were examined presented in table 4 with increasing dosing algal cells in the feed water more soluble organics in term of soluble toc were deposited on the membrane surface this implies that the amounts of soluble organics in the cake layers were associated with the gdm permeate flux fig 1 this observation was dissimilar with the finding in a previous study 35 that the accumulated toc amounts did not significantly influence the permeate flux of gdm systems in treating secondary wastewater effluent treatment such difference was possibly associated with different wastewater characteristics lake water vs secondary wastewater effluent and membrane properties 100 kda vs 20 kda in these two studies in addition the fractions of soluble organic substances in the biofilm cake layer were examined by lc ocd and eem table 4 the lc ocd results indicated that the biopolymers were the major organic foulants in the gdm systems 52 71 regardless of absence or presence of the algal cells in the feed water the amounts of biopolymers on the membranes in the gdm systems treating the diatom dosed lake water 23 1 46 4 mg m2 were remarkably higher than those with the green algae dosed feed water 20 7 26 9 mg m2 both of which were greater than that in the control reactor 9 2 mg m2 it is well documented that both chlorella vulgaris green algae and phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom have capability in producing valuable organic components such as lipids proteins 28 36 possibly the deposited algal cells on the membrane surface could produce such greater sized organics i e biopolymers which were retained by the uf membranes increasing the amount of the diatom cells in the feed water could promote the biopolymer accumulation on the membrane while an insignificant increase of biopolymer deposition amounts on the membranes was noticed with increasing green algae concentration in the feed water nevertheless the amount of biopolymers was highly correlated with the cake layer resistance r2 0 91 instead of the amounts of other organic fractions i e humic substances building blocks and lmws a similar finding was also reported in the gdm systems in treating municipal wastewater 17 the eem analysis further revealed that in all tested five gdm systems the fluorescence intensities of aromatic proteins i and ii were greater than those of fulvic like substances iii microbial byproduct like substances iv and humic like substances v accounting to 55 68 of the total five organic components in addition the presence of green algae in the gdm systems appeared to promote more aromatic protein accumulation on the membranes compared to the control and diatom dosed gdm systems this trend is not consistent with the findings in lc ocd possibly certain organics especially biopolymers that could be detected by lc ocd may not have florescent characteristics as a result they were not presented in eem fractions nevertheless the algal species in the polluted water could influence gdm performance due to their dissimilar membrane fouling mechanisms in terms of foulant characteristics which were associated to their respective physiological behaviors under gdm operation conditions previous study also highlighted that the exposed light intensity could influence gdm performance due to its effect on algal growth 37 due to greatly dissimilar light condition during summer and winter in iceland future study on the effect of seasonal condition on gdm performance in treating algae contained surface water was proposed 4 conclusions the effects of membrane types algae species and concentrations on the performances of the gdm systems were investigated in terms of permeate flux water quality and membrane fouling mechanisms and characterization the results showed the presence of algal cells in the feed water could dramatically increase irreversible fouling of mf membranes while it caused an insignificant increase of cake layer fouling of uf membranes especially at lower algal concentrations in addition increasing the concentrations of algal cells in the feed water could cause more cake layer fouling due to the accumulation of more biopolymers on the uf membranes meanwhile greater amount of lmw neutrals was observed in the permeate water of the gdm systems treating diatom polluted lake water while the green algae in the feed water did not significantly influence the permeate quality of gdm

the difference between rt and rm rir rim the irreversible fouling resistance rir was achieved based on the difference between rm rir rim and rm rim the irremovable fouling resistance rim was achieved based on the difference between rm rim and rm 2 4 water quality analysis the turbidity ph dissolved oxygen do and conductivity measurements were conducted with a turbidity meter hach us a ph meter hach us a do meter hach us and a conductivity meter hach us respectively the water samples were periodically taken from the gdm systems operated at the stage ii for water quality examination the dissolved total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen in the water samples were measured by a toc tn analyzer shimadzu japan after the samples was filtered with a syringe membrane 0 45 μm millipore usa soluble organic fractions in the water sample were measured by an lc ocd analyzer doc labor germany which consists of a size exclusion chromatography an organic carbon detector and an organic nitrogen detector the organic matters were identified into five different fraction groups according to their molecular weights mw namely biopolymers mw 20 kda humic substances mw 1000 da building blocks mw 300 500 da low molecular weight lmw acids and neutrals mw 350 da the detailed lc ocd operation and analysis methods were described in the literature 19 in addition the composition of soluble organic fractions in the water sample was further identified by an eem fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent usa at the excitation wavelength of 220 450 nm and the emission wavelength of 280 550 nm the aromatic proteins region i ex 250 nm em 330 nm and region ii ex 250 nm em 380 nm fulvic acid like matters region iii ex 250 nm em 380 nm soluble microbial byproduct like matters region iv ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and humic acid like matters region v ex 250 nm em 380 nm were identified 20 to illustrate statistical significance a two sample t test was performed by comparing the sampling data groups under two different conditions the p value for the two sample t test was calculated at a significance level at 5 2 5 biofilm analysis at the end of the gdm filtration the membrane was taken from the filtration cell the biofilm cake layer was physically removed from the membrane by rinsing with 10 ml of distilled water 10 min which was considered as biofilm solution the soluble components in the biofilm solution were separated from the pellets by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 min the soluble organic compositions in the biofilm were further analyzed as the methods described in section 2 4 the pellet foulants were collected and dried for weight measurement 21 the specific cake resistance m kg was calculated by dividing the cake layer resistance m 1 to the cake layer foulant mass load on the membrane kg m2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of membrane type and algal species on gdm performance in this study chlorella vulgaris unicellular eukaryotic green algae with a spherical shape at sizes of 2 10 μm in diameter and phaeodactylum tricornutum fusiform shape a very widely studied marine diatom were selected as model pollutant algae in fresh surface water and in brackish surface water respectively shown in fig 1 during 10 day s gdm filtration stage i the permeate fluxes dramatically dropped during initial period of filtration within the first day before they stabilized regardless of membrane type and algal species this phenomenon has well been observed in the gdm systems in treating different types of water surface water 6 seawater 22 rainwater 23 grey water 24 wastewater 17 it was thought the initial membrane fouling was mainly induced by pore constriction in the gdm systems significantly limiting water passing through the membranes and subsequently leading to a sudden drop of the permeate flux 25 after 10 day operation the averaged permeate flux remained considerably stable at 2 54 1 45 2 03 l m2h in the mf gdm systems treating the lake water green algae polluted lake water and diatom polluted lake water respectively which were relatively lower than those in the uf gdm systems 6 55 9 42 5 53 l m2h for the lake water green algae polluted lake water and diatom polluted lake water respectively table s1 obviously the presence of both types of algae in the lake water led to an obvious decrease of the mf gdm permeate fluxes in the uf gdm systems the permeate flux was slightly improved when a low amount of green algae was dosed in the lake water while a low amount of diatom in the lake water caused a slightly reduced permeate flux of the uf gdm system furthermore the fouled membrane morphologies were recorded fig s3 and the fouling resistance distribution was evaluated fig 2 in the mf gdm systems treating the lake water i e mf control the irreversible fouling was predominant contributing to 52 of total fouling resistance when the lake water was dosed with algae both irreversible fouling resistance 1 2 1 3 1013 m 1 and irremovable fouling resistance 1 9 2 2 1012 m 1 greatly increased in the mf gdm systems while their cake layer fouling resistances were much lower than that in the mf control in contrast the cake layer fouling contributed majorly to the total fouling in the uf gdm systems in the absence and presence of additional algal species ranging from 87 to 93 compared to the control uf gdm system 3 6 1012 m 1 the dosed green algae in the uf gdm system led to a slight decrease of cake layer fouling resistance 2 6 1012 m 1 while the dosed diatom caused an increase of cake layer fouling 4 7 1012 m 1 such observations suggest that the uf gdm systems had better membrane performance and experienced less negative effects by the low amount of dosed algae in the lake water compared to the mf gdm systems it is noticed that the pristine uf membrane averaged at 90 l m2h had a higher clean water flux than the mf membrane averaged at 27 l m2h at a hydrostatic pressure of 75 mbar while the clean membrane resistances only contributed 10 of the total fouling resistance for both types of membranes fig 2 thus such difference in the clean membrane permeability may not be the major reason for the better performance of the uf membrane indeed the different fouling mechanisms of the mf and uf membranes appeared to be associated with their performances as shown in figs 2 and s3 most of the potential foulants in the lake water could be rejected by the uf membrane to form a cake layer while these foulants appeared to predominantly plug or narrow the pores of the mf membrane possibly due to their relatively comparable sizes to the mf membrane pore sizes furthermore the rejected organics on the uf membrane surface could benefit the prokaryotes development as a result promoting the eukaryotic predation and movement activity accordingly more heterogeneous and porous biofilm layer was formed on the uf membrane although more biofilm mass which resulted in a higher permeate flux 4 5 22 additionally the lower amount of algal cells especially green algae may behave as dosed particles which could facilitate the formed cake layer with much more heterogeneous nature as a result leading to less cake layer filtration resistance 26 27 it is also observed that the influences of algal species on the performances of the mf gdm and uf gdm systems behaved in different patterns in the mf gdm system fed with green algae dosed lake water a lower permeate flux was observed due to more cake layer irreversible and irremovable fouling resistances compared to those with diatom dosed lake water while the presence of the green algae in the lake water benefited to increase the permeate flux in the uf gdm systems by reducing reversible fouling 3 2 effect of algal concentration on gdm performance 3 2 1 membrane performance and fouling resistance distribution as the uf gdm systems had better membrane performance than the mf gdm systems and a lower amount of algae in the lake water had insignificant impacts on the uf gdm performance stage i in the stage ii the effect of higher algal concentration 2 time and 4 time of the algal concentration in the stage i on the uf gdm performance was further explored the gdm permeate flux development profiles were presented in fig 3 similarly the permeate fluxes dramatically dropped during initial period of filtration within the first day before they stabilized under all testing conditions fig 3 compared to the stable flux in the control gdm 9 00 l m2h the presence of more algal cells in the lake water could lead to decreased permeate fluxes for both algal species 2 97 7 23 l m2h it is noted that the control uf gdm systems in the stage i and ii had slightly different stable fluxes 6 22 and 9 00 l m2h respectively table s1 because the feed lake water taken at different periods of time had slightly dissimilar compositions e g turbidity 23 3 8 8 ntu vs 6 2 7 6 ntu tables s2 and 2 to make a fair comparison the flux incline or decline ratio was calculated and illustrated in table s1 obviously when a lower concentration of green algae was present in the lake water the permeate flux increased 44 while with further increasing its concentration to 2 and 4 the permeate flux dropped 20 and 23 respectively in the presence of the diatom in the lake water the permeate flux decreased from 16 to 34 to 67 with elevating the diatom concentration from 1 to 2 to 4 respectively at the end of experiments day 34 the fouling resistance distribution was further examined shown in fig 4 the cake layer fouling was predominant in the higher amount of algae dosed gdm systems at the stage ii similar to the control gdm system and the gdm system with the lower amount of algae uf membrane stage i it was also observed that the permeate flux decline was associated with an increased cake layer fouling moreover the amounts of the diatom cells in the feed lake water had a more significant impact on the gdm performance than those of the green algae 3 2 2 permeate water quality the water samples from the feed water tanks and permeate bottles were periodically monitored during 34 day operation stage ii and their water quality parameters were presented in the table 2 as shown in table 2 dosing both algal cells into the feed water could not significantly influence turbidity ph and do levels compared to the control feed i e without dosing algae p values 0 05 in contrast dosing the diatom cell solution including cultural medium could significantly increase the feed water conductivity p value 0 05 because the dosed cultural medium was at a high salinity level while the conductivity of the feed water dosed with the green algae was not significantly varied p value 0 05 the permeate water in all tested gdm systems was almost turbidity free due to excellent rejection of the uf membranes in addition the ph do or conductivity level in the permeate water was comparable to that in its respective feed water in addition compared to the control feed water the diatom dosed feed water had greatly more soluble organic carbon and total nitrogen p value 0 05 while the feed water dosed with the green algae had similar amounts of soluble organic carbon and total nitrogen p value 0 05 table 2 as the diatom culture medium f 2 si contains na2edta c10h14n2na2o8 trace element 1 48 mgc l in the culture medium it could contribute soluble organic carbon in the diatom dosed feed water contributing 15 30 μgc l in the feed water as 50 100 times dilution of the culture medium in addition it has been reported that marine diatoms can secrete large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps and their quantity and quality are environmental dependent 28 29 after the marine diatom cells were dosed into the lake water their growth conditions shifted from favorable high salinity to unfavorable low salinity as a result they may regulate their metabolic behaviors by producing more eps to tolerate such environmental stress especially these led to great amount of lmw neutral substances in the diatom dosed feed water almost 50 100 times higher than those in the control feed water furthermore the averaged soluble toc 15 7 18 9 and tn 7 7 11 6 removal ratios of the green algae dosed gdm systems were slightly higher than those in the control gdm 12 5 and 2 4 respectively both removal ratios were improved with increasing dosing amount of the green algae previous studies have pointed out that the green algae c vulgaris could utilize organic carbon sources to promote their growth i e heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth 14 30 and enhance nutrient removal from the wastewater 31 this characteristics of green algae promoted the organic removal efficiencies in the gdm systems while in the diatom dosed gdm systems the averaged soluble toc removal ratios 3 8 7 6 were lower than that in the control gdm 12 5 and tn removal ratios 2 3 were comparable to that in the control gdm 2 4 to further investigate the effect of algal species and concentrations on doc removal compositions of doc were analyzed by lc ocd table 2 and eem fig 5 table 2 shows that in both control gdm and algae dosed gdm systems the concentrations of all five organic components in the permeate were slightly higher than or comparable to those in respective feed water similarly the eem analysis results fig 5 also indicated that almost comparable amounts of five types of organic components in the feed and permeate water this phenomenon was also observed in the previous studies 17 18 32 34 it was speculated that 1 the particulate organics not measured by the toc analyzer due to pretreatment procedure of toc analysis in the feed water could decomposed or hydrolyzed into the smaller sized soluble substances and 2 the microorganisms on the membrane surface utilized greater sized organics and produced smaller sized soluble substances these soluble substances could not be effectively retained by the uf membranes and therefore were present in the permeate 3 2 3 cake layer foulants characteristics the cake layer morphologies were directly observed via the glass windows of the gdm filtration cells and their photos were recorded in fig s4 clearly the algal cells covered the membrane surface within the first day of filtration showing being highly retained by the membranes with more particulates from the lake water accumulated on the membranes the algal presence especially green algae was not obviously noticed at the end of filtration experiments the cake layer was carefully removed from the membrane surface and the foulant characteristics were examined the microscopic images in the fig s5 revealed the presence of the eukaryotes in the cake layer regardless of the absence and presence of dosed algal cells shown in table 3 much more cake layer foulants were deposited on the membrane surface in the gdm systems treating algae dosed lake water compared to those in the control gdm system this was attributed to the accumulation of the rejected algal cells on the uf membranes fig s3 in terms of the accumulated foulant mass load on the membrane the specific cake resistance was calculated and presented in table 3 apparently the specific cake resistances in the gmd systems treating the green algae dosed lake water and the diatom dosed lake water were almost 7 8 time and 3 4 time lower than that fed with the control lake water respectively this implies that in the presence of algal cells especially the green algae in the lake water the formed cake layer on the uf membrane would be more porous compared to that in the control condition furthermore the accumulated organic substances on the membrane surfaces were examined presented in table 4 with increasing dosing algal cells in the feed water more soluble organics in term of soluble toc were deposited on the membrane surface this implies that the amounts of soluble organics in the cake layers were associated with the gdm permeate flux fig 1 this observation was dissimilar with the finding in a previous study 35 that the accumulated toc amounts did not significantly influence the permeate flux of gdm systems in treating secondary wastewater effluent treatment such difference was possibly associated with different wastewater characteristics lake water vs secondary wastewater effluent and membrane properties 100 kda vs 20 kda in these two studies in addition the fractions of soluble organic substances in the biofilm cake layer were examined by lc ocd and eem table 4 the lc ocd results indicated that the biopolymers were the major organic foulants in the gdm systems 52 71 regardless of absence or presence of the algal cells in the feed water the amounts of biopolymers on the membranes in the gdm systems treating the diatom dosed lake water 23 1 46 4 mg m2 were remarkably higher than those with the green algae dosed feed water 20 7 26 9 mg m2 both of which were greater than that in the control reactor 9 2 mg m2 it is well documented that both chlorella vulgaris green algae and phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom have capability in producing valuable organic components such as lipids proteins 28 36 possibly the deposited algal cells on the membrane surface could produce such greater sized organics i e biopolymers which were retained by the uf membranes increasing the amount of the diatom cells in the feed water could promote the biopolymer accumulation on the membrane while an insignificant increase of biopolymer deposition amounts on the membranes was noticed with increasing green algae concentration in the feed water nevertheless the amount of biopolymers was highly correlated with the cake layer resistance r2 0 91 instead of the amounts of other organic fractions i e humic substances building blocks and lmws a similar finding was also reported in the gdm systems in treating municipal wastewater 17 the eem analysis further revealed that in all tested five gdm systems the fluorescence intensities of aromatic proteins i and ii were greater than those of fulvic like substances iii microbial byproduct like substances iv and humic like substances v accounting to 55 68 of the total five organic components in addition the presence of green algae in the gdm systems appeared to promote more aromatic protein accumulation on the membranes compared to the control and diatom dosed gdm systems this trend is not consistent with the findings in lc ocd possibly certain organics especially biopolymers that could be detected by lc ocd may not have florescent characteristics as a result they were not presented in eem fractions nevertheless the algal species in the polluted water could influence gdm performance due to their dissimilar membrane fouling mechanisms in terms of foulant characteristics which were associated to their respective physiological behaviors under gdm operation conditions previous study also highlighted that the exposed light intensity could influence gdm performance due to its effect on algal growth 37 due to greatly dissimilar light condition during summer and winter in iceland future study on the effect of seasonal condition on gdm performance in treating algae contained surface water was proposed 4 conclusions the effects of membrane types algae species and concentrations on the performances of the gdm systems were investigated in terms of permeate flux water quality and membrane fouling mechanisms and characterization the results showed the presence of algal cells in the feed water could dramatically increase irreversible fouling of mf membranes while it caused an insignificant increase of cake layer fouling of uf membranes especially at lower algal concentrations in addition increasing the concentrations of algal cells in the feed water could cause more cake layer fouling due to the accumulation of more biopolymers on the uf membranes meanwhile greater amount of lmw neutrals was observed in the permeate water of the gdm systems treating diatom polluted lake water while the green algae in the feed water did not significantly influence the permeate quality of gdm

13951,in electrocoagulation the accumulation of gas bubbles surrounding the electrode plate surface results in high internal resistance between the electrode plates that obstruct optimum ionic transfer subsequently reducing the electrocoagulation efficiency this study investigated the performance of batch electrocoagulation designed with vibration induced electrode plates in the treatment of landfill leachate to remove colour and chemical oxygen demand cod the electrode plates in the electrocoagulation cell were each attached with a dc motor vibrator varied at different vibration intensity in which its effect on the initial ph operating time and electrical current of the electrocoagulation were determined the results showed that the application of vibration induced electrode plates had a synergistic effect with the electrocoagulation with more than 90 of colour and cod up to 35 removed during the treatment at vibration intensity of 2 8 v initial ph 5 operating time of 35 min applied current of 2 5a applied voltage ranged between 11 0 12 9 v with calculated electrical energy consumption of 8 58 kw h m3 overall the vibration induced electrode plates were found to enhance the treatment performance due to a combination of improved ionic transfer enhanced bubbles detachment from the electrode surface and dispersion in the solution the detachment of bubbles from the plates also enable improved mixing in the solution leading to an increase in homogeneity and better sludge separation following treatment in conclusion this study showed that electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates provided an improved technique in enhancing the ionic transfer and bubbles dispersion in electrocoagulation for the removal of pollutants keywords cod colour electrocoagulation gas bubbles detachment vibration induced electrode plates 1 introduction the research on electrocoagulation ec in treating landfill leachate has attracted increasing interest and attention over the year from many researchers given the effectiveness of the technology in removing a variety of harmful pollutants in leachate such as chemical oxygen demand cod colour and suspended solids 1 5 electrocoagulation can be described as an electrochemical method involving the release of active coagulant precursors usually aluminium or iron cations from the corroded sacrificial anodes in the solution and the simultaneous formation of hydroxyl ions and hydrogen gas at the cathode when an electric current is applied the anode will undergo oxidation while the cathode will experience a reductive deposition of elemental metals as such the formation of solid hydroxides and oxyhydroxides during the process will provide active surfaces for the adsorption of pollutants since water is also electrolysed as part of the parallel reaction this will induce a simultaneous production of oxygen and hydrogen bubbles at the corresponding anode and cathode respectively without any flow or agitation mechanism in the ec treatment the oxygen and hydrogen gas generated in situ can produce a soft mix which helps to attract the colloids destabilise to flocculate and will then carry the flocculated pollutants up to the surface through natural buoyancy 6 this later process which can help to further enhance the pollutant removal efficiency is named as electroflotation another main mechanism in ec unfortunately however during the treatment process the evolved gases accumulate at the electrode surface increasing the electrical resistance between the electrodes thereby achieving less than optimum ionic transfer also the uneven generation of gas bubbles on the electrode could lead to the concentration of gas bubbles in the specific zone of floatation therefore to overcome this high electrolytic flow is required in batch electrocoagulation to minimise the accumulation and detach bubbles from the electrode surface the electrolytic flow in batch electrocoagulation is normally achieved by applying an agitation mechanism such as a magnetic stirrer bar as such a high electrolytic flow can be obtained by increasing the agitation speed of the stirrer bar near to the electrode surface as reported in a few studies the agitation speed however requires an optimum speed for the pollutant removal efficiency to achieve its maximum value 7 9 setting below the optimum speed will cause low ion mobility and produce small flocs which may be difficult to remove while beyond the optimum speed will result in floc degradation due to high collisions 8 10 most of the intensification methods in wastewater treatment as shown in fig 1 commonly utilize addition of coagulants flocculants additive or other surface active materials the exposure to chemicals are quite common in electrocoagulation studies as revealed in several literatures 11 15 in our previous review of electrocoagulation we highlighted the latest physical intensification approaches which focused on the mechanical modifications of the reactor and electrodes to enhance the agitation mass transport and efficiency of pollutant removal in the electrocoagulation cell the modifications include utilising a filter press reactor an oscillating anode periodic electrode reversal and a rotating anode 15 it has also been reported that the enhancement made on the electrocoagulation reactor and electrode improved the removal percentage by more than 90 another physical method of intensification which is through vibrations and acoustical techniques can be classified as the exposure to ultrasound vibration and sound 16 the combination of ultrasound with electrocoagulation commonly known as sono electrocoagulation has been applied in improving the kinetics and effectiveness of the electrode process especially to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants and the coagulation of the flocs 17 18 the exposure to ultrasound through sono electrocoagulation however is dependent on the external source which is the external probe or water bath for generating bubbles aside from that this combination is highly dependent on high power densities and power consumption which can invariably lead to high operating costs on the other hand there are several industrial applications concerning vibrations such as electropolishing 17 18 mineral processing 19 20 and flotation for wastewater treatment 16 in the intensification of wastewater flotation treatment by exposure to vibration the study utilized a flotation column an aerator to supply air through an air pump and a shaker to generate vibration at certain amplitude and frequency used to intensify different stages of flotation 16 it has been reported from this study that exposure to vibration resulted in the decrease of air bubble size increase of air flow through the aerator more even dispersion of air bubbles in water which directly improving the treatment efficiency significantly 16 more importantly vibration stimulates the stirring of bubbles and contaminants in water which may increase the collisions probability between contaminants and bubbles leading to a better aggregate formation 16 this study was reported for the flotation treatment alone in treating wastewater nevertheless to date studies concerning on exposure of vibration in electrocoagulation has not been investigated and reported anywhere in the literature since electrocoagulation includes electroflotation in its parallel treatment which is also the key parameters of the process so there is an interest to determine the effects of vibration exposure on intensifying the flotation process in ec thus the present study was conducted to investigate the performance of vibration induced electrode plates in removing colour and cod in landfill leachate the study focused on the variables such as the effect of vibration intensity of the electrode plates applied current operating time and initial ph on the removal efficiency of the contaminants as well as its complete mixing and flotation capability during the ec treatment 2 materials and method 2 1 sampling of leachate the main raw material used in this research was stabilised landfill leachate collected at a detention pond in pulau burung sanitary landfill pbsl located in the northern region of penang malaysia geographic coordinates of 5 12 n latitude 100 25 e longitude surrounded by a natural habitat of several varieties of bird species and mangrove trees pbsl has been operating since 1991 during the initial phase of operations a semi aerobic system was introduced which established a controlled tipping technique complying with level ii of the sanitary landfill standards 21 in 2001 the landfill was upgraded to level iii employing controlled tipping with leachate recirculation 22 as these landfill phases are now full the state is presently in the process of moving to phase 3 which will establish a level iv standard a highest standard for landfill by incorporating a modern material recovery facility mrf the samples examined in this research were collected within a six month period between january and june 2019 for full monitoring of its physico chemical characteristics a 20 l ptfe container was completely filled with the leachate in order to prevent any space for aeration the sample was collected via grab sampling from the detention pond and analysed within 24 h from the time of sampling the collection and preservation of the sample were performed in accordance with the standard method for the examination of water and wastewater 23 the leachate physicochemical parameters analysed included temperature ph colour cod biological oxygen demand bod5 suspended solids ammonia nitrogen nh3 n turbidity conductivity and dissolved oxygen the results of these physicochemical parameters are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedures the electrocoagulation treatment was performed using a fabricated plexiglass batch reactor 210 mm l 156 mm width and 148 mm height in size as illustrated in fig 2 the batch reactor has a volume of 4 85 l the working volume of 2 l for each sample was made constant for all runs the electrodes were made of 5052 aluminium alloy with compositions containing silicon 0 25 iron 0 40 copper 0 1 manganese 0 1 magnesium 2 2 2 8 chromium 0 15 0 35 zinc 0 1 others 0 15 and the remainder comprising of aluminium a pair of vertical aluminium electrodes with a dimension of 200 mm l 50 mm w and 1 mm thickness was arranged in a parallel configuration the electrodes were then immersed into the leachate sample at a depth of 60 mm with an effective surface area of 30 cm2 one face and a total surface area of 120 cm2 for both plates the gap between the electrodes of 2 cm was maintained for all runs 24 28 both electrodes were connected with a digital dc power supply qje ps3010 which supplied between 0 10 a and 0 30 v of power for the vibration induced treatment a dc motor vibrator of size 25 mm diameter and 13 mm height was attached to one side of each electrode plate each of the dc motors was connected to the multiple input power supply as illustrated in fig 2 the vibration motor was able to function at a voltage ranging between 0 6 v since our research was concerned about the performance of the novel vibration induced electrocoagulation the treatment was also undertaken using stationary electrode plates for comparison for this treatment no dc motor was attached to the electrode plates and the electrocoagulation was performed without any flow no agitation mechanism inside the reactor the performance of batch electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates was investigated based on the effect of parameters i e vibration intensity varied from 1 8 v to 3 8 v of the motor vibrator ph of 5 10 operating time between 10 and 60 min and current density between 0 5 and 4 5 a on the removal percentage of colour and cod in studying the effect of ph 1 m of sodium hydroxide and 1 m of hydrochloric acid were used to adjust the leachate to basic and acidic ph respectively for the non vibration induced electrocoagulation treatment i e stationary electrode plates similar parameters were used and examined except for vibration intensity at the end of each run samples of the treated leachate were collected at a depth of 5 cm from the surface of the wastewater using a pipette the electrodes were washed with water to remove any residuals of solid particles and dried the removal percentage of pollutant p was calculated by applying the following equation 1 p c i c o c o x 100 where ci and co signify the initial and final concentration of raw and treated leachate respectively 2 3 analysis of raw leachate and samples of treated leachate table 1 lists the leachate parameters that were characterised using the standard analytical method the measurements of the samples were conducted in triplicates according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23 the ph of the samples was determined using a ph meter hach model sens ion 1 usa temperature and conductivity were determined using a conductivity meter hach model sens ion 5 usa and a dissolved oxygen meter ysi 5000 usa was used to determine the dissolved oxygen values 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical properties of pbsl leachate table 2 shows the physicochemical properties of the pbsl leachate the properties were compared with the range of values obtained from the literature for old leachate 22 the biodegradation ration of bod5 to cod of 0 1 indicates that pbsl is considered in the methanogenic phase mature stabilised leachate 35 36 at this final stage of landfill stabilisation the nutrients and substrate in leachate have a limiting amount and the biological activity is shifted to relative dormancy thus from the data shown in table 2 it can be seen that the leachate parameters are at a much lower concentration 37 comparing the values with the standard discharge limit of leachate as to that established by the department of environment malaysia it can be seen that among the critical values include colour and cod 3 2 effect of vibration intensity of electrode plates on the electrocoagulation treatment to maximise the efficiency of electrocoagulation the following need to be minimised 1 internal resistance between the two electrodes 2 the accumulation of oxygen and hydrogen gas bubbles nucleates at the electrode surface and 3 the impairment to mass transfer through the spaces between the electrode 38 39 here the oxygen and hydrogen gas which nucleate gather on the electrode surface which might create impermeable layers which prevent effective ions transport between the two electrodes hence raising internal resistance the resistance r is correlated with the voltage v and the applied current i following ohm s law 2 v i r since the voltage is directly dependent on r thus without any form of flow stationary electrode at an constant applied current the release of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles that attach on the surface of the electrode plate may result in an increase in electrical resistance minimise the ionic transfer between the electrode plates and consequently reduce the removal of pollutant fig 3 illustrates that even at a constant electrode distance the change in the applied voltage for the stationary electrode plates is greater compared to the vibration induced plate accordingly this may suggest that high resistance has occurred on the stationary electrode plates especially at a current between 1 5 a and 3 5 a according to mollah et al 38 a high electrolyte flow surrounding the electrode may be useful to mitigate the accumulation of bubbles thus eliminating the bubbles from the electrode surface hence the use of vibration induced electrode plates in the electrocoagulation treatment may provide benefit based on this reason during the electrocoagulation treatment the motor vibrator attached to the electrode plates will vibrate on the plate tested at an intensity range between 1 8 and 3 8 v to observe the effect of plate vibration on the generation and dispersion of bubbles an experiment was conducted to observe the treatment using clear water with modified electrical conductivity comparable to the wastewater and applying an electrical current fixed at 2 5 a fig 4 illustrates the generation and dispersion of bubbles in the solution when the intensity of the vibration was varied between 1 8 3 8 v from observing the treatment it was noticed that when the electrical current was applied to the electrode bubbles formed on the surface of the electrode next applying a lower vibration intensity of 1 8 v to the electrode it was observed that the bubbles tended to attach themselves on the surface of the electrode with no dispersion of bubbles occurring into the solution then increasing the vibration intensity to 2 3 v this resulted in fewer bubbles detaching themselves and dispersing into the solution further increase on the intensity of the vibration up to 3 8 v showed that the bubbles fully detached themselves from the surface of the electrode dispersing into the solution the vibration induced electrode plates affect the removal percentage during the treatment as shown from the plot in fig 5 the effect was examined at a constant ph of 8 with an operating time of 35 min and voltage of 2 5 a the removal of colour in the leachate increased to more than 50 by increasing the vibration intensity from 1 8 to 2 8 v but remained unchanged at a higher intensity with the removal percentage achieved more than 70 the removal percentage of cod achieved the highest removal at the vibration intensity of 2 8 v therefore the results indicate that batch electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates showed good performance in colour removal this may be due to the role of the vibration induced electrode plates where oscillation may induce a certain frequency creating a stirring effect surrounding the electrode plate surface which in turn detaches the bubbles from the electrode surface enhancing the flocculation and floatation process the performance however is limited to a certain range of intensity where in this case at the vibration intensity of more than 2 8 v the removal percentage of cod reduced or remained unchanged for colour removal to observe the synergistic performance of the vibration induced electrode plates in electrocoagulation the effect of the initial ph operating time and current intensity were investigated on colour and cod removal the results were also compared with electrocoagulation using stationary electrode plates 3 3 effect of initial ph on colour and cod removal between vibration induced and stationary electrode plates the initial ph at the beginning of the electrocoagulation treatment had a substantial influence since it had a different effect on the dissolution of aluminium electrodes and its speciation of hydroxides to determine the relative effect of the initial ph on the vibration induced electrocoagulation the initial ph was adjusted to 5 6 8 9 and 10 with a constant vibration intensity of 2 8 v at both the constant operating time of 35 min and the current intensity of 2 5a similar parameters for the operating time and current intensity were also investigated for the stationary electrode plates as a comparison the removal percentage of colour cod and its final ph are presented in fig 6 a c in the removal of colour and cod it can be seen from the plot that the removal percentage reduced with increasing ph the highest percentage of 90 for colour and 35 for cod was achieved at ph 5 consistently for both vibration induced and stationary electrode plates generally the high colour concentration in old leachate is due to the presence of saturated organic matter such as humic and fulvic substances with some insoluble forms which tend to exhibit the high turbidity and suspended solids value 40 the removal of these substances is strongly dependent on the ph in which according to gregory et al 41 for the solution with a ph of 5 6 a strong adsorption and charge neutralisation occurs between the negatively charged humic substances and the positively charged al and the aluminium hydroxide precipitate has higher solubility at this region at a ph between 6 and 10 the colour and cod removal decreases dramatically this is because the concentration of aluminium hydroxides precipitates decreased due to an increase in aluminium hydroxyl anions a l o h 4 which is predominant in alkaline condition hence re stabilises the colloidal suspension which then hinders flocculation on the other hand between the ph of 6 and 10 there is a significant difference in the removal efficiency of both colour and cod between the vibration induced and stationary electrode plates this is because aside from the formation of hydroxyl ions at the electrodes the electrodes also produce gas bubbles mainly hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode over time during the treatment these gas bubbles accumulate at the stationary electrode resulting in less ionic transfer and prolong the coagulation process when applying vibration onto the electrode plates this enables the gas bubbles to continuously detach themselves from the electrode plate hence promoting the destabilisation of particles to occur and flocculate to the top surface in electrocoagulation the ph also influences the size of the gas bubbles where the smallest hydrogen bubbles are produced at a neutral or acidic ph 42 hence this reason further supports the highest removal of colour and cod at lower ph the final ph plot as illustrated in fig 6 c shows that there is an increase of ph for the treated leachate at the end of the electrolysis for all the tested ph this may indicate the increase of hydrogenation at the cathode plate and the liberation of hydroxide ions from aluminium hydroxides that increase ph throughout the ec process 43 3 4 effect of operating time on colour and cod removal between vibration induced and stationary electrode plates the effect of operating time was next investigated between 10 and 60 min at a constant ph of 8 and a current density of 2 5 a for the vibration induced electrode plates the vibration intensity was fixed at 2 8 v as shown in fig 7 a an increase in the time from 10 to 60 min led to an increase in the removal of colour which achieved the highest percentage with the vibration induced electrode plates of more than 80 likewise for the stationary electrode plates the removal of colour shows a slight percentage below the vibration induced electrode plates at ph 8 the hydrolysis of the al3 cations may not predominate since the reaction is not in favour at this ph given the concentration of al oh 3 s is low 41 however prolonging the electrolysis time allows the rate of bubble generation to increase hence the removal of pollutants in the leachate during the treatment was improved by the action of the bubbles the vibration induced electrode plates further enhanced the soft mixing produced during electrocoagulation with the stationary plates by producing a vast number of bubbles in the solution hence improving the rate transfer of ions to attract the pollutants furthermore the vibration intensity induced during electrocoagulation could raise the mixing efficiency thus promoting collisions to occur between the coagulant and the pollutant particles therefore by using electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates the pollutant removal efficiency was enhanced between 6 and 45 efficiency in the 60 min treatment for the cod removal it was anticipated from the previous result that the removal percentage would be lower at ph 8 compared to colour removal fortunately prolonging the electrolysis time to 60 min helped to increase the removal up to 16 for the vibration induced electrode plates and 60 even higher for the stationary plates as shown in fig 7 b the electrochemical process that occurred at the anode resulted in the dissolution of aluminium to compete with the evolution of oxygen hence oxygen evolution may help with the oxygen demand 25 44 it is expected that prolonging the time of more than 60 minutes may also increase the removal efficiency of cod even higher however this may not be true for the vibration induced electrode plates as can be seen from the plot the removal efficiency was increasing within the 35 minutes of treatment time within this time frame the vibration induced treatment may allow greater dissociation of hydrogen gas produced at the electrode plates thus increasing the cod removal efficiency the removal efficiency however remains unchanged at 48 minutes and unable to surpass the removal efficiency obtained by the stationary plates at 60 minutes of treatment time this might be because at prolonged operating time for the ec with vibration induced electrode plates resulted in saturated gas bubbles produced in the solution thus reduce the ions concentration and viscosity of the solution when the ion concentration reduced the adsorption of pollutants decrease and remain unchanged this phenomena can also be correlated with the electrical conductivity of the solution as a function of time as described in the following paragraph fig 7 c illustrates the changes in electrical conductivity over operating time the electrical conductivity measurement reflects the solution conductivity which helps the flow of the electric current through it 42 addition of anions in the form of salts may increase the electrical conductivity of the solution hence increase the current densitiy and removal efficiency of the treatment 45 in this study however there were no addition of salts made during the treatment and the electrical conductivity obviously represents the actual value of the leachate wastewater addition of acids and alkalis as to adjust the initial ph only reduced the electrical conductivity of the solution very slightly even though without the addition of salts within 60 minutes of time the treatment still could achieve increasing removal of colour and cod as can be observed in the results increasing in electrocoagulation time and increased in the removal percentage of colour and cod the electrical conductivity decreased for both the vibration induced and stationary plates similar results were also reported in some study 46 the vibration induced electrode plates showed even lower electrical conductivity as compared to stationary plates is due to a significant amount of bubbles produced in the solution when the electrode plates were induced with vibration the gas bubbles detached from the electrode plates producing increasing amount of bubbles in the solution hence decreased in concentration of leachate and electrical conductivity in turn 46 3 5 effect of current density on colour and cod removal between vibration induced and stationary electrode plates fig 8 a and b illustrates the removal percentage of colour and cod when the current intensity is varied at 0 5 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 a at a constant time of 35 min and ph 8 and a vibration intensity of 2 8 v for vibration induced electrocoagulation a significant difference can be observed for the colour removal between the results obtained from the vibration induced treatment and the stationary electrode plates here the treatment favours the combination of the electrocoagulation with the vibration induced electrode plates as compared to the stationary plates when increasing the current using an electrochemical reactor with the aluminium electrode plates the production of coagulants ions from the electrode plate will increase consequently more flocs are formed to capture the colloidal particles and to improve pollutant removal efficiency with increasing current density the rate of bubble generation will also increase while the bubble size will decrease resulting in faster removal of pollutants by hydrogen floatation 47 apparently when the electrocoagulation is coupled with vibration induced electrode plates the gas bubbles will be massively formed by oxidation and the reduction of water even though it s at a lower current intensity the gas bubbles help to promote flocculation through improved mixing leading to enhanced pollutant removal by floatation the stationary plate on the other hand has lower removal percentage at lower current intensity due to it only being capable of providing soft mixing for the flocculation process despite the low removal percentage for cod attained during the treatment the results however show that electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates improved the pollutant removal with an increment between 1 and 7 between the current intensity of 0 5 4 5 a fig 8 c displays final temperature obtained at the conclusion of each treatment the starting temperature at the beginning of each treatment was made consistent with the room temperature between 26 and 27 c as seen from the plot for both the vibration induced and stationary plates the temperature increases when the applied current increases during the treatment in which the most substantial removal percentage for colour was around 80 achieved with the applied current at 4 5 a final temperature of around 43 c and operating time of 35 min accordingly this indicates that even without varying the temperature during the treatment the temperature will be elevated during the process given the thermal energy that is provided by the electrical current to the electrode plates increasing temperature during the treatment also allows the solubility of aluminium to enhance thus increasing the pollutant removal efficiency 10 in the case of the vibration induced electrode plates the higher temperature will favour the removal of pollutant since it is attributed by the larger amount hydrogen gas bubbles formed on the vibration induced cathode which in turn enhances the floatation speed of the coagulant with the adsorbed pollutants 10 3 6 sludge separation after electrocoagulation a physical observation was made on the sludge separation following the electrocoagulation treatment with the vibration induced plates and stationary electrode plates figs 9 and 10 show the snapshot image of the sludge separated following electrocoagulation with the vibration induced plates and stationary electrode plates respectively both have similar working parameters i e ph 6 operating time of 48 min current intensity of 3 5 a and 2 3 v of vibration intensity of the electrode plates for the vibration induced treatment the electrocoagulation with the vibration induced electrode plates benefits from the treatment in a way that generalises the floatation process through the generation and dispersion of the enhanced bubbles as low density particulates of fine particles can separate from the wastewater by the bubbles produced from the treatment this can be seen in fig 9 where it displays a better sludge separation by forming two uniform layers of sludge on the top surface of the wastewater this layer may contain residuals of amorphous aluminium hydroxide and or aluminium oxyhydroxide represented by the white layers and the dark layer represents the removed pollutant on the other hand sludge separated from the stationary electrode plates shows that non uniform layers have been formed with larger particles are shown floating and dispersing everywhere in the solution the conclusion being that even at high current intensity the bubbles produced at the stationary electrode plates could not enhance the floatation process as compared to the performance by the vibration induced electrode plates 3 7 electrical energy consumption one of the most important economical parameters in electrocoagulation is energy consumption fig 11 shows the correlation between current densities and the average voltage obtained from the electrocoagulation treatment fig 12 shows the energy consumptions required for the treatment of the landfill leachate as a function of operating time at different current densities the current densites was calculated using eq 3 while the electrical energy consumpetion e was calculated in terms of kwh m3 of treated effluent using eq 4 3 c d i a 4 e u i t v where c d is the current density ma cm2 i is the applied current a a is the total effective submerged area of the electrode cm2 e is the electrical energy consumption kwh m3 u is the average cell voltage v t is the operating time of electrocoagulation treatment h and v is the volume of treated effluent l the average voltages obtained from vibration induced and stationary electrode plates are similar since both have similar current densities applied during the electrocoagulation treatment with similar set ups in term of the volume of wastewater and effective submerged area of electrode plates it can be seen from fig 11 that the average voltage increases proportionally with the current densities this is true since voltage v is dependent on the applied current i as shown in eq 2 the results on the electrical energy consumption shows that the values increased with the current density the highest value for energy consumption were 39 15 kw h m3 at applied current of 2 5 a cd 20 8 ma cm2 the highest colour removal effiencies of more than 90 was obtained at operating time of 35 minutes and more than 40 of cod removal effiency was obtained after 60 min of operating time as a result the maximum values for energy consumption at cd of 20 8 ma cm2 were 8 58 kw h m3 and 14 71 kw h m3 for colour and cod removal respectively these values are within the range of values as reported in the literature of range between 0 002 and 58 kw h m3 for energy consumption with the electrocoagulation process 48 4 conclusions after more than 20 years since its operation pulau burung sanitary landfill has achieved a mature stabilised phase based on the current value of physicochemical characteristics nevertheless there are several parameters that do not comply with the discharge standard as established under the regulations issued by the malaysian department of environment hence the treatment of leachate is required to reduce the harmful pollutants which are contaminating the surrounding environment electrocoagulation is useful for treating mature leachate as the one in pbsl the efficiency of this method however is reduced when there is resistance between the electrode plates such as the accumulation of generated gas bubbles on the electrode surface a novel approach to improve the mixing and ions transfer is by applying electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates as demonstrated in the present study and the results show good performance in removing colour and cod in leachate compared to stationary electrode plates indeed the performance is maximised when the vibration intensity of the electrode plates is at 2 8 v with the treatment operating at acidic ph and current intensity ranged between 2 5 a and 4 5 a however the vibration induced electrode plates was not feasible to further removed cod at longer operating time due saturation of gas bubbles the vibration induced electrode plates were also found to reduce the accumulation of bubbles surrounding the electrode plates improve the homogeneity of the solution and provide better sludge separation at the conclusion of the treatment the calculated electrical energy requirement revealed that the value of energy consumption for the highest removal of colour and cod is 8 58 kw h m3 and 14 71 kw h m3 respectively to further gain a better understanding on the present study fundamentally the following work is proposed 1 since gas bubbles may be the key point in the success of electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates determination of the bubbles size and its distribution bubbles rise velocity mixing and dispersion characteristics at different vibration intensity during treatment could be further investigated this may further lead to better understanding of flow behaviour in electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates 2 the study on the fundamentals of vibration relating to its frequency velocity mode shape and boundary layer on the electrode plates may reflect the mechanism of fluid motion laminar transitional turbulence flow and its flow pattern in presence of strong vortex generated by the vibrating plates in the electrocoagulation is a further area for investigation 3 the stability of particles can also be investigated through the electrokinetic effects to determine the electrophoresis movement of the charged particles relative to the liquid suspended under the influence of an electric field and vibration induced plates 4 the mechanism of the electrocoagulation process when induced with vibration such as physio adsorption or chemo adsorption could be further explored 5 the evaluation of the mass transfer during vibration induced treatment through cfd simulation is a further area worth looking into 6 the flocculation index could be determined to observe the uniformity of the floc and its particle size during vibration induced

13951,in electrocoagulation the accumulation of gas bubbles surrounding the electrode plate surface results in high internal resistance between the electrode plates that obstruct optimum ionic transfer subsequently reducing the electrocoagulation efficiency this study investigated the performance of batch electrocoagulation designed with vibration induced electrode plates in the treatment of landfill leachate to remove colour and chemical oxygen demand cod the electrode plates in the electrocoagulation cell were each attached with a dc motor vibrator varied at different vibration intensity in which its effect on the initial ph operating time and electrical current of the electrocoagulation were determined the results showed that the application of vibration induced electrode plates had a synergistic effect with the electrocoagulation with more than 90 of colour and cod up to 35 removed during the treatment at vibration intensity of 2 8 v initial ph 5 operating time of 35 min applied current of 2 5a applied voltage ranged between 11 0 12 9 v with calculated electrical energy consumption of 8 58 kw h m3 overall the vibration induced electrode plates were found to enhance the treatment performance due to a combination of improved ionic transfer enhanced bubbles detachment from the electrode surface and dispersion in the solution the detachment of bubbles from the plates also enable improved mixing in the solution leading to an increase in homogeneity and better sludge separation following treatment in conclusion this study showed that electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates provided an improved technique in enhancing the ionic transfer and bubbles dispersion in electrocoagulation for the removal of pollutants keywords cod colour electrocoagulation gas bubbles detachment vibration induced electrode plates 1 introduction the research on electrocoagulation ec in treating landfill leachate has attracted increasing interest and attention over the year from many researchers given the effectiveness of the technology in removing a variety of harmful pollutants in leachate such as chemical oxygen demand cod colour and suspended solids 1 5 electrocoagulation can be described as an electrochemical method involving the release of active coagulant precursors usually aluminium or iron cations from the corroded sacrificial anodes in the solution and the simultaneous formation of hydroxyl ions and hydrogen gas at the cathode when an electric current is applied the anode will undergo oxidation while the cathode will experience a reductive deposition of elemental metals as such the formation of solid hydroxides and oxyhydroxides during the process will provide active surfaces for the adsorption of pollutants since water is also electrolysed as part of the parallel reaction this will induce a simultaneous production of oxygen and hydrogen bubbles at the corresponding anode and cathode respectively without any flow or agitation mechanism in the ec treatment the oxygen and hydrogen gas generated in situ can produce a soft mix which helps to attract the colloids destabilise to flocculate and will then carry the flocculated pollutants up to the surface through natural buoyancy 6 this later process which can help to further enhance the pollutant removal efficiency is named as electroflotation another main mechanism in ec unfortunately however during the treatment process the evolved gases accumulate at the electrode surface increasing the electrical resistance between the electrodes thereby achieving less than optimum ionic transfer also the uneven generation of gas bubbles on the electrode could lead to the concentration of gas bubbles in the specific zone of floatation therefore to overcome this high electrolytic flow is required in batch electrocoagulation to minimise the accumulation and detach bubbles from the electrode surface the electrolytic flow in batch electrocoagulation is normally achieved by applying an agitation mechanism such as a magnetic stirrer bar as such a high electrolytic flow can be obtained by increasing the agitation speed of the stirrer bar near to the electrode surface as reported in a few studies the agitation speed however requires an optimum speed for the pollutant removal efficiency to achieve its maximum value 7 9 setting below the optimum speed will cause low ion mobility and produce small flocs which may be difficult to remove while beyond the optimum speed will result in floc degradation due to high collisions 8 10 most of the intensification methods in wastewater treatment as shown in fig 1 commonly utilize addition of coagulants flocculants additive or other surface active materials the exposure to chemicals are quite common in electrocoagulation studies as revealed in several literatures 11 15 in our previous review of electrocoagulation we highlighted the latest physical intensification approaches which focused on the mechanical modifications of the reactor and electrodes to enhance the agitation mass transport and efficiency of pollutant removal in the electrocoagulation cell the modifications include utilising a filter press reactor an oscillating anode periodic electrode reversal and a rotating anode 15 it has also been reported that the enhancement made on the electrocoagulation reactor and electrode improved the removal percentage by more than 90 another physical method of intensification which is through vibrations and acoustical techniques can be classified as the exposure to ultrasound vibration and sound 16 the combination of ultrasound with electrocoagulation commonly known as sono electrocoagulation has been applied in improving the kinetics and effectiveness of the electrode process especially to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants and the coagulation of the flocs 17 18 the exposure to ultrasound through sono electrocoagulation however is dependent on the external source which is the external probe or water bath for generating bubbles aside from that this combination is highly dependent on high power densities and power consumption which can invariably lead to high operating costs on the other hand there are several industrial applications concerning vibrations such as electropolishing 17 18 mineral processing 19 20 and flotation for wastewater treatment 16 in the intensification of wastewater flotation treatment by exposure to vibration the study utilized a flotation column an aerator to supply air through an air pump and a shaker to generate vibration at certain amplitude and frequency used to intensify different stages of flotation 16 it has been reported from this study that exposure to vibration resulted in the decrease of air bubble size increase of air flow through the aerator more even dispersion of air bubbles in water which directly improving the treatment efficiency significantly 16 more importantly vibration stimulates the stirring of bubbles and contaminants in water which may increase the collisions probability between contaminants and bubbles leading to a better aggregate formation 16 this study was reported for the flotation treatment alone in treating wastewater nevertheless to date studies concerning on exposure of vibration in electrocoagulation has not been investigated and reported anywhere in the literature since electrocoagulation includes electroflotation in its parallel treatment which is also the key parameters of the process so there is an interest to determine the effects of vibration exposure on intensifying the flotation process in ec thus the present study was conducted to investigate the performance of vibration induced electrode plates in removing colour and cod in landfill leachate the study focused on the variables such as the effect of vibration intensity of the electrode plates applied current operating time and initial ph on the removal efficiency of the contaminants as well as its complete mixing and flotation capability during the ec treatment 2 materials and method 2 1 sampling of leachate the main raw material used in this research was stabilised landfill leachate collected at a detention pond in pulau burung sanitary landfill pbsl located in the northern region of penang malaysia geographic coordinates of 5 12 n latitude 100 25 e longitude surrounded by a natural habitat of several varieties of bird species and mangrove trees pbsl has been operating since 1991 during the initial phase of operations a semi aerobic system was introduced which established a controlled tipping technique complying with level ii of the sanitary landfill standards 21 in 2001 the landfill was upgraded to level iii employing controlled tipping with leachate recirculation 22 as these landfill phases are now full the state is presently in the process of moving to phase 3 which will establish a level iv standard a highest standard for landfill by incorporating a modern material recovery facility mrf the samples examined in this research were collected within a six month period between january and june 2019 for full monitoring of its physico chemical characteristics a 20 l ptfe container was completely filled with the leachate in order to prevent any space for aeration the sample was collected via grab sampling from the detention pond and analysed within 24 h from the time of sampling the collection and preservation of the sample were performed in accordance with the standard method for the examination of water and wastewater 23 the leachate physicochemical parameters analysed included temperature ph colour cod biological oxygen demand bod5 suspended solids ammonia nitrogen nh3 n turbidity conductivity and dissolved oxygen the results of these physicochemical parameters are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedures the electrocoagulation treatment was performed using a fabricated plexiglass batch reactor 210 mm l 156 mm width and 148 mm height in size as illustrated in fig 2 the batch reactor has a volume of 4 85 l the working volume of 2 l for each sample was made constant for all runs the electrodes were made of 5052 aluminium alloy with compositions containing silicon 0 25 iron 0 40 copper 0 1 manganese 0 1 magnesium 2 2 2 8 chromium 0 15 0 35 zinc 0 1 others 0 15 and the remainder comprising of aluminium a pair of vertical aluminium electrodes with a dimension of 200 mm l 50 mm w and 1 mm thickness was arranged in a parallel configuration the electrodes were then immersed into the leachate sample at a depth of 60 mm with an effective surface area of 30 cm2 one face and a total surface area of 120 cm2 for both plates the gap between the electrodes of 2 cm was maintained for all runs 24 28 both electrodes were connected with a digital dc power supply qje ps3010 which supplied between 0 10 a and 0 30 v of power for the vibration induced treatment a dc motor vibrator of size 25 mm diameter and 13 mm height was attached to one side of each electrode plate each of the dc motors was connected to the multiple input power supply as illustrated in fig 2 the vibration motor was able to function at a voltage ranging between 0 6 v since our research was concerned about the performance of the novel vibration induced electrocoagulation the treatment was also undertaken using stationary electrode plates for comparison for this treatment no dc motor was attached to the electrode plates and the electrocoagulation was performed without any flow no agitation mechanism inside the reactor the performance of batch electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates was investigated based on the effect of parameters i e vibration intensity varied from 1 8 v to 3 8 v of the motor vibrator ph of 5 10 operating time between 10 and 60 min and current density between 0 5 and 4 5 a on the removal percentage of colour and cod in studying the effect of ph 1 m of sodium hydroxide and 1 m of hydrochloric acid were used to adjust the leachate to basic and acidic ph respectively for the non vibration induced electrocoagulation treatment i e stationary electrode plates similar parameters were used and examined except for vibration intensity at the end of each run samples of the treated leachate were collected at a depth of 5 cm from the surface of the wastewater using a pipette the electrodes were washed with water to remove any residuals of solid particles and dried the removal percentage of pollutant p was calculated by applying the following equation 1 p c i c o c o x 100 where ci and co signify the initial and final concentration of raw and treated leachate respectively 2 3 analysis of raw leachate and samples of treated leachate table 1 lists the leachate parameters that were characterised using the standard analytical method the measurements of the samples were conducted in triplicates according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 23 the ph of the samples was determined using a ph meter hach model sens ion 1 usa temperature and conductivity were determined using a conductivity meter hach model sens ion 5 usa and a dissolved oxygen meter ysi 5000 usa was used to determine the dissolved oxygen values 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical properties of pbsl leachate table 2 shows the physicochemical properties of the pbsl leachate the properties were compared with the range of values obtained from the literature for old leachate 22 the biodegradation ration of bod5 to cod of 0 1 indicates that pbsl is considered in the methanogenic phase mature stabilised leachate 35 36 at this final stage of landfill stabilisation the nutrients and substrate in leachate have a limiting amount and the biological activity is shifted to relative dormancy thus from the data shown in table 2 it can be seen that the leachate parameters are at a much lower concentration 37 comparing the values with the standard discharge limit of leachate as to that established by the department of environment malaysia it can be seen that among the critical values include colour and cod 3 2 effect of vibration intensity of electrode plates on the electrocoagulation treatment to maximise the efficiency of electrocoagulation the following need to be minimised 1 internal resistance between the two electrodes 2 the accumulation of oxygen and hydrogen gas bubbles nucleates at the electrode surface and 3 the impairment to mass transfer through the spaces between the electrode 38 39 here the oxygen and hydrogen gas which nucleate gather on the electrode surface which might create impermeable layers which prevent effective ions transport between the two electrodes hence raising internal resistance the resistance r is correlated with the voltage v and the applied current i following ohm s law 2 v i r since the voltage is directly dependent on r thus without any form of flow stationary electrode at an constant applied current the release of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles that attach on the surface of the electrode plate may result in an increase in electrical resistance minimise the ionic transfer between the electrode plates and consequently reduce the removal of pollutant fig 3 illustrates that even at a constant electrode distance the change in the applied voltage for the stationary electrode plates is greater compared to the vibration induced plate accordingly this may suggest that high resistance has occurred on the stationary electrode plates especially at a current between 1 5 a and 3 5 a according to mollah et al 38 a high electrolyte flow surrounding the electrode may be useful to mitigate the accumulation of bubbles thus eliminating the bubbles from the electrode surface hence the use of vibration induced electrode plates in the electrocoagulation treatment may provide benefit based on this reason during the electrocoagulation treatment the motor vibrator attached to the electrode plates will vibrate on the plate tested at an intensity range between 1 8 and 3 8 v to observe the effect of plate vibration on the generation and dispersion of bubbles an experiment was conducted to observe the treatment using clear water with modified electrical conductivity comparable to the wastewater and applying an electrical current fixed at 2 5 a fig 4 illustrates the generation and dispersion of bubbles in the solution when the intensity of the vibration was varied between 1 8 3 8 v from observing the treatment it was noticed that when the electrical current was applied to the electrode bubbles formed on the surface of the electrode next applying a lower vibration intensity of 1 8 v to the electrode it was observed that the bubbles tended to attach themselves on the surface of the electrode with no dispersion of bubbles occurring into the solution then increasing the vibration intensity to 2 3 v this resulted in fewer bubbles detaching themselves and dispersing into the solution further increase on the intensity of the vibration up to 3 8 v showed that the bubbles fully detached themselves from the surface of the electrode dispersing into the solution the vibration induced electrode plates affect the removal percentage during the treatment as shown from the plot in fig 5 the effect was examined at a constant ph of 8 with an operating time of 35 min and voltage of 2 5 a the removal of colour in the leachate increased to more than 50 by increasing the vibration intensity from 1 8 to 2 8 v but remained unchanged at a higher intensity with the removal percentage achieved more than 70 the removal percentage of cod achieved the highest removal at the vibration intensity of 2 8 v therefore the results indicate that batch electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates showed good performance in colour removal this may be due to the role of the vibration induced electrode plates where oscillation may induce a certain frequency creating a stirring effect surrounding the electrode plate surface which in turn detaches the bubbles from the electrode surface enhancing the flocculation and floatation process the performance however is limited to a certain range of intensity where in this case at the vibration intensity of more than 2 8 v the removal percentage of cod reduced or remained unchanged for colour removal to observe the synergistic performance of the vibration induced electrode plates in electrocoagulation the effect of the initial ph operating time and current intensity were investigated on colour and cod removal the results were also compared with electrocoagulation using stationary electrode plates 3 3 effect of initial ph on colour and cod removal between vibration induced and stationary electrode plates the initial ph at the beginning of the electrocoagulation treatment had a substantial influence since it had a different effect on the dissolution of aluminium electrodes and its speciation of hydroxides to determine the relative effect of the initial ph on the vibration induced electrocoagulation the initial ph was adjusted to 5 6 8 9 and 10 with a constant vibration intensity of 2 8 v at both the constant operating time of 35 min and the current intensity of 2 5a similar parameters for the operating time and current intensity were also investigated for the stationary electrode plates as a comparison the removal percentage of colour cod and its final ph are presented in fig 6 a c in the removal of colour and cod it can be seen from the plot that the removal percentage reduced with increasing ph the highest percentage of 90 for colour and 35 for cod was achieved at ph 5 consistently for both vibration induced and stationary electrode plates generally the high colour concentration in old leachate is due to the presence of saturated organic matter such as humic and fulvic substances with some insoluble forms which tend to exhibit the high turbidity and suspended solids value 40 the removal of these substances is strongly dependent on the ph in which according to gregory et al 41 for the solution with a ph of 5 6 a strong adsorption and charge neutralisation occurs between the negatively charged humic substances and the positively charged al and the aluminium hydroxide precipitate has higher solubility at this region at a ph between 6 and 10 the colour and cod removal decreases dramatically this is because the concentration of aluminium hydroxides precipitates decreased due to an increase in aluminium hydroxyl anions a l o h 4 which is predominant in alkaline condition hence re stabilises the colloidal suspension which then hinders flocculation on the other hand between the ph of 6 and 10 there is a significant difference in the removal efficiency of both colour and cod between the vibration induced and stationary electrode plates this is because aside from the formation of hydroxyl ions at the electrodes the electrodes also produce gas bubbles mainly hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode over time during the treatment these gas bubbles accumulate at the stationary electrode resulting in less ionic transfer and prolong the coagulation process when applying vibration onto the electrode plates this enables the gas bubbles to continuously detach themselves from the electrode plate hence promoting the destabilisation of particles to occur and flocculate to the top surface in electrocoagulation the ph also influences the size of the gas bubbles where the smallest hydrogen bubbles are produced at a neutral or acidic ph 42 hence this reason further supports the highest removal of colour and cod at lower ph the final ph plot as illustrated in fig 6 c shows that there is an increase of ph for the treated leachate at the end of the electrolysis for all the tested ph this may indicate the increase of hydrogenation at the cathode plate and the liberation of hydroxide ions from aluminium hydroxides that increase ph throughout the ec process 43 3 4 effect of operating time on colour and cod removal between vibration induced and stationary electrode plates the effect of operating time was next investigated between 10 and 60 min at a constant ph of 8 and a current density of 2 5 a for the vibration induced electrode plates the vibration intensity was fixed at 2 8 v as shown in fig 7 a an increase in the time from 10 to 60 min led to an increase in the removal of colour which achieved the highest percentage with the vibration induced electrode plates of more than 80 likewise for the stationary electrode plates the removal of colour shows a slight percentage below the vibration induced electrode plates at ph 8 the hydrolysis of the al3 cations may not predominate since the reaction is not in favour at this ph given the concentration of al oh 3 s is low 41 however prolonging the electrolysis time allows the rate of bubble generation to increase hence the removal of pollutants in the leachate during the treatment was improved by the action of the bubbles the vibration induced electrode plates further enhanced the soft mixing produced during electrocoagulation with the stationary plates by producing a vast number of bubbles in the solution hence improving the rate transfer of ions to attract the pollutants furthermore the vibration intensity induced during electrocoagulation could raise the mixing efficiency thus promoting collisions to occur between the coagulant and the pollutant particles therefore by using electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates the pollutant removal efficiency was enhanced between 6 and 45 efficiency in the 60 min treatment for the cod removal it was anticipated from the previous result that the removal percentage would be lower at ph 8 compared to colour removal fortunately prolonging the electrolysis time to 60 min helped to increase the removal up to 16 for the vibration induced electrode plates and 60 even higher for the stationary plates as shown in fig 7 b the electrochemical process that occurred at the anode resulted in the dissolution of aluminium to compete with the evolution of oxygen hence oxygen evolution may help with the oxygen demand 25 44 it is expected that prolonging the time of more than 60 minutes may also increase the removal efficiency of cod even higher however this may not be true for the vibration induced electrode plates as can be seen from the plot the removal efficiency was increasing within the 35 minutes of treatment time within this time frame the vibration induced treatment may allow greater dissociation of hydrogen gas produced at the electrode plates thus increasing the cod removal efficiency the removal efficiency however remains unchanged at 48 minutes and unable to surpass the removal efficiency obtained by the stationary plates at 60 minutes of treatment time this might be because at prolonged operating time for the ec with vibration induced electrode plates resulted in saturated gas bubbles produced in the solution thus reduce the ions concentration and viscosity of the solution when the ion concentration reduced the adsorption of pollutants decrease and remain unchanged this phenomena can also be correlated with the electrical conductivity of the solution as a function of time as described in the following paragraph fig 7 c illustrates the changes in electrical conductivity over operating time the electrical conductivity measurement reflects the solution conductivity which helps the flow of the electric current through it 42 addition of anions in the form of salts may increase the electrical conductivity of the solution hence increase the current densitiy and removal efficiency of the treatment 45 in this study however there were no addition of salts made during the treatment and the electrical conductivity obviously represents the actual value of the leachate wastewater addition of acids and alkalis as to adjust the initial ph only reduced the electrical conductivity of the solution very slightly even though without the addition of salts within 60 minutes of time the treatment still could achieve increasing removal of colour and cod as can be observed in the results increasing in electrocoagulation time and increased in the removal percentage of colour and cod the electrical conductivity decreased for both the vibration induced and stationary plates similar results were also reported in some study 46 the vibration induced electrode plates showed even lower electrical conductivity as compared to stationary plates is due to a significant amount of bubbles produced in the solution when the electrode plates were induced with vibration the gas bubbles detached from the electrode plates producing increasing amount of bubbles in the solution hence decreased in concentration of leachate and electrical conductivity in turn 46 3 5 effect of current density on colour and cod removal between vibration induced and stationary electrode plates fig 8 a and b illustrates the removal percentage of colour and cod when the current intensity is varied at 0 5 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 a at a constant time of 35 min and ph 8 and a vibration intensity of 2 8 v for vibration induced electrocoagulation a significant difference can be observed for the colour removal between the results obtained from the vibration induced treatment and the stationary electrode plates here the treatment favours the combination of the electrocoagulation with the vibration induced electrode plates as compared to the stationary plates when increasing the current using an electrochemical reactor with the aluminium electrode plates the production of coagulants ions from the electrode plate will increase consequently more flocs are formed to capture the colloidal particles and to improve pollutant removal efficiency with increasing current density the rate of bubble generation will also increase while the bubble size will decrease resulting in faster removal of pollutants by hydrogen floatation 47 apparently when the electrocoagulation is coupled with vibration induced electrode plates the gas bubbles will be massively formed by oxidation and the reduction of water even though it s at a lower current intensity the gas bubbles help to promote flocculation through improved mixing leading to enhanced pollutant removal by floatation the stationary plate on the other hand has lower removal percentage at lower current intensity due to it only being capable of providing soft mixing for the flocculation process despite the low removal percentage for cod attained during the treatment the results however show that electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates improved the pollutant removal with an increment between 1 and 7 between the current intensity of 0 5 4 5 a fig 8 c displays final temperature obtained at the conclusion of each treatment the starting temperature at the beginning of each treatment was made consistent with the room temperature between 26 and 27 c as seen from the plot for both the vibration induced and stationary plates the temperature increases when the applied current increases during the treatment in which the most substantial removal percentage for colour was around 80 achieved with the applied current at 4 5 a final temperature of around 43 c and operating time of 35 min accordingly this indicates that even without varying the temperature during the treatment the temperature will be elevated during the process given the thermal energy that is provided by the electrical current to the electrode plates increasing temperature during the treatment also allows the solubility of aluminium to enhance thus increasing the pollutant removal efficiency 10 in the case of the vibration induced electrode plates the higher temperature will favour the removal of pollutant since it is attributed by the larger amount hydrogen gas bubbles formed on the vibration induced cathode which in turn enhances the floatation speed of the coagulant with the adsorbed pollutants 10 3 6 sludge separation after electrocoagulation a physical observation was made on the sludge separation following the electrocoagulation treatment with the vibration induced plates and stationary electrode plates figs 9 and 10 show the snapshot image of the sludge separated following electrocoagulation with the vibration induced plates and stationary electrode plates respectively both have similar working parameters i e ph 6 operating time of 48 min current intensity of 3 5 a and 2 3 v of vibration intensity of the electrode plates for the vibration induced treatment the electrocoagulation with the vibration induced electrode plates benefits from the treatment in a way that generalises the floatation process through the generation and dispersion of the enhanced bubbles as low density particulates of fine particles can separate from the wastewater by the bubbles produced from the treatment this can be seen in fig 9 where it displays a better sludge separation by forming two uniform layers of sludge on the top surface of the wastewater this layer may contain residuals of amorphous aluminium hydroxide and or aluminium oxyhydroxide represented by the white layers and the dark layer represents the removed pollutant on the other hand sludge separated from the stationary electrode plates shows that non uniform layers have been formed with larger particles are shown floating and dispersing everywhere in the solution the conclusion being that even at high current intensity the bubbles produced at the stationary electrode plates could not enhance the floatation process as compared to the performance by the vibration induced electrode plates 3 7 electrical energy consumption one of the most important economical parameters in electrocoagulation is energy consumption fig 11 shows the correlation between current densities and the average voltage obtained from the electrocoagulation treatment fig 12 shows the energy consumptions required for the treatment of the landfill leachate as a function of operating time at different current densities the current densites was calculated using eq 3 while the electrical energy consumpetion e was calculated in terms of kwh m3 of treated effluent using eq 4 3 c d i a 4 e u i t v where c d is the current density ma cm2 i is the applied current a a is the total effective submerged area of the electrode cm2 e is the electrical energy consumption kwh m3 u is the average cell voltage v t is the operating time of electrocoagulation treatment h and v is the volume of treated effluent l the average voltages obtained from vibration induced and stationary electrode plates are similar since both have similar current densities applied during the electrocoagulation treatment with similar set ups in term of the volume of wastewater and effective submerged area of electrode plates it can be seen from fig 11 that the average voltage increases proportionally with the current densities this is true since voltage v is dependent on the applied current i as shown in eq 2 the results on the electrical energy consumption shows that the values increased with the current density the highest value for energy consumption were 39 15 kw h m3 at applied current of 2 5 a cd 20 8 ma cm2 the highest colour removal effiencies of more than 90 was obtained at operating time of 35 minutes and more than 40 of cod removal effiency was obtained after 60 min of operating time as a result the maximum values for energy consumption at cd of 20 8 ma cm2 were 8 58 kw h m3 and 14 71 kw h m3 for colour and cod removal respectively these values are within the range of values as reported in the literature of range between 0 002 and 58 kw h m3 for energy consumption with the electrocoagulation process 48 4 conclusions after more than 20 years since its operation pulau burung sanitary landfill has achieved a mature stabilised phase based on the current value of physicochemical characteristics nevertheless there are several parameters that do not comply with the discharge standard as established under the regulations issued by the malaysian department of environment hence the treatment of leachate is required to reduce the harmful pollutants which are contaminating the surrounding environment electrocoagulation is useful for treating mature leachate as the one in pbsl the efficiency of this method however is reduced when there is resistance between the electrode plates such as the accumulation of generated gas bubbles on the electrode surface a novel approach to improve the mixing and ions transfer is by applying electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates as demonstrated in the present study and the results show good performance in removing colour and cod in leachate compared to stationary electrode plates indeed the performance is maximised when the vibration intensity of the electrode plates is at 2 8 v with the treatment operating at acidic ph and current intensity ranged between 2 5 a and 4 5 a however the vibration induced electrode plates was not feasible to further removed cod at longer operating time due saturation of gas bubbles the vibration induced electrode plates were also found to reduce the accumulation of bubbles surrounding the electrode plates improve the homogeneity of the solution and provide better sludge separation at the conclusion of the treatment the calculated electrical energy requirement revealed that the value of energy consumption for the highest removal of colour and cod is 8 58 kw h m3 and 14 71 kw h m3 respectively to further gain a better understanding on the present study fundamentally the following work is proposed 1 since gas bubbles may be the key point in the success of electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates determination of the bubbles size and its distribution bubbles rise velocity mixing and dispersion characteristics at different vibration intensity during treatment could be further investigated this may further lead to better understanding of flow behaviour in electrocoagulation with vibration induced electrode plates 2 the study on the fundamentals of vibration relating to its frequency velocity mode shape and boundary layer on the electrode plates may reflect the mechanism of fluid motion laminar transitional turbulence flow and its flow pattern in presence of strong vortex generated by the vibrating plates in the electrocoagulation is a further area for investigation 3 the stability of particles can also be investigated through the electrokinetic effects to determine the electrophoresis movement of the charged particles relative to the liquid suspended under the influence of an electric field and vibration induced plates 4 the mechanism of the electrocoagulation process when induced with vibration such as physio adsorption or chemo adsorption could be further explored 5 the evaluation of the mass transfer during vibration induced treatment through cfd simulation is a further area worth looking into 6 the flocculation index could be determined to observe the uniformity of the floc and its particle size during vibration induced

13952,aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been limited by its long startup time in sequencing batch reactors sbrs the objective of this work is to determine if a new amendment of the ags process improves sludge granulation rate and pollutants removal efficiency this amendment consisted in an external conditioning step during which the effluent sludge was dried supplemented with 0 1 g cacl2 g 1 dried sludge ds and then gradually reintroduced into the sbr results have shown that this technique can reduce the granulation time by 17 days while ensuring the stability of ags stable aerobic granules were obtained on day 20 i e a few days after reintroducing 1 75 g l 1 ca2 conditioned sludge to the sbr for 5 consecutive days mixed liquor suspended solids mlss sludge volume index ratio at 30 min and 5 min svi30 svi5 and average granule size in the ags reactor were maintained at 5 7 g l 1 1 0 and 3 5 mm respectively the external conditioning led to an increase in extracellular polymers eps production a decrease in moisture content specific oxygen uptake rate sour and iron precipitation altogether these impacts led to a faster aggregation of the effluent sludge compared to a control sbr furthermore microbial community analyses have shown that the external conditioning process enriched specific betaproteobacteria e g thauera genus in aggregates and ags such outcomes could be linked to the faster granulation rate and more efficient pollutants degradation keywords effluent sludge external conditioning cacl2 addition betaproteobacteria thauera 1 introduction in the last few decades aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been extensively studied in sequencing batch reactors sbr 1 4 due to its superior settleability denser structure and higher biomass retention compared to conventional activated sludge as technologies 5 6 the efficiency of aerobic granulation is affected by a wide variety of factors including substrate composition settling time hydrodynamic shear stress and the production of extracellular polymers eps 7 11 earlier work has shown that aerobic granules are typically grown in sbr within 100 400 days using municipal wastewater 1 2 12 14 the granulation process when sbrs are fed with an activated sludge as inoculant is much shorter when treating synthetic wastewater indeed aerobic granules can be obtained in 2 4 weeks in lab scale sbrs such sbrs are usually fed with synthetic wastewater consisting primarily of acetate or glucose as a carbon source in such conditions a steady state is reached after an additional one to two months on top of the aforementioned factors wastewater characteristics and random aggregation disintegration mechanisms also play key roles in sludge granulation especially during the start up phase 15 17 several improvements to the rapid granulation process in synthetic wastewater have been proposed including fine tuning the optimal selective pressure settling time organic loading rate orl starvation period and shear force 8 aerobic granules are formed within 7 to 24 hours when a high selective pressure is applied to the sbr 18 the downside is that it produces fragile granules that break apart within a few days to maintain the long term stability of ags in sbr the selective pressure must be reduced to a suitable level after the steady state has been reached 19 several studies have improved the aerobic granulation process by seeding the sbr with anaerobic granules 20 crushed granular sludge 21 or aerobic granules maintained in long term storage 22 various supplements were also added to the synthetic wastewater to improve ags efficiency such as specific microbial strains as pure cultures 23 24 granular activated carbon gac 25 and dry sludge micro powder 26 27 increasing the temperature of upstream wastewater was also attempted 28 however this amendment is unsuitable for municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps which lab scale sbr aim to mimic finally another category of supplements includes adding nuclei or carriers to the sbr adding nuclei or carriers to the sbr such as ca2 can shorten the initial aggregation time by providing a surface to which microbes can attach themselves despite this promising concept directly supplementing the synthetic wastewater with ca2 decreases the granulation time 29 31 however the ca2 ions bond with eps neutralize the negative charges on the surface of bacterial cells and precipitate ions the latter can then served as nuclei and accelerate microbial aggregation 2 32 the addition of ca2 also improves the structure and density of ags yet its excessive addition results in high concentrations of inorganic precipitates along with an ash content of up to 50 84 34 both inorganic precipitates and ash decrease the bioactivity of ags 33 35 although decreasing the addition of ca2 down to 25 40 mg l reduces inorganic precipitates and ash content sludge granulation time drastically increases in such conditions 36 37 in brief the addition of ca2 has both positive and negative effects on the formation of aerobic granules other metal ions like mg2 fe2 fe3 mn2 and al3 can improve sludge granulation by increasing the size and stability of granules and altering microbial community structure 38 41 whereas all these methods can speed up the sludge granulation process their complexity and associated costs are prohibitive in practice these strategies solely focused on internal bioreactor conditioning earlier studies have reported that external conditioning such as drying the sludge outside the sbr and then reintroducing it into the sbr afterwards could reduce both the sludge granulation time and effluent sludge waste products during the initial wastewater treatment stage 42 in this regard effluent sludge waste products could be greatly reduced in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtp as result of the optimization of the ags formation process in wwtp several chemical and physical conditioners such as ca2 al3 fe3 are added to the waste activated sludge was in the pretreatment and wastewater treatment steps 43 44 ca2 is a more affordable and easier to obtain alternative to al3 and fe3 chemical flocculants 45 46 and its addition plays a positive role in eps production and aggregates strength 47 48 microbes known for their eps production and capacity to breakdown organic compounds including proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes proved to abundant in floccular sludge 35 eps act as binding agents that accelerate the formation of microbial aggregates by binding cells together which then promotes aerobic sludge granulation 11 sludge aggregates formed after a 72 h natural drying period reintroduced into the sbr as external conditioning were thinner and more fragile when compared to aggregates derived from undried sludge many factors related to these observations which could be the causes of their shortcomings have yet to be elucidated for instance microbial community dynamics were not investigated in effluent sludge during a natural drying process nor during sludge granulation 42 considering the different ags formation methods tested in the literature we developed an external conditioning method consisting mainly of an addition of ca2 to effluent sludge taken from the sbr and then the gradual reintroduction of this treated sludge into the sbr in this regard the main objective of this work is to assess the impact of this new external conditioning strategy on ags formation sludge physical properties eps production microbial community structure as well as pollution removal efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor conditions and operation two identical sbrs made of acrylic plastic were set up for the cultivation of aerobic granules height diameter and working volume of each reactor were 100 cm 9 cm and 4 l respectively one of the sbr r1 served as control and was used to cultivate aerobic granules with a gradually shortened settling time while the second one r2 was used for the cultivation of granules using the ca2 external conditioning method mentioned previously reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater mainly composed of acetate nh4 n and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively aeration was at an airflow rate of 0 1 m3 h 1 sgv 0 44 cm s 1 offered by an air pump pl60 resun china and a 50 volumetric exchange ratio was applied each cycle of the sbr consisted of 160 min with a feeding time of 5 min and aeration time of 120 min a settling of 2 15 min a discharge time of 5 min and an idle time of 15 28 min details on the operating scheme for each cycle are given in table 1 pumps bt100 02 china and valves were controlled by programmable logic controllers plc in both sbrs the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 20 5 c using industrial grade air conditioning for indoor use gree group china wastewater ph was maintained at 7 0 7 5 by adjusting it with 10 hcl every 24 h both sbrs were inoculated with 0 5 l seeding sludge from a municipal sewage treatment plant qige wwtp hangzhou china influent chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were set at 500 600 mg l 1 and 25 32 mg l 1 respectively trace element solutions were also added as described in 42 the composition of the synthetic wastewater medium meets the nutritional requirements of microbes typically found in wastewater treatment systems 42 the micro scale cacl2 size 20 200 μm was manually prepared using solid cacl2 was stored sealed for effluent sludge external conditioning in r1 settling time was gradually reduced and effluent sludge was washed out into the sewer system in r2 rapid granulation strategy consisted of effluent sludge external conditioning with adding ca2 and then feeding back for ags fast formation settling time stayed the same throughout the granulation process and biomass grew quickly after inoculation i e during the initial stage in the first 9 days coarse sludge was washed out from r2 following a 2 min settling time then was collected and filtered through three gauze sieves 0 1 mm mesh size every 24 h starting from day 10 starting from day 11 this coarse sludge was supplemented with 0 1 g cacl2 g 1 dry solids ds and manually mixed for 5 min to create a homogeneous mixture on gauze sieves this external conditioning aims to speed up the subsequent granulation process the ca2 concentration used was selected according to 47 48 as it was reported to increase sludge aggregation the treated sludge was soaked for 30 min in a 2 l beaker of fresh water afterwards the resulting sludge was manually crushed and separated on gauze mesh size 4 mm to decrease the size but increase the amount of aggregates finally sludge aggregates 1 75 0 05 g l 1 smaller than 4 mm were reintroduced into r2 every day for 5 days 2 2 eps content eps were extracted from the collected sludge by using the formaldehyde naoh method liu and fang 2002 because proteins pn and polysaccharides ps account for ca 80 of total eps total eps will be approximated as the sum of pn and ps the pn concentration was determined using the coomassie brilliant blue dye method using bovine serum albumin bsa as standard 50 the ps concentration was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as standard 51 2 3 bacterial community structure analysis

3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of adding micro cacl2 on effluent sludge fig 1 shows effluent sludge morphology in r2 before and after external conditioning with ca2 after inoculation and stable operation loose floccular sludge was washed out in the first 2 min on day 10 fig 1 a mean effluent sludge was maintained at 0 610 0 005 g l 1 and collected with a gauze sieve 0 1 mm mesh size every 24 h starting from day 10 after the collected effluent sludge was supplemented with 0 1 g ca2 g 1 ds the floccular sludge began aggregating quickly compact aggregates with a uniform size were manually crushed to increase the amount of aggregates fig 1 b eps sour and moisture content of effluent sludge had significant variations during the external conditioning process fig 2 eps gradually increased from 109 4 mg g 1 to 180 3 mg g 1 vss ps content obviously increased higher than pn whereas pn content barely increased throughout the external conditioning this was well agreed with the earlier work 48 sour and moisture content decreased from 15 7 to 0 55 mg o2 g 1 vss h within 24 h these results contrast with those reported following an external conditioning consisting of drying the effluent sludge for 72 h before reintroducing it to the sbr 42 indeed the addition of ca2 in the effluent sludge can neutralize negative charges on eps or at the surface of bacterial cell walls consequently ca2 can interconnect these compounds and generate cross linkages 29 33 furthermore the addition of ca2 can alter the sludge s structure thus increasing its dewaterability 45 48 as a result the moisture content of effluent sludge quickly decreased during the external conditioning process sludge also quickly attached to ca2 nuclei which sharply decreased the sour the now hypotonic environment stimulated the microbial production of eps as a mean of protection against osmotic stress 11 48 which consequently improved the rapid aggregation process and created a positive feedback loop overall this external conditioning method led to a quicker aggregation process than one consisting of sludge drying alone 42 3 2 effect of hydraulic pressure on sludge aggregate additionally a third sbr r3 was set up to investigate the role of hydraulic shear force on sludge aggregates the ca2 external conditioning was also applied to r3 aggregates with a mlss over 2 68 g l 1 fig 1 b were used as inoculants whereas fresh water was used as influent sgv was maintained at 0 44 cm s 1 other operation conditions are described when referring to r2 from day 10 to 57 in table 1 compact aggregates fig 3 a already encompass a dense structure on day 1 the average aggregate size decreased from 3 6 mm to 0 4 mm via the shear force applied throughout the experiment this is namely due to the breakdown of larger aggregates into floccular sludge and small aggregates consequently larger aggregates were washed out with the effluent sludge under a 2 min settling time regime while smaller aggregates and floccular sludge remained in r3 after 3 days fig 3 b it also translates to a decrease of mlss from 2 68 g l 1 to 1 10 g l 1 along with a decrease in retaining efficiency from 1 0 to 0 43 fig 3 c these results show that adding ca2 as an external conditioning step led to a higher efficiency than the external conditioning alone i e via natural drying 42 likely by having a positive impact on eps production and sludge aggregate density with relatively higher ps 47 48 furthermore aggregates formed following the addition of ca2 resisted to low hydraulic pressure in the sbr 3 3 impact of the addition of cacl2 within an external conditioning process on rapid granulation 3 3 1 morphological variations of ags in sbrs changes in ags morphology throughout the wastewater treatment are shown in fig 4 during the first week of treatment fig 4 a and b sludge aggregates had a loose irregular shape that was undistinguishable from floccular sludge in r1 after 12 days a few aggregates made of flocs and zoogloea spp were observed due to the decreasing settling time from 15 to 5 min fig 4 c after 19 days the proportion of such aggregates slightly increased fig 4 e as the settling time further decreased to 2 min denser sludge remained in the sbr and the increased olr which contributed to sludge granulation in r1 reducing the settling time to 2 min further increased the amount of granules on day 23 fig 4 g after 57 days of development aerobic granules were increasingly abundant and their average size went over 1 0 mm fig 4 i overall the strategy to decrease settling time leading to a higher orl was a favorable method to quicken ags cultivation in r1 8 19 contrasting trends were observed in r2 while settling time was drastically reduced on day 10 flocs were still dominant after 12 days of cultivation even though olr increased substantially and a few granules began to form fig 4 d on day 13 aggregates were conditioned externally with ca2 and fed back into r2 which led to the formation of denser and more clearly defined granules in the following week fig 4 f sludge granulation sharply increased in subsequent days fig 4 h increasing the number and size of granules as well as showing a more defined rounder shape simultaneously bigger aggregates broke down and gave rise to numerous smaller aggregates which accelerated sludge granulation and led to an overall quicker and more intense granulation than r1 even at the end of process after 57 days the average size of aerobic granule increased to 3 5 mm in r2 fig 4 j in sum the external conditioning and addition of ca2 to effluent sludge followed by reintroducing into the sbr contributed to the sludge rapid granulation and its greater efficiency compared to gradually increasing selection pressure i e for r1 moreover granulation rate was also faster when adding ca2 during the external conditioning phase when compared to a previous study using natural drying as external conditioning 42 or internal conditioning with improving wastewater temperature 28 adding chemical coagulation and flocculation in practice 43 3 3 2 ags physical characteristics 1 mlss and mlvss mlss in both sbrs mlss and mlvss mlss increased from 3 75 to 5 89 g l 1 and from 0 5 to 0 82 during the first 10 days respectively fig 5 a as settling time decreased starting from the 10th day so did the mlss and mlvss decreased since numerous flocs were washed out of the sbrs the further decrease of settling time in r1 led to a slow increase in mlss and mlvss throughout the experiment up to a peak value of 3 99 g l 1 and 3 63 g l 1 on day 48 which slightly decreased afterwards with a final mlss mlvss ration of 0 9 fig 5 a similarly to r1 the mlss in r2 sharply decreased down to 1 12 g l 1 on day 12 after the settling time was reduced to 2 min from the 10th day fig 5 a each day the externally conditioned sludge aggregates 1 75 0 05 g l 1 were fed back into r2 from day 13 to 17 the addition of the conditioned sludge led to a quick increase in mlss and mvlss in r2 fig 5 a this increase in mlss and mlvss stabilized to 6 0 g l 1 and 5 7 g l 1 fig 5 a respectively while mlvss mlss ratio in r2 slightly decreased to 0 81 on day 17 and increased to 0 9 on day 31 kept a steady development until day 57 fig 5 a this could be due to the rapid formation of sludge aggregates after the addition of cacl2 which in turn slightly increased the sludge ash content liu et al 2017 reported that the mlvss mlss ratio represents a rough estimate of ash content and sludge bioactivity 35 considering that both reactors maintained a mlvss mlss ratio of 0 9 fig 5 a this suggests that effluent sludge conditioning with the addition of 0 1 g ca2 ds followed by feeding back the treated sludge into the reactor accelerated the granulation process without significantly altering the ash content and the bioactivity of ags moreover this method as opposed to the earlier works 33 34 e g excess or continuous addition of ca2 prevents the precipitation of excess metal ions in ags and a reduction of the ash content of aerobic granules in startup stage 2 svi and svi30 svi5 svi is an important index that hints at the overall sedimentation of sludge in both reactors it reflects the sludge s structure thus its looseness and coagulation performance fig 5 b shows the fluctuations of svi in r1 and r2 throughout the whole operation the svi5 of the inoculant sludge increased in both sbr over the first 10 days from the initial 73 9 ml g 1 up to 159 7 ml g 1 respectively also the svi30 svi5 ratios decreased from 0 7 to 0 48 in the first 10 days fig 5 b these results indicate that the sludge s settleability decreased during that timeframe in r1 when the settling time was reduced from 15 min to 5 min both svi5 and svi30 decreased while the svi30 svi5 ratios increased on day 37 svi5 and svi30 stabilized at 51 6 ml g 1 and 46 4 ml g 1 respectively while the svi30 svi5 ratio increased over 0 9 fig 5 b in r2 similar trends were observed after 10 days svi5 and svi30 plummeted under 60 0 ml g 1 fig 5 b conditioned sludge was gradually reintroduced into r2 from day 13 to day 17 leading to a stabilization of both svi5 and svi30 at ca 45 1 ml g 1 on day 20 consequently the svi30 svi5 ratio reached 1 0 on day 20 fig 5 b studies have reported that a svi30 svi5 ratio 0 9 indicate a successful aerobic sludge granulation 53 54 our results thus show that in r2 successful granulation was achieved 17 days earlier than in r1 and therefore that the r2 operation was more efficient in that regard therefore these results indicated that the external conditioning of the effluent sludge by the addition of ca2 could reduce ags formation time during the startup phase 3 settling velocity size and sour fig 5 c shows the variations of settling velocity size and sour of aerobic granules in both sbr throughout the granulation process after inoculation sludge settling velocity decreased from 9 8 m h 1 to 7 3 m h 1 in both reactors while sludge mean size increased slowly due to the formation of the initial flocs in the first 10 days with decreasing settling time and gradual sludge granulation in r1 the settling velocity and mean size of sludge increased throughout the operation and plateaued on day 52 at 16 2 m h 1 and 1 1 mm respectively on the other hand sour increased for the whole duration of the operation and reached to 26 2 mg o2 g 1 vss h during the settling stage fig 5 c in r2 sludge settling velocity and mean size increased more rapidly than in r1 and reached 25 8 m h 1 and 2 8 mm on day 57 respectively however trends in sour were hectic in the first 23 days with a swift increase during the rest of the operation which led to final value close to r1 at 27 8 mg o2 g 1 vss h fig 5 c this could be explained by the compact structure and low sour of sludge aggregates fed back into r2 after external conditioning which turn out to increase settling velocity and mean size while slightly decreasing sour this is in agreement with previous work 42 these results suggest that the addition of ca2 during external conditioning not only quickens sludge aggregation but also has positive impacts on sludge settling velocity and mean size while its impact on sour at the end of operation is negligible 4 eps and pn ps eps production is at the core of ags formation as it is the leading cause of the preferential attachment of microbial cells into flocs eps is mainly composed of pn and ps which concentration is shown as a function of time in fig 8 eps concentration increased in both r1 and r2 until day 10 resulting from an increase in pn and a slight decrease in ps fig 5 d in r1 eps decreased between day 10 19 due to the reduction in settling time from 15 to 5 min when aerobic sludge granulation began around day 19 eps concentration gradually increased until it stabilized at 73 2 mg g 1 vss on day 37 when ags maturation plateaued pn and ps concentrations barely fluctuated after the onset of the granulation process fig 5 d in r2 starting from day 13 eps pn and ps concentrations rapidly increased to 86 2 mg g 1 vss 47 6 mg g 1 vss and 38 6 mg g 1 vss respectively fig 5 d these are due to the gradual reintroduction of conditioned sludge aggregates into sbr eps concentrations peaked after the last addition of conditioned aggregates on day 17 afterwards eps slightly decreased from day 24 onwards whereas eps pn and ps stabilized starting from day 30 at the end of operations on day 57 eps pn and ps concentrations were of 106 5 mg g 1 vss 52 8 mg g 1 vss and 53 7 mg g 1 vss fig 5 d respectively these values are higher in r2 than in r1 as expected from previous trends observed with higher mlss and mlvss in r2 fig 5 a these results indicate that external conditioning and gradual reinsertion of aggregated sludge into r2 increased eps production which in turn accelerated ags formation in the sbr as was observed in 42 3 4 cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies were also monitored in both sbrs throughout the operation as shown in fig 6 before day 10 i e shortening of settling time influent and effluent cod and nh4 n were similar in both sbrs in r1 the reduction in settling time decreased cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies from 91 3 to 83 9 and 87 4 76 7 respectively fig 6 a when sludge granulation successfully took off on day 19 the pollutants removal efficiencies recovered reaching 93 efficiency or more fig 6 a the drastic reduction in settling time in r2 led to low mlss before the reintroduction of conditioned aggregates which consequently led to sharply lower pollutants removal efficiencies compared to r1 between day 13 and 17 when conditioned aggregates were gradually fed back into r2 pollutants removal efficiency recovered quickly up to day 30 where it reached 100 efficiency while the pollutants removal efficiency was much lower in r2 than in r1 in the operation of day 12 20 aggregates with low sour fed back into r2 led to decrease ags sour the maturation of ags formation quickly increased sludge bioactivity which led to a speedy recovery of its pollutants removal properties in r2 fig 5 c thus its 100 efficiency was reached faster than in r1 3 5 long term operation of ags to investigate the long term stability of the rapidly formed granules r2 was operated for more than 150 days throughout the long term stability operation from day 60 150 aerobic granules maintained their compacted and round structure fig 7 on day 115 granules almost reached the height of 2 l fig 7 c on day 150 the granular degree was above 95 fig 7 d mlss and mlvss mlss values stayed at 6 5 7 6 g l 1 and 0 91 respectively while svi5 and svi30 svi5 remained at 47 0 0 5 ml g 1 and 1 0 respectively effluent cod and nh4 n stayed close to zero in sum these results show that the rapid formation of ags by using external conditioning indeed shortens the time of ags formation but also allows for a long term operational stability under 2 min settling time additionally this method is eco friendly and the operation is simpler than those using strong selection pressure during the start up phase followed by the monitoring of these operating parameters throughout long term management 18 19 3 6 microbial community structure dynamics sludge samples s0 s6 were collected from r2 and monitored using high throughput sequencing technology in order to improve our understanding of how microbial community structure is shaped during the ags rapid formation process microbial community structure was also analyzed figs 8 and 9 after quality filtering 21 896 22 825 high quality reads remained in samples s1 s2 and s3 comprising a total of 119 122 otu and a sufficiently high depth coverage of 0 99 those three samples refer to the external sludge collected during the external conditioning microbial diversity indices associated with those samples are shown in table 2 the closeness of richness estimators ace and chao1 between samples predicts a similar richness regardless of conditioning time however shannon and simpson diversity indices changed from 3 28 and 0 59 to 2 83 and 0 60 after 12 h of external conditioning and then to 2 81 and 0 69 after 24 h of conditioning considering that samples s1 s2 and s3 comprised between 119 and 122 otu such indices suggest that external conditioning slightly decreases species evenness which is visible in fig 8 indeed fig 8 a shows the microbial community structure of effluent sludge samples during the external conditioning with ca2 addition results suggest that at the phylum level proteobacteria were the most abundant bacteria with a relative abundance of 80 0 81 4 and 84 0 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively such high proportion of proteobacteria is in line with previous work 35 56 consequently the slight increase in proportion of proteobacteria leads to a small decrease in the relative abundance of bacteroidetes ranging from 15 4 13 2 and to 11 3 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively other phyla such as firmicutes gracilibacteria and verrucomicrobia had a relative abundance of 2 1 or less while the gradual increase in proteobacteria throughout the external conditioning could have played a positive role in eps production 5 57 which could explain the increase in eps concentration observed in fig 2 the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma clustering dendrogram based on unweighted unifrac distances shown in fig 8 a implies that there is a more pronounced change in microbial community structure between 0 h and 24 h or 0 h and 12 h of external conditioning than between 0 h and 12 h the contribution of each sample s1 s2 and s3 to the relative abundance of each taxon from phyla to genus is shown in fig 8 b results have shown that all samples comprise bacteria from three phyla five classes seven orders nine families and ten genera at the class level betaproteobacteria were the most abundant in all samples by far average of 70 48 slowly increasing from 69 5 to 73 6 during the external conditioning this suggests that the external conditioning promoted their growth or survival as opposed to other bacterial families thauera was the most abundant genus within this family and from genera concomitantly there was a gradual decrease in bacteroidetes relative abundance throughout the external conditioning from 15 4 to 11 2 from s1 to s3 indeed it was reported that bacteroidetes and underlying species found in wastewater were easily washed away during the sludge aggregation process 58 overall changes in microbial community structure observed in fig 8 b are hypothesized to be due to their higher retention in sludge their ability to produce eps to stimulate rapid aggregation and tolerance to the external conditioning process as reported in the earlier work 43 as for samples collected before and after the external conditioning i e s0 s4 s5 and s6 22799 to 24722 high quality reads remained after quality filtering reads were clustered into 110 316 otus when using a 97 sequence identity threshold which represented a sufficient depth coverage of 0 99 diversity indices associated with samples s0 s4 s5 and s6 are found in table 3 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all four samples ranging from a relative abundance of 58 6 92 9 which is in line with previous studies 35 56 less abundant phyla with a relative abundance over 1 included actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes chloroflexi verrucomicrobia acidobacteria and gracilibacteria all of them are frequently observed in the seeding sludge of sbr and remain present in ags which suggests that they could be involved in the ags formation process 43 furthermore ace and chao1 richness indicators as well as shannon and simpson diversity indices show that there is a large decrease in richness following the external conditioning i e from s0 up to s6 indeed even the number of otus sharply decreased from 316 to 110 from s0 to s6 which indicates that the seeding sludge s0 was much more diverse before ags rapid formation and external conditioning the diversity indices along with an overview of bacterial community profiles shown in fig 9 a and b further show that the evenness of the community drops due to the increasing dominance of a few selected taxa throughout the rapid granulation process for instance betaproteobacteria increased from 8 54 in the seeding sludge s0 to 89 9 in mature granules s6 it is noteworthy to mention that most changes in bacterial community structure were already observed on day 10 i e when subsamples were collected to begin the external conditioning this trend in β diversity can also be observed on the upgma dendrogram seen in fig 9a emphasizing that while samples s4 s5 and s6 have a short distance between them s0 is far from all of them meaning that otu distribution is quite different between s0 and the s4 s5 and s6 cluster mature granules s6 had a denser and larger structure than rapidly aggregating granules s4 and s5 which could explain the slight differences in bacterial communities between them overall this result implies that the granulation process does not alter microbial community structure much beyond their initial adaptation to wastewater treatment operations as suggested in winkler et al 2013 59 however minor changes did occur following the external conditioning namely with a sharp reduction in bacteroidetes and even further increase in proteobacteria which led to an even more streamlined community structure figs 8 and 9 our hypotheses regarding this streamlining of the bacterial community structure in the sbr are as follows 1 some taxa within proteobacteria namely thauera had more favourable conditions due to their pollution removal abilities in the sbr compared to other taxa such as alphaproteobacteria family and actinobacteria phylum this allowed them to thrive during external conditioning and rapid granulation process fig 8 b and b 2 the thauera genus is commonly associated with eps production which implies that not only does it accelerate ags formation but also it is expected that the formation of aggregates and granules prevent them from washing out of the sbr with the effluent sludge 35 57 on the other hand species that had a decreasing relative abundance as a function of time such as roseomonas and leucobacter might be deterred by the environmental conditions of the sbr and be washed out with the effluent sludge 43 3 7 possible impact of the effluent sludge external conditioning with an addition of ca2 on ags rapid formation in this study several sbr operating parameters were beneficial to aerobic sludge granulation namely the short settling time application of hydrodynamic shear force and the addition of ca2 to act as starting nuclei or carriers for microbial attachment here is the mechanism we propose for the rapid formation of ags fig 10 1 external conditioning of the effluent sludge with an addition of ca2 first the effluent sludge washes out from the sbr as floccular sludge fig 1 a under a short settling time regime the effluent sludge is then collected and conditioned by adding ca2 outside the sbr ca2 ions neutralize negative charges at the surface of bacterial cells and on eps then further act as nuclei or carriers to promote microbial attachment and aggregation onto their surface 32 throughout the external conditioning process moisture content decreases due to the alteration of the sludge s structure which in turn promotes sludge flocculation 48 simultaneously microbes known for their production of eps and bioremediating properties are enriched namely the bacterial genus thauera betaproteobacteria fig 8 a the gradual reduction in nutrients and water content in the sludge also streamlines the microbial community which amplifies the proportion and activity of microbes beneficial to the sludge aggregation process 11 ca2 ions in themselves are also reported to bind with eps which enhances the structure and density of sludge aggregates 33 taken together these events lead to a positive feedback loop increasing the propensity of sludge aggregation and therefore a rapid aggregation fig 1 b the external conditioning technique used in this study was more efficient at promoting sludge aggregation than previously used methods which include drying as the external conditioning of choice 42 2 ags rapid formation the sludge aggregates reintroduced into the sbr break down into smaller flocs and aggregates with varying sizes due to the hydrodynamic shear force applied throughout the sbr operations fig 3 it is hypothesized that smaller aggregates remaining in the sbr act as additional nuclei or carriers onto which microbes can attach themselves which promotes sludge aggregation and the rapid formation of ags 21 similarly to ca2 the shear force applied also compresses flocs and aggregate and turns them into aerobic granules 42 60 moreover microbes promoting the rapid formation of aggregates such as the thauera genus contribute to the rapid sludge granulation and pollutants degradation following their reinsertion into the sbr figs 4 and 6 since the operating conditions of the sbr favour their metabolism over other microbes their proportion within the microbial community further increases and promotes the formation of ags fig 9 a this strategy reduces the occurrence of random aggregation disintegration events during the initial phase of the sbr operations which is crucial for the successful formation and stabilization of aggregates and granules throughout the ags formation process 15 16 the gradual addition of ca2 into the effluent sludge also prevents its sedimentation in ags and greatly reduces the ash content of aerobic granules 4 conclusions this study has shown that an external conditioning step supplementing the effluent sludge with ca2 followed by its gradual reinsertion into sbr can shorten the ags formation time by up to 17 days adding ca2 to the effluent sludge over the course of 24 h and in five subsequent rounds can rapidly promote eps production effluent sludge aggregation and the reduction of sour and moisture content conditioned aggregates reintroduced into the sbr also acted as nuclei or carriers playing a positive role on rapid ags formation the external conditioning and reinsertion of effluent sludge also contributed to an enrichment of betaproteobacteria phylotypes namely thauera which in turn enhanced the formation of ags degradation of pollutants the strategy used in this work takes full advantage of both effluent sludge conditioning techniques and the addition of ca2 to accelerate the granulation of sludge and reducing the ash content in the start up stage this work will have important repercussions in the field as the conditioning method does not require a major adjustment of wwtp operations but will provide a more effective process there are however many more methods to explore and impacts to understand to optimize wastewater treatment processes for instance it would be beneficial to know if quorum sensing is involved in the sludge aggregation process and if so if it could improve actual conditioning methods in the future compliance with ethical standard ethical statement authors declare

13952,aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been limited by its long startup time in sequencing batch reactors sbrs the objective of this work is to determine if a new amendment of the ags process improves sludge granulation rate and pollutants removal efficiency this amendment consisted in an external conditioning step during which the effluent sludge was dried supplemented with 0 1 g cacl2 g 1 dried sludge ds and then gradually reintroduced into the sbr results have shown that this technique can reduce the granulation time by 17 days while ensuring the stability of ags stable aerobic granules were obtained on day 20 i e a few days after reintroducing 1 75 g l 1 ca2 conditioned sludge to the sbr for 5 consecutive days mixed liquor suspended solids mlss sludge volume index ratio at 30 min and 5 min svi30 svi5 and average granule size in the ags reactor were maintained at 5 7 g l 1 1 0 and 3 5 mm respectively the external conditioning led to an increase in extracellular polymers eps production a decrease in moisture content specific oxygen uptake rate sour and iron precipitation altogether these impacts led to a faster aggregation of the effluent sludge compared to a control sbr furthermore microbial community analyses have shown that the external conditioning process enriched specific betaproteobacteria e g thauera genus in aggregates and ags such outcomes could be linked to the faster granulation rate and more efficient pollutants degradation keywords effluent sludge external conditioning cacl2 addition betaproteobacteria thauera 1 introduction in the last few decades aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been extensively studied in sequencing batch reactors sbr 1 4 due to its superior settleability denser structure and higher biomass retention compared to conventional activated sludge as technologies 5 6 the efficiency of aerobic granulation is affected by a wide variety of factors including substrate composition settling time hydrodynamic shear stress and the production of extracellular polymers eps 7 11 earlier work has shown that aerobic granules are typically grown in sbr within 100 400 days using municipal wastewater 1 2 12 14 the granulation process when sbrs are fed with an activated sludge as inoculant is much shorter when treating synthetic wastewater indeed aerobic granules can be obtained in 2 4 weeks in lab scale sbrs such sbrs are usually fed with synthetic wastewater consisting primarily of acetate or glucose as a carbon source in such conditions a steady state is reached after an additional one to two months on top of the aforementioned factors wastewater characteristics and random aggregation disintegration mechanisms also play key roles in sludge granulation especially during the start up phase 15 17 several improvements to the rapid granulation process in synthetic wastewater have been proposed including fine tuning the optimal selective pressure settling time organic loading rate orl starvation period and shear force 8 aerobic granules are formed within 7 to 24 hours when a high selective pressure is applied to the sbr 18 the downside is that it produces fragile granules that break apart within a few days to maintain the long term stability of ags in sbr the selective pressure must be reduced to a suitable level after the steady state has been reached 19 several studies have improved the aerobic granulation process by seeding the sbr with anaerobic granules 20 crushed granular sludge 21 or aerobic granules maintained in long term storage 22 various supplements were also added to the synthetic wastewater to improve ags efficiency such as specific microbial strains as pure cultures 23 24 granular activated carbon gac 25 and dry sludge micro powder 26 27 increasing the temperature of upstream wastewater was also attempted 28 however this amendment is unsuitable for municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps which lab scale sbr aim to mimic finally another category of supplements includes adding nuclei or carriers to the sbr adding nuclei or carriers to the sbr such as ca2 can shorten the initial aggregation time by providing a surface to which microbes can attach themselves despite this promising concept directly supplementing the synthetic wastewater with ca2 decreases the granulation time 29 31 however the ca2 ions bond with eps neutralize the negative charges on the surface of bacterial cells and precipitate ions the latter can then served as nuclei and accelerate microbial aggregation 2 32 the addition of ca2 also improves the structure and density of ags yet its excessive addition results in high concentrations of inorganic precipitates along with an ash content of up to 50 84 34 both inorganic precipitates and ash decrease the bioactivity of ags 33 35 although decreasing the addition of ca2 down to 25 40 mg l reduces inorganic precipitates and ash content sludge granulation time drastically increases in such conditions 36 37 in brief the addition of ca2 has both positive and negative effects on the formation of aerobic granules other metal ions like mg2 fe2 fe3 mn2 and al3 can improve sludge granulation by increasing the size and stability of granules and altering microbial community structure 38 41 whereas all these methods can speed up the sludge granulation process their complexity and associated costs are prohibitive in practice these strategies solely focused on internal bioreactor conditioning earlier studies have reported that external conditioning such as drying the sludge outside the sbr and then reintroducing it into the sbr afterwards could reduce both the sludge granulation time and effluent sludge waste products during the initial wastewater treatment stage 42 in this regard effluent sludge waste products could be greatly reduced in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtp as result of the optimization of the ags formation process in wwtp several chemical and physical conditioners such as ca2 al3 fe3 are added to the waste activated sludge was in the pretreatment and wastewater treatment steps 43 44 ca2 is a more affordable and easier to obtain alternative to al3 and fe3 chemical flocculants 45 46 and its addition plays a positive role in eps production and aggregates strength 47 48 microbes known for their eps production and capacity to breakdown organic compounds including proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes proved to abundant in floccular sludge 35 eps act as binding agents that accelerate the formation of microbial aggregates by binding cells together which then promotes aerobic sludge granulation 11 sludge aggregates formed after a 72 h natural drying period reintroduced into the sbr as external conditioning were thinner and more fragile when compared to aggregates derived from undried sludge many factors related to these observations which could be the causes of their shortcomings have yet to be elucidated for instance microbial community dynamics were not investigated in effluent sludge during a natural drying process nor during sludge granulation 42 considering the different ags formation methods tested in the literature we developed an external conditioning method consisting mainly of an addition of ca2 to effluent sludge taken from the sbr and then the gradual reintroduction of this treated sludge into the sbr in this regard the main objective of this work is to assess the impact of this new external conditioning strategy on ags formation sludge physical properties eps production microbial community structure as well as pollution removal efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor conditions and operation two identical sbrs made of acrylic plastic were set up for the cultivation of aerobic granules height diameter and working volume of each reactor were 100 cm 9 cm and 4 l respectively one of the sbr r1 served as control and was used to cultivate aerobic granules with a gradually shortened settling time while the second one r2 was used for the cultivation of granules using the ca2 external conditioning method mentioned previously reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater mainly composed of acetate nh4 n and kh2po4 as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively aeration was at an airflow rate of 0 1 m3 h 1 sgv 0 44 cm s 1 offered by an air pump pl60 resun china and a 50 volumetric exchange ratio was applied each cycle of the sbr consisted of 160 min with a feeding time of 5 min and aeration time of 120 min a settling of 2 15 min a discharge time of 5 min and an idle time of 15 28 min details on the operating scheme for each cycle are given in table 1 pumps bt100 02 china and valves were controlled by programmable logic controllers plc in both sbrs the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 20 5 c using industrial grade air conditioning for indoor use gree group china wastewater ph was maintained at 7 0 7 5 by adjusting it with 10 hcl every 24 h both sbrs were inoculated with 0 5 l seeding sludge from a municipal sewage treatment plant qige wwtp hangzhou china influent chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n were set at 500 600 mg l 1 and 25 32 mg l 1 respectively trace element solutions were also added as described in 42 the composition of the synthetic wastewater medium meets the nutritional requirements of microbes typically found in wastewater treatment systems 42 the micro scale cacl2 size 20 200 μm was manually prepared using solid cacl2 was stored sealed for effluent sludge external conditioning in r1 settling time was gradually reduced and effluent sludge was washed out into the sewer system in r2 rapid granulation strategy consisted of effluent sludge external conditioning with adding ca2 and then feeding back for ags fast formation settling time stayed the same throughout the granulation process and biomass grew quickly after inoculation i e during the initial stage in the first 9 days coarse sludge was washed out from r2 following a 2 min settling time then was collected and filtered through three gauze sieves 0 1 mm mesh size every 24 h starting from day 10 starting from day 11 this coarse sludge was supplemented with 0 1 g cacl2 g 1 dry solids ds and manually mixed for 5 min to create a homogeneous mixture on gauze sieves this external conditioning aims to speed up the subsequent granulation process the ca2 concentration used was selected according to 47 48 as it was reported to increase sludge aggregation the treated sludge was soaked for 30 min in a 2 l beaker of fresh water afterwards the resulting sludge was manually crushed and separated on gauze mesh size 4 mm to decrease the size but increase the amount of aggregates finally sludge aggregates 1 75 0 05 g l 1 smaller than 4 mm were reintroduced into r2 every day for 5 days 2 2 eps content eps were extracted from the collected sludge by using the formaldehyde naoh method liu and fang 2002 because proteins pn and polysaccharides ps account for ca 80 of total eps total eps will be approximated as the sum of pn and ps the pn concentration was determined using the coomassie brilliant blue dye method using bovine serum albumin bsa as standard 50 the ps concentration was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as standard 51 2 3 bacterial community structure analysis

according to the manufacture s instructions sequencing of the 16s rdna v3 and v4 regions was conducted at the zhejiang tianke hi tech inc hangzhou china using illumina miseq 2 300 technology 10 ng dna

quality reads were used for downstream analyses high quality reads were obtained by removing paired read sequences shorter than 200 bp longer than 1000 bp a mean phred score under 25 or containing any ambiguous base the average length of high quality reads was 420 bp sequences were further clustered and assigned to operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 sequence identity threshold 2 4 analysis

3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of adding micro cacl2 on effluent sludge fig 1 shows effluent sludge morphology in r2 before and after external conditioning with ca2 after inoculation and stable operation loose floccular sludge was washed out in the first 2 min on day 10 fig 1 a mean effluent sludge was maintained at 0 610 0 005 g l 1 and collected with a gauze sieve 0 1 mm mesh size every 24 h starting from day 10 after the collected effluent sludge was supplemented with 0 1 g ca2 g 1 ds the floccular sludge began aggregating quickly compact aggregates with a uniform size were manually crushed to increase the amount of aggregates fig 1 b eps sour and moisture content of effluent sludge had significant variations during the external conditioning process fig 2 eps gradually increased from 109 4 mg g 1 to 180 3 mg g 1 vss ps content obviously increased higher than pn whereas pn content barely increased throughout the external conditioning this was well agreed with the earlier work 48 sour and moisture content decreased from 15 7 to 0 55 mg o2 g 1 vss h within 24 h these results contrast with those reported following an external conditioning consisting of drying the effluent sludge for 72 h before reintroducing it to the sbr 42 indeed the addition of ca2 in the effluent sludge can neutralize negative charges on eps or at the surface of bacterial cell walls consequently ca2 can interconnect these compounds and generate cross linkages 29 33 furthermore the addition of ca2 can alter the sludge s structure thus increasing its dewaterability 45 48 as a result the moisture content of effluent sludge quickly decreased during the external conditioning process sludge also quickly attached to ca2 nuclei which sharply decreased the sour the now hypotonic environment stimulated the microbial production of eps as a mean of protection against osmotic stress 11 48 which consequently improved the rapid aggregation process and created a positive feedback loop overall this external conditioning method led to a quicker aggregation process than one consisting of sludge drying alone 42 3 2 effect of hydraulic pressure on sludge aggregate additionally a third sbr r3 was set up to investigate the role of hydraulic shear force on sludge aggregates the ca2 external conditioning was also applied to r3 aggregates with a mlss over 2 68 g l 1 fig 1 b were used as inoculants whereas fresh water was used as influent sgv was maintained at 0 44 cm s 1 other operation conditions are described when referring to r2 from day 10 to 57 in table 1 compact aggregates fig 3 a already encompass a dense structure on day 1 the average aggregate size decreased from 3 6 mm to 0 4 mm via the shear force applied throughout the experiment this is namely due to the breakdown of larger aggregates into floccular sludge and small aggregates consequently larger aggregates were washed out with the effluent sludge under a 2 min settling time regime while smaller aggregates and floccular sludge remained in r3 after 3 days fig 3 b it also translates to a decrease of mlss from 2 68 g l 1 to 1 10 g l 1 along with a decrease in retaining efficiency from 1 0 to 0 43 fig 3 c these results show that adding ca2 as an external conditioning step led to a higher efficiency than the external conditioning alone i e via natural drying 42 likely by having a positive impact on eps production and sludge aggregate density with relatively higher ps 47 48 furthermore aggregates formed following the addition of ca2 resisted to low hydraulic pressure in the sbr 3 3 impact of the addition of cacl2 within an external conditioning process on rapid granulation 3 3 1 morphological variations of ags in sbrs changes in ags morphology throughout the wastewater treatment are shown in fig 4 during the first week of treatment fig 4 a and b sludge aggregates had a loose irregular shape that was undistinguishable from floccular sludge in r1 after 12 days a few aggregates made of flocs and zoogloea spp were observed due to the decreasing settling time from 15 to 5 min fig 4 c after 19 days the proportion of such aggregates slightly increased fig 4 e as the settling time further decreased to 2 min denser sludge remained in the sbr and the increased olr which contributed to sludge granulation in r1 reducing the settling time to 2 min further increased the amount of granules on day 23 fig 4 g after 57 days of development aerobic granules were increasingly abundant and their average size went over 1 0 mm fig 4 i overall the strategy to decrease settling time leading to a higher orl was a favorable method to quicken ags cultivation in r1 8 19 contrasting trends were observed in r2 while settling time was drastically reduced on day 10 flocs were still dominant after 12 days of cultivation even though olr increased substantially and a few granules began to form fig 4 d on day 13 aggregates were conditioned externally with ca2 and fed back into r2 which led to the formation of denser and more clearly defined granules in the following week fig 4 f sludge granulation sharply increased in subsequent days fig 4 h increasing the number and size of granules as well as showing a more defined rounder shape simultaneously bigger aggregates broke down and gave rise to numerous smaller aggregates which accelerated sludge granulation and led to an overall quicker and more intense granulation than r1 even at the end of process after 57 days the average size of aerobic granule increased to 3 5 mm in r2 fig 4 j in sum the external conditioning and addition of ca2 to effluent sludge followed by reintroducing into the sbr contributed to the sludge rapid granulation and its greater efficiency compared to gradually increasing selection pressure i e for r1 moreover granulation rate was also faster when adding ca2 during the external conditioning phase when compared to a previous study using natural drying as external conditioning 42 or internal conditioning with improving wastewater temperature 28 adding chemical coagulation and flocculation in practice 43 3 3 2 ags physical characteristics 1 mlss and mlvss mlss in both sbrs mlss and mlvss mlss increased from 3 75 to 5 89 g l 1 and from 0 5 to 0 82 during the first 10 days respectively fig 5 a as settling time decreased starting from the 10th day so did the mlss and mlvss decreased since numerous flocs were washed out of the sbrs the further decrease of settling time in r1 led to a slow increase in mlss and mlvss throughout the experiment up to a peak value of 3 99 g l 1 and 3 63 g l 1 on day 48 which slightly decreased afterwards with a final mlss mlvss ration of 0 9 fig 5 a similarly to r1 the mlss in r2 sharply decreased down to 1 12 g l 1 on day 12 after the settling time was reduced to 2 min from the 10th day fig 5 a each day the externally conditioned sludge aggregates 1 75 0 05 g l 1 were fed back into r2 from day 13 to 17 the addition of the conditioned sludge led to a quick increase in mlss and mvlss in r2 fig 5 a this increase in mlss and mlvss stabilized to 6 0 g l 1 and 5 7 g l 1 fig 5 a respectively while mlvss mlss ratio in r2 slightly decreased to 0 81 on day 17 and increased to 0 9 on day 31 kept a steady development until day 57 fig 5 a this could be due to the rapid formation of sludge aggregates after the addition of cacl2 which in turn slightly increased the sludge ash content liu et al 2017 reported that the mlvss mlss ratio represents a rough estimate of ash content and sludge bioactivity 35 considering that both reactors maintained a mlvss mlss ratio of 0 9 fig 5 a this suggests that effluent sludge conditioning with the addition of 0 1 g ca2 ds followed by feeding back the treated sludge into the reactor accelerated the granulation process without significantly altering the ash content and the bioactivity of ags moreover this method as opposed to the earlier works 33 34 e g excess or continuous addition of ca2 prevents the precipitation of excess metal ions in ags and a reduction of the ash content of aerobic granules in startup stage 2 svi and svi30 svi5 svi is an important index that hints at the overall sedimentation of sludge in both reactors it reflects the sludge s structure thus its looseness and coagulation performance fig 5 b shows the fluctuations of svi in r1 and r2 throughout the whole operation the svi5 of the inoculant sludge increased in both sbr over the first 10 days from the initial 73 9 ml g 1 up to 159 7 ml g 1 respectively also the svi30 svi5 ratios decreased from 0 7 to 0 48 in the first 10 days fig 5 b these results indicate that the sludge s settleability decreased during that timeframe in r1 when the settling time was reduced from 15 min to 5 min both svi5 and svi30 decreased while the svi30 svi5 ratios increased on day 37 svi5 and svi30 stabilized at 51 6 ml g 1 and 46 4 ml g 1 respectively while the svi30 svi5 ratio increased over 0 9 fig 5 b in r2 similar trends were observed after 10 days svi5 and svi30 plummeted under 60 0 ml g 1 fig 5 b conditioned sludge was gradually reintroduced into r2 from day 13 to day 17 leading to a stabilization of both svi5 and svi30 at ca 45 1 ml g 1 on day 20 consequently the svi30 svi5 ratio reached 1 0 on day 20 fig 5 b studies have reported that a svi30 svi5 ratio 0 9 indicate a successful aerobic sludge granulation 53 54 our results thus show that in r2 successful granulation was achieved 17 days earlier than in r1 and therefore that the r2 operation was more efficient in that regard therefore these results indicated that the external conditioning of the effluent sludge by the addition of ca2 could reduce ags formation time during the startup phase 3 settling velocity size and sour fig 5 c shows the variations of settling velocity size and sour of aerobic granules in both sbr throughout the granulation process after inoculation sludge settling velocity decreased from 9 8 m h 1 to 7 3 m h 1 in both reactors while sludge mean size increased slowly due to the formation of the initial flocs in the first 10 days with decreasing settling time and gradual sludge granulation in r1 the settling velocity and mean size of sludge increased throughout the operation and plateaued on day 52 at 16 2 m h 1 and 1 1 mm respectively on the other hand sour increased for the whole duration of the operation and reached to 26 2 mg o2 g 1 vss h during the settling stage fig 5 c in r2 sludge settling velocity and mean size increased more rapidly than in r1 and reached 25 8 m h 1 and 2 8 mm on day 57 respectively however trends in sour were hectic in the first 23 days with a swift increase during the rest of the operation which led to final value close to r1 at 27 8 mg o2 g 1 vss h fig 5 c this could be explained by the compact structure and low sour of sludge aggregates fed back into r2 after external conditioning which turn out to increase settling velocity and mean size while slightly decreasing sour this is in agreement with previous work 42 these results suggest that the addition of ca2 during external conditioning not only quickens sludge aggregation but also has positive impacts on sludge settling velocity and mean size while its impact on sour at the end of operation is negligible 4 eps and pn ps eps production is at the core of ags formation as it is the leading cause of the preferential attachment of microbial cells into flocs eps is mainly composed of pn and ps which concentration is shown as a function of time in fig 8 eps concentration increased in both r1 and r2 until day 10 resulting from an increase in pn and a slight decrease in ps fig 5 d in r1 eps decreased between day 10 19 due to the reduction in settling time from 15 to 5 min when aerobic sludge granulation began around day 19 eps concentration gradually increased until it stabilized at 73 2 mg g 1 vss on day 37 when ags maturation plateaued pn and ps concentrations barely fluctuated after the onset of the granulation process fig 5 d in r2 starting from day 13 eps pn and ps concentrations rapidly increased to 86 2 mg g 1 vss 47 6 mg g 1 vss and 38 6 mg g 1 vss respectively fig 5 d these are due to the gradual reintroduction of conditioned sludge aggregates into sbr eps concentrations peaked after the last addition of conditioned aggregates on day 17 afterwards eps slightly decreased from day 24 onwards whereas eps pn and ps stabilized starting from day 30 at the end of operations on day 57 eps pn and ps concentrations were of 106 5 mg g 1 vss 52 8 mg g 1 vss and 53 7 mg g 1 vss fig 5 d respectively these values are higher in r2 than in r1 as expected from previous trends observed with higher mlss and mlvss in r2 fig 5 a these results indicate that external conditioning and gradual reinsertion of aggregated sludge into r2 increased eps production which in turn accelerated ags formation in the sbr as was observed in 42 3 4 cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies were also monitored in both sbrs throughout the operation as shown in fig 6 before day 10 i e shortening of settling time influent and effluent cod and nh4 n were similar in both sbrs in r1 the reduction in settling time decreased cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies from 91 3 to 83 9 and 87 4 76 7 respectively fig 6 a when sludge granulation successfully took off on day 19 the pollutants removal efficiencies recovered reaching 93 efficiency or more fig 6 a the drastic reduction in settling time in r2 led to low mlss before the reintroduction of conditioned aggregates which consequently led to sharply lower pollutants removal efficiencies compared to r1 between day 13 and 17 when conditioned aggregates were gradually fed back into r2 pollutants removal efficiency recovered quickly up to day 30 where it reached 100 efficiency while the pollutants removal efficiency was much lower in r2 than in r1 in the operation of day 12 20 aggregates with low sour fed back into r2 led to decrease ags sour the maturation of ags formation quickly increased sludge bioactivity which led to a speedy recovery of its pollutants removal properties in r2 fig 5 c thus its 100 efficiency was reached faster than in r1 3 5 long term operation of ags to investigate the long term stability of the rapidly formed granules r2 was operated for more than 150 days throughout the long term stability operation from day 60 150 aerobic granules maintained their compacted and round structure fig 7 on day 115 granules almost reached the height of 2 l fig 7 c on day 150 the granular degree was above 95 fig 7 d mlss and mlvss mlss values stayed at 6 5 7 6 g l 1 and 0 91 respectively while svi5 and svi30 svi5 remained at 47 0 0 5 ml g 1 and 1 0 respectively effluent cod and nh4 n stayed close to zero in sum these results show that the rapid formation of ags by using external conditioning indeed shortens the time of ags formation but also allows for a long term operational stability under 2 min settling time additionally this method is eco friendly and the operation is simpler than those using strong selection pressure during the start up phase followed by the monitoring of these operating parameters throughout long term management 18 19 3 6 microbial community structure dynamics sludge samples s0 s6 were collected from r2 and monitored using high throughput sequencing technology in order to improve our understanding of how microbial community structure is shaped during the ags rapid formation process microbial community structure was also analyzed figs 8 and 9 after quality filtering 21 896 22 825 high quality reads remained in samples s1 s2 and s3 comprising a total of 119 122 otu and a sufficiently high depth coverage of 0 99 those three samples refer to the external sludge collected during the external conditioning microbial diversity indices associated with those samples are shown in table 2 the closeness of richness estimators ace and chao1 between samples predicts a similar richness regardless of conditioning time however shannon and simpson diversity indices changed from 3 28 and 0 59 to 2 83 and 0 60 after 12 h of external conditioning and then to 2 81 and 0 69 after 24 h of conditioning considering that samples s1 s2 and s3 comprised between 119 and 122 otu such indices suggest that external conditioning slightly decreases species evenness which is visible in fig 8 indeed fig 8 a shows the microbial community structure of effluent sludge samples during the external conditioning with ca2 addition results suggest that at the phylum level proteobacteria were the most abundant bacteria with a relative abundance of 80 0 81 4 and 84 0 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively such high proportion of proteobacteria is in line with previous work 35 56 consequently the slight increase in proportion of proteobacteria leads to a small decrease in the relative abundance of bacteroidetes ranging from 15 4 13 2 and to 11 3 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively other phyla such as firmicutes gracilibacteria and verrucomicrobia had a relative abundance of 2 1 or less while the gradual increase in proteobacteria throughout the external conditioning could have played a positive role in eps production 5 57 which could explain the increase in eps concentration observed in fig 2 the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma clustering dendrogram based on unweighted unifrac distances shown in fig 8 a implies that there is a more pronounced change in microbial community structure between 0 h and 24 h or 0 h and 12 h of external conditioning than between 0 h and 12 h the contribution of each sample s1 s2 and s3 to the relative abundance of each taxon from phyla to genus is shown in fig 8 b results have shown that all samples comprise bacteria from three phyla five classes seven orders nine families and ten genera at the class level betaproteobacteria were the most abundant in all samples by far average of 70 48 slowly increasing from 69 5 to 73 6 during the external conditioning this suggests that the external conditioning promoted their growth or survival as opposed to other bacterial families thauera was the most abundant genus within this family and from genera concomitantly there was a gradual decrease in bacteroidetes relative abundance throughout the external conditioning from 15 4 to 11 2 from s1 to s3 indeed it was reported that bacteroidetes and underlying species found in wastewater were easily washed away during the sludge aggregation process 58 overall changes in microbial community structure observed in fig 8 b are hypothesized to be due to their higher retention in sludge their ability to produce eps to stimulate rapid aggregation and tolerance to the external conditioning process as reported in the earlier work 43 as for samples collected before and after the external conditioning i e s0 s4 s5 and s6 22799 to 24722 high quality reads remained after quality filtering reads were clustered into 110 316 otus when using a 97 sequence identity threshold which represented a sufficient depth coverage of 0 99 diversity indices associated with samples s0 s4 s5 and s6 are found in table 3 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all four samples ranging from a relative abundance of 58 6 92 9 which is in line with previous studies 35 56 less abundant phyla with a relative abundance over 1 included actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes chloroflexi verrucomicrobia acidobacteria and gracilibacteria all of them are frequently observed in the seeding sludge of sbr and remain present in ags which suggests that they could be involved in the ags formation process 43 furthermore ace and chao1 richness indicators as well as shannon and simpson diversity indices show that there is a large decrease in richness following the external conditioning i e from s0 up to s6 indeed even the number of otus sharply decreased from 316 to 110 from s0 to s6 which indicates that the seeding sludge s0 was much more diverse before ags rapid formation and external conditioning the diversity indices along with an overview of bacterial community profiles shown in fig 9 a and b further show that the evenness of the community drops due to the increasing dominance of a few selected taxa throughout the rapid granulation process for instance betaproteobacteria increased from 8 54 in the seeding sludge s0 to 89 9 in mature granules s6 it is noteworthy to mention that most changes in bacterial community structure were already observed on day 10 i e when subsamples were collected to begin the external conditioning this trend in β diversity can also be observed on the upgma dendrogram seen in fig 9a emphasizing that while samples s4 s5 and s6 have a short distance between them s0 is far from all of them meaning that otu distribution is quite different between s0 and the s4 s5 and s6 cluster mature granules s6 had a denser and larger structure than rapidly aggregating granules s4 and s5 which could explain the slight differences in bacterial communities between them overall this result implies that the granulation process does not alter microbial community structure much beyond their initial adaptation to wastewater treatment operations as suggested in winkler et al 2013 59 however minor changes did occur following the external conditioning namely with a sharp reduction in bacteroidetes and even further increase in proteobacteria which led to an even more streamlined community structure figs 8 and 9 our hypotheses regarding this streamlining of the bacterial community structure in the sbr are as follows 1 some taxa within proteobacteria namely thauera had more favourable conditions due to their pollution removal abilities in the sbr compared to other taxa such as alphaproteobacteria family and actinobacteria phylum this allowed them to thrive during external conditioning and rapid granulation process fig 8 b and b 2 the thauera genus is commonly associated with eps production which implies that not only does it accelerate ags formation but also it is expected that the formation of aggregates and granules prevent them from washing out of the sbr with the effluent sludge 35 57 on the other hand species that had a decreasing relative abundance as a function of time such as roseomonas and leucobacter might be deterred by the environmental conditions of the sbr and be washed out with the effluent sludge 43 3 7 possible impact of the effluent sludge external conditioning with an addition of ca2 on ags rapid formation in this study several sbr operating parameters were beneficial to aerobic sludge granulation namely the short settling time application of hydrodynamic shear force and the addition of ca2 to act as starting nuclei or carriers for microbial attachment here is the mechanism we propose for the rapid formation of ags fig 10 1 external conditioning of the effluent sludge with an addition of ca2 first the effluent sludge washes out from the sbr as floccular sludge fig 1 a under a short settling time regime the effluent sludge is then collected and conditioned by adding ca2 outside the sbr ca2 ions neutralize negative charges at the surface of bacterial cells and on eps then further act as nuclei or carriers to promote microbial attachment and aggregation onto their surface 32 throughout the external conditioning process moisture content decreases due to the alteration of the sludge s structure which in turn promotes sludge flocculation 48 simultaneously microbes known for their production of eps and bioremediating properties are enriched namely the bacterial genus thauera betaproteobacteria fig 8 a the gradual reduction in nutrients and water content in the sludge also streamlines the microbial community which amplifies the proportion and activity of microbes beneficial to the sludge aggregation process 11 ca2 ions in themselves are also reported to bind with eps which enhances the structure and density of sludge aggregates 33 taken together these events lead to a positive feedback loop increasing the propensity of sludge aggregation and therefore a rapid aggregation fig 1 b the external conditioning technique used in this study was more efficient at promoting sludge aggregation than previously used methods which include drying as the external conditioning of choice 42 2 ags rapid formation the sludge aggregates reintroduced into the sbr break down into smaller flocs and aggregates with varying sizes due to the hydrodynamic shear force applied throughout the sbr operations fig 3 it is hypothesized that smaller aggregates remaining in the sbr act as additional nuclei or carriers onto which microbes can attach themselves which promotes sludge aggregation and the rapid formation of ags 21 similarly to ca2 the shear force applied also compresses flocs and aggregate and turns them into aerobic granules 42 60 moreover microbes promoting the rapid formation of aggregates such as the thauera genus contribute to the rapid sludge granulation and pollutants degradation following their reinsertion into the sbr figs 4 and 6 since the operating conditions of the sbr favour their metabolism over other microbes their proportion within the microbial community further increases and promotes the formation of ags fig 9 a this strategy reduces the occurrence of random aggregation disintegration events during the initial phase of the sbr operations which is crucial for the successful formation and stabilization of aggregates and granules throughout the ags formation process 15 16 the gradual addition of ca2 into the effluent sludge also prevents its sedimentation in ags and greatly reduces the ash content of aerobic granules 4 conclusions this study has shown that an external conditioning step supplementing the effluent sludge with ca2 followed by its gradual reinsertion into sbr can shorten the ags formation time by up to 17 days adding ca2 to the effluent sludge over the course of 24 h and in five subsequent rounds can rapidly promote eps production effluent sludge aggregation and the reduction of sour and moisture content conditioned aggregates reintroduced into the sbr also acted as nuclei or carriers playing a positive role on rapid ags formation the external conditioning and reinsertion of effluent sludge also contributed to an enrichment of betaproteobacteria phylotypes namely thauera which in turn enhanced the formation of ags degradation of pollutants the strategy used in this work takes full advantage of both effluent sludge conditioning techniques and the addition of ca2 to accelerate the granulation of sludge and reducing the ash content in the start up stage this work will have important repercussions in the field as the conditioning method does not require a major adjustment of wwtp operations but will provide a more effective process there are however many more methods to explore and impacts to understand to optimize wastewater treatment processes for instance it would be beneficial to know if quorum sensing is involved in the sludge aggregation process and if so if it could improve actual conditioning methods in the future compliance with ethical standard ethical statement authors declare

13953,aiming at preventing the production of a large amount of solid wastes spent biological activated carbon sbac while increasing their efficiencies as resources this study was undertaken to explore the ability of sbacs with different lifespans to remove pb ii from water sbacs with different using time 5 6 and 7 years were collected in a full scale bac process designated sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 respectively although the content of metals ca ii etc adsorbed on sbacs increases with using time ft ir analyses confirmed the stability of surface functional groups on sbacs adsorption experiments showed that sbacs irrespective of using time presented stable adsorption abilities 99 for pb ii 2 0 8 0 mg l with the maximum uptake of 168 07 mg g their adsorption properties were changed from freundlich to langmuir model over time adsorption processes were pseudo second order kinetic and faster at a higher content of carboxyl groups as a dominant adsorption mechanism ion exchange with ca ii adsorbed on sbacs accounted for 60 of the total adsorbed pb ii water temperature ph and coexisting ions have little effects on the removal of pb ii for the organics previously adsorbed on sbacs almost no leaching was observed in the real river water and application experiments verified sbacs ability to remove pb ii from actual water 80 the findings will find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time which not only prevent the production of large amounts of solid waste spent biological activated carbon sbac but also make the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process keywords drinking water treatment spent biological activated carbon sbac surface oxygen containing functional groups metal exchange leaching 1 introduction china s standards for drinking water quality 1 promulgated in 2006 was planned to be fully implemented on july 1 2012 which accelerated the upgrading of the conventional water treatment plant among them membrane filtration and activated carbon ac adsorption technologies were the preferred advanced treatment technologies for drinking water 2 compared with the former due to the high surface area porous structure and developed functional group ac is used to remove a broad spectrum of impurities from water and has been the most popular and widely used adsorbent in water treatment field 3 5 especially in the biological activated carbon bac or o3 granular ac process the ac serves as a porous carrier material to which bacteria can attach and pollutants are removed by both adsorption and biodegradation 3 6 which has been proved to be one of the most promising water treatments technologies 7 since 2014 more than 20 of surface water plants in china have adopted the bac process 8 at that time in order to guide the selection of ac activated carbon from coal for drinking water treatment in municipal water plant cj t 345 2010 9 was developed in china which referred to current awwa and jwwa standards the bac process does play a crucial role in improving water quality in china and achieving the new drinking water standards 2 however with the increase of using time the ac adsorption capacity will gradually decrease to the point that the bac process no longer produces the desired effluent water quality when the spent activated biological carbon sbac will be regarded as a kind of solid waste and need be regenerated or disposed 10 every year billions of tons of solid wastes are produced by municipalities all over the world 11 such as us municipal solid waste msw production has climbed to more than 230 million milligrams usepa 2018 in 2015 therefore it is becoming increasingly important to reduce waste 12 in addition due to the scarcity and increasing exploitation of resources the prevention of waste as well as the reintroduction of the materials into the economic loop has been the strategies of waste management 13 now many water treatment plants in china are facing the problem of sbacs replacement or regeneration with the increase of using time undoubtedly sbacs rational use will reduce or avoid the continuous generation of large amounts of solid waste to explore the reuse potential of sbac ac used 5 years was sampled from a full scale bac water treatment plant in china facing the replace or regeneration the surface properties analyses and related adsorption testing indicated that the collected ac can remove heavy metals pb ii 14 undoubtedly the finding will provide a new idea for the reuse of sbacs due to the advantages of adsorption compared to other removal methods 15 16 however due to the improvement of the source water quality the effluent water quality of the selected water treatment plant can reach the standards of gb 5749 2006 again 1 therefore ac that once faced replacement or regeneration continued to be used in water treatment plants which brings uncertainty to its ability to remove heavy metals the present work was thus undertaken to explore the ability of sbacs with different lifespans to remove metals from water the sbac samples with different using time 5 6 and 7 years were collected in the same bac water treatment plant with our previous study 14 which were respectively designated sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 first the effects of using time on the surface properties of the sbacs were investigated including ph value the amount of surface acidic and basic functional groups ft ir and xps analyses of sbacs with different using time then taking pb ii as an example which has received the highest attention due to its ubiquitous and hazardous effects to human health 17 18 the adsorption experiments were respectively conducted for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 characterizations of sbacs indicated that not only the surface acidic functional groups increased but also metals adsorbed on sbacs especially ca mg and al increased over time that is different from the virgin ac sbacs are more like biochar with abundant organic functional groups and higher ashes 19 which have been frequently used to remove metals and consist of three main metal sorption mechanisms i ion exchange ii metal complexation with free functional groups together with physical adsorption and iii surface precipitation 19 in addition during the pb ii adsorption a certain amount of ca ii and mg ii were found to release from the sbacs therefore the removal of pb ii by sbacs from solution may involve exchange with h metal exchange with ca ii and mg ii coordination with surface hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and surface precipitation 14 etc to verify the adsorption mechanism of pb ii by sbacs with different using time the adsorption properties of sbacs with different using time for pb ii were comprehensively investigated including adsorption isotherm analyses kinetics models fittings and influencing factors analyses etc n2 adsorption desorption isotherm ft ir and xps comparative analyses of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption and the related ions release experiments were also respectively conducted to investigate their reuse potential in real water body the leaching and application experiments were performed using the local campus river undoubtedly the results will help to find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time and provide the theoretical and practical basis for the revise of cjt 345 2010 9 while making the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process 2 materials and methods 2 1 the collecting of sbac samples the selected full scale bac water treatment plant was the same one with our previous study 14 due to the improvement of source water quality the effluent water quality of the water treatment plant can meet the requirements of gb 5749 2006 again 1 so the sbac 5 was continued to be used in the bac process therefore with the increase of using time the sbac samples used 6 and 7 years sbac 6 and sbac 7 were luckily collected in the same bac process according to the methods specified in awwab 605 2013 10 the collected sbac samples were firstly stored in screw capped plastic bottles and were naturally dried before use 2 2 characterization of sbac samples nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were measured at 77 k for sbacs with a volumetric adsorption analyzer autosorb iq2 mp quantachrome and bet specific surface area micropore volume mesopore volume and total volume were respectively given according to the same methods with our previous study 14 the ph value of sbacs was measured based on astm standard test method 20 boehm s titration method was used to quantify the amount of acidic and basic functional groups on sbac s surfaces 21 all reagents used were of analytical grade the surface functional groups the elemental composition and chemical bonding state on the surfaces of the sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption were respectively determined using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectrometer spectrum 100 perkin elmer inc usa and an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250 spectrometer 6 22 2 3 analyses of adsorption properties of sbacs with different using time 2 3 1 batch adsorption experiments batch experiments to determine the pb ii removal efficiency were performed in 250 ml erlenmayer flasks according to astm standard methods 23 desired concentration of pb ii solutions used in the adsorption studies were prepared by appropriate dilutions in pure water of a stock pb no3 2 solution 1000 mg l tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd according to the objective of this study combined with drinking water quality standards water quality conditions and possible water pollution accidents the initial pb ii concentration was set to approximately 5 0 mg l pb ii and other metal ions concentrations in solution were measured by an icp oes icap 7400 thermo electron corporation usa these experiments were done in duplicate and the average values were reported 14 24 effects of the experimental parameters on the removal of pb ii by sbacs were also studied in a batch mode including adsorbent dosages 0 0 2 g l the initial pb ii concentration 2 0 8 0 mg l contact time 5 300 min temperature 20 35 c ph 2 0 9 0 and coexisting ions 0 200 mg l etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of using time on the surface properties of sbacs 3 1 1 ph value in this study the ph of the virgin ac is 11 14 while the ph of the sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 respectively lowered to 6 0 6 5 and 5 7 that is due to the complex physical chemical and biological process ozone oxidation adsorption and biodegradation during the bac process 14 25 especially the ozone oxidation the ph of sbacs will decrease with the increasing of using time until to about 6 and then no obvious changes were observed this should be attributed to the limited amount of surface functional groups on ac that can be oxidized under bac process conditions limited ozone dose among of them sbac 6 presented a slightly higher ph which should be caused by the varying conditions within the water treatment plant such as process upsets widely fluctuating influent water quality loadings of total organic carbon and also the makeup of granular ac 10 etc 3 1 2 the amount of surface functional groups on sbacs the amount of acidic and basic functional groups on sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 were given by boehm s titration see table s1 the results indicated that the contents of acidic groups carboxyl lactone and phenolic groups are higher than those of basic groups in all sbac samples which confirmed the results of the above ph values particularly sbac 6 has the highest content of carboxyl groups followed by sbac 7 and sbac 5 undoubtedly the above results implied their potential of removing heavy metal by chelating properties 26 27 3 1 3 ft ir analyses of the sbacs with different using time as fig 1 a indicated compared to virgin ac several new peaks appeared in sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 including around 1385 cm 1 due to the adsorption peak of no3 28 1665 1565 cm 1 due to the asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylates 29 1020 1300 cm 1 due to co vibration and 3200 3600 cm 1 due to free and hydrogen bonded oh groups 30 the new characteristic peaks should be attributed to the complex physical chemical and biological effects during bac water treatment 25 31 32 although the obvious changes occurred from virgin ac to sbac it can be seen that sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 showed the same characteristic peaks namely the surface functional groups on the sbacs showed stability over time 3 1 4 xps analyses of the sbacs with different using time xps measurements of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 were performed before and after pb ii adsorption using virgin ac as a control the results were summarized in table 1 which gave the elemental compositions of sbacs in atomic of carbon oxygen as well as the trace components 7 as table 1 indicated the oxygen contents increased by 7 03 10 32 in sbacs compared to virgin ac which reflected a significant increase in surface oxygen containing functional groups during the bac process in addition the impurity contents represented by ca mg al etc also significantly increased namely the content of metals adsorbed on ac grains increased over time andersson et al also reported the similar results 33 among them ca and mg should be derived from the water to be treated and may be retained through electrostatic effect inner sphere complex with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups as well as precipitation 19 and al should be introduced by the flocculants other than those no other harmful impurities were detected 3 2 effects of using time on the adsorption properties of the sbacs for pb ii 3 2 1 adsorption ability of the sbacs with different using time it can be observed from fig 2 a that sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 showed the similar adsorption ability for pb ii the equilibrium concentration of pb ii gradually decreased with the increase of sbacs dosages due to the interaction between pb ii and free binding sites available on the surface of sbacs when the dosages of sbacs reached to 0 10 g l all sbacs already reached the adsorption equilibrium with the maximum removal rates of more than 99 0 fig 2b showed the effects of initial pb ii concentration on the removal of pb ii by sbacs with different using time although the equilibrium concentrations showed a slightly upward trend with the increase in the initial concentrations from 2 45 to 8 08 mg l all sbacs irrespective of using time showed the removal rate of more than 99 for pb ii at low carbon dosing 0 20 g l and maintained the equilibrium concentrations of less than 0 05 mg l among them sbac 6 performed best and the equilibrium concentrations of pb ii were less than 0 01 mg l which reached the requirement of who guidelines for drinking water quality that is although doc removal efficiency in the service life of a bac will gradually decrease with the increase of using time the bac process imparted the sbac a stable capability to remove heavy metals which can be explained by the stability of surface functional groups on sbacs over time undoubtedly the above findings will help to find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs solid waste irrespective using time namely they became a new kind of materials removing heavy metals from the water which is in line with the characteristics of circular economy and sustainable water management 34 35 3 2 2 adsorption isotherm analyses to fit these data langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models were adopted which are expressed as qe qmbce 1 bce qe kfce 1 n and ln qe ln qs kad rtln 1 1 ce 2 respectively 36 38 here ce is the equilibrium concentration of pb ii mg l qmis the maximum adsorption capacity mg g b l mg kf mg g l mg 1 n n unitless are adsorption constants indicating the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity kad is the adsorption equilibrium constant qs is the theoretical saturation capacity mg g t is absolute temperature k and r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k the fitting results were shown in figs 2 and the corresponding parameters were summarized and listed in table s2 the fitting results indicated that the adsorption isotherm properties of sbacs on pb ii showed significantly changes compared with langmiur and dubinin radushkevich models the adsorption isotherm of sbac 5 is more in line with freundlich model figs 2c d s1 and table s2 which is consistent with our previous study 14 however as far as sbac 6 and sbac 7 are concerned langmiur models are superior to freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models that is sbac s adsorption properties were changed from freundlich to langmuir model see fig 2c d and table s2 r2 increased from 0 826 to 0 987 with the increase of using time it is well known that langmuir model describes monolayer adsorption on a homogenous surface 39 therefore it can be inferred that the adsorption sites were gradually dispersed uniformly on the surface of sbacs with the increase of running time and pb ii was adsorbed as a monolayer on the sbacs surface given the maximum metal uptake sbac 5 is the largest at 168 07 mg g table s2 which is difficult to achieve by most adsorbents 12 40 43 such as nano hematite bagasse composite n hbc 16 57 mg g 40 bentonite enriched with sh groups 22 06 mg g 41 a novel magnetic nanoparticles 129 65 mg g 42 and a new biosorbent 13 65 mg g 43 etc in terms of the adsorption capacity indicated by kf and the theorytical saturation capacity indicated by qs both of them showed stabilities over time sbac 6 is slightly better than sbac 5 and sbac 7 which should be attributed to the developed acidic groups especially the carboxyl groups in the sbac 6 3 2 3 adsorption kinetic properties as fig 2e indicated the adsorption of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 on pb ii showed the same kinetics properties irrespective of using time pb ii removal of 98 were finished within 5 min that is the reactions between pb ii and sbacs were almost instantaneous compared with the pseudo first order model and the intra particle diffusion model weber morris model these fast kinetics were found to follow the pseudo second order model fig 2f and table s2 with the expression of t qt 1 k2 qe 2 t qe 32 38 44 here qe and qt are amounts of pb ii absorbed mg g at equilibrium and at time t min respectively k2 g mg min is the rate constant of the pseudo second order sorption as far as the reaction rates are concerned the rate constant k2 of sbac 6 is the highest indicating that the fastest pb ii adsorption followed by sbac 7 and sbac 5 which should be attributed the developed acidic groups especially the carboxyl groups in the sbac 6 table s1 illustrating the interaction of surface acidic functional groups with heavy metal ions during adsorption 27 45 3 3 adsorption mechanism analyses during pb ii adsorption by sbacs the metal analyses of the supernatants after adsorption were conducted the results showed that a significant release of ca ii occurs during the uptake of pb ii and amount of mg ii and al iii is insignificant that is the removal of pb ii from solution may involve metal exchange with ca ii and mg ii in addition to ion exchange coordination with surface hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups surface precipitation 12 19 etc to verify the mechanism of pb ii adsorption by sbacs with different using time the ft ir xps and pore structure parameters comparative analyses of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption were performed and the related ion release experiments were also conducted 3 3 1 ft ir analyses of the sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption as far as the ft ir spectra of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption are concerned the shifting of characteristic peaks is observed after pb ii adsorption especially carboxylates and oh groups fig 1b which revealed that they were involved in pb ii adsorption 32 for sbac 5 there is a shifting of the 1665 1565 cm 1 adsorption peak prior to pb ii adsorption indicating that it has been involved in the relevant chemical reactions in the bac process and the higher content of lactone groups in sbac 5 also verified this the characteristic peak of 1385 cm 1 appeared in all samples and there was no significant changes before and after pb ii adsorption which should be attributed to the adsorption peak of no3 28 and may be introduced by the water treatment process 3 3 2 element composition analyses of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption as indicated in table 1 as far as sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption are concerned the significant difference is that the o1 s and pb 4f contents of sbacs after pb ii adsorption respectively increased by 2 1 2 46 and 0 15 0 23 and the ca ii contents decreased by 0 06 0 31 no regular changes were observed for the contents of mg ii and al iii it can be concluded that the surface oxygen containing functional groups consistent with the results of ft ir analyses and the metals adsorbed on sbacs participate in the pb ii adsorption process the related literatures showed that the complexed alkaline earth metals such as ca mg in r o coo or o mineral oxides etc function groups can be released into the solution through exchange reaction 39 therefore the removal of pb ii from solution may involve coordination with surface hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups exchange with h and ca ii etc to verify the adsorption mechanism the contributions of different surface oxygen complex were given by xps peak41 soft and the related ions release experiments were also conducted 3 3 3 different surface oxygen complex contributions for pb ii adsorption before pb ii adsorption three main surface oxygen components coh or coc h oco and co groups were observed in the deconvoluted o 1s spectra of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 fig s2 among of them sbac 6 has the highest content of h oco groups which are consistent with the results of boehm s titration and also are the reasons of their highest removal efficiency and fastest reaction rate in adsorption experiments after pb ii adsorption the significant changes in the above peak areas were observed for all sbacs especially for h oco groups decreased by 38 2 11 09 and 7 14 for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 respectively while coc or coh groups respectively increased by 4 07 11 62 and 10 34 illustrating the interaction of acidic groups with heavy metal ions during the adsorption process 46 that is irrespective of using time the ion exchange and complexation with oxygen containing functional groups in sbacs should be the very important mechanism for pb ii adsorption by sbacs 14 27 45 3 3 4 ca ii mg ii and al iii release experiments pure ion exchange will occur at equimolar concentration i e the amount of adsorbed pb ii should be linear with the amount of desorbed ca ii mg ii and al iii ions to investigate the possible metal exchange reactions pb ii solutions with different initial concentrations were prepared 0 500 15 54 32 00 61 31 103 7 mg l pb ii adsorption experiments by sbacs and subsequent metal analyses of the supernatants were respectively conducted for above pb ii solutions the experiment results indicated that the adsorbed pb ii and the desorbed ca ii showed a good linear relationship the r2 values are respectively 0 9503 0 9697 and 0 9909 for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 fig s3 and no obvious proportional relationships were observed between the adsorbed pb ii and the desorbed mg ii and al iii the released ca ii should originate from the complexed surface functional groups such as r o me or r coo me where me represents the central metal atoms on the sbac surfaces 19 that is with the increase of running time of the bac process the ph of sbac gradually decreases the surface acidic functional groups on sbacs gradually increase and metal ions such as ca ii mg ii etc in the water are complexed during pb ii adsorption these complexes were dissociated due to the formation of more stable complexes containing pb ii 13 machida et al also reported the similar results by study the role of minerals in carbonaceous adsorbents for removal of pb ii ions from aqueous solution 47 it can be concluded that the adsorption of ca ii etc on sbacs should be one of the reasons for their slight ph fluctuations section 3 1 1 the results also showed that the linear slopes between the adsorbed pb ii and the desorbed ca ii were about 0 59 0 61 fig s3 indicating about 60 of pb ii are adsorbed by exchange with ca ii on the surface of sbacs since sbacs properties are different from virgin ac the adsorption process of metal ions is very complex and other possibilities such as precipitation etc cannot be ruled out in addition to ion exchange and complexation with oxygen containing functional groups 14 19 due to the acidic surface on the sbacs the co precipitation should play a minor role during the sorption process the pseudo second order kinetic model also confirmed their adsorption mechanism dominated by ion exchange which is commonly considered to reach equilibrium in few minutes therefore the role of the rate limited chemisorption involving inner sphere complexation and precipitation should be comparably tiny 19 44 thus pb ii adsorption primarily involved ion exchange h ca2 etc and metal complexation with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups especially ion exchange with ca ii which accounted for 60 3 3 5 pore size distribution of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption in order to know the effects of the pore structure of sbacs with different using time on the adsorption of pb ii n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were respectively conducted for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 before and after pb ii adsorption the results were given in table 2 in which the parameters of sbac 5 were cited from our previous study 14 as table 2 indicated although sbet vtotal vmic etc for all sbacs presented slightly downward trends with the increase of using time no obvious and regular changes were observed for their pore structure parameters before and after pb ii adsorption moreover compared with sbac 5 the changes before and after pb ii adsorption of sbac 6 and sbac 7 are more slight that is the pore structure parameters of sbacs have little effects on the adsorption of pb ii 3 4 analyses of influencing factors 3 4 1 effects of water temperature the effects of water temperature on pb ii adsorption were respectively investigated for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 at 10 c 15 c 20 c 25 c 30 c and 35 c the results were shown in fig 3 a as fig 3a indicated that the changes in water temperature have little effects on removal rates when the adsorbent dosage is sufficient 0 20 g l in terms of removal efficiencies sbac 6 is slightly better than sbac 5 and sbac 7 which should be attributed the developed acidic groups of on the surface sbac 6 table s1 to highlight the effects of water temperatures the adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted at 20 c and 25 c respectively and the results were shown in fig 3b the results indicated that the removal rates of all sbacs are slightly higher at 25 c than those of at 20 c under the lower dosages of sbacs however when the adsorption equilibrium was reached no significant changes were observed for the removal rates of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 it can be concluded that the higher temperature accelerated the rate of chemical reactions but as the time went by the adsorption equilibrium was achieved for each sbac sample 3 4 2 effects of ph it can be seen from fig 3c that when the solution ph at about 3 0 all sbacs had the lower removal rates for pb ii with the increase of ph from 4 0 to more than 9 0 the removal rates remained at 97 or more and no significant changes were observed for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 namely the lower solution ph will significantly affect the adsorption of pb ii which can be explained by the surface properties of sbacs as mentioned earlier the ph values in sbacs have dropped to 5 7 6 5 undoubtedly when the ph less than 4 0 the surfaces of sbacs are positively charged which will produce electrostatic repulsion for pb ii and also be not conducive to the ionization of the ion exchange functional groups carboxyl etc in the sbacs therefore leading to the significant decrease of the pb ii removal 48 49 as the solution phs increase the amount of negative charge on the sbacs surfaces also increase mainly via deprotonation of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups releasing of ca ii etc making more adsorption sites available for pb ii therefore higher removal rates were obtained grimm et al investigated cu ii binding with organic functional groups and also showed that most of the binding sites are occupied by protons at a low ph 2 5 but at a higher ph 4 5 most of the binding sites are occupied by cu ii because of decreased proton competition 48 in fact when equilibrium is reached the ph monitor in the solution during pb ii adsorption showed a slight increase in ph ph 7 0 or decrease ph 7 0 which ranges from 0 0 1 74 fig s4 the ph changes in the system should be attributed to the ion exchange interactions in the solution involving the release of ca ii etc as well as ion exchange reactions of carboxyl or hydroxyl groups in this study when the solution ph 7 0 despite the release of h ions and other metal ions the final ph value is slight higher than the initial ph due to the parallel release of hydroxyl ions by sbacs 50 the drop in ph when the solution ph 7 0 should be attributed to the a considerable acidity in the surface of sbacs which will neutralize the alkalinity in the water 45 3 4 3 effects of coexisting ions since ca ii and mg ii are widely present in source water the effects of coexisting ions ca ii and mg ii on pb ii adsorption was investigated cacl2 2h2o and mgcl2 2h2o tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd were used to prepare the coexisting ions solution 0 mg l 50 mg l 100 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l in which the equal amounts of ca ii and mg ii were added in each pb ii solution and then the adsorption experiments for the coexisting solutions were conducted and the results were shown in fig 3d as fig 3d indicated that compared to the absence of coexisting ions the removal rate of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 for pb ii decreased slightly by 5 8 with the increase of the coexisting ions from 0 to 200 mg l since a large amount of ca ii and mg ii are present in the main solution the releases of ca ii etc are suppressed which in turn leads to a decrease in the sites of active adsorption that is the slight decrease in removal rates should be attributed to the competition adsorption of pb ii ca ii and mg ii for the same active sites 24 like the effects of water temperature due to the developed surface carboxyl groups sbac 6 also presented a stronger competitive adsorption capacity than sbac 5 and sbac 7 3 5 application experiments in the river water the river water was directly sampled from the local campus and was firstly filtered through 0 22 μm to removal suspend solids and green algae and then was stored in a 4 c freezer before use and the water quality parameters were given in table s3 3 5 1 leaching tests of sbacs in river water it is well known that ac used in bac process is favored for its superior adsorption performance for the organic pollutants that is the leaching of organics adsorbed on sbacs may become an obstacle for their practical application therefore the leaching tests were respectively conducted for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 by measuring the changes of non purgeable organic carbon npoc by toc l cpn shimadzu co ltd in the river water containing 0 20 g l sbacs the leaching tests were also conducted according to the batch mode and lasted 22 h the results were shown in fig 4 a it can be seen from fig 4a that compared to the initial npoc in the river water 50 42 mg l no significant changes were observed for the npoc values of the river water with the increase of shaking time from 0 to 22 h namely there was no significant leaching of organics previously adsorbed on sbacs which is important for their direct reuse 3 5 2 application experiments in the river water containing pb ii as fig 4b indicated that compared to the removal rate in the pure water npoc 1 1 mg l although the removal rates of sbacs for pb ii in the real river water decreased the maximum removal rate still reached to 80 90 given the adsorption mechanism it can be concluded that the coexisting ions ca ii 32 45 mg l mg ii 44 85 mg l etc in the river partly affected the adsorption capacity of sbacs and other pollutants npoc 50 42 mg l in the real river may also have an adverse effect on the adsorption pb ii despite some effects sbacs still show good adsorption capacity for pb ii in actual water bodies undoubtedly the above results not only give a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time solid waste but also provide the theoretical and practical basis for the revision of cjt 345 2010 9 while making the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process 4 conclusions aiming to find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time solid waste sbacs with different using time 5 6 and 7 years were collected in a full scale bac water treatment plant their adsorption properties and mechanism for pb ii were comprehensively studied the results indicated that sbacs irrespective of using time presented a stable adsorption ability 99 for pb ii which primarily involved ion exchange and metal complexation with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups especially ion exchange with ca ii accounted for 60 of the total adsorbed pb ii water temperature 10 35 c ph 4 and coexisting ions have little effects on the removal of pb ii by sbacs almost no leaching of organics was observed for sbacs in the real river water application tests in the river water verified sbacs ability to remove pb ii from actual water 80 undoubtedly the above findings will find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time which not only prevent the production of large amounts of solid waste spent biological activated carbon sbac but also make the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13953,aiming at preventing the production of a large amount of solid wastes spent biological activated carbon sbac while increasing their efficiencies as resources this study was undertaken to explore the ability of sbacs with different lifespans to remove pb ii from water sbacs with different using time 5 6 and 7 years were collected in a full scale bac process designated sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 respectively although the content of metals ca ii etc adsorbed on sbacs increases with using time ft ir analyses confirmed the stability of surface functional groups on sbacs adsorption experiments showed that sbacs irrespective of using time presented stable adsorption abilities 99 for pb ii 2 0 8 0 mg l with the maximum uptake of 168 07 mg g their adsorption properties were changed from freundlich to langmuir model over time adsorption processes were pseudo second order kinetic and faster at a higher content of carboxyl groups as a dominant adsorption mechanism ion exchange with ca ii adsorbed on sbacs accounted for 60 of the total adsorbed pb ii water temperature ph and coexisting ions have little effects on the removal of pb ii for the organics previously adsorbed on sbacs almost no leaching was observed in the real river water and application experiments verified sbacs ability to remove pb ii from actual water 80 the findings will find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time which not only prevent the production of large amounts of solid waste spent biological activated carbon sbac but also make the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process keywords drinking water treatment spent biological activated carbon sbac surface oxygen containing functional groups metal exchange leaching 1 introduction china s standards for drinking water quality 1 promulgated in 2006 was planned to be fully implemented on july 1 2012 which accelerated the upgrading of the conventional water treatment plant among them membrane filtration and activated carbon ac adsorption technologies were the preferred advanced treatment technologies for drinking water 2 compared with the former due to the high surface area porous structure and developed functional group ac is used to remove a broad spectrum of impurities from water and has been the most popular and widely used adsorbent in water treatment field 3 5 especially in the biological activated carbon bac or o3 granular ac process the ac serves as a porous carrier material to which bacteria can attach and pollutants are removed by both adsorption and biodegradation 3 6 which has been proved to be one of the most promising water treatments technologies 7 since 2014 more than 20 of surface water plants in china have adopted the bac process 8 at that time in order to guide the selection of ac activated carbon from coal for drinking water treatment in municipal water plant cj t 345 2010 9 was developed in china which referred to current awwa and jwwa standards the bac process does play a crucial role in improving water quality in china and achieving the new drinking water standards 2 however with the increase of using time the ac adsorption capacity will gradually decrease to the point that the bac process no longer produces the desired effluent water quality when the spent activated biological carbon sbac will be regarded as a kind of solid waste and need be regenerated or disposed 10 every year billions of tons of solid wastes are produced by municipalities all over the world 11 such as us municipal solid waste msw production has climbed to more than 230 million milligrams usepa 2018 in 2015 therefore it is becoming increasingly important to reduce waste 12 in addition due to the scarcity and increasing exploitation of resources the prevention of waste as well as the reintroduction of the materials into the economic loop has been the strategies of waste management 13 now many water treatment plants in china are facing the problem of sbacs replacement or regeneration with the increase of using time undoubtedly sbacs rational use will reduce or avoid the continuous generation of large amounts of solid waste to explore the reuse potential of sbac ac used 5 years was sampled from a full scale bac water treatment plant in china facing the replace or regeneration the surface properties analyses and related adsorption testing indicated that the collected ac can remove heavy metals pb ii 14 undoubtedly the finding will provide a new idea for the reuse of sbacs due to the advantages of adsorption compared to other removal methods 15 16 however due to the improvement of the source water quality the effluent water quality of the selected water treatment plant can reach the standards of gb 5749 2006 again 1 therefore ac that once faced replacement or regeneration continued to be used in water treatment plants which brings uncertainty to its ability to remove heavy metals the present work was thus undertaken to explore the ability of sbacs with different lifespans to remove metals from water the sbac samples with different using time 5 6 and 7 years were collected in the same bac water treatment plant with our previous study 14 which were respectively designated sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 first the effects of using time on the surface properties of the sbacs were investigated including ph value the amount of surface acidic and basic functional groups ft ir and xps analyses of sbacs with different using time then taking pb ii as an example which has received the highest attention due to its ubiquitous and hazardous effects to human health 17 18 the adsorption experiments were respectively conducted for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 characterizations of sbacs indicated that not only the surface acidic functional groups increased but also metals adsorbed on sbacs especially ca mg and al increased over time that is different from the virgin ac sbacs are more like biochar with abundant organic functional groups and higher ashes 19 which have been frequently used to remove metals and consist of three main metal sorption mechanisms i ion exchange ii metal complexation with free functional groups together with physical adsorption and iii surface precipitation 19 in addition during the pb ii adsorption a certain amount of ca ii and mg ii were found to release from the sbacs therefore the removal of pb ii by sbacs from solution may involve exchange with h metal exchange with ca ii and mg ii coordination with surface hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and surface precipitation 14 etc to verify the adsorption mechanism of pb ii by sbacs with different using time the adsorption properties of sbacs with different using time for pb ii were comprehensively investigated including adsorption isotherm analyses kinetics models fittings and influencing factors analyses etc n2 adsorption desorption isotherm ft ir and xps comparative analyses of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption and the related ions release experiments were also respectively conducted to investigate their reuse potential in real water body the leaching and application experiments were performed using the local campus river undoubtedly the results will help to find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time and provide the theoretical and practical basis for the revise of cjt 345 2010 9 while making the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process 2 materials and methods 2 1 the collecting of sbac samples the selected full scale bac water treatment plant was the same one with our previous study 14 due to the improvement of source water quality the effluent water quality of the water treatment plant can meet the requirements of gb 5749 2006 again 1 so the sbac 5 was continued to be used in the bac process therefore with the increase of using time the sbac samples used 6 and 7 years sbac 6 and sbac 7 were luckily collected in the same bac process according to the methods specified in awwab 605 2013 10 the collected sbac samples were firstly stored in screw capped plastic bottles and were naturally dried before use 2 2 characterization of sbac samples nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were measured at 77 k for sbacs with a volumetric adsorption analyzer autosorb iq2 mp quantachrome and bet specific surface area micropore volume mesopore volume and total volume were respectively given according to the same methods with our previous study 14 the ph value of sbacs was measured based on astm standard test method 20 boehm s titration method was used to quantify the amount of acidic and basic functional groups on sbac s surfaces 21 all reagents used were of analytical grade the surface functional groups the elemental composition and chemical bonding state on the surfaces of the sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption were respectively determined using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectrometer spectrum 100 perkin elmer inc usa and an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250 spectrometer 6 22 2 3 analyses of adsorption properties of sbacs with different using time 2 3 1 batch adsorption experiments batch experiments to determine the pb ii removal efficiency were performed in 250 ml erlenmayer flasks according to astm standard methods 23 desired concentration of pb ii solutions used in the adsorption studies were prepared by appropriate dilutions in pure water of a stock pb no3 2 solution 1000 mg l tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd according to the objective of this study combined with drinking water quality standards water quality conditions and possible water pollution accidents the initial pb ii concentration was set to approximately 5 0 mg l pb ii and other metal ions concentrations in solution were measured by an icp oes icap 7400 thermo electron corporation usa these experiments were done in duplicate and the average values were reported 14 24 effects of the experimental parameters on the removal of pb ii by sbacs were also studied in a batch mode including adsorbent dosages 0 0 2 g l the initial pb ii concentration 2 0 8 0 mg l contact time 5 300 min temperature 20 35 c ph 2 0 9 0 and coexisting ions 0 200 mg l etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of using time on the surface properties of sbacs 3 1 1 ph value in this study the ph of the virgin ac is 11 14 while the ph of the sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 respectively lowered to 6 0 6 5 and 5 7 that is due to the complex physical chemical and biological process ozone oxidation adsorption and biodegradation during the bac process 14 25 especially the ozone oxidation the ph of sbacs will decrease with the increasing of using time until to about 6 and then no obvious changes were observed this should be attributed to the limited amount of surface functional groups on ac that can be oxidized under bac process conditions limited ozone dose among of them sbac 6 presented a slightly higher ph which should be caused by the varying conditions within the water treatment plant such as process upsets widely fluctuating influent water quality loadings of total organic carbon and also the makeup of granular ac 10 etc 3 1 2 the amount of surface functional groups on sbacs the amount of acidic and basic functional groups on sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 were given by boehm s titration see table s1 the results indicated that the contents of acidic groups carboxyl lactone and phenolic groups are higher than those of basic groups in all sbac samples which confirmed the results of the above ph values particularly sbac 6 has the highest content of carboxyl groups followed by sbac 7 and sbac 5 undoubtedly the above results implied their potential of removing heavy metal by chelating properties 26 27 3 1 3 ft ir analyses of the sbacs with different using time as fig 1 a indicated compared to virgin ac several new peaks appeared in sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 including around 1385 cm 1 due to the adsorption peak of no3 28 1665 1565 cm 1 due to the asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylates 29 1020 1300 cm 1 due to co vibration and 3200 3600 cm 1 due to free and hydrogen bonded oh groups 30 the new characteristic peaks should be attributed to the complex physical chemical and biological effects during bac water treatment 25 31 32 although the obvious changes occurred from virgin ac to sbac it can be seen that sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 showed the same characteristic peaks namely the surface functional groups on the sbacs showed stability over time 3 1 4 xps analyses of the sbacs with different using time xps measurements of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 were performed before and after pb ii adsorption using virgin ac as a control the results were summarized in table 1 which gave the elemental compositions of sbacs in atomic of carbon oxygen as well as the trace components 7 as table 1 indicated the oxygen contents increased by 7 03 10 32 in sbacs compared to virgin ac which reflected a significant increase in surface oxygen containing functional groups during the bac process in addition the impurity contents represented by ca mg al etc also significantly increased namely the content of metals adsorbed on ac grains increased over time andersson et al also reported the similar results 33 among them ca and mg should be derived from the water to be treated and may be retained through electrostatic effect inner sphere complex with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups as well as precipitation 19 and al should be introduced by the flocculants other than those no other harmful impurities were detected 3 2 effects of using time on the adsorption properties of the sbacs for pb ii 3 2 1 adsorption ability of the sbacs with different using time it can be observed from fig 2 a that sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 showed the similar adsorption ability for pb ii the equilibrium concentration of pb ii gradually decreased with the increase of sbacs dosages due to the interaction between pb ii and free binding sites available on the surface of sbacs when the dosages of sbacs reached to 0 10 g l all sbacs already reached the adsorption equilibrium with the maximum removal rates of more than 99 0 fig 2b showed the effects of initial pb ii concentration on the removal of pb ii by sbacs with different using time although the equilibrium concentrations showed a slightly upward trend with the increase in the initial concentrations from 2 45 to 8 08 mg l all sbacs irrespective of using time showed the removal rate of more than 99 for pb ii at low carbon dosing 0 20 g l and maintained the equilibrium concentrations of less than 0 05 mg l among them sbac 6 performed best and the equilibrium concentrations of pb ii were less than 0 01 mg l which reached the requirement of who guidelines for drinking water quality that is although doc removal efficiency in the service life of a bac will gradually decrease with the increase of using time the bac process imparted the sbac a stable capability to remove heavy metals which can be explained by the stability of surface functional groups on sbacs over time undoubtedly the above findings will help to find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs solid waste irrespective using time namely they became a new kind of materials removing heavy metals from the water which is in line with the characteristics of circular economy and sustainable water management 34 35 3 2 2 adsorption isotherm analyses to fit these data langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models were adopted which are expressed as qe qmbce 1 bce qe kfce 1 n and ln qe ln qs kad rtln 1 1 ce 2 respectively 36 38 here ce is the equilibrium concentration of pb ii mg l qmis the maximum adsorption capacity mg g b l mg kf mg g l mg 1 n n unitless are adsorption constants indicating the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity kad is the adsorption equilibrium constant qs is the theoretical saturation capacity mg g t is absolute temperature k and r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k the fitting results were shown in figs 2 and the corresponding parameters were summarized and listed in table s2 the fitting results indicated that the adsorption isotherm properties of sbacs on pb ii showed significantly changes compared with langmiur and dubinin radushkevich models the adsorption isotherm of sbac 5 is more in line with freundlich model figs 2c d s1 and table s2 which is consistent with our previous study 14 however as far as sbac 6 and sbac 7 are concerned langmiur models are superior to freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models that is sbac s adsorption properties were changed from freundlich to langmuir model see fig 2c d and table s2 r2 increased from 0 826 to 0 987 with the increase of using time it is well known that langmuir model describes monolayer adsorption on a homogenous surface 39 therefore it can be inferred that the adsorption sites were gradually dispersed uniformly on the surface of sbacs with the increase of running time and pb ii was adsorbed as a monolayer on the sbacs surface given the maximum metal uptake sbac 5 is the largest at 168 07 mg g table s2 which is difficult to achieve by most adsorbents 12 40 43 such as nano hematite bagasse composite n hbc 16 57 mg g 40 bentonite enriched with sh groups 22 06 mg g 41 a novel magnetic nanoparticles 129 65 mg g 42 and a new biosorbent 13 65 mg g 43 etc in terms of the adsorption capacity indicated by kf and the theorytical saturation capacity indicated by qs both of them showed stabilities over time sbac 6 is slightly better than sbac 5 and sbac 7 which should be attributed to the developed acidic groups especially the carboxyl groups in the sbac 6 3 2 3 adsorption kinetic properties as fig 2e indicated the adsorption of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 on pb ii showed the same kinetics properties irrespective of using time pb ii removal of 98 were finished within 5 min that is the reactions between pb ii and sbacs were almost instantaneous compared with the pseudo first order model and the intra particle diffusion model weber morris model these fast kinetics were found to follow the pseudo second order model fig 2f and table s2 with the expression of t qt 1 k2 qe 2 t qe 32 38 44 here qe and qt are amounts of pb ii absorbed mg g at equilibrium and at time t min respectively k2 g mg min is the rate constant of the pseudo second order sorption as far as the reaction rates are concerned the rate constant k2 of sbac 6 is the highest indicating that the fastest pb ii adsorption followed by sbac 7 and sbac 5 which should be attributed the developed acidic groups especially the carboxyl groups in the sbac 6 table s1 illustrating the interaction of surface acidic functional groups with heavy metal ions during adsorption 27 45 3 3 adsorption mechanism analyses during pb ii adsorption by sbacs the metal analyses of the supernatants after adsorption were conducted the results showed that a significant release of ca ii occurs during the uptake of pb ii and amount of mg ii and al iii is insignificant that is the removal of pb ii from solution may involve metal exchange with ca ii and mg ii in addition to ion exchange coordination with surface hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups surface precipitation 12 19 etc to verify the mechanism of pb ii adsorption by sbacs with different using time the ft ir xps and pore structure parameters comparative analyses of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption were performed and the related ion release experiments were also conducted 3 3 1 ft ir analyses of the sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption as far as the ft ir spectra of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption are concerned the shifting of characteristic peaks is observed after pb ii adsorption especially carboxylates and oh groups fig 1b which revealed that they were involved in pb ii adsorption 32 for sbac 5 there is a shifting of the 1665 1565 cm 1 adsorption peak prior to pb ii adsorption indicating that it has been involved in the relevant chemical reactions in the bac process and the higher content of lactone groups in sbac 5 also verified this the characteristic peak of 1385 cm 1 appeared in all samples and there was no significant changes before and after pb ii adsorption which should be attributed to the adsorption peak of no3 28 and may be introduced by the water treatment process 3 3 2 element composition analyses of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption as indicated in table 1 as far as sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption are concerned the significant difference is that the o1 s and pb 4f contents of sbacs after pb ii adsorption respectively increased by 2 1 2 46 and 0 15 0 23 and the ca ii contents decreased by 0 06 0 31 no regular changes were observed for the contents of mg ii and al iii it can be concluded that the surface oxygen containing functional groups consistent with the results of ft ir analyses and the metals adsorbed on sbacs participate in the pb ii adsorption process the related literatures showed that the complexed alkaline earth metals such as ca mg in r o coo or o mineral oxides etc function groups can be released into the solution through exchange reaction 39 therefore the removal of pb ii from solution may involve coordination with surface hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups exchange with h and ca ii etc to verify the adsorption mechanism the contributions of different surface oxygen complex were given by xps peak41 soft and the related ions release experiments were also conducted 3 3 3 different surface oxygen complex contributions for pb ii adsorption before pb ii adsorption three main surface oxygen components coh or coc h oco and co groups were observed in the deconvoluted o 1s spectra of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 fig s2 among of them sbac 6 has the highest content of h oco groups which are consistent with the results of boehm s titration and also are the reasons of their highest removal efficiency and fastest reaction rate in adsorption experiments after pb ii adsorption the significant changes in the above peak areas were observed for all sbacs especially for h oco groups decreased by 38 2 11 09 and 7 14 for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 respectively while coc or coh groups respectively increased by 4 07 11 62 and 10 34 illustrating the interaction of acidic groups with heavy metal ions during the adsorption process 46 that is irrespective of using time the ion exchange and complexation with oxygen containing functional groups in sbacs should be the very important mechanism for pb ii adsorption by sbacs 14 27 45 3 3 4 ca ii mg ii and al iii release experiments pure ion exchange will occur at equimolar concentration i e the amount of adsorbed pb ii should be linear with the amount of desorbed ca ii mg ii and al iii ions to investigate the possible metal exchange reactions pb ii solutions with different initial concentrations were prepared 0 500 15 54 32 00 61 31 103 7 mg l pb ii adsorption experiments by sbacs and subsequent metal analyses of the supernatants were respectively conducted for above pb ii solutions the experiment results indicated that the adsorbed pb ii and the desorbed ca ii showed a good linear relationship the r2 values are respectively 0 9503 0 9697 and 0 9909 for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 fig s3 and no obvious proportional relationships were observed between the adsorbed pb ii and the desorbed mg ii and al iii the released ca ii should originate from the complexed surface functional groups such as r o me or r coo me where me represents the central metal atoms on the sbac surfaces 19 that is with the increase of running time of the bac process the ph of sbac gradually decreases the surface acidic functional groups on sbacs gradually increase and metal ions such as ca ii mg ii etc in the water are complexed during pb ii adsorption these complexes were dissociated due to the formation of more stable complexes containing pb ii 13 machida et al also reported the similar results by study the role of minerals in carbonaceous adsorbents for removal of pb ii ions from aqueous solution 47 it can be concluded that the adsorption of ca ii etc on sbacs should be one of the reasons for their slight ph fluctuations section 3 1 1 the results also showed that the linear slopes between the adsorbed pb ii and the desorbed ca ii were about 0 59 0 61 fig s3 indicating about 60 of pb ii are adsorbed by exchange with ca ii on the surface of sbacs since sbacs properties are different from virgin ac the adsorption process of metal ions is very complex and other possibilities such as precipitation etc cannot be ruled out in addition to ion exchange and complexation with oxygen containing functional groups 14 19 due to the acidic surface on the sbacs the co precipitation should play a minor role during the sorption process the pseudo second order kinetic model also confirmed their adsorption mechanism dominated by ion exchange which is commonly considered to reach equilibrium in few minutes therefore the role of the rate limited chemisorption involving inner sphere complexation and precipitation should be comparably tiny 19 44 thus pb ii adsorption primarily involved ion exchange h ca2 etc and metal complexation with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups especially ion exchange with ca ii which accounted for 60 3 3 5 pore size distribution of sbacs before and after pb ii adsorption in order to know the effects of the pore structure of sbacs with different using time on the adsorption of pb ii n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were respectively conducted for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 before and after pb ii adsorption the results were given in table 2 in which the parameters of sbac 5 were cited from our previous study 14 as table 2 indicated although sbet vtotal vmic etc for all sbacs presented slightly downward trends with the increase of using time no obvious and regular changes were observed for their pore structure parameters before and after pb ii adsorption moreover compared with sbac 5 the changes before and after pb ii adsorption of sbac 6 and sbac 7 are more slight that is the pore structure parameters of sbacs have little effects on the adsorption of pb ii 3 4 analyses of influencing factors 3 4 1 effects of water temperature the effects of water temperature on pb ii adsorption were respectively investigated for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 at 10 c 15 c 20 c 25 c 30 c and 35 c the results were shown in fig 3 a as fig 3a indicated that the changes in water temperature have little effects on removal rates when the adsorbent dosage is sufficient 0 20 g l in terms of removal efficiencies sbac 6 is slightly better than sbac 5 and sbac 7 which should be attributed the developed acidic groups of on the surface sbac 6 table s1 to highlight the effects of water temperatures the adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted at 20 c and 25 c respectively and the results were shown in fig 3b the results indicated that the removal rates of all sbacs are slightly higher at 25 c than those of at 20 c under the lower dosages of sbacs however when the adsorption equilibrium was reached no significant changes were observed for the removal rates of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 it can be concluded that the higher temperature accelerated the rate of chemical reactions but as the time went by the adsorption equilibrium was achieved for each sbac sample 3 4 2 effects of ph it can be seen from fig 3c that when the solution ph at about 3 0 all sbacs had the lower removal rates for pb ii with the increase of ph from 4 0 to more than 9 0 the removal rates remained at 97 or more and no significant changes were observed for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 namely the lower solution ph will significantly affect the adsorption of pb ii which can be explained by the surface properties of sbacs as mentioned earlier the ph values in sbacs have dropped to 5 7 6 5 undoubtedly when the ph less than 4 0 the surfaces of sbacs are positively charged which will produce electrostatic repulsion for pb ii and also be not conducive to the ionization of the ion exchange functional groups carboxyl etc in the sbacs therefore leading to the significant decrease of the pb ii removal 48 49 as the solution phs increase the amount of negative charge on the sbacs surfaces also increase mainly via deprotonation of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups releasing of ca ii etc making more adsorption sites available for pb ii therefore higher removal rates were obtained grimm et al investigated cu ii binding with organic functional groups and also showed that most of the binding sites are occupied by protons at a low ph 2 5 but at a higher ph 4 5 most of the binding sites are occupied by cu ii because of decreased proton competition 48 in fact when equilibrium is reached the ph monitor in the solution during pb ii adsorption showed a slight increase in ph ph 7 0 or decrease ph 7 0 which ranges from 0 0 1 74 fig s4 the ph changes in the system should be attributed to the ion exchange interactions in the solution involving the release of ca ii etc as well as ion exchange reactions of carboxyl or hydroxyl groups in this study when the solution ph 7 0 despite the release of h ions and other metal ions the final ph value is slight higher than the initial ph due to the parallel release of hydroxyl ions by sbacs 50 the drop in ph when the solution ph 7 0 should be attributed to the a considerable acidity in the surface of sbacs which will neutralize the alkalinity in the water 45 3 4 3 effects of coexisting ions since ca ii and mg ii are widely present in source water the effects of coexisting ions ca ii and mg ii on pb ii adsorption was investigated cacl2 2h2o and mgcl2 2h2o tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd were used to prepare the coexisting ions solution 0 mg l 50 mg l 100 mg l 150 mg l and 200 mg l in which the equal amounts of ca ii and mg ii were added in each pb ii solution and then the adsorption experiments for the coexisting solutions were conducted and the results were shown in fig 3d as fig 3d indicated that compared to the absence of coexisting ions the removal rate of sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 for pb ii decreased slightly by 5 8 with the increase of the coexisting ions from 0 to 200 mg l since a large amount of ca ii and mg ii are present in the main solution the releases of ca ii etc are suppressed which in turn leads to a decrease in the sites of active adsorption that is the slight decrease in removal rates should be attributed to the competition adsorption of pb ii ca ii and mg ii for the same active sites 24 like the effects of water temperature due to the developed surface carboxyl groups sbac 6 also presented a stronger competitive adsorption capacity than sbac 5 and sbac 7 3 5 application experiments in the river water the river water was directly sampled from the local campus and was firstly filtered through 0 22 μm to removal suspend solids and green algae and then was stored in a 4 c freezer before use and the water quality parameters were given in table s3 3 5 1 leaching tests of sbacs in river water it is well known that ac used in bac process is favored for its superior adsorption performance for the organic pollutants that is the leaching of organics adsorbed on sbacs may become an obstacle for their practical application therefore the leaching tests were respectively conducted for sbac 5 sbac 6 and sbac 7 by measuring the changes of non purgeable organic carbon npoc by toc l cpn shimadzu co ltd in the river water containing 0 20 g l sbacs the leaching tests were also conducted according to the batch mode and lasted 22 h the results were shown in fig 4 a it can be seen from fig 4a that compared to the initial npoc in the river water 50 42 mg l no significant changes were observed for the npoc values of the river water with the increase of shaking time from 0 to 22 h namely there was no significant leaching of organics previously adsorbed on sbacs which is important for their direct reuse 3 5 2 application experiments in the river water containing pb ii as fig 4b indicated that compared to the removal rate in the pure water npoc 1 1 mg l although the removal rates of sbacs for pb ii in the real river water decreased the maximum removal rate still reached to 80 90 given the adsorption mechanism it can be concluded that the coexisting ions ca ii 32 45 mg l mg ii 44 85 mg l etc in the river partly affected the adsorption capacity of sbacs and other pollutants npoc 50 42 mg l in the real river may also have an adverse effect on the adsorption pb ii despite some effects sbacs still show good adsorption capacity for pb ii in actual water bodies undoubtedly the above results not only give a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time solid waste but also provide the theoretical and practical basis for the revision of cjt 345 2010 9 while making the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process 4 conclusions aiming to find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time solid waste sbacs with different using time 5 6 and 7 years were collected in a full scale bac water treatment plant their adsorption properties and mechanism for pb ii were comprehensively studied the results indicated that sbacs irrespective of using time presented a stable adsorption ability 99 for pb ii which primarily involved ion exchange and metal complexation with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups especially ion exchange with ca ii accounted for 60 of the total adsorbed pb ii water temperature 10 35 c ph 4 and coexisting ions have little effects on the removal of pb ii by sbacs almost no leaching of organics was observed for sbacs in the real river water application tests in the river water verified sbacs ability to remove pb ii from actual water 80 undoubtedly the above findings will find a sustainable way out for a large amount of sbacs with different using time which not only prevent the production of large amounts of solid waste spent biological activated carbon sbac but also make the bac process a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

these results are shown in fig 1 a d in this case obtained for several crystals resolved peaks appeared in 17 7 29 5 32 08 33 3 36 48 38 2 41 08 45 4 and 52 51 which can be assigned to 221 444 440 226 713 638 848 311 and 884 planes it s one of the tetragonal and monoclinic mixed phase crystal systems of cuo sno2 cusno3 nanoparticles and well matched for the jcpds nos 01 5842 20 6471 meanwhile all diffraction patterns are no change in the relative intensities compared to the other materials ox it ci and cr acids mediated cusno3 the ox it ci and cr cusno3 nanoparticles were well matched to the space group fd 3 m 227 and crystal system as investigated 4 2 morphological studies fig 2 a p shows the fe sem image of synthesized different acid mediated cusno3 nanoparticles ox cusno3 nanoparticles were shown in fig 2 a d and observed morphology seem to the karaiyan poochi nest like shape with a size distribution range at 2 μm particles were found to have edges broken thus revealing to the core of the structure fig 2 e h indicate cusno3 nanoparticles it and it s occurred as spherical like morphology with a un uniform size distribution of the nanoparticles and wide ranging up to 2 μm the spherical structure of nanoparticles is to develop above on nanosheets of cusno3 nanoparticles the various compounds present in the organic molecules could be responsible for the formation of spherical nanoparticles and other shapes fig 2 i l explains to the porous like the formation of ci cusno3 nanoparticles these images reveal the precisely porous material with diameter range is up to 1 μm finally the previous morphologies were changed in cr cusno3 nanoparticles than the reason is another complexation formation of metal precursors fig 2 m p and obtained flower like morphology with diameter ranges from 100 nm to 2 μm the main advantages of these materials morphologies are different but there is no change in the crystal structure therefore it s going for a convenient way for the synthesis of this material using acids in the investigations fig 3 a b shows ox it ci and cr cusno3 nanoparticles elements were confirmed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy three main characteristic peaks appeared and obtained 31 42 of oxygen 16 68 of cu 51 9 of tin elements were investigated respectively fig 4 a d shows birds wing like morphological structure of cr cusno3 nanoparticles and observed diameter ranges at 100 to 20 nm 4 3 drs uv visible spectroscopy diffuse reflectance ultraviolet visible spectroscopy drs uv was performed to analyze the synthesized ox it ci and cr cusno3 materials fig 5 a a d shows the drs uv vis spectrum of different acid mediated cusno3 nanoparticles with absorption edges at 376 466 and 496 nm respectively the bandgap energy was calculated by the kubelka munk function fig 5b a d shows that a diffuse reflectance spectrum of the different acid mediated copper stannate nanoparticles with systematic band gaps was observed the evaluated optical band gap energy was 2 1 2 2 2 2 and 2 3 ev the cr cusno3 material is having low values of bandgap energy when compared to the other samples of it ci and ox cusno3 nanoparticles therefore these nanoparticles were able to enhance the effectiveness of the photocatalytic activity 4 4 raman spectroscopy studies raman spectra of synthesized acids mediated cusno3 nanoparticles are shown in fig 5c a d this figure explains the several intense modes at 492 1070 1473 and 2444 cm 1 which can be assigned for different functional groups with vibration modes peak 491 cm 1 can be assigned o m o cu or sn bending and stretching vibration of f1u modes band at 605 cm 1 normal a1g vibration modes of the tetragonal rutile structure of sn o groups 56 these results were very clearly showing and nearby ft ir functional groups region of the synthesized material was more favorable for another part of characterization and applications 4 5 ft ir spectroscopy studies the ft ir spectroscopy was used for the identification of functional groups as shown in fig 5d a d the synthesized samples obtain several remarkable peaks within the ranges up to 4000 cm 1 the bands at 3448 cm 1 and 1434 cm 1 could be indicating the involvement of the oh stretching vibrations of surface absorbed water molecules furthermore the bands at 679 and 475 cm 1 are due to the formation of symmetrical and anti symmetrical stretching vibration of m o m sn o sn groups and cu o m o stretching vibration of different acid mediated cusno3 nanoparticles 57 these results are well matched for raman spectroscopy results because of material confirmation are satisfied 4 6 tg dta studies fig 5e a d shows in three decomposition weight losses involved in the tga analysis in the first there was no weight loss of ox it cin and cr cusno3 material while temperature increasing the water molecules comes out from 50 110 c remaining three weight loss peaks were appearing the next stage of weight loss is organic solvent content removed at 110 180 c and another one peaks are organic moieties removing to the stage at 300 400 c especially carbon containing groups finally the bimetallic phase was decomposed to the metal oxide single phase was shown in the 550 c final stage of loss 5 photocatalytic activity mb was chosen as the model organic pollutant to estimate the degradation performance using synthesized cusno3 nanomaterials the different acid mediated cusno3 nanoparticles were stirred in the dark medium for about 10 min to attain absorption desorption equilibrium the catalyst was fully reacted with organic dye with the degradation total time duration also monitored under the visible light illumination si fig 1 4 a shows that the absorption maximum range at λ 664 nm after this exposure the degrading suspension was collected with a recorded uv vis spectrophotometer si fig 1 4 b shows that c co represents to the time dependent concentration of methylene blue dye degradation initially a blank test exhibits lower photo degradation efficiency was obtained in the absence of an ox it cin and cr cusno3 as catalyst under visible light irradiation the dye concentration was decreased in the presence of the catalyst consequentially the efficacy of testing dye degradation was degraded completely within the 45 40 40 and 35 min si fig 1 4 d the kinetic plot was derived from these equation ln c co vs time the first order linear fit was determined the observed r2 value at 0 987 0 976 0 992 and 0 997 min 1 the ox it cin and cr cusno3 catalyst was monitoring and observed with a range up to 82 1 85 8 85 4 and 82 of degradation with different time intervals were shown in si fig 1 4 c the cr cusno3 catalyst was a high photocatalytic activity compared with ci it ox cusno3 material the reason for this mechanism involved due to electron holes are created for methylene blue dye with catalyst and this schematic representation of dye degradation mechanism was a detailed description in fig 6 the synthesized all samples were shown an enhanced level of photocatalytic activity the cr cusno3 nanoparticles are determined to the high degradation efficiency than other materials are due to the low energy band 59 78 these obtained photocatalytic study results are compared with other reported materials and its shown in table 1 6 recyclability studies recyclability and stability are the main criteria for the photocatalytic activity and the cr cusno3 material was investigated by four cycles fig 7 a the catalyst in the presence of methylene blue dye solution was tested this was repeated to four times with collected residue was dried after characterized by xrd ft ir studies fig 7 b shows the x ray diffraction patterns of recycle cr cusno3 material this material was confirmed by jcpds card no 01 1195 10 0022 85 86 the monoclinic and tetragonal mixed phase of the crystal systems were identified and observed several intense peaks at 18 3 30 0 33 8 35 7 38 9 51 8 57 7 and 61 9 which corresponds 001 001 110 002 111 021 121 and 113 plans here these recycle material confirmation was slightly different and disordering peaks and it s was convenient with satisfied with the stability therefore we are collected to the other tests like ft ir spectroscopy fig 7 c and this material functional group was investigated the identified peaks at 462 767 and 849 cm 1 which reveals to that m o m cu o sn and m o cu sn o groups based on all collected results that are well matching to the non recyclable material than we are proposed materials are good stability and marvelous photocatalytic performance 7 antibacterial activity the four bacteria including gram positive and gram negative bacteria were tested in this study with the help of four different material types among four acid ox it ci and cr cusno3 mediated synthesis nanoparticles only three nanoparticles ox it ci cusno3 shows effective inhibition of bacterial growth only against bacillus

1 and 1434 cm 1 could be indicating the involvement of the oh stretching vibrations of surface absorbed water molecules furthermore the bands at 679 and 475 cm 1 are due to the formation of symmetrical and anti symmetrical stretching vibration of m o m sn o sn groups and cu o m o stretching vibration of different acid mediated cusno3 nanoparticles 57 these results are well matched for

initially a blank test exhibits lower photo degradation efficiency was obtained in the absence of an ox it cin and cr cusno3 as catalyst under visible light irradiation the dye concentration was decreased in the presence of the catalyst consequentially the efficacy of testing dye degradation was degraded completely within the 45 40 40 and 35 min si fig 1 4 d the kinetic plot was derived from

material the reason for this mechanism involved due to electron holes are created for methylene blue dye with catalyst and this schematic representation of dye degradation mechanism was a detailed description in fig 6 the synthesized all samples were shown an enhanced level of photocatalytic activity the cr cusno3 nanoparticles are determined to the high degradation efficiency than other materials are due to the low energy band 59 78 these obtained photocatalytic study results are compared with other reported materials and its shown in table 1 6 recyclability studies recyclability and
