5740,season ahead hydrologic forecasts hold the potential to inform water user decision making provided forecast information offers value to targeted end users particularly in water scarce regions yet user willingness to trust forecast information is uncertain and often varied across similar user groups here forecast uptake by agriculture users in semi arid water rights managed basins is modelled to account for heterogeneous risk attitude and hydrologic variability a season ahead forecast of reservoir inflow is translated to water trading rulesets through coupled reservoir allocation i e per water right allocation from the reservoir crop water economic optimization and demand derivation models theoretical growers aligned in crop type cooperatives are modelled as potential exclusive water trading partners that in years of scarcity may choose between forecast informed water trading via option contracts or one of two alternative water trade actions persistence forecast informed trading or no trading simulations across varied initial water rights endowment and farmer risk attitude allows for evaluation of expected investment of water rights in forecast informed water trade results indicate farmer willingness to trust forecast information and subsequently invest rights option contracts trade is variable 28 70 and dependent on initial endowment of rights and alternative water trade action manifested here as persistence informed trade and no trade alternative while variable investment outcomes for probabilistic hydrologic simulations reveal long term trade stability under nearly every forecast informed water trading simulation suggesting options contracts may be viable under a variety of water scarcity conditions a key insight is that seasonal climate forecasts may prove to be quite valuable when translated through sectoral models providing the tailored information to end users with diverse risk attitudes this reinforces the potential in including forecasts in agricultural water resources decision support frameworks as a hedge against water scarcity for farmers of varied earning potential keywords risk attitude option contracts forecast water rights water markets water trade agent based scarcity 1 introduction water option contracts ocs have been implemented as a market based approach to drought mitigation and transaction cost reduction for agricultural producers brown and carriquiry 2007 wheeler et al 2013 vicuña et al 2018 ocs provide a hedge against future market uncertainty allowing prospective sellers and buyers to negotiate price and quantity terms for a good which is valid at a later date as a financial instrument the value of ocs is clear when the contract quantity or allocation of water can be guaranteed by the seller however in many regions allocations provided to water rights holders are uncertain and based on water availability i e reservoir storage as such ocs have been deemed infeasible and are not implemented vicuña et al 2011 vicuña et al 2018 where season ahead forecasts of allocation can be produced with consistent skill it is possible to couple forecasts with financial instruments including ocs roncoli et al 2009 block 2011 delorit and block 2018 likely benefactors of forecast informed ocs including farmers who make investment decisions ahead of planting must determine whether forecast information holds sufficient value before they will integrate it in their decision making rey et al 2016 vicuña et al 2018 assessing forecast option value is complex and should account for variability in both hydrology and target end user group behavior i e willingness to trust forecast information with respect to hydrologic variability prospective users of forecast informed ocs are most likely to value products which are robust to many possible hydrologic conditions including prolonged and disconnected drought scenarios herman et al 2015 brown and carriquiry 2007 adamson et al 2017 herman et al 2016 zeff et al 2014 soares et al 2018 resampling bootstrap and other statistical hydrologic simulation techniques have been used extensively to create ensembles of synthetic timeseries with which the efficacy of ocs and other interventions may be assessed second option value does not accrue uniformly across water users willingness to trust forecast information is tied to farmer economic profitability i e crop choice and risk attitude and therefore option value is variable both within and across sectoral water uses binswanger 1980 ziervogel 2004 tanaka et al 2006 tanaka et al 2010 de brauw and eozenou 2014 lastly the option value of forecast information is variable to the benchmarks against which it is compared murphy 1992 mason and stephenson 2008 pappenberger et al 2015 season ahead allocation forecasts applied to ocs must therefore be compared to relevant alternative water transfer strategies and climate forecast information farmers may use in unison to cope with allocation uncertainty hansen et al 2006 rey et al 2016 an assessment of the option value of forecast informed ocs should test the robustness of its performance to these relevant aspects to determine how and to what extent farmers may implement forecast informed water decision making through time this type of analysis may provide insight to policymakers and those tasked with developing forecast based financial instruments mortensen and block 2018 studies which assess farmer risk attitudes and willingness to adopt forecast informed decision making generally take either theoretical economic or applied behavioral science and economic approaches theoretical approaches for eliciting farmer risk attitudes are rooted in choice economic theory and use expected utility or direct elicitation of utility functions bard and barry 2001 rey et al 2016 adamson et al 2017 dozier et al 2017 kosovac et al 2017 these are often criticized as abstracting from realistic conditions particularly with respect to accurate measurement and alignment of utility functions with observations or assumed often homogenously risk averse and downside prudent farmer risk attitude carpentier et al 2015 ward and singh 2015 gómez limón et al 2016 further very few theoretical economic studies apply season ahead forecasts and instead use historical hydrologic conditions when forward looking these studies rely on projections of decadal to multi decadal hydrologic trends to evaluate models while ignoring the impacts of interannual hydrologic variability calatrava and garrido 2005 kasprzyk et al 2012 molinos senante et al 2016 in this way they are limited in their application to farmers as planting decisions may change year to year based on expected hydrologic and market crop and production inputs conditions opposingly applied approaches use field experiments which generally rely on farmer response to surveys roe 2003 bougherara and gassmann 2011 de brauw and eozenou 2014 in contrast to theoretical approaches applied approaches find that farmer communities possess a spectrum of risk attitudes variable across region type of agriculture and production goal roe 2003 ziervogel et al 2005 qasim 2012 kosovac et al 2017 typically farmer populations are categorized in groups by risk attitude e g high medium low unlike theoretical approaches some applied studies address facets of farmer willingness to accept hydrologic forecasts at the seasonal scale ziervogel 2004 ziervogel et al 2005 bharwani et al 2005 wossen et al 2015 berger et al 2017 these studies investigate uptake at forecast skill thresholds and seek to understand farmer farmer interactions and forecast perception these studies are beneficial in that they address heterogeneous farmer risk attitude by establishing sub groups based on risk tolerance but are limited in terms of their broader applicability they are predominantly set in developing countries lesotho for ziervogel et al 2005 limpopo south africa for bharwani et al 2005 ghana for wossen et al 2015 ethiopia for berger et al 2017 assess mainly rainfed agriculture and are tailored to small share subsistence farming and do not explicitly address the potential for mutually beneficial interaction between farmers as water trade partners the gap present in the applied approaches is how seasonal forecasts can be translated and implemented in large scale irrigated agriculture in developed countries which is an important and growing contributor to global food production siebert et al 2005 assouline et al 2015 food and agriculture organization fao 2016 in many cases irrigated agriculture is required due to a mismatch between the growing season and peak precipitation timing delorit et al 2019 where seasonal mismatches occur often strong water law emerges in these regions sustainable surface and groundwater resource management is sought while provisions for fair access to water for economic use are made e g agricultural production bjornlund and mckay 2002 townsend and adams 2016 wheeler et al 2013 water law establishes surface water rights as limited access permits to some fixed or variable quantity water getches et al 2015 some water law and accompanying water rights systems are based on free market economic approaches which allow rights to be transferred between users endo et al 2018 although water law varies by region the economic basis of water law types with tradeable rights are anchored by the coase theorem freebairn and quiggin 2006 chikozho and kujinga 2017 hasselman and stoker 2017 this approach suggests that through trading of water rights temporary or permanent water will be put to its best economic use coase 1937 ruml 2005 where tradeable water rights are predominantly engaged in irrigated agriculture forecasts may be tailored such that they are attractive to water rights holders and may be implemented without significant institutional change i e fundamental shifts in water law as land dedicated to irrigated agriculture continues to become a relevant piece of the global agricultural tapestry investigating methods to implement robust forecast informed decision making to promote economic water use efficiency and bolster production in the face of hydrologic uncertainty will be necessary assouline et al 2015 the work presented here addresses the need to model hydrologically and risk robust forecast informed decision making in irrigated agriculture by utilizing beneficial components of both theoretical and applied approaches to risk it applies a three tiered heterogeneous risk attitude construct to theoretical high hv and low value lv farmers who consider formation of crop type cooperatives that may engage in exclusive water trade under varied hydrologic conditions the cooperatives are presented forecast informed ocs as an alternative to persistence informed oc water trade or no trading approach delorit and block 2019 the framework presented here is evaluated retrospectively 2000 2015 in the agriculture dominated elqui valley of north central chile the framework is suitable for broader application given that the water law and management of chile is based on a free market economic approach shared by other countries rieu clarke et al 2017 borgias and bauer 2017 endo et al 2018 perform an analysis of global water law and conclude that up to 58 countries including chile have shared legal and economic attributes necessary to promote efficient sustainable water markets here only details essential to calibrating the framework are presented readers interested in additional detail on the case study are directed to delorit et al 2019 and delorit and block 2019 in the elqui valley agricultural water users hold roughly 90 percent of the 25 000 fully allocated water rights assigned to the basin the chilean water code of 1981 wc stipulates that each water right is equivalently valued and does not exceed a 1 0 l per second average annually however it is possible that during the growing season allocation may exceed 1 0 l per second on september 1st the privately held water resources management firm is tasked with setting the annual per water right allocation value its decision is based largely on existing storage in a central reservoir and a mixed qualitative quantitative assessment of expected reservoir inflow delorit et al 2017 if storage and inflow are not sufficient to provide full 1 0 l per second allocations each water right is curtailed proportionately coupled uncertainty in the allocation value and the date at which the annual per right allocation value is set are present challenges for farmers in the elqui 2 materials methods and calculation this work provides a novel framework to assess the robustness of forecast informed options contracts ocs to variable hydrology and farmer willingness to trust forecast information in water rights managed agricultural basins trust is manifested by the formation size and stability of high hv and low value lv growers cooperatives that engage in exclusive water trading to promote water market scale economic benefits 2 1 forecast production and translation the work presented here is an extension of several modelling phases fig 1 designed to produce and translate season ahead streamflow forecasts into information with which farmers can make consistently efficient water transfer decisions phase 1 fig 1 red components addresses natural hydrologic uncertainty in the elqui valley the primary growing season occurs from september to april and many farmers must make production input decisions prior to the revealing of the annual allocation value september 1st skillful season ahead forecasts of growing season reservoir inflow are produced for the elqui valley for leads between may and august to provide advanced indications of likely allocation values delorit et al 2017 these forecasts are coupled with a reservoir allocation model which calculates annual per water right allocation values hereafter these forecasts are referred to as advanced statistical forecasts persistence allocations are defined as a 5 year running mean of allocation for example the per water right persistence allocation for 2007 is the mean of observed annual allocation values for 2002 through 2006 thus persistence allocations do constitute a forecast but one that is strictly based on recent historical observations hereafter these forecasts are referred to as persistence forecasts phase 2 fig 1 yellow components translates per water right allocation values to expected yield and profit for representative crop type cooperatives on a per hectare basis farmers may select to join a theoretical water trading cooperative within the cooperative farmers are aligned by expected profitability i e similar crop value alignment by crop value is necessary to ensure trading is economically beneficial as trade vigor between equally profitable farmers would be low as they share a comparable willingness to pay for water the cooperative forms for the sole purpose of allowing members to benefit from water transfers individual cooperative members are permitted to produce and sell their yields as they deem necessary like non member farmers yield response to water is non linear steduto et al 2012 liu et al 2017 and calculated for the possible range of feasible per water right allocation values 0 05 1 0 l per second aquacrop a crop water model produced by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations is utilized to simulate yield response to water right allocations geerts et al 2009 heng et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hunink and droogers 2010 to produce discrete pairings of allocation and expected yield liters per second tons per hectare the continuous yield response functions are derived by regression using yield and water right allocation parings obtained from aquacrop and are constraints in crop type profit optimization regression of allocation onto yield provides derived yield response functions market prices clp t 1 are forecasted separately the advanced statistical price forecast approach uses united states department of agriculture 6 month lead market prices of corresponding agricultural products to create a cross validated season ahead regression based time series of expected prices in chilean markets the persistence based forecast utilizes the same basic framework as the persistence allocation forecast using the mean of three prior years expected gross per area profit clp ha 1 is calculated as the expected yield t ha 1 for any allocation value multiplied by market price as defined above of the product this is transformed to expected net profit when per water right fees maintenance production inputs etc are subtracted production inputs are modelled as constant returns to scale pre trade expected profit and shadow prices for water are obtained the underlying hydro economic model used in this research phase presumes farmers are risk neutral and profit maximizing for additional detail readers are directed to delorit et al 2019 phase 3 fig 1 green components illustrates how water s shadow price for crops is used to derive each farmer groups demand for water simulating across many likely per farmer water right endowment scenarios a market scale trade model is developed endowment describes the number of water rights held by a typical crop type farmer the model is based on a two firm demand equilibrium model which specifies the economically efficient market price and net allocation distribution for each cooperative the water buying cooperative pays the equilibrium price to the selling cooperative either until buyer demand is satisfied or until the supply of rights is exhausted as such supply and demand latency are possible when allocations are low competitive disequilibrium occurs the threshold between equilibrium and disequilibrium is based on endowment of water rights in disequilibrium the marginal willingness to pay by the buyer exceeds the marginal willingness to accept of the seller and negotiation is necessary to arrive at an economically efficient price griffin 2006 simulation across multiple endowment scenarios provides sets of demand based trade rules by which the crop cooperatives agree to abide for additional detail readers are directed to delorit and block 2019 phase 4 fig 1 blue components amalgamates outputs from phases 1 allocations 2 expected profits and 3 endowment based water trade rulesets and simulates inter cooperative water trade using option contracts option contracts have been implemented in developed countries in basins where irrigated agriculture is a significant component of the water economy williamson et al 2008 ghosh and willett 2016 marshall 2016 dozier et al 2017 applied here are several combinations of allocation and price forecast information to guide option contracts trading joint per cooperative and per water right expected surplus are generated for each combination and evaluated against a perfect foresight model informed with observations a priori knowledge of allocation and price information multi stage forecasts of allocation are considered because allocation forecasts issued by the advanced statistical model are produced for several leads may 1st august 1st option contracts pricing a function of the demand based trading ruleset responds to forecast updates water s strike price is the seller s long term expected value of the proportion of the per water right allocation value suggested by the demand based ruleset williamson et al 2008 for each allocation forecast update stage the predicted market price of water and premium are calculated the premium which provides the buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase water is obtained using the black scholes method black and scholes 1973 black and scholes 1976 sturm et al 2017 at each stage the buying farmer cooperative makes engagement decisions e g to pay the contract premium or wait for the next stage based on whether the market price of water is below the strike price ultimately option contracts are called if the revealed allocation value is insufficient to meet demand and the corresponding revealed market price is greater than the contract price secured when a premium is paid for additional detail readers are directed to delorit and block 2019 2 2 risk attitude framework for developed countries the four phase forecast production and translation model presented above while novel presume farmers possess uniform neutral risk attitudes regarding water as an input to production further they have only been evaluated over a single hydrologic forecast and set of observations sequentially 2000 2015 to remove the assumption of homogeneity and neutrality in risk attitude and test inter cooperative robustness to several hydrologic scenarios the framework is expanded fig 1 phase 5 2 2 1 farmers grouped by risk attitude farmer risk attitude is dynamic and not necessarily uniformly distributed or skewed the results of ziervogel et al 2005 bharwani et al 2005 and others which apply heterogeneous risk attitude with respect to forecast trust are tied to developing countries other studies identify trends in farmer risk attitude in developed countries roe 2003 roe et al 2014 roe et al 2014 use an 11 point scale to elicit farmer risk attitudes working with commercial polling firms answers to questions are statistically significant when controlled for confounding variables in predicting observed risk behaviors like farm equipment and cropping investments and other high risk choices e g self employment willingness jaeger et al 2010 dohmen et al 2011 roe et al 2014 the results align respondents by risk tolerance low 26 medium 40 and high 34 while risk attitudes among farmers in the elqui valley are unknown the results of roe et al 2014 provide some indication of general attitude toward risk in developed countries and are used here to apportion elqui farmers to three risk groups this component of the framework is left purposefully simplified to allow for modification of both the number and distribution farmer population among risk groups 2 2 2 forecast trust units ftus as a measure of forecast option value profit and alternatives forecast trust units ftu are used to determine whether farmers will enter or leave the inter cooperative water trade arrangement partially following ziervogel et al 2005 ftus accumulate with forecast accuracy over a specified period based on a comparison of absolute profit differential eq 1 for every year expected profit from the advanced statistical forecast informed model more closely matches the perfect foresight model than do the no trading or persistence forecast informed model an ftu is earned if expected profit from the persistence forecast or no trading model is superior to the advanced statistical forecast an ftu is lost eq 1 1 ft u m n 1 m f t u n 1 π ob s n π fcs t n π ob s n π per s n o r n o t r a d e n 1 o t h e r w i s e where ft u m is the sum of ft u n for accumulation period m with years n π ob s n is expected profit from perfect foresight observed option contracts trading π fcs t n is expected profit given advanced statistical forecast option contracts trading π per s n and π notrad e n are expected profit from persistence option contracts trading or no trading respectively aggregating ftus over a specified accumulation period determines entrance or departure from the inter cooperative water trading arrangement for the upcoming contract period for ft u m to be positive water rights holders enter the inter cooperative arrangement advanced forecast performance must exceed that of a persistence or no trade alternative for the majority of years in accumulation period m expected profits π calculated for the four sets described above are analyzed in two ways to determine ftu accumulation in any period m 1 joint surplus per water right ftus accumulate as a function of market scale joint expected surplus total expected profit is divided by the total number of rights invested in the cooperatives regardless of underlying ownership this analysis reflects a case where the hv and lv farmers value collective action trusting long term gains will be made and excess profit generated from trade will be equitably distributed between the cooperatives therefore an equivalent number of ftus accumulate between the cooperatives in m hereafter this accumulation method is referred to as joint surplus 2 per cooperative per water right surplus ftus accumulate based on market scale per water right performance of each cooperative and therefore may accumulate differently for the hv and lv cooperatives this analysis reflects a case where ftus accumulate based on whether farmers within their own farmer crop type cooperative are better off compared with joint performance hereafter this accumulation method is referred to as individual surplus in the elqui temporary trading of water rights is possible along the entire extent of the river however the extent to which trading occurs between hv and lv farmers is likely low this is due to the absence of a formal physical or virtual trading space and non binding arbitrary trade restrictions imposed by local water communities delorit and block 2019 delorit et al 2019 thus a no trading alternative is considered in addition arrangements that use persistence forecast information might develop this alternative reflects the widely accepted theory that innovation manifested here as formation of water trading cooperatives drives competition petrakis et al 2015 bogdan 2016 thus four distinct scenarios emerge against which the advanced statistical forecast may be compared namely by varying the mechanism by which farmers evaluate expected profitability joint and individual surplus and alternative actions persistence forecast informed options contract trading and no trading the following pairings of profitability based ftu accumulation and alternative action emerge 1 joint surplus based ftu accumulation persistence forecast informed option contracts water trading jp 2 joint surplus based ftu accumulation no trading jn 3 individual surplus based ftu accumulation persistence forecast informed option contracts water trading ip 4 individual surplus based ftu accumulation no trading in 2 2 3 combining risk groups and forecast trust to fully develop the relationship between farmers and willingness to trust forecast information it is necessary to describe the distribution of farmers within each risk group this study follows the work of bharwani et al 2005 ziervogel et al 2005 and roe et al 2014 the high and low risk tolerance attitude groups described in section 2 2 1 the low risk tolerance group follows a 2 parameter lognormal distribution low ln μ 1 σ 2 2 and the high risk tolerance group follows an inverse lognormal distribution using the same parameters as the low risk tolerance group high ln μ 1 σ 2 2 1 fig 2 a the inverse lognormal distribution attributed to high risk tolerant farmers recognizes their need for some forecast skill to join the cooperative for example for a total ftu score of one during an accumulation period approximately 30 of high risk taking farmers are willing to join their crop type cooperative fig 2b the remaining 70 of farmers in the high risk group are unwilling to join until the ftu score is at least two farmers with medium risk neutral attitudes are assumed to follow a 2 parameter normal distribution medium n μ 1 σ 2 0 5 these distributions are simulated and likely not fully representative of the true distribution of risk attitude in the elqui the proportion of hv and lv farmers willing to invest rights in forecast informed option contracts trading is a combination of farmer risk groups and aggregated ftu scores eq 2 2 v i n p i h f f t u m 2 v i tot p i h p i m f 2 f t u m 4 v i tot p i h p i m p i l f 4 f t u m 6 v i tot where v i n is the volume of rights invested by cooperative i hv or lv in contract period n which follows ftu accumulation period m p i h p i m and p i l are the percentage participation from each cooperative group high medium and low risk tolerance f f t u m is the proportion of the risk group distribution willing to trust forecasts based on the number of ftus obtained in an accumulation period v i tot is the total volume of rights held by the hv and lv farmer groups here six total ftus are required to achieve full rights investment discussed below v i n is calculated based upon the number of ftus accumulated over an accumulation period m the proportions of farmers aligned with each ftu accumulation distribution follow the results of roe et al 2014 low 26 medium 40 and high 34 an example may help to clarify if the ftu score is equal to three all high risk taking farmers invest their water rights along with 50 of the medium risk taking farmers fig 2a b for v i tot 100 it follows that v i n 34 100 40 50 26 0 100 54 farmers 2 3 hydrologic simulations forecast trust unit accumulation and contract periods hydrologic uncertainty in the elqui valley affects allocation values the observed set of growing season allocation values 2000 2015 ranges between 0 2 and 1 3 l per second fig 3 a a prolonged hydrologic drought 2012 2015 forced reservoir managers to curtail per water right allocations below the long term mean of 0 46 l per second based on long term observations for the elqui 1950 present this meteorological and hydrological drought is both the longest and driest on record delorit et al 2017 to test the robustness of inter cooperative use of forecast informed ocs both prolonged drought transposition and random simulations are created from the existing allocation record 2000 2015 the prolonged drought is transposed to the beginning fig 3b and middle fig 3c of the period of evaluation 2000 2015 to gauge the effect of specified conditions additionally 10 000 randomly generated simulations sampling without replacement fig 3d are created transposed drought and simulations match the length of observed allocation and market price data available for the elqui 16 years it is assumed that farmers who choose to join the inter cooperative water trading arrangement must commit their water rights for a period of 5 years this allows for three accumulations periods followed by three contract periods colored arrows and brackets fig 3d spin up this is the first six years of the time series during which farmers of prospective hv and lv cooperatives retrospectively evaluate expected profit accumulation period m 1 at the end of the period farmers compare performance based on accumulated ftus for no trading π notrade n trading using persistence forecast based option contracts π pers n and trading using advanced statistical forecast informed option contracts π fcs t n to facilitate trade the total number of ftus is between negative and positive six contract period 1 n 1 this is the first five year period of inter cooperative water trading ftus accumulated during the spin up period determine the number of water rights to be invested by each cooperative v h v 1 and v l v 1 during contract period 1 eq 2 fig 3d the four phase model is used to calculate expected profits given the number of rights invested ftus accumulate during contract period 1 ftu accumulation period m 2 contract period 2 n 2 this is the second five year period of inter cooperative water trading the number of rights invested in contract period 2 is based on the ftus accumulated during contract period 1 ftu accumulation period m 2 ftus are reset to zero from the end of contract period 1 such that the water trading arrangement is not unnecessarily buffered or penalized for previous performance contract period n 3 methodologically identical to prior steps contract period 3 extends beyond the time series shown fig 3d but illustrates how the water trading arrangement would be expected to exist into the future hereafter ftu accumulation and contract periods are referred to as m or n respectively because six ftus are required to obtain the entire number of water rights available between the hv and lv cooperatives i e all rights that could be invested are invested and five ftus is the maximum possible during n 2 and n 3 not all water rights can be invested in contract periods m 2 and m 3 2 4 water right endowment inequality unequal distribution of water rights or hierarchically based access to water may affect farmer crop type choices and profitability plunkett chaddad and cook 2010 hu et al 2016 it follows that farmers with larger endowments of water rights may possess a comparative economic advantage over farmers with lower endowments and thus may be able to influence water market interactions molinos senante et al 2016 this may result in economic stratification in the agricultural component of the water market in response growers cooperatives may form to provide farmers market leverage and the ability to collectively bargain water market pricing cook and iliopoulos 2000 ortmann and king 2007 the national council of farmer cooperatives finds cooperatives emerge to do just this provide bargaining power establish access to competitive markets competitively seek production inputs promote profit making reduce and manage risk cooperatives generally prioritize long term economic resilience over short term economic gains in basins where irrigated agriculture is a meaningful component of the water economy trading of water between growers cooperatives may both improve basin economic efficiency joint surplus and mitigate per water right allocation value uncertainty the market scale analysis is facilitated by the formation of theoretical hv and lv cooperatives in the elqui valley based on grape and potato farming they are selected based on their importance to the agricultural economy and representation of similar crop types grapes are representative of hv perennial crop farmers who are believed to possess larger per hectare endowments of water rights than lv annual crop farmers true water rights ownership by hv and lv farmers is unknown thus simulation over many potential water rights pools is necessary due to uncertainty in the true value a uniform distribution of known water rights holdings along sections of the elqui river reveal that hv farmers are expected to hold between 1 0 and 2 75 water rights on a per hectare basis zunino et al 2009 in contrast lv farmers are believed to possess 0 58 water rights on a per hectare basis venezian 1987 additional detail on basis crop selection methodology and results is provided in delorit parker and block 2019 based on these endowments eight hv and lv rights ownership scenarios are developed each scenario is based on 0 25 water right increment changes in ownership by hv farmers 1 0 2 75 water rights per hectare the number of hectares farmed in hv crops is 3592 zunino et al 2009 thus the number of water rights held by the hv farmers is the product of the eight per hectare endowments and the known number of hectares farmed lv farmers are believed to farm 5 800 ha in any year zunino et al 2009 holding 0 58 water rights on a per hectare basis equates to lv farmers hold 10 000 total water rights the total number of water rights considered for the inter cooperative water trading arrangement is 13 592 19 878 water rights 54 80 of total water market share 3 results 3 1 forecasts and expected profits the coupled models provide insight to the potential utility of forecast informed option contracts trading between the theoretical hv and lv water trading growers cooperatives fig 4 in terms of per water right allocation the multi stage advanced statistical forecast issued on may 1st and updated on august 1st correlates highly with observations pearson s coefficient of correlation r 0 70 p 0 002 fig 4a categorical prediction hit rate of allocation values for three categories moderate severe extreme however is only 53 delorit et al 2017 this is well below the 60 to 70 categorical skill thresholds ziervogel et al 2005 and bharwani et al 2005 suggest are necessary for forecast uptake by end users comparatively the persistence forecast running average 5 years is highly dampened and tends to over allocate during the observed drought 2012 2015 however there are instances when the persistence forecast is significantly more skillful than the advanced statistical forecast i e 2002 and 2008 specifically when allocations are near normal advanced statistical market price forecasts issued october 1st are moderately correlated with observed chilean market prices rhv 0 50 p 0 05 rlv 0 61 p 0 01 fig 4b c the persistence market price forecasts do not correlate with observed market prices as well rhv 0 13 p 0 62 rlv 0 22 p 0 40 the sum of expected profits using advanced statistical forecast informed option contracts to facilitate water trading over the period investigated 2000 2015 is clearly closer to perfect foresight than expected profit generated from either the persistence informed option contracts or no trading alternatives fig 5 a this is especially evident as the number of inter cooperative water rights grows in general the persistence forecast produces optimistic expected profits which are a function of over allocation during the drought fig 4a the no trading alternative is inefficient because the water trading rulesets governed by demand drives water from low to high value use trading of rights is significant using the multi stage advanced forecast informed option contracts across all endowment scenarios fig 5b the maximum number of rights that can be traded in any year is 10 000 the total held by the lv group for each endowment scenario wholesale rights transfer from lv to hv occurs at least once across 2000 2015 similarly there is at least one year when allocations are sufficient to satisfy both hv and lv demand such that no trades are specified as expected the lv group is a majority seller fig 5b blue dot exceeds red dot for all net endowments other than the largest 19 900 water rights persistence informed option contracts rights trading is significantly lower than the multi stage advanced forecast trading outcomes across endowments fig 5c this result is a function of systematic overallocation by the persistence forecast in general larger allocation values result in lower expected trade volume and for many endowments 15 400 water rights the hv farmer group is a majority seller persistence information also never results in trading outcomes greater than 6000 of the 10 000 possible rights option contract water trading using perfect information observations suggests trading between hv and lv farmer groups should be vigorous across the endowment scenarios fig 5d advanced forecast informed trading fig 5b represents this expectation better than persistence forecast informed trading fig 5c perhaps of greatest importance is that both the prefect and advanced forecast models predict wholesale trade occurrences by the lv cooperative the similarities and general alignment in outcomes of these two suggest that the advanced forecasts may hold value as trade information 3 2 forecast trust units the preceding analysis is based on a single hydrologic simulation assumes farmers as risk neutral and all potential rights as invested in inter cooperative water trading that is farmers are bound to participate in the water trading arrangement the heterogeneous risk attitude model removes these limitations by systematically revaluating farmer willingness to invest water rights in the water trading cooperative using ftus while continuing to simulate over the range of likely inter cooperative water rights ownership scenarios and alternative actions total ftu accumulation difference between advanced forecast informed option contracts water trading and alternative actions persistence and no trading for each mode joint or individual across 2000 2015 illustrates clear positive trends favoring the advanced approach for scenarios where ftus accumulate jointly between the hv and lv cooperatives the value of the advanced forecasts differs significantly between the persistence joint surplus persistence forecast informed options contract water trading jp fig 6 a and no trading joint surplus no trading jn fig 6b alternative actions for jp the skill of the advanced forecasts applied to option contracts water trading holds lower utility to hv and lv farmers at each endowment scenario as compared to jn additionally ftu accumulation decreases with increasing total water rights endowments for the jp case this occurs because increased water rights ownership means water is less scarce the number of water rights owned by the inter cooperative arrangement increases but total irrigated land does not because persistence allocation forecast tends to over allocate fig 4a and increased endowments buffer per hectare allocations the skill of the persistence forecast increases as endowments increase but remains less skillful than the advance forecast alternatively for the jn case fig 6b ftu accumulation increases as endowment increases this increase can be attributed to increases in net allocation which is the number of water rights held on a per hectare average multiplied by the per water right allocation value increased endowments imply more water available for trade and thus the gap between gains from trade under the advanced forecast informed option contracts and the no trading alternative grow in the cases of individual ftu accumulation by the hv and lv cooperatives with persistence ip fig 6c and no trading in fig 6d alternatives the same basic outcome is observed generally fewer ftus are accumulated in ip than in however the relationship between hv and lv farmer willingness to invest in forecast informed option contracts water trading is starkly different in the case of ip fig 6c lv farmer ftu accumulation increases by a factor of two across the increasing range of endowments this can be attributed to the fact that while lv farmer endowments are held static across the endowment scenarios water rights held by the hv cooperative increase in terms of water scarcity underlying scarcity for lv farmers is constant while for hv farmers it decreases thus an inverse ftu accumulation regime is expected for lv positive and hv negative farmers for increasing endowment scenarios in the case of in fig 6d a different ftu accumulation regime is observed like the jn case fig 6b forecast informed trading provides extensive benefits by simply moving water from low to high value use however because hv farmers hold a comparative economic advantage significant latent demand from the no trading alternative is alleviated through forecast informed option contracts trading across all endowment scenarios in many cases for larger water rights endowments hv demand for water can be fully satiated such that supply latency exists for lv farmers lv farmer willingness to sell water exceeds hv farmer demand the effect of supply latency on lv farmer ftu accumulation is negative at larger endowments although forecast trust is comparable with other ftu accumulation and alternative action scenarios comparing the two persistence jp to ip fig 6a to c and no trading alternative scenarios jn to in fig 6b to d joint ftu accumulation is driven by hv farmers this result is expected because of the comparative advantage they hold over lv farmers 3 3 robustness of forecast informed water trade while ftu accumulation over the observed hydrologic record provides insight with respect to generalized willingness to utilize forecasts cooperative size and long term stability may be affected by hydrologic conditions and contract period length here the 85th 50th and 15th percentile water rights investment outcomes from the 10 003 hydrologic simulations are evaluated to illustrate how forecast optimism and pessimism effect ftu accumulation and water rights investment by contract period across the range of water rights endowment scenarios fig 7 for the jp case ftu accumulation and corresponding water rights investment decrease with increasing endowment fig 7a rights investment during contract period n 1 fig 7a top is generally higher than in n 2 fig 7a middle and n 3 fig 7a bottom this is precisely because ftu accumulation period m 1 covers six years one additional year over m 2 and m 3 this is true for all profit based ftu accumulation and alternative action scenarios for all contract periods in the jp case lower bound 15th percentile and median outcomes are relatively consistent although upper bounds 85th percentile for n 2 and n 3 are reduced to the median outcome for half of the endowment scenarios 16 000 19 000 water rights this result suggests that as water rights become available it is increasingly likely that that only farmers with high risk tolerance will invest rights in the advanced forecast informed water trading cooperative however the consistency between results for n 2 and n 3 suggest that a degree of rights investment stability is expected for the jn case fig 7b the number of rights invested by period increases over the range of endowment scenarios median rights investment outcomes for all contract periods and endowment scenarios includes all farmers with high risk tolerance and at least half of farmers from the medium risk tolerance group for the five largest endowment scenarios 16 300 19 900 water rights median outcomes suggest both the high and medium risk tolerant groups will invest water rights for contract periods 2 and 3 the 85th percentile outcome suggests five ftus may accumulate such that all potential rights will be invested in the water trading cooperative corresponding ftu accumulation periods cover 5 years thus only a portion of the low risk tolerant group may consider investment like the jp case the jn case displays rights investment consistency in contract periods n 2 and n 3 which indicates the inter cooperative arrangement reaches relative stability under both individual profit based ftu accumulation cases ip fig 7c and in fig 7d inter endowment rights investments are less stable instability arises from independent ftu accumulation and rights investment decisions by hv and lv farmers the effect supply and demand latency have on per water right profits make the inter cooperative arrangement unstable in comparison to the jp and jn cases ip and in do not possess similar investment stability between contract periods n 2 and n 3 although the general pattern of both the median and upper and lower bounds for ip and in are somewhat consistent during these periods comparing across the four pairings the joint cases jp and jn are best suited to provide inter contract period and endowment stability compared to the individual cases ip and in however rights investment response between jp and jn is drastically different joint assessment of profitability by farmers is only preferred when otherwise no trading is possible jn this result is intriguing given that potential users of advanced forecast informed ocs cannot control whether a competing persistence forecast informed oc cooperative emerges clearly advanced forecast users prefer jp as investment of rights is maximized and stable between endowments if there is no competition for water rights if a competing cooperative emerges using persistence forecast information rendering the no trading outcomes moot fig 7b and d are infeasible ip is the best option available for advanced forecast users the preferred ftu accumulation basis is thus dependent upon the alternative action available to water rights users moving between profit based ftu accumulation cases affects stability inter endowment stability in j greater than i while moving between alternative actions affects participation participation in n greater than p 4 discussion water rights endowment scenarios cooperative size hydrologic regimes drought transpositions and random hydrologic simulations trust unit accumulation bases and alternative actions are all influential in evaluating forecast based water rights investment strategies these conditions are not unique to the elqui valley the results suggest that forecast uptake based on trust unit thresholds and risk group size is evident expected investment of rights is variable 28 70 of total rights available across the scenarios considered the cooperative operates continuously and stably across contract periods except for simulations containing a number 25 or more of extreme drought years in general this suggests that forecast uptake is robust to most hydrologic regimes for farmers with high or medium risk tolerance preferences this clearly highlights that while allocation forecast categorical skill 53 is below what has been suggested as sufficient to evoke forecast acceptance and implementation by farmers typically 60 70 bharwani et al 2005 ziervogel et al 2005 by translating the forecast to specific end user tailored actions through yield and economic models it may possible to increase forecast appeal and uptake for this analysis at least one forecast trust unit is necessary to prompt water rights investment by the most risk tolerant farmer group given the adoption of five and six year periods forecast informed decision making must be more skillful than an alternative in at least three of five 60 or four of six 67 years for positive trust units to accrue given the very high level of positive forecast trust unit accumulation and appropriate water rights investments forecast value has effectively increased through transformation an additional contribution of this work arises from simulating over varied water rights endowment scenarios varying rights ownership is synonymous with an analysis of how water scarcity may affect the size of the inter cooperative arrangement increasing the pool of rights increases the net allocation received given the total number of irrigated hectares remains constant as such the results presented here reveal inter cooperative water trading sensitivity to changes in water scarcity only when high and low value farmers choose to jointly determine forecast trust unit accumulation and face a persistence forecast informed water trading alternative do increased endowments decreased water scarcity negatively impact realized water rights investment this is not the case for the other three scenarios addressed this suggests that forecast value to users increases with or is not sensitive to expanding endowments that is forecast value is robust to several water scarcity scenarios the four scenarios proposed serve to highlight likely conditions under which water trading cooperatives may form alternative actions available to farmers have some effect on rights investment the no trading alternative results in generally more cooperative rights investment than the persistence alternative but are not controllable by those interested in formation of trading cooperatives for example if forecast informed water trading cooperatives form the members cannot control whether a competing persistence forecast based trading cooperative emerges as such interested farmers must consider which forecast trust unit accumulation method to advertise to potential participants joint or individual expected profitability the profit based trust unit accumulation methodology influences long term rights investment stability across endowment scenarios this is made clear comparing joint fig 7a b to individual profit based trust accumulation fig 7c d while joint profit based accumulation has a substantial upside in terms of potential rights investment fig 7b if a competing persistence cooperative forms fig 7a rights investment expectations fall for the joint cases differences in expected investment increase with larger endowment scenarios for this reason if investment stability is preferred farmers may be inclined to advertise individual profit based accumulation statistics fig 7c d which are less sensitive to alternative actions over the range of endowments this is reinforced by the likelihood of larger endowment scenarios being the most realistic of those simulated 18 000 water rights zunino et al 2009 this work treats farmers in the elqui as approximated by risk groups with underlying attitudes toward forecast trust however the true nature of risk attitudes is unknown the group based approach used here mimics that of similar studies but is flexible such that alterations to the number and size of risk groups forecast trust thresholds and characterization of intra group farmer distributions may be altered ground truthing risk attitudes through focused interactions with farmers of varied crop types in the elqui should be conducted to confirm the risk attitude model another limitation of the research presented here is that rights must either be invested in the advanced forecast informed water trading cooperative or in only one alternative action for example if insufficient forecast trust units are accumulated during a specified period and the alternative action analyzed is a persistence informed water trading cooperative rights holders must choose one of these options the model does not permit the option to pursue a no trading alternative it follows that if no trading is the available alternative action the persistence alternative is not available thus the results here limit the total number of alternatives simulated 5 conclusions this work postulates that to provide a fair assessment of the option value of forecasts here translated to inform water option contracts available to water rights holders engaged in irrigated agriculture the robustness of the forecasts to both varied hydrologic conditions and risk attitudes among rights holders must be tested here a robustness framework is presented to evaluate water rights investment by farmers across many water rights endowment scenarios when presented with alternative water trading engagement strategies results indicate that water trading cooperatives will form and operate continuously to promote water market scale economic benefits and use efficiency based on the emergence of forecast informed option contracts used to facilitate temporary water transfers specifically findings here suggest that forecast uptake is not only expected but also robust to hydrologic variability and simulations of water scarcity while rights invested between users is expected to fluctuate in response to prolonged droughts probabilistic simulations suggest that given a 25 or less chance of extreme drought in any year investment of rights reaches stability across a range of likely water rights ownership scenarios this framework is likely transferable beyond the elqui valley case study wherever water rights are implemented and may be traded by those who seek to use water as an input to production user demand may be derived and transparent water trading rulesets may be implemented yet even in cases where the framework may not be directly applied i e rights are not tradeable infrastructure does not permit efficient movement of water the results presented here illustrate the appeal of even marginally skillful season ahead hydrologic forecasts enhanced through translation the full value of climate and hydrology forecast information may not be realized unless it is tailored specifically to end users the conclusions of this study serve to support the inclusion of season ahead hydrologic forecasts as a critical component of water systems management the connectedness of the natural and human components of water systems warrants forecast development and integration consistent with sectoral goals and user preferences to catalyze efficient water systems credit authorship

5740,season ahead hydrologic forecasts hold the potential to inform water user decision making provided forecast information offers value to targeted end users particularly in water scarce regions yet user willingness to trust forecast information is uncertain and often varied across similar user groups here forecast uptake by agriculture users in semi arid water rights managed basins is modelled to account for heterogeneous risk attitude and hydrologic variability a season ahead forecast of reservoir inflow is translated to water trading rulesets through coupled reservoir allocation i e per water right allocation from the reservoir crop water economic optimization and demand derivation models theoretical growers aligned in crop type cooperatives are modelled as potential exclusive water trading partners that in years of scarcity may choose between forecast informed water trading via option contracts or one of two alternative water trade actions persistence forecast informed trading or no trading simulations across varied initial water rights endowment and farmer risk attitude allows for evaluation of expected investment of water rights in forecast informed water trade results indicate farmer willingness to trust forecast information and subsequently invest rights option contracts trade is variable 28 70 and dependent on initial endowment of rights and alternative water trade action manifested here as persistence informed trade and no trade alternative while variable investment outcomes for probabilistic hydrologic simulations reveal long term trade stability under nearly every forecast informed water trading simulation suggesting options contracts may be viable under a variety of water scarcity conditions a key insight is that seasonal climate forecasts may prove to be quite valuable when translated through sectoral models providing the tailored information to end users with diverse risk attitudes this reinforces the potential in including forecasts in agricultural water resources decision support frameworks as a hedge against water scarcity for farmers of varied earning potential keywords risk attitude option contracts forecast water rights water markets water trade agent based scarcity 1 introduction water option contracts ocs have been implemented as a market based approach to drought mitigation and transaction cost reduction for agricultural producers brown and carriquiry 2007 wheeler et al 2013 vicuña et al 2018 ocs provide a hedge against future market uncertainty allowing prospective sellers and buyers to negotiate price and quantity terms for a good which is valid at a later date as a financial instrument the value of ocs is clear when the contract quantity or allocation of water can be guaranteed by the seller however in many regions allocations provided to water rights holders are uncertain and based on water availability i e reservoir storage as such ocs have been deemed infeasible and are not implemented vicuña et al 2011 vicuña et al 2018 where season ahead forecasts of allocation can be produced with consistent skill it is possible to couple forecasts with financial instruments including ocs roncoli et al 2009 block 2011 delorit and block 2018 likely benefactors of forecast informed ocs including farmers who make investment decisions ahead of planting must determine whether forecast information holds sufficient value before they will integrate it in their decision making rey et al 2016 vicuña et al 2018 assessing forecast option value is complex and should account for variability in both hydrology and target end user group behavior i e willingness to trust forecast information with respect to hydrologic variability prospective users of forecast informed ocs are most likely to value products which are robust to many possible hydrologic conditions including prolonged and disconnected drought scenarios herman et al 2015 brown and carriquiry 2007 adamson et al 2017 herman et al 2016

efficacy of ocs and other interventions may be assessed second option value does not accrue uniformly across water users willingness to trust forecast information is tied to farmer economic

ahead allocation forecasts applied to ocs must therefore be compared to relevant alternative water transfer strategies and climate forecast information farmers may use in unison to cope with allocation uncertainty hansen et al 2006 rey et al 2016 an assessment of the option value of forecast informed ocs should test the robustness of its performance to these relevant aspects to determine how and to what extent farmers may implement forecast informed water decision making through time this type of analysis may provide insight to policymakers and those tasked with developing forecast based financial instruments mortensen and block 2018 studies which assess farmer risk attitudes and willingness to adopt forecast informed decision making generally take either theoretical economic or applied behavioral science and economic approaches theoretical approaches for eliciting farmer risk attitudes are rooted in choice economic theory and use expected utility or direct elicitation of utility functions bard and barry 2001 rey et al 2016 adamson et al 2017 dozier et al 2017 kosovac et al 2017 these are often criticized as abstracting from realistic conditions particularly with respect to accurate measurement and alignment of utility functions with observations or assumed often homogenously risk averse and downside prudent farmer risk attitude carpentier et al 2015 ward and singh 2015 gómez limón et al 2016 further very few theoretical economic studies apply season ahead forecasts and instead use historical hydrologic conditions when forward looking these studies rely on projections of decadal to multi decadal hydrologic trends to evaluate models while ignoring the impacts of interannual hydrologic variability calatrava and garrido 2005 kasprzyk et al 2012 molinos senante et al 2016 in this way they are limited in their application to farmers as planting decisions may change year to year based on expected hydrologic and market crop and production inputs conditions opposingly applied approaches use field experiments which generally rely on farmer response to surveys roe 2003 bougherara and gassmann 2011 de brauw and eozenou 2014 in contrast to theoretical approaches applied approaches find that farmer communities possess a spectrum of risk attitudes variable across region type of agriculture and production goal roe 2003 ziervogel et al 2005 qasim 2012 kosovac et al 2017 typically farmer populations are categorized in groups by risk attitude e g high medium low unlike theoretical approaches some applied studies address facets of farmer willingness to accept hydrologic forecasts at the seasonal scale ziervogel 2004 ziervogel et al 2005 bharwani et al 2005 wossen et al 2015 berger et al 2017 these studies investigate uptake at forecast skill thresholds and seek to understand farmer farmer interactions and forecast perception these studies are beneficial in that they address heterogeneous farmer risk attitude by establishing sub groups based on risk tolerance but are limited in terms of their broader applicability they are predominantly set in developing countries lesotho for ziervogel et al 2005 limpopo south africa for bharwani et al 2005 ghana for wossen et al 2015 ethiopia for berger et al 2017 assess mainly rainfed agriculture and are tailored to small share subsistence farming and do not explicitly address the potential for mutually beneficial interaction between farmers as water trade partners the gap present in the applied approaches is how seasonal forecasts can be translated and implemented in large scale irrigated agriculture in developed countries which is an important and growing contributor to global food production siebert et al 2005 assouline et al 2015 food and agriculture organization fao 2016 in many cases irrigated agriculture is required due to a mismatch between the growing season and peak precipitation timing delorit et al 2019 where seasonal mismatches occur often strong water law emerges in these regions sustainable surface and groundwater resource management is sought while provisions for fair access to water for economic use are made e g agricultural production bjornlund and mckay 2002 townsend and adams 2016 wheeler et al 2013 water law establishes surface water rights as limited access permits to some fixed or variable quantity water getches et al 2015 some water law and accompanying water rights systems are based on free market economic approaches which allow rights to be transferred between users endo et al 2018 although water law varies by region the economic basis of water law types with tradeable rights are anchored by the coase theorem freebairn and quiggin 2006 chikozho and kujinga 2017 hasselman and stoker 2017 this approach suggests that through trading of water rights temporary or permanent water will be put to its best economic use coase 1937 ruml 2005 where tradeable water rights are predominantly engaged in irrigated agriculture forecasts may be tailored such that they are attractive to water rights holders and may be implemented without significant institutional change i e fundamental shifts in water law as land dedicated to irrigated agriculture continues to become a relevant piece of the global agricultural tapestry investigating methods to implement robust forecast informed decision making to promote economic water use efficiency and bolster production in the face of hydrologic uncertainty will be necessary assouline et al 2015 the work presented here addresses the need to model hydrologically and risk robust forecast informed decision making in irrigated agriculture by utilizing beneficial components of both theoretical and applied approaches to risk it applies a three tiered heterogeneous risk attitude construct to theoretical high hv and low value lv farmers who consider formation of crop type cooperatives that may engage in exclusive water trade under varied hydrologic conditions the cooperatives are presented forecast informed ocs as an alternative to persistence informed oc water trade or no trading approach delorit and block 2019 the framework presented here is evaluated retrospectively 2000 2015 in the agriculture dominated elqui valley of north central chile the framework is suitable for broader application given that the water law and management of chile is based on a free market economic approach shared by other countries rieu clarke et al 2017 borgias and bauer 2017 endo et al 2018 perform an analysis of global water law and conclude that up to 58 countries including chile have shared legal and economic attributes necessary to promote efficient sustainable water markets here only details essential to calibrating the framework are presented readers interested in additional detail on the case study are directed to delorit et al 2019 and delorit and block 2019 in the elqui valley agricultural water users hold roughly 90 percent of the 25 000 fully allocated water rights assigned to the basin the chilean water code of 1981 wc stipulates that each water right is equivalently valued and does not exceed a 1 0 l per second average annually however it is possible that during the growing season allocation may exceed 1 0 l per second on september 1st the privately held water resources management firm is tasked with setting the annual per water right allocation value its decision is based largely on existing storage in a central reservoir and a mixed qualitative quantitative assessment of expected reservoir inflow delorit et al 2017 if storage and inflow are not sufficient to provide full 1 0 l per second allocations each water right is curtailed proportionately coupled uncertainty in the allocation value and the date at which the annual per right allocation value is set are present challenges for farmers in the elqui 2 materials methods and calculation this work provides a novel framework to assess the robustness of forecast informed options contracts ocs to variable hydrology and farmer willingness to trust forecast information in water rights managed agricultural basins trust is manifested by the formation size and stability of high hv and low value lv growers cooperatives that engage in exclusive water trading to promote water market scale economic benefits 2 1 forecast production and translation the work presented here is an extension of several modelling phases fig 1 designed to produce and translate season ahead streamflow forecasts into information with which farmers can make consistently efficient water transfer decisions phase 1 fig 1 red components addresses natural hydrologic uncertainty in the elqui valley the primary growing season occurs from september to april and many farmers must make production input decisions prior to the revealing of the annual allocation value september 1st skillful season ahead forecasts of growing season reservoir inflow are produced for the elqui valley for leads between may and august to provide advanced indications of likely allocation values delorit et al 2017 these forecasts are coupled with a reservoir allocation model which calculates annual per water right allocation values hereafter these forecasts are referred to as advanced statistical forecasts persistence allocations are defined as a 5 year running mean of allocation for example the per water right persistence allocation for 2007 is the mean of observed annual allocation values for 2002 through 2006 thus persistence allocations do constitute a forecast but one that is strictly based on recent historical observations hereafter these forecasts are referred to as persistence forecasts phase 2 fig 1 yellow components translates per water right allocation values to expected yield and profit for representative crop type cooperatives on a per hectare basis farmers may select to join a theoretical water trading cooperative within the cooperative farmers are aligned by expected profitability i e similar crop value alignment by crop value is necessary to ensure trading is economically beneficial as trade vigor between equally profitable farmers would be low as they share a comparable willingness to pay for water the cooperative forms for the sole purpose of allowing members to benefit from water transfers individual cooperative members are permitted to produce and sell their yields as they deem necessary like non member farmers yield response to water is non linear steduto et al 2012 liu et al 2017 and calculated for the possible range of feasible per water right allocation values 0 05 1 0 l per second aquacrop a crop water model produced by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations is utilized to simulate yield response to water right allocations geerts et al 2009 heng et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hunink and droogers 2010 to produce discrete pairings of allocation and expected yield liters per second tons per hectare the continuous yield response functions are derived by regression using yield and water right allocation parings obtained from aquacrop and are constraints in crop type profit optimization regression of allocation onto yield provides derived yield response functions market prices clp t 1 are forecasted separately the advanced statistical price forecast approach uses united states department of agriculture 6 month lead market prices of corresponding agricultural products to create a cross validated season ahead regression based time series of expected prices in chilean markets the persistence based forecast utilizes the same basic framework as the persistence allocation forecast using the mean of three prior years expected gross per area profit clp ha 1 is calculated as the expected yield t ha 1 for any allocation value multiplied by market price as defined above of the product this is transformed to expected net profit when per water right fees maintenance production inputs etc are subtracted production inputs are modelled as constant returns to scale pre trade expected profit and shadow prices for water are obtained the underlying hydro economic model used in this research phase presumes farmers are risk neutral and profit maximizing for additional detail readers are directed to delorit et al 2019 phase 3 fig 1 green components illustrates how water s shadow price for crops is used to derive each farmer groups demand for water simulating across many likely per farmer water right endowment scenarios a market scale trade model is developed endowment describes the number of water rights held by a typical crop type farmer the model is based on a two firm demand equilibrium model which specifies the economically efficient market price and net allocation distribution for each cooperative the water buying cooperative pays the equilibrium price to the selling cooperative either until buyer demand is satisfied or until the supply of rights is exhausted as such supply and demand latency are possible when allocations are low competitive disequilibrium occurs the threshold between equilibrium and disequilibrium is based on endowment of water rights in disequilibrium the marginal willingness to pay by the buyer exceeds the marginal willingness to accept of the seller and negotiation is necessary to arrive at an economically efficient price griffin 2006 simulation across multiple endowment scenarios provides sets of demand based trade rules by which the crop cooperatives agree to abide for additional detail readers are directed to delorit and block 2019 phase 4 fig 1 blue components amalgamates outputs from phases 1 allocations 2 expected profits and 3 endowment based water trade rulesets and simulates inter cooperative water trade using option contracts option contracts have been implemented in developed countries in basins where irrigated agriculture is a significant component of the water economy williamson et al 2008 ghosh and willett 2016 marshall 2016 dozier et al 2017 applied here are several combinations of allocation and price forecast information to guide option contracts trading joint per cooperative and per water right expected surplus are generated for each combination and evaluated against a perfect foresight model informed with observations a priori knowledge of allocation and price information multi stage forecasts of allocation are considered because allocation forecasts issued by the advanced statistical model are produced for several leads may 1st august 1st option contracts pricing a function of the demand based trading ruleset responds to forecast updates water s strike price is the seller s long term expected value of the proportion of the per water right allocation value suggested by the demand based ruleset williamson et al 2008 for each allocation forecast update stage the predicted market price of water and premium are calculated the premium which provides the buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase water is obtained using the black scholes method black and scholes 1973 black and scholes 1976 sturm et al 2017 at each stage the buying farmer cooperative makes engagement decisions e g to pay the contract premium or wait for the next stage based on whether the market price of water is below the strike price ultimately option contracts are called if the revealed allocation value is insufficient to meet demand and the corresponding revealed market price is greater than the contract price secured when a premium is paid for additional detail readers are directed to delorit and block 2019 2 2 risk attitude framework for developed countries the four phase forecast production and translation model presented above while novel presume farmers possess uniform neutral risk attitudes regarding water as an input to production further they have only been evaluated over a single hydrologic forecast and set of observations sequentially 2000 2015 to remove the assumption of homogeneity and neutrality in risk attitude and test inter cooperative robustness to several hydrologic scenarios the framework is expanded fig 1 phase 5 2 2 1 farmers grouped by risk attitude farmer risk attitude is dynamic and not necessarily uniformly distributed or skewed the results of ziervogel et al 2005 bharwani et al 2005 and others which apply heterogeneous risk attitude with respect to forecast trust are tied to developing countries other studies identify trends in farmer risk attitude in developed countries roe 2003 roe et al 2014 roe et al 2014 use an 11 point scale to elicit farmer risk attitudes working with commercial polling firms answers to questions are statistically significant when controlled for confounding variables in predicting observed risk behaviors like farm equipment and cropping investments and other high risk choices e g self employment willingness jaeger et al 2010 dohmen et al 2011 roe et al 2014 the results align respondents by risk tolerance low 26 medium 40 and high 34 while risk attitudes among farmers in the elqui valley are unknown the results of roe et al 2014 provide some indication of general attitude toward risk in developed countries and are used here to apportion elqui farmers to three risk groups this component of the framework is left purposefully simplified to allow for modification of both the number and distribution farmer population among risk groups 2 2 2 forecast trust units ftus as a measure of forecast option value profit and alternatives forecast trust units ftu are used to determine whether farmers will enter or leave the inter cooperative water trade arrangement partially following ziervogel et al 2005 ftus accumulate with forecast accuracy over a specified period based on a comparison of absolute profit differential eq 1 for every year expected profit from the advanced statistical forecast informed model more closely matches the perfect foresight model than do the no trading or persistence forecast informed model an ftu is earned if expected profit from the persistence forecast or no trading model is superior to the advanced statistical forecast an ftu is lost eq 1 1 ft u m n 1 m f t u n 1 π ob s n π fcs t n π ob s n π per s n o r n o t r a d e n 1 o t h e r w i s e where ft u m is the sum of ft u n for accumulation period m with years n π ob s n is expected profit from perfect foresight observed option contracts trading π fcs t n is expected profit given advanced statistical forecast option contracts trading π per s n and π notrad e n are expected profit from persistence option contracts trading or no trading respectively aggregating ftus over a specified accumulation period determines entrance or departure from the inter cooperative water trading arrangement for the upcoming contract period for ft u m to be positive water rights holders enter the inter cooperative arrangement advanced forecast performance must exceed that of a persistence or no trade alternative for the majority of years in accumulation period m expected profits π calculated for the four sets described above are analyzed in two ways to determine ftu accumulation in any period m 1 joint surplus per water right ftus accumulate as a function of market scale joint expected surplus total expected profit is divided by the total number of rights invested in the cooperatives regardless of underlying ownership this analysis reflects a case where the hv and lv farmers value collective action trusting long term gains will be made and excess profit generated from trade will be equitably distributed between the cooperatives therefore an equivalent number of ftus accumulate between the cooperatives in m hereafter this accumulation method is referred to as joint surplus 2 per cooperative per water right surplus ftus accumulate based on market scale per water right performance of each cooperative and therefore may accumulate differently for the hv and lv cooperatives this analysis reflects a case where ftus accumulate based on whether farmers within their own farmer crop type cooperative are better off compared with joint performance hereafter this accumulation method is referred to as individual surplus in the elqui temporary trading of water rights is possible along the entire extent of the river however the extent to which trading occurs between hv and lv farmers is likely low this is due to the absence of a formal physical or virtual trading space and non binding arbitrary trade restrictions imposed by local water communities delorit and block 2019 delorit et al 2019 thus a no trading alternative is considered in addition arrangements that use persistence forecast information might develop this alternative reflects the widely accepted theory that innovation manifested here as formation of water trading cooperatives drives competition petrakis et al 2015 bogdan 2016 thus four distinct scenarios emerge against which the advanced statistical forecast may be compared namely by varying the mechanism by which farmers evaluate expected profitability joint and individual surplus and alternative actions persistence forecast informed options contract trading and no trading the following pairings of profitability based ftu accumulation and alternative action emerge 1 joint surplus based ftu accumulation persistence forecast informed option contracts water trading jp 2 joint surplus based ftu accumulation no trading jn 3 individual surplus based ftu accumulation persistence forecast informed option contracts water trading ip 4 individual surplus based ftu accumulation no trading in 2 2 3 combining risk groups and forecast trust to fully develop the relationship between farmers and willingness to trust forecast information it is necessary to describe the distribution of farmers within each risk group this study follows the work of bharwani et al 2005 ziervogel et al 2005 and roe et al 2014 the high and low risk tolerance attitude groups described in section 2 2 1 the low risk tolerance group follows a 2 parameter lognormal distribution low ln μ 1 σ 2 2 and the high risk tolerance group follows an inverse lognormal distribution using the same parameters as the low risk tolerance group high ln μ 1 σ 2 2 1 fig 2 a the inverse lognormal distribution attributed to high risk tolerant farmers recognizes their need for some forecast skill to join the cooperative for example for a total ftu score of one during an accumulation period approximately 30 of high risk taking farmers are willing to join their crop type cooperative fig 2b the remaining 70 of farmers in the high risk group are unwilling to join until the ftu score is at least two farmers with medium risk neutral attitudes are assumed to follow a 2 parameter normal distribution medium n μ 1 σ 2 0 5 these distributions are simulated and likely not fully representative of the true distribution of risk attitude in the elqui the proportion of hv and lv farmers willing to invest rights in forecast informed option contracts trading is a combination of farmer risk groups and aggregated ftu scores eq 2 2 v i n p i h f f t u m 2 v i tot p i h p i m f 2 f t u m 4 v i tot p i h p i m p i l f 4 f t u m 6 v i tot where v i n is the volume of rights invested by cooperative i hv or lv in contract period n which follows ftu accumulation period m p i h p i m and p i l are the percentage participation from each cooperative group high medium and low risk tolerance f f t u m is the proportion of the risk group distribution willing to trust forecasts based on the number of ftus obtained in an accumulation period v i tot is the total volume of rights held by the hv and lv farmer groups here six total ftus are required to achieve full rights investment discussed below v i n is calculated based upon the number of ftus accumulated over an accumulation period m the proportions of farmers aligned with each ftu accumulation distribution follow the results of roe et al 2014 low 26 medium 40 and high 34 an example may help to clarify if the ftu score is equal to three all high risk taking farmers invest their water rights along with 50 of the medium risk taking farmers fig 2a b for v i tot 100 it follows that v i n 34 100 40 50 26 0 100 54 farmers 2 3 hydrologic simulations forecast trust unit accumulation and contract periods hydrologic uncertainty in the elqui valley affects allocation values the observed set of growing season allocation values 2000 2015 ranges between 0 2 and 1 3 l per second fig 3 a a prolonged hydrologic drought 2012 2015 forced reservoir managers to curtail per water right allocations below the long term mean of 0 46 l per second based on long term observations for the elqui 1950 present this meteorological and hydrological drought is both the longest and driest on record delorit et al 2017 to test the robustness of inter cooperative use of forecast informed ocs both prolonged drought transposition and random simulations are created from the existing allocation record 2000 2015 the prolonged drought is transposed to the beginning fig 3b and middle fig 3c of the period of evaluation 2000 2015 to gauge the effect of specified conditions additionally 10 000 randomly generated simulations sampling without replacement fig 3d are created transposed drought and simulations match the length of observed allocation and market price data available for the elqui 16 years it is assumed that farmers who choose to join the inter cooperative water trading arrangement must commit their water rights for a period of 5 years this allows for three accumulations periods followed by three contract periods colored arrows and brackets fig 3d spin up this is the first six years of the time series during which farmers of prospective hv and lv cooperatives retrospectively evaluate expected profit accumulation period m 1 at the end of the period farmers compare performance based on accumulated ftus for no trading π notrade n trading using persistence forecast based option contracts π pers n and trading using advanced statistical forecast informed option contracts π fcs t n to

profits given the number of rights invested ftus accumulate during contract period 1 ftu accumulation period m 2 contract period 2 n 2 this is the second five year period of inter cooperative water trading the number of rights invested in contract period 2 is based on the ftus accumulated during contract period 1 ftu accumulation period m 2 ftus are reset to zero from the end of contract period 1 such that the water trading arrangement is not unnecessarily buffered or penalized for previous performance contract period n 3 methodologically identical to prior steps contract period 3 extends beyond the time series shown fig 3d but illustrates how the water trading arrangement would be expected to exist into the future hereafter ftu accumulation and contract periods are referred to as m or n respectively because six ftus are required to obtain the entire number of water rights available between the hv and lv cooperatives i e all rights that could be invested are invested and five ftus is the maximum possible during n 2 and n 3 not all water rights can be invested in contract periods m 2 and m 3 2 4 water right endowment inequality unequal distribution of water rights or hierarchically based access to water may affect farmer crop type choices and profitability plunkett chaddad and cook 2010 hu et al 2016 it follows that farmers with larger endowments of water rights may possess a comparative economic advantage over farmers with lower endowments and thus may be able to influence water market interactions molinos senante et al 2016 this may result in economic stratification in the agricultural component of the water market in response growers cooperatives may form to provide farmers market leverage and the ability to collectively bargain water market pricing cook and iliopoulos 2000 ortmann and king 2007 the national council of farmer cooperatives finds cooperatives emerge to do just this provide bargaining power establish access to competitive markets competitively seek production inputs promote profit making reduce and manage risk cooperatives generally prioritize long term economic resilience over short term economic gains in basins where irrigated agriculture is a meaningful component of the water economy trading of water between growers cooperatives may both improve basin economic efficiency joint surplus and mitigate per water right allocation value uncertainty the market scale analysis is facilitated by the formation of theoretical hv and lv cooperatives in the elqui valley based on grape and potato farming they are selected based on their importance to the agricultural economy and representation of similar crop types grapes are representative of hv perennial crop farmers who are believed to possess larger per hectare endowments of water rights than lv annual crop farmers true water rights ownership by hv and lv farmers is unknown thus simulation over many potential water rights pools is necessary due to uncertainty in the true value a uniform distribution of known water rights holdings along sections of the elqui river reveal that hv farmers are expected to hold between 1 0 and 2 75 water rights on a per hectare basis zunino et al 2009 in contrast lv farmers are believed to possess 0 58 water rights on a per hectare basis venezian 1987 additional detail on basis crop selection methodology and results is provided in delorit parker and block 2019 based on these endowments eight hv and lv rights ownership scenarios are developed each scenario is based on 0 25 water right increment changes in ownership by hv farmers 1 0 2 75 water rights per hectare the number of hectares farmed in hv crops is 3592 zunino et al 2009 thus the number of water rights held by the hv farmers is the product of the eight per hectare endowments and the known number of hectares farmed lv farmers are believed to farm 5 800 ha in any year zunino et al 2009 holding 0 58 water rights on a per hectare basis equates to lv farmers hold 10 000 total water rights the total number of water rights considered for the inter cooperative water trading arrangement is 13 592 19 878 water rights 54 80 of total water market share 3 results 3 1 forecasts and expected profits the coupled models provide insight to the potential utility of forecast informed option contracts trading between the theoretical hv and lv water trading growers cooperatives fig 4 in terms of per water right allocation the multi stage advanced statistical forecast issued on may 1st and updated on august 1st correlates highly with observations pearson s coefficient of correlation r 0 70 p 0 002 fig 4a categorical prediction hit rate of allocation values for three categories moderate severe extreme however is only 53 delorit et al 2017 this is well below the 60 to 70 categorical skill thresholds ziervogel et al 2005 and bharwani et al 2005 suggest are necessary for forecast uptake by end users comparatively the persistence forecast running average 5 years is highly dampened and tends to over allocate during the observed drought 2012 2015 however there are instances when the persistence forecast is significantly more skillful than the advanced statistical forecast i e 2002 and 2008 specifically when allocations are near normal advanced statistical market price forecasts issued october 1st are moderately correlated with observed chilean market prices rhv 0 50 p 0 05 rlv 0 61 p 0 01 fig 4b c the persistence market price forecasts do not correlate with observed market prices as well rhv 0 13 p 0 62 rlv 0 22 p 0 40 the sum of expected profits using advanced statistical forecast informed option contracts to facilitate water trading over the period investigated 2000 2015 is clearly closer to perfect foresight than expected profit generated from either the persistence informed option contracts or no trading alternatives fig 5 a this is especially evident as the number of inter cooperative water rights grows in general the persistence forecast produces optimistic expected profits which are a function of over allocation during the drought fig 4a the no trading alternative is inefficient because the water trading rulesets governed by demand drives water from low to high value use trading of rights is significant using the multi stage advanced forecast informed option contracts across all endowment scenarios fig 5b the maximum number of rights that can be traded in any year is 10 000 the total held by the lv group for each endowment scenario wholesale rights transfer from lv to hv occurs at least once across 2000 2015 similarly there is at least one year when allocations are sufficient to satisfy both hv and lv demand such that no trades are specified as expected the lv group is a majority seller fig 5b blue dot exceeds red dot for all net endowments other than the largest 19 900 water rights persistence informed option contracts rights trading is significantly lower than the multi stage advanced forecast trading outcomes across endowments fig 5c this result is a function of systematic overallocation by the persistence forecast in general larger allocation values result in lower expected trade volume and for many endowments 15 400 water rights the hv farmer group is a majority seller persistence information also never results in trading outcomes greater than 6000 of the 10 000 possible rights option contract water trading using perfect information observations suggests trading between hv and lv farmer groups should be vigorous across the endowment scenarios fig 5d advanced forecast informed trading fig 5b represents this expectation better than persistence forecast informed trading fig 5c perhaps of greatest importance is that both the prefect and advanced forecast models predict wholesale trade occurrences by the lv cooperative the similarities and general alignment in outcomes of these two suggest that the advanced forecasts may hold value as trade information 3 2 forecast trust units the preceding analysis is based on a single hydrologic simulation assumes farmers as risk neutral and all potential rights as invested in inter cooperative water trading that is farmers are bound to participate in the water trading arrangement the heterogeneous risk attitude model removes these limitations by systematically revaluating farmer willingness to invest water rights in the water trading cooperative using ftus while continuing to simulate over the range of likely inter cooperative water rights ownership scenarios and alternative actions total ftu accumulation difference between advanced forecast informed option contracts water trading and alternative actions persistence and no trading for each mode joint or individual across 2000 2015 illustrates clear positive trends favoring the advanced approach for scenarios where ftus accumulate jointly between the hv and lv cooperatives the value of the advanced forecasts differs significantly between the persistence joint surplus persistence forecast informed options contract water trading jp fig 6 a and no trading joint surplus no trading jn fig 6b alternative actions for jp the skill of the advanced forecasts applied to option contracts water trading holds lower utility to hv and lv farmers at each endowment scenario as compared to jn additionally ftu accumulation decreases with increasing total water rights endowments for the jp case this occurs because increased water rights ownership means water is less scarce the number of water rights owned by the inter cooperative arrangement increases but total irrigated land does not because persistence allocation forecast tends to over allocate fig 4a and increased endowments buffer per hectare allocations the skill of the persistence forecast increases as endowments increase but remains less skillful than the advance forecast alternatively for the jn case fig 6b ftu accumulation increases as endowment increases this increase can be attributed to increases in net allocation which is the number of water rights held on a per hectare average multiplied by the per water right allocation value increased endowments imply more water available for trade and thus the gap between gains from trade under the advanced forecast informed option contracts and the no trading alternative grow in the cases of individual ftu accumulation by the hv and lv cooperatives with persistence ip fig 6c and no trading in fig 6d alternatives the same basic outcome is observed generally fewer ftus are accumulated in ip than in however the relationship between hv and lv farmer willingness to invest in forecast informed option contracts water trading is starkly different in the case of ip fig 6c lv farmer ftu accumulation increases by a factor of two across the increasing range of endowments this can be attributed to the fact that while lv farmer endowments are held static across the endowment scenarios water rights held by the hv cooperative increase in terms of water scarcity underlying scarcity for lv farmers is constant while for hv farmers it decreases thus an inverse ftu accumulation regime is expected for lv positive and hv negative farmers for increasing endowment scenarios in the case of in fig 6d a different ftu accumulation regime is observed like the jn case fig 6b forecast informed trading provides extensive benefits by simply moving water from low to high value use however because hv farmers hold a comparative economic advantage significant latent demand from the no trading alternative is alleviated through forecast informed option contracts trading across all endowment scenarios in many cases for larger water rights endowments hv demand for water can be fully satiated such that supply latency exists for lv farmers lv farmer willingness to sell water exceeds hv farmer demand the effect of supply latency on lv farmer ftu accumulation is negative at larger endowments although forecast trust is comparable with other ftu accumulation and alternative action scenarios comparing the two persistence jp to ip fig 6a to c and no trading alternative scenarios jn to in fig 6b to d joint ftu accumulation is driven by hv farmers this result is expected because of the comparative advantage they hold over lv farmers 3 3 robustness of forecast informed water trade while ftu accumulation over the observed hydrologic record provides insight with respect to generalized willingness to utilize forecasts cooperative size and long term stability may be affected by hydrologic conditions and contract period length here the 85th 50th and 15th percentile water rights investment outcomes from the 10 003 hydrologic simulations are evaluated to illustrate how forecast optimism and pessimism effect ftu accumulation and water rights investment by contract period across the range of water rights endowment scenarios fig 7 for the jp case ftu accumulation and corresponding water rights investment decrease with increasing endowment fig 7a rights investment during contract period n 1 fig 7a top is generally higher than in n 2 fig 7a middle and n 3 fig 7a bottom this is precisely because ftu accumulation period m 1 covers six years one additional year over m 2 and m 3 this is true for all profit based ftu accumulation and alternative action scenarios for all contract periods in the jp case lower bound 15th percentile and median outcomes are relatively consistent although upper bounds 85th percentile for n 2 and n 3 are reduced to the median outcome for half of the endowment scenarios 16 000 19 000 water rights this result suggests that as water rights become available it is increasingly likely that that only farmers with high risk tolerance will invest rights in the advanced forecast informed water trading cooperative however the consistency between results for n 2 and n 3 suggest that a degree of rights investment stability is expected for the jn case fig 7b the number of rights invested by period increases over the range of endowment scenarios median rights investment outcomes for all contract periods and endowment scenarios includes all farmers with high risk tolerance and at least half of farmers from the medium risk tolerance group for the five largest endowment scenarios 16 300 19 900 water rights median outcomes suggest both the high and medium risk tolerant groups will invest water rights for contract periods 2 and 3 the 85th percentile outcome suggests five ftus may accumulate such that all potential rights will be invested in the water trading cooperative corresponding ftu accumulation periods cover 5 years thus only a portion of the low risk tolerant group may consider investment like the jp case the jn case displays rights investment consistency in contract periods n 2 and n 3 which indicates the inter cooperative arrangement reaches relative stability under both individual profit based ftu accumulation cases ip fig 7c and in fig 7d inter endowment rights investments are less stable instability arises from independent ftu accumulation and rights investment decisions by hv and lv farmers the effect supply and demand latency have on per water right profits make the inter cooperative arrangement unstable in comparison to the jp and jn cases ip and in do not possess similar investment stability between contract periods n 2 and n 3 although the general pattern of both the median and upper and lower bounds for ip and in are somewhat consistent during these periods comparing across the four pairings the joint cases jp and jn are best suited to provide inter contract period and endowment stability compared to the individual cases ip and in however rights investment response between jp and jn is drastically different joint assessment of profitability by farmers is only preferred when otherwise no trading is possible jn this result is intriguing given that potential users of advanced forecast informed ocs cannot control whether a competing persistence forecast informed oc cooperative emerges clearly advanced forecast users prefer jp as investment of rights is maximized and stable between endowments if there is no competition for water rights if a competing cooperative emerges using persistence forecast information rendering the no trading outcomes moot fig 7b and d are infeasible ip is the best option available for advanced forecast users the preferred ftu accumulation basis is thus dependent upon the alternative action available to water rights users moving between profit based ftu accumulation cases affects stability inter endowment stability in j greater than i while moving between alternative actions affects participation participation in n greater than p 4 discussion water rights endowment scenarios cooperative size hydrologic regimes drought transpositions and random hydrologic simulations trust unit accumulation bases and alternative actions are all influential in evaluating forecast based water rights investment strategies these conditions are not unique to the elqui valley the results suggest that forecast uptake based on trust unit thresholds and risk group size is evident expected investment of rights is variable 28 70 of total rights available across the scenarios considered the cooperative operates continuously and stably across contract periods except for simulations containing a number 25 or more of extreme drought years in general this suggests that forecast uptake is robust to most hydrologic regimes for farmers with high or medium risk tolerance preferences this clearly highlights that while allocation forecast categorical skill 53 is below what has been suggested as sufficient to evoke forecast acceptance and implementation by farmers typically 60 70 bharwani et al 2005 ziervogel et al 2005 by translating the forecast to specific end user tailored actions through yield and economic models it may possible to increase forecast appeal and uptake for this analysis at least one forecast trust unit is necessary to prompt water rights investment by the most risk tolerant farmer group given the adoption of five and six year periods forecast informed decision making must be more skillful than an alternative in at least three of five 60 or four of six 67 years for positive trust units to accrue given the very high level of positive forecast trust unit accumulation and appropriate water rights investments forecast value has effectively increased through transformation an additional contribution of this work arises from simulating over varied water rights endowment scenarios varying rights ownership is synonymous with an analysis of how water scarcity may affect the size of the inter cooperative arrangement increasing the pool of rights increases the net allocation received given the total number of irrigated hectares remains constant as such the results presented here reveal inter cooperative water trading sensitivity to changes in water scarcity only when high and low value farmers choose to jointly determine forecast trust unit accumulation and face a persistence forecast informed water trading alternative do increased endowments decreased water scarcity negatively impact realized water rights investment this is not the case for the other three scenarios addressed this suggests that forecast value to users increases with or is not sensitive to expanding endowments that is forecast value is robust to several water scarcity scenarios the four scenarios proposed serve to highlight likely conditions under which water trading cooperatives may form alternative actions available to farmers have some effect on rights investment the no trading alternative results in generally more cooperative rights investment than the persistence alternative but are not controllable by those interested in formation of trading cooperatives for example if forecast informed water trading cooperatives form the members cannot control whether a competing persistence forecast based trading cooperative emerges as such interested farmers must consider which forecast trust unit accumulation method to advertise to potential participants joint or individual expected profitability the profit based trust unit accumulation methodology influences long term rights investment stability across endowment scenarios this is made clear comparing joint fig 7a b to individual profit based trust accumulation fig 7c d while joint profit based accumulation has a substantial upside in terms of potential rights investment fig 7b if a competing persistence cooperative forms fig 7a rights investment expectations fall for the joint cases differences in expected investment increase with larger endowment scenarios for this reason if investment stability is preferred farmers may be inclined to advertise individual profit based accumulation statistics fig 7c d which are less sensitive to alternative actions over the range of endowments this is reinforced by the likelihood of larger endowment scenarios being the most realistic of those simulated 18 000 water rights zunino et al 2009 this work treats farmers in the elqui as approximated by risk groups with underlying attitudes toward forecast trust however the true nature of risk attitudes is unknown the group based approach used here mimics that of similar studies but is flexible such that alterations to the number and size of risk groups forecast trust thresholds and characterization of intra group farmer distributions may be altered ground truthing risk attitudes through focused interactions with farmers of varied crop types in the elqui should be conducted to confirm the risk attitude model another limitation of the research presented here is that rights must either be invested in the advanced forecast informed water trading cooperative or in only one alternative action for example if insufficient forecast trust units are accumulated during a specified period and the alternative action analyzed is a persistence informed water trading cooperative rights holders must choose one of these options the model does not permit the option to pursue a no trading alternative it follows that if no trading is the available alternative action the persistence alternative is not available thus the results here limit the total number of alternatives simulated 5 conclusions this work postulates that to provide a fair assessment of the option value of forecasts here translated to inform water option contracts available to water rights holders engaged in irrigated agriculture the robustness of the forecasts to both varied hydrologic conditions and risk attitudes among rights holders must be tested here a robustness framework is presented to evaluate water rights investment by farmers across many water rights endowment scenarios when presented with alternative water trading engagement strategies results indicate that water trading cooperatives will form and operate continuously to promote water market scale economic benefits and use efficiency based on the emergence of forecast informed option contracts used to facilitate temporary water transfers specifically findings here suggest that forecast uptake is not only expected but also robust to hydrologic variability and simulations of water scarcity while rights invested between users is expected to fluctuate in response to prolonged droughts probabilistic simulations suggest that given a 25 or less chance of extreme drought in any year investment of rights reaches stability across a range of likely water rights ownership scenarios this framework is likely transferable beyond the elqui valley case study wherever water rights are implemented and may be traded by those who seek to use water as an input to production user demand may be derived and transparent water trading rulesets may be implemented yet even in cases where the framework may not be directly applied i e rights are not tradeable infrastructure does not permit efficient movement of water the results presented here illustrate the appeal of even marginally skillful season ahead hydrologic forecasts enhanced through translation the full value of climate and hydrology forecast information may not be realized unless it is tailored specifically to end users the conclusions of this study serve to support the inclusion of season ahead hydrologic forecasts as a critical component of water systems management the connectedness of the natural and human components of water systems warrants forecast development and integration consistent with sectoral goals and user preferences to catalyze efficient water systems credit authorship

5741,accurate monthly runoff prediction plays an important role in the planning and management of water resources however owing to climate changes and human activities natural runoff often contains a variety of frequency components and existing monthly runoff estimation techniques may fail to capture potential change processes effectively to overcome this problem we have developed a hybrid model for monthly runoff prediction first observed runoff is decomposed into several subcomponents via variational mode decomposition second support vector machine models based on quantum behaved particle swarm optimization are adopted to identify the input output relationships hidden in each subcomponent finally the total output of all submodules is treated as the final forecasting result for the original runoff three quantitative indexes are considered to test the performance of the developed models the monthly streamflow of two reservoirs in china s yangtze valley is considered as the survey target this area contains the world s largest hydropower project three gorges reservoir and the waterhead of the middle line of asia s largest inter basin water transfer project danjiangkou reservoir test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs keywords monthly runoff prediction decomposition and ensemble machine learning technique swarm intelligence method three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs 1 introduction accurate mid to long term monthly streamflow forecasting is of great importance for a variety of practical engineering problems chau et al 2005 feng et al 2020b jiang et al 2018 such as power generation jiang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 flood control bai et al 2015 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 water supply madani 2011 multi energy scheduling feng et al 2019b

al 2019 and ecological restoration feng et al 2020a ma et al 2013 mu et al 2015 streamflow is typically affected by numerous factors such as precipitation evaporation solar radiation underlying surfaces and atmospheric circulation and presents the composite features of strong nonlinearity high uncertainty and spatiotemporal variability deb et al 2019a owing to rapid economic development in recent years severe climatic variations deb et al 2015a b 2016 and human activities li et al 2009 have increasingly made significant changes to the intrinsic consistency of runoff as a result it is becoming much more difficult to capture the dynamic processes of monthly runoff time series accurately in rapidly changing environments over the past few decades numerous forecasting models have been successfully developed by scholars these models can be broadly divided into three categories physically based models conceptually lumped models and data based models deb et al 2019b niu et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhu et al 2019 generally physically based models contribute to our understanding of rainfall runoff processes but may produce large deviations when rainfall or runoff data are not available conceptually lumped models are unable to capture the non stationarity in rainfall runoff relationships realistically data based models can provide satisfactory forecasting results without knowing detailed information regarding data signals cao et al 2019a wu and chau 2010 yang et al 2017 therefore data based models are becoming increasingly popular in various complex engineering problems cao et al 2019b wang et al 2020 wang et al 2019b wen et al 2019a in recent years many data based methods such as artificial neural networks extreme learning machines support vector machines svm and tree based ensemble models have been employed in hydrological time series forecasting fan et al 2018 taormina and chau 2015 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2016 as a typical representative of data based models svm is based on the vapnik chervonenkis dimension which is the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can process yu et al 2017 and the structural risk minimization principle which is the tradeoff between minimizing training error and minimizing the expected gap between training error and testing error zhang et al 2018 in theory an svm can obtain a globally optimal solution for regression or classification problems which has promoted its widespread application in the fields of water management and hydrology yu et al 2017 however svm performance may be limited in practice since its forecasting results are largely influenced by the choice of computational parameters wang et al 2013 therefore there is room to improve svm performance in monthly runoff prediction based on previous studies it can be said that two different methods are often utilized to improve the generalization ability of svms the first is to determine appropriate computational parameters using swarm intelligence algorithms chen et al 2015 niu et al 2018 taormina et al 2015 the second is to decompose the hidden sub signals in original hydrological time series utilizing data preprocessing techniques huang et al 2009 sang et al 2012 wu et al 2009 variational mode decomposition vmd is a novel non recursive tool that was developed to extract nonlinear trends and harmonics from complex data signals he et al 2019 in vmd a variational model is adopted to search for a sequence of subcomponents with different frequency bands and time resolutions fang et al 2019a unlike empirical mode decomposition emd vmd can effectively alleviate the mode mixing issue where one subcomponent contains two or more sub signals with clear differences or one sub signal is divided into two or more subcomponents with similar features fosso and molinas 2018 naik et al 2018 as a result vmd has been widely used in many research fields including wind speed monitoring and fault diagnosis li et al 2019 nechikkat et al 2015 owing to its simplicity and convenience we adopted vmd as a data preprocessing tool for decomposing monthly runoff series recently quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso which is inspired by quantum mechanics theory was proposed to handle global optimization problems in qpso each potential solution is regarded as a particle possessing quantum behavior and a group of particles iteratively search for an optimal solution within the problem space compared to other intelligent algorithms qpso effectively alleviates the premature convergence problem and provides solutions with higher quality niu et al 2018 since the qspo method has strong global search ability we adopted it to search for appropriate svm parameters this paper proposes a hybrid method for monthly runoff prediction the feasibility of the proposed method is successfully proven using the example of two real world hydropower reservoirs in china the novel contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 to reduce modeling difficulty vmd is used to decompose complicated monthly runoff time series into several relatively simple subcomponents 2 for each subseries an svm is employed to identify input output relationships and the qpso method is used to identify suitable parameter combinations 3 experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method can provide better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional models to the best of our knowledge few previous studies have combined vmd svm and qpso to forecast monthly streamflow indicating that this paper has the potential to fill a significant research gap the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the details of the proposed hybrid method for monthly runoff prediction section 3 contains information regarding selected evaluation indicators simulations and discussions are presented in section 4 section 5 summarizes our conclusions 2 the proposed method 2 1 variational mode decomposition as a novel data decomposition method vmd makes full use of variational models to produce a given number of discrete subcomponents in vmd it is assumed that each model possesses a bandwidth with a certain center frequency niu et al 2020 seo et al 2018 decomposed results can be obtained by identifying the best scheme of constrained variational models during the optimization process the bandwidth and center frequency of each variational model is updated dynamically without loss of generality it is assumed that an original signal f t is decomposed into k different discrete models uk t where each model is assembled around a center pulsation frequency wk the goal is to minimize the total estimated bandwidth of all models while satisfying the constraint that the sum of all obtained models at any time is equal to the original signal which can be expressed as follows 1 min u k t w k t k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k t f t where k is the number of models u k t and w k t are the t th data point and center frequency of the k th model respectively j is an imaginary unit defined such that j 2 1 δ t is the dirac distribution is the convolution operator f t is the t th data of the original signal generally it is difficult to obtain a solution for the constrained optimization problem in eq 1 owing the complex features of both objective functions and constraints to improve execution efficiency the lagrange multiplier and quadratic penalty functions are introduced to transform the abovementioned constrained variational problem into the following unconstrained problem 2 l u k t w k t λ a k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 k 1 k u k t f t 2 2 λ t f t k 1 k u k t where a and λ are the penalty parameter and lagrange multiplier respectively the alternate direction method for multipliers admm which is a famous splitting method for separable optimization problems dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 fu et al 2019a is adopted to seek out the saddle point of the augmented lagrange function in the admm decision variables u k n 1 w k n 1 and λ n 1 are spilt into several different blocks based on their roles and the original problem is divided into numerous smaller sub problems of a single block which will be optimized iteratively by fixing all other blocks at each inner cycle chang et al 2016

used to project input vectors into a high dimensional feature space such that complex input output relationships can be identified in a relatively simple manner wu et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 the original problem cannot be linearly separated in a two dimensional space but separation may become possible after utilizing the transfer function to map the problem into a three dimensional space ji et al 2014 without loss of generality it is assumed that n samples are involved in the training dataset then the svm method for regression relationships can be defined as follows 4 y i w ϕ x i b i 1 2 n where x i r d and y i r are the input vector and output vector in the i th data sample ϕ x i is a nonlinear mapping function for transforming the original input vector into the target feature space w i and b i are the weight vector and bias respectively which can be obtained by solving the following problem 5 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subjective to w ϕ x i b i y i ε ξ i y i w ϕ x i b i ε ξ i where ξ i and ξ i are two positive slack variables denoting the training error of the i th sample with an error tolerance ε c is a parameter for controlling the model s empirical risk by introducing a set of dual variables the following lagrange function can be formulated from the original objective function and corresponding constraints 6 l 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i i 1 n a i ε ξ i w ϕ x i b i y i i 1 n η i ξ i η i ξ i i 1 n a i ε ξ i y i w ϕ x i b i where η i η i a i and a i denote the values of the lagrange multiples eq 6 can then be expressed as a dual optimization problem for choosing lagrange multiples yuan et al 2015 additionally the objective and constraints are quadratic and linear functions of two variables a i and a i respectively which can be expressed as follows 7 max f a i

symmetric positive definite function on a square as the sum of a convergent sequence of product functions ji et al 2014 f x is the simulated value of an svm model with respect to an input vector x here the following traditional radial basis function with a standard deviation of σ is selected as a kernel function 9 k x i x exp x i x 2 2 σ 2 2 3 quantum behaved particle swarm optimization pso is a stochastic evolutionary technique from newtonian mechanics for solving global optimization problems in pso each possible solution is viewed as a particle with a position vector and velocity vector in the problem space a set of particles forms a swarm that searches for the best solutions from generation to generation when addressing a d variable minimization problem n particles can update their position and velocity values as follows 10 v i j t 1 w v i j t c 1 r 1 pbes t i j t x i j t c 2 r 2 gbes t j t x i j t x i j t 1 x i j t v i j t 1 where c 1 and c 2 are cognition and social learning coefficients respectively r 1 and r 2 are two random numbers in the range of 0 1 gbes t j t is the j th position of the best known particle in the swarm at iteration k pbes t i j t is the j th best known position of particle i at iteration k x i j t and v i j t are the j th velocity and position values of particle i at iteration k respectively during the evolutionary process the standard pso method fails to traverse the entire problem space and often falls into local optima inspired by a famous quantum mechanics theory a novel method called qpso was developed to enhance pso performance in qpso each solution is viewed as a particle with quantum behavior and its velocity and position vectors cannot be determined simultaneously owing to the uncertainty principle xia et al 2019 for each particle its quantum state is described by a wave function ψ x and the corresponding probability at position x can be obtained by probability density function ψ x 2 for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that each particle moves in a d dimensional space with a potential well around a local attractor p the wave function can be expressed as 11 ψ x 1 l e x p l where l is the standard deviation of the double exponential distribution the probability density function ψ x 2 can be expressed as 12 ψ x 2 1 l e 2 x p l and the normalized probability distribution function f x can be expressed as 13 f x x ψ x 2 d x 1 e 2 x p l using the monte carlo method the updating equation for each particle can be expressed as 14 x i j t 1 p j t a mbes t j t x i j t ln 1 φ 1 if φ 2 0 5 x i j t 1 p j t a mbes t

positions at iteration k 2 4 proposed method for monthly streamflow time series prediction as mentioned above hydrological time series are often nonlinear and nonstationary because of a variety of factors including climate change and human activity ji et al 2014 xu et al 2017 zhao and zhao 2014 to enhance the prediction accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction we propose the hybrid method model illustrated in fig 2 in the proposed method vmd is first used to decompose original monthly runoff data series into a series of subcomponents second svms are trained to model the complex relationships between the input and output variables in each subcomponent the qpso method is used to optimize the computational parameters of each svm finally the total outputs of all svms are combined to produce a final forecasting result for the original runoff time series the proposed approach is composed of two main stages the first is the decomposition stage where vmd is used to reduce the modeling difficulty of the original runoff time series the second is the ensemble stage where the information from all extracted subseries is merged to generate the final result this indicates that the hybrid method has a higher probability to produce a forecasting model with a more compact structure and better generalization ability the detailed procedures used by the proposed model can be roughly divided into the following steps step 1 prepare data for modeling we use vmd to decompose an original monthly runoff series into a sequence of subseries with different frequencies and spatiotemporal resolutions the data in all subseries are divided into training and testing datasets that are normalized to a range of 0 1 as 17 x i b a x i min 1 i n x i max 1 i n x i min 1 i n x i where x i and x i are the normalized and original value of the i th data sample respectively a and b are the adjusting parameters n is the number of data step 2 parameter setting we use the partial autocorrelation function pacf and domain knowledge to determine the set of input variables then define the values of basic parameters such as the number of iterations k and particles i for qpso step 3 model optimization the qpso method is executed independently to search for the optimal parameters for all svms where each particle s position vector is composed of a penalty coefficient c insensitive loss function ε and standard deviation of the kernel function σ step 3 0 set the subseries index m 1 step 3 1 set the iteration index k 1 then generate an initial swarm in the problem space step 3 2 set k k 1 calculate the fitness values of all particles to update the best position of each particle and global best position of the current swarm step 3 3 calculate the contraction expansion coefficient and then update the positions of all particles using eqs 14 16 step 3 4 check the stopping criterion if k k stop iteration and select the global best position as the optimal parameter for the svm in the m th subseries otherwise return to step 3 2 step 3 5 set m m 1 if m exceeds the total number of subcomponents stop calculation otherwise return to step 3 1 for a new training process step 4 engineering application by this time all svms for each subseries will be trained for prediction in practice the original input variables for each subseries should be normalized in the range of 0 1 and the simulated output variables should be renormalized to obtain true predicted values 3 evaluation indicators in this section three evaluation indicators are discussed for testing the forecasting abilities of different forecasting models namely root mean squared error rmse the coefficient of correlation r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ce rmse can effectively measure the performance of a forecasting model when tracking high runoffs r is adopted to measure the linear dependence relationships between observed data and the simulated outputs of a forecasting model ce is used to test the deviation of a forecasting model generally models with larger values of r and ce or smaller values of rmse provide better forecasting performance wang et al 2015 the definitions of these three indexes are provided below rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 ce 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y avg 2 20 r i 1 n y i y avg y i y avg i 1 n y i y avg 2 y i y avg 2 where y i and y i denote the observed and model predicted values for the i th sample respectively y avg and y avg denote the average values of all observed and model predicted values respectively 4 case studies 4 1 study area and dataset in this section two huge multipurpose reservoirs three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs located on the yangtze river are considered as research objects with approximately 22 5 gw of installed capacity and 39 3 billion m3 of storage volume the three gorges project has become the largest hydropower plant in the world for the three gorges reservoir flood control is the primary goal during the flood season while power generation and navigation are the main focus during the dry season with a total storage volume of approximately 29 billion m3 the danjiangkou reservoir has become the largest artificial freshwater lake in asia for this reservoir the main goal is to provide water for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china therefore accurate monthly runoff prediction is of great importance for improving the overall dispatching effects of these two reservoirs monthly streamflow data from the three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs were used to test the feasibility of the proposed method fig 3 presents runoff data for these reservoirs where the data for three gorges runs from 1882 to 2015 and the data for danjiangkou runs from 1930 to 2017 one can see that the monthly streamflow of the two reservoirs varies within a relatively wide range indicating that the modeling difficulty for forecasting models is very high for these two reservoirs data from the final 40 y were utilized for testing and the other data were utilized for training in the training dataset approximately 85 of the data were utilized for parameter identification and the remainder were utilized for validation vmd was implemented in matlab and the other methods extreme learning machine elm artificial neural network ann svm and qpso were coded in java language 4 2 decomposition results the original monthly runoff time series were decomposed into a sequence of disjoint subseries using vmd according to the research results reported in previous papers the number of subseries often has a significant influence on the decomposed results wen et al 2019b to achieve satisfactory performance the number of subcomponents was determined using the traditional emd method figs 4 and 5 present the decomposed results for the two reservoirs using the vmd and emd methods respectively the frequencies of the generated subseries vary from high to low and there are clear differences in the obtained subcomponents for each reservoir which indicate the feasibility and variability of the two methods in terms of extracting intrinsic information from original streamflow time series 4 3 input variable determination generally the set of input variables has a direct effect on the final forecasting results in this study the pacf was selected as a potential indicator for identifying appropriate input variables the following two criteria are often utilized in practice 1 the variable at lag t will be selected as an input when its pacf value is out of the confidence interval and 2 the previous value will be regarded as an input when all pacf values fall inside the specified confidence interval fig 6 presents the pacf values for different series of three gorges data where the first subgraph contains the pacf values of the original runoff time series and the others contain the pacf values of the decomposed subseries based on full consideration of the information in fig 6 and other relevant factors in practical applications the input variables for various series of three gorges reservoir data are listed in table 1 where xt is the target output variable and xt p denotes the p antecedent variables of the target output variable one can see that the number of input variables is not exactly the same for all subseries demonstrating the complex and variable features of monthly runoff data from the target reservoirs 4 4 model development to verify the practicability of the proposed hybrid method seven methods were considered for comparison namely ann elm svm and the modified svm models svm emd svm ensemble emd svm eemd svm qpso emd and svm qpso eemd detailed information regarding these models is provided in this section 1 ann and elm models for the standard ann and elm models the original streamflow was selected as the target object the numbers of neurons in the input and output layers were set to four and one respectively the trial and error method was used to determine the best number of hidden neurons the back propagation method was utilized to train the ann model the moore penrose generalized inverse method was utilized to find the hidden output weights in the elm model after randomly generating its input hidden weights and hidden biases 2 svm model for the standard svm model the original streamflow was selected as the target object the radial basis function was selected as the kernel function the grid search method was utilized to identify the computational parameters for which the final forecasting model yielded the minimum rmse value 3 svm emd and svm eemd models for the svm emd and svm eemd models the original runoff was first divided into several subseries utilizing emd or eemd each subseries was then modeled utilizing a standard svm the set of input variables for each subseries is listed in table 1 tor the emd method no additional parameters were required for the eemd method the number of subseries was equal to that of the emd method the ensemble number was set to 100 and the amplitude of white noise was 0 2 times the standard deviation of the studied data 4 svm qpso emd and svm qpso eemd models for the svm qpso emd and svm qpso eemd models the original runoff was divided into several subseries utilizing emd or eemd each subseries was then modeled utilizing an svm combined with the qpso method the computational parameters for emd and eemd were the same as those discussed above for each svm model the set of input variables is listed in table 1 the numbers of solutions and iterations for qpso were set to 50 and 200 respectively 4 5 simulation results 4 5 1 results for the three gorges reservoir based on the descriptions above the original streamflow runoff and extracted subseries were modelled utilizing different methods table 2 lists the detailed statistical indexes of different forecasting models for three gorges for both the training and testing phases one can see that when predicting the monthly runoff in three gorges the hybrid method is able to provide the best results in terms of all considered indexes overall the performances of the modified svm methods are significantly better than those of the conventional methods svm elm and ann for example compared with the rmse value of the ann method the hybrid method yields reductions of approximately 27 1 and 25 0 during the training and testing phases respectively compared to the svm method the improvements in the prediction results of the hybrid method in terms of r and ce are up to 4 2 and 8 9 during the testing phase respectively compared to the svm qpso eemd method the hybrid method exhibits an rmse reduction of up to 5 4 during the training phase this analysis demonstrates that the proposed hybrid method can provide satisfactory forecasting results for complex hydrological time series to verify the performance of the hybrid method fig 7 presents the original streamflow and simulated values obtained by different forecasting methods during the testing stage one can clearly see that all of the methods provide decent performance in terms of tracking the dynamic changes in monthly runoff demonstrating the feasibility of forecasting models as a whole the modified svm methods combined with other methods outperform the original svm demonstrating the importance of parameter optimization and data partitioning for improving the performance of the svm model the proposed hybrid method outperforms all other methods in terms of approximating the variation tendencies of monthly streamflow proving the effectiveness of the combined elements in terms of enhancing the generalization capability of the forecasting model therefore it can be concluded that the proposed hybrid method is an effective tool for forecasting the monthly runoff series of three gorges the original and forecasted peak flows during the testing phase are presented in fig 8 one can see that all of the forecasting models can trace the changes in peak flow to some extent but the performance of the hybrid method is superior to those of the traditional methods for example the absolute relative error of the average forecasting results of the hybrid method is approximately 3 8 which is less than the values of 15 9 for ann 7 9 for elm and 13 5 for svm for the maximum peak flow the underestimation of the hybrid method 9 8 is less the values of 43 1 for ann 32 9 for elm 47 6 for svm and 28 8 for svm emd therefore the proposed hybrid method is a promising alternative tool in terms of capturing the peak flows of monthly streamflow in three gorges 4 5 2 results for the danjiangkou reservoir table 3 lists the forecasting results obtained by different methods for the danjiangkou reservoir one can see that the results of the ann and elm methods are inferior to those of the other methods the modified svm methods outperform the ann elm and svm methods the hybrid method exhibits the best performance in terms of all indexes for example during the training phase the proposed method is capable of reducing the values of ce and r by approximately 35 9 and 89 1 compared to the svm this reaffirms the superior performance of the proposed hybrid method for monthly runoff prediction fig 9 presents the prediction results for the compared methods for the danjiangkou reservoir during the testing phase it can be seen that the performances of all methods for monthly runoff simulation are satisfactory the hybrid method exhibits the best performance with a trend line very close to the observed data line in contrast there are clear deviations between the observed data and the outputs of the other methods additionally the standard svm method fails to capture the abrupt changes in runoff during flood season unlike the modified svm methods therefore the proposed hybrid method is an effective tool for monthly streamflow prediction because it can provide superior performance compared to several existing methods during the testing phase 4 6 discussion of results our simulations revealed that there are clear differences between the elm ann and svm methods indicating the importance of training tools in forecasting models for the traditional ann model the gradient based training strategy suffers from a few shortcomings such as overfitting and dimensionality issues dong et al 2019 ren et al 2018 yan et al 2019 the standard elm method tends to fall into local optima based on the predetermination of input hidden weights and hidden biases the conventional svm method utilizing the structural risk minimization principle can overcome the weaknesses of ann and elm to some extent and provide relatively good forecasting results however runoff is affected by a variety of factors and contains different frequency components feng et al 2019c hui et al 2016a hui et al 2016b madani 2014 zhao et al 2019 therefore for a single forecasting model it is often difficult to fully reflect the formation mechanisms and change rules of natural streamflow accurately since only one resolution component is utilized to establish the prediction module indicating that other resolution subcomponents in the original runoff time series cannot be separated effectively to solve this problem decomposition methods emd eemd and vmd are used to identify different resolution intervals the features of each subseries such as periodicity and volatility can then be clearly separated resulting in a significant reduction in modeling difficulty therefore the performances of the modified svm methods such as svm emd and svm eemd were superior to those of the standard svm method which matches the results of recent similar studies huang et al 2014 napolitano et al 2011 tan et al 2018 the proposed hybrid method outperformed all of the compared methods possible reasons for the superiority of the hybrid method are analyzed below first vmd decomposes an original monthly time series into several subcomponents facilitating effective identification of frequency changes in the original runoff data series second the svm method is adopted to model the complicated input output relationships hidden in each subseries and the qpso method is used to identify the optimal computational parameters which can effectively improve the generalization ability of svms finally final forecasting results are obtained by summing the simulated outputs of all svm models providing a synergetic effect and improving the performance of the hybrid forecasting model niu et al 2019 overall the incorporation of data decomposition and swarm intelligence into the forecasting model can provide accurate monthly streamflow forecasting results for operators which can serve as worthy technical references for the global research community in terms of hydrological prediction it should be noted that although the feasibility of the proposed method for monthly runoff prediction was verified utilizing real world data there are still several potential directions for future research the first is to test additional data decomposition strategies to increase the quality of obtained subcomponents the second is to develop new effective swarm intelligence methods for finding better parameter combinations for the forecasting model the last is to test additional artificial intelligence or machine learning methods to improve the generalization capabilities of the forecasting model in the future it is necessary to expand our research based on these three aspects and develop more practical forecasting methods to provide technical support for water resource management 5 conclusion over the past few decades methods for improving hydrological forecasting accuracy have received significant attention from scholars and engineers in the water resources field to enrich hydrological forecasting theory we developed a hybrid forecasting model for monthly runoff prediction first vmd is used to decompose an original runoff series into a series of subcomponents second an svm optimized by qpso is utilized to forecast all subcomponents finally the sum of the forecasted values of all subcomponents is treated as the final forecasted value monthly streamflow data from two huge reservoirs in china three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs were collected to test the performance of the developed forecasting model the results revealed that the proposed hybrid model can provide better forecasting results than several existing methods with respect to three statistical indexes therefore the proposed method based on data decomposition and parameter optimization strategies is a promising alternative for improving the forecasting results of mid to long term

5741,accurate monthly runoff prediction plays an important role in the planning and management of water resources however owing to climate changes and human activities natural runoff often contains a

test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs keywords monthly runoff prediction decomposition and ensemble machine learning technique swarm intelligence method three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs 1 introduction accurate mid to long term monthly streamflow forecasting is of great importance for a variety of practical engineering problems chau et al 2005 feng et al 2020b jiang et al 2018 such as power generation jiang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 flood control bai et al 2015 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 water supply madani 2011 multi energy scheduling feng et al 2019b 2020c environmental protection he et al 2018 operation rule derivation chang et al 2018 water distribution system optimization zheng et al 2015 dam construction pang et al 2018a pang et al 2018b xu et al 2019 and ecological restoration feng et al 2020a ma et al 2013 mu et al 2015 streamflow is typically affected by numerous factors such as precipitation evaporation solar radiation underlying surfaces and atmospheric circulation and presents the composite features of strong nonlinearity high uncertainty and spatiotemporal variability deb et al 2019a owing to rapid economic development in recent years severe climatic variations deb et al 2015a b 2016 and human activities li et al 2009 have increasingly made significant changes to the intrinsic consistency of runoff as a result it is becoming much more difficult to capture the dynamic processes of monthly runoff time series accurately in rapidly changing environments over the past few decades numerous forecasting models have been successfully developed by scholars these models can be broadly divided into three categories physically based models conceptually lumped models and data based models deb et al 2019b niu et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhu et al 2019 generally physically based models contribute to our understanding of rainfall runoff processes but may produce large deviations when rainfall or runoff data are not available conceptually lumped models are unable to capture the non stationarity in rainfall runoff relationships realistically data based models can provide satisfactory forecasting results without knowing detailed information regarding data signals cao et al 2019a wu and chau 2010 yang et al 2017 therefore data based models are becoming increasingly popular in various complex engineering problems cao et al 2019b wang et al 2020 wang et al 2019b wen et al 2019a in recent years many data based methods such as artificial neural networks extreme learning machines support vector machines svm and tree based ensemble models have been employed in hydrological time series forecasting fan et al 2018 taormina and chau 2015 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2016 as a typical representative of data based models svm is based on the vapnik chervonenkis dimension which is the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can process yu et al 2017 and the structural risk minimization principle which is the tradeoff between minimizing training error and minimizing the expected gap between training error and testing error zhang et al 2018 in theory an svm can obtain a globally optimal solution for regression or classification problems which has promoted its widespread application in the fields of water management and hydrology yu et al 2017 however svm performance may be limited in practice since its forecasting results are largely influenced by the choice of computational parameters wang et al 2013 therefore there is room to improve svm performance in monthly runoff prediction based on previous studies it can be said that two different methods are often utilized to improve the generalization ability of svms the first is to determine appropriate computational parameters using swarm intelligence algorithms chen et al 2015 niu et al 2018 taormina et al 2015 the second is to decompose the hidden sub signals in original hydrological time series utilizing data preprocessing techniques huang et al 2009 sang et al 2012 wu et al 2009 variational mode decomposition vmd is a novel non recursive tool that was developed to extract nonlinear trends and harmonics from complex data signals he et al 2019 in vmd a variational model is adopted to search for a sequence of subcomponents with different frequency bands and time resolutions fang et al 2019a unlike empirical mode decomposition emd vmd can effectively alleviate the mode mixing issue where one subcomponent contains two or more sub signals with clear differences or one sub signal is divided into two or more subcomponents with similar features fosso and molinas 2018 naik et al 2018 as a result vmd has been widely used in many research fields including wind speed monitoring and fault diagnosis li et al 2019 nechikkat et al 2015 owing to its simplicity and convenience we adopted vmd as a data preprocessing tool for decomposing monthly runoff series recently quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso which is inspired by quantum mechanics theory was proposed to handle global optimization problems in qpso each potential solution is regarded as a particle possessing quantum behavior and a group of particles iteratively search for an optimal solution within the problem space compared to other intelligent algorithms qpso effectively alleviates the premature convergence problem and provides solutions with higher quality niu et al 2018 since the qspo method has strong global search ability we adopted it to search for appropriate svm parameters this paper proposes a hybrid method for monthly runoff prediction the feasibility of the proposed method is successfully proven using the example of two real world hydropower reservoirs in china the novel contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 to reduce modeling difficulty vmd is used to decompose complicated monthly runoff time series into several relatively simple subcomponents 2 for each subseries an svm is employed to identify input output relationships and the qpso method is used to identify suitable parameter combinations 3 experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method can provide better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional models to the best of our knowledge few previous studies have combined vmd svm and qpso to forecast monthly streamflow indicating that this paper has the potential to fill a significant research gap the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the details of the proposed hybrid method for monthly runoff prediction section 3 contains information regarding selected evaluation indicators simulations and discussions are presented in section 4 section 5 summarizes our conclusions 2 the proposed method 2 1 variational mode decomposition as a novel data decomposition method vmd makes full use of variational models to produce a given number of discrete subcomponents in vmd it is assumed that each model possesses a bandwidth with a certain center frequency niu et al 2020 seo et al 2018 decomposed results can be obtained by identifying the best scheme of constrained variational models during the optimization process the bandwidth and center frequency of each variational model is updated dynamically without loss of generality it is assumed that an original signal f t is decomposed into k different discrete models uk t where each model is assembled around a center pulsation frequency wk the goal is to minimize the total estimated bandwidth of all models while satisfying the constraint that the sum of all obtained models at any time is equal to the original signal which can be expressed as follows 1 min u k t w k t k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 s t k 1 k u k t f t where k is the number of models u k t and w k t are the t th data point and center frequency of the k th model respectively j is an imaginary unit defined such that j 2 1 δ t is the dirac distribution is the convolution operator f t is the t th data of the original signal generally it is difficult to obtain a solution for the constrained optimization problem in eq 1 owing the complex features of both objective functions and constraints to improve execution efficiency the lagrange multiplier and quadratic penalty functions are introduced to transform the abovementioned constrained variational problem into the following unconstrained problem 2 l u k t w k t λ a k 1 k t δ t j π t u k t e j w k t 2 2 k 1 k u k t f t 2 2 λ t f t k 1 k u k t where a and λ are the penalty parameter and lagrange multiplier respectively the alternate direction method for multipliers admm which is a famous splitting method for separable optimization problems dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 fu et al 2019a is adopted to seek out the saddle point of the augmented lagrange function in the admm decision variables u k n 1 w k n 1 and λ n 1 are spilt into several different blocks based on their roles and the original problem is divided into numerous smaller sub problems of a single block which will be optimized iteratively by fixing all other blocks at each inner cycle chang et al 2016 fu et al 2019b when a preset stopping criterion is met the entire iterative optimization process in eq 3 is halted 3 u k n 1 f w i k k u i n 1 w i k k u i n w 0 5 λ w 1 2 a w w k n 2 w k n 1 0 w u k n

i t λ t and u k n 1 t respectively 2 2 support vector machine an svm is an effective statistical learning method for regression and classification problems in an svm linear or nonlinear models are used to project input vectors into a high dimensional feature space such that complex input output relationships can be identified in a relatively simple manner wu et al 2008 as shown in fig 1 the original problem cannot be linearly separated in a two dimensional space but separation may become possible after utilizing the transfer function to map the problem into a three dimensional space ji et al 2014 without loss of generality it is assumed that n samples are involved in the training dataset then the svm method for regression relationships can be defined as follows 4 y i w ϕ x i b i 1 2 n where x i r d and y i r are the input vector and output vector in the i th data sample ϕ x i is a nonlinear mapping function for transforming the original input vector into the target feature space w i and b i are the weight vector and bias respectively which can be obtained by solving the following problem 5 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subjective to w ϕ x i b i y i ε ξ i y i w ϕ x i b i ε ξ i where ξ i and ξ i are two positive slack variables denoting the training error of the i th sample with an error tolerance ε c is a parameter for controlling the model s empirical risk by introducing a set of dual variables the following lagrange function can be formulated from the original objective function and corresponding constraints 6 l 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i i 1 n a i ε ξ i w ϕ x i b i y i i 1 n η i ξ i η i ξ i i 1 n a i ε ξ i y i w ϕ x i b i where η i η i a i and a i denote the values of the lagrange multiples eq 6 can then be expressed as a dual optimization problem for choosing lagrange multiples yuan et al 2015 additionally the objective and constraints are quadratic and linear functions of two variables a i and a i respectively which can be expressed as follows 7 max f a i a i i 1 l y i a i a i ε i 1 l a i a i 1 2 i 1 l j 1 l a i a i a j a j k x i x j subjective to i 1 n a i a i 0 0 a i a i c the optimal weight vector for the problem in eq 7 is expressed as w i 1 n x i a i a i meaning the regression function for an svm model can be expressed as 8 f x i 1 n a i a i k x i x b where k x i x j is a kernel function satisfying mercer s condition which represents a symmetric positive definite function on a square as the sum of a convergent sequence of product functions ji et al 2014 f x is the simulated value of an svm model with respect to an input vector x here the following traditional radial basis function with a standard deviation of σ is selected as a kernel function 9 k x i x exp x i x 2 2 σ 2 2 3 quantum behaved particle swarm optimization pso is a stochastic evolutionary technique from newtonian mechanics for solving global optimization problems in pso each possible solution is viewed as a particle with a position vector and velocity vector in the problem space a set of particles forms a swarm that searches for the best solutions from generation to generation when addressing a d variable minimization problem n particles can update their position and velocity values as follows 10 v i j t 1 w v i j t c 1 r 1 pbes t i j t x i j t c 2 r 2 gbes t j t x i j t x i j t 1 x i j t v i j t 1 where c 1 and c 2 are cognition and social learning coefficients respectively r 1 and r 2 are two random numbers in the range of 0 1 gbes t j t is the j th position of the best known particle in the swarm at iteration k pbes t i j t is the j th best known position of particle i at iteration k x i j t and v i j t are the j th velocity and position values of particle i at iteration k respectively during the evolutionary process the standard pso method fails to traverse the entire problem space and often falls into local optima inspired by a famous quantum mechanics theory a novel method called qpso was developed to enhance pso performance in qpso each solution is viewed as a particle with quantum behavior and its velocity and position vectors cannot be determined simultaneously owing to the uncertainty principle xia et al 2019 for each particle its quantum state is described by a wave function ψ x and the corresponding probability at position x can be obtained by probability density function ψ x 2 for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that each particle moves in a d dimensional space with a potential well around a local attractor p the wave function can be expressed as 11 ψ x 1 l e x p l where l is the standard deviation of the double exponential distribution the probability density function ψ x 2 can be expressed as 12 ψ x 2 1 l e 2 x p l and the normalized probability distribution function f x can be expressed as 13 f x x ψ x 2 d x 1 e 2 x p l using the monte carlo method the updating equation for each particle can be expressed as 14 x i j t 1 p j t a mbes t j t x i j t ln 1 φ 1 if φ 2 0 5 x i j t 1 p j t a mbes t j t x i j t ln 1 φ 1 if φ 2 0 5 15 p j t φ 3 g b e s t j t φ 4 p b e s t i j t φ 3 φ 4 16 mbes t j t 1 n i 1 n pbes t i j t where a is the contraction expansion factor at iteration k φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 and φ 4 are random numbers uniformly distributed in the range of 0 1 p j t is the j th value of the local attractor at iteration k mbes t j t is the j th average value of all the best known particle positions at iteration k 2 4 proposed method for monthly streamflow time series prediction as mentioned above hydrological time series are often nonlinear and nonstationary because of a variety of factors including climate change and human activity ji et al 2014 xu et al 2017 zhao and zhao 2014 to enhance the prediction accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction we propose the hybrid method model illustrated in fig 2 in the proposed method vmd is first used to decompose original monthly runoff data series into a series of subcomponents second svms are trained to model the complex relationships between the input and output variables in each subcomponent the qpso method is used to optimize the computational parameters of each svm finally the total outputs of all svms are combined to produce a final forecasting result for the original runoff time series the proposed approach is composed of two main stages the first is the decomposition stage where vmd is used to reduce the modeling difficulty of the original runoff time series the second is the ensemble stage where the information from all extracted subseries is merged to generate the final result this indicates that the hybrid method has a higher probability to produce a forecasting model with a more compact structure and better generalization ability the detailed procedures used by the proposed model can be roughly divided into the following steps step 1 prepare data for modeling we use vmd to decompose an original monthly runoff series into a sequence of subseries with different frequencies and spatiotemporal resolutions the data in all subseries are divided into training and testing datasets that are normalized to a range of 0 1 as 17 x i b a x i min 1 i n x i max 1 i n x i min 1 i n x i where x i and x i are the normalized and original value of the i th data sample respectively a and b are the adjusting parameters n is the number of data step 2 parameter setting we use the partial autocorrelation function pacf and domain knowledge to determine the set of input variables then define the values of basic parameters such as the number of iterations k and particles i for qpso step 3 model optimization the qpso method is executed independently to search for the optimal parameters for all svms where each particle s position vector is composed of a penalty coefficient c insensitive loss function ε and standard deviation of the kernel function σ step 3 0 set the subseries index m 1 step 3 1 set the iteration index k 1 then generate an initial swarm in the problem space step 3 2 set k k 1 calculate the fitness values of all particles to update the best position of each particle and global best position of the current swarm step 3 3 calculate the contraction expansion coefficient and then update the positions of all particles using eqs 14 16 step 3 4 check the stopping criterion if k k stop iteration and select the global best position as the optimal parameter for the svm in the m th subseries otherwise return to step 3 2 step 3 5 set m m 1 if m exceeds the total number of subcomponents stop calculation otherwise return to step 3 1 for a new training process step 4 engineering application by this time all svms for each subseries will be trained for prediction in practice the original input variables for each subseries should be normalized in the range of 0 1 and the simulated output variables should be renormalized to obtain true predicted values 3 evaluation indicators in this section three evaluation indicators are discussed for testing the forecasting abilities of different forecasting models namely root mean squared error rmse the coefficient of correlation r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ce rmse can effectively measure the performance of a forecasting model when tracking high runoffs r is adopted to measure the linear dependence relationships between observed data and the simulated outputs of a forecasting model ce is used to test the deviation of a forecasting model generally models with larger values of r and ce or smaller values of rmse provide better forecasting performance wang et al 2015 the definitions of these three indexes are provided below rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 ce 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y avg 2 20 r i 1 n y i y avg y i y avg i 1 n y i y avg 2 y i y avg 2 where y i and y i denote the observed and model predicted values for the i th sample respectively y avg and y avg denote the average values of all observed and model predicted values respectively 4 case studies 4 1 study area and dataset in this section two huge multipurpose reservoirs three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs located on the yangtze river are considered as research objects with approximately 22 5 gw of installed capacity and 39 3 billion m3 of storage volume the three gorges project has become the largest hydropower plant in the world for the three gorges reservoir flood control is the primary goal during the flood season while power generation and navigation are the main focus during the dry season with a total storage volume of approximately 29 billion m3 the danjiangkou reservoir has become the largest artificial freshwater lake in asia for this reservoir the main goal is to provide water for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china therefore accurate monthly runoff prediction is of great importance for improving the overall dispatching effects of these two reservoirs monthly streamflow data from the three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs were used to test the feasibility of the proposed method fig 3 presents runoff data for these reservoirs where the data for three gorges runs from 1882 to 2015 and the data for danjiangkou runs from 1930 to 2017 one can see that the monthly streamflow of the two reservoirs varies within a relatively wide range indicating that the modeling difficulty for forecasting models is very high for these two reservoirs data from the final 40 y were utilized for testing and the other data were utilized for training in the training dataset approximately 85 of the data were utilized for parameter identification and the remainder were utilized for validation vmd was implemented in matlab and the other methods extreme learning machine elm artificial neural network ann svm and qpso were coded in java language 4 2 decomposition results the original monthly runoff time series were decomposed into a sequence of disjoint subseries using vmd according to the research results reported in previous papers the number of subseries often has a significant influence on the decomposed results wen et al 2019b to achieve satisfactory performance the number of subcomponents was determined using the traditional emd method figs 4 and 5 present the decomposed results for the two reservoirs using the vmd and emd methods respectively the frequencies of the generated subseries vary from high to low and there are clear differences in the obtained subcomponents for each reservoir which indicate the feasibility and variability of the two methods in terms of extracting intrinsic information from original streamflow time series 4 3 input variable determination generally the set of input variables has a direct effect on the final forecasting results in this study the pacf was selected as a potential indicator for identifying appropriate input variables the following two criteria are often utilized in practice 1 the variable at lag t will be selected as an input when its pacf value is out of the confidence interval and 2 the previous value will be regarded as an input when all pacf values fall inside the specified confidence interval fig 6 presents the pacf values for different series of three gorges data where the first subgraph contains the pacf values of the original runoff time series and the others contain the pacf values of the decomposed subseries based on full consideration of the information in fig 6 and other relevant factors in practical applications the input variables for various series of three gorges reservoir data are listed in table 1 where xt is the target output variable and xt p denotes the p antecedent variables of the target output variable one can see that the number of input variables is not exactly the same for all subseries demonstrating the complex and variable features of monthly runoff data from the target reservoirs 4 4 model development to verify the practicability of the proposed hybrid method seven methods were considered for comparison namely ann elm svm and the modified svm models svm emd svm ensemble emd svm eemd svm qpso emd and svm qpso eemd detailed information regarding these models is provided in this section 1 ann and elm models for the standard ann and elm models the original streamflow was selected as the target object the numbers of neurons in the input and output layers were set to four and one respectively the trial and error method was used to determine the best number of hidden neurons the back propagation method was utilized to train the ann model the moore penrose generalized inverse method was utilized to find the hidden output weights in the elm model after randomly generating its input hidden weights and hidden biases 2 svm model for the standard svm model the original streamflow was selected as the target object the radial basis function was selected as the kernel function the grid search method was utilized to identify the computational parameters for which the final forecasting model yielded the minimum rmse value 3 svm emd and svm eemd models for the svm emd and svm eemd models the original runoff was first divided into several subseries utilizing emd or eemd each subseries was then modeled utilizing a standard svm the set of input variables for each subseries is listed in table 1 tor the emd method no additional parameters were required for the eemd method the number of subseries was equal to that of the emd method the ensemble number was set to 100 and the amplitude of white noise was 0 2 times the standard deviation of the studied data 4 svm qpso emd and svm qpso eemd models for the svm qpso emd and svm qpso eemd models the original runoff was divided into several subseries utilizing emd or eemd each subseries was then modeled utilizing an svm combined with the qpso method the computational parameters for emd and eemd were the same as those discussed above for each svm model the set of input variables is listed in table 1 the numbers of solutions and iterations for qpso were set to 50 and 200 respectively 4 5 simulation results 4 5 1 results for the three gorges reservoir based on the descriptions above the original streamflow runoff and extracted subseries were modelled utilizing different methods table 2 lists the detailed statistical indexes of different forecasting models for three gorges for both the training and testing phases one can see that when predicting the monthly runoff in three gorges the hybrid method is able to provide the best results in terms of all considered indexes overall the performances of the modified svm methods are significantly better than those of the conventional methods svm elm and ann for example compared with the rmse value of the ann method the hybrid method yields reductions of approximately 27 1 and 25 0 during the training and testing phases respectively compared to the svm method the improvements in the prediction results of the hybrid method in terms of r and ce are up to 4 2 and 8 9 during the testing phase respectively compared to the svm qpso eemd method the hybrid method exhibits an rmse reduction of up to 5 4 during the training phase this analysis demonstrates that the proposed hybrid method can provide satisfactory forecasting results for complex hydrological time series to verify the performance of the hybrid method fig 7 presents the original streamflow and simulated values obtained by different forecasting methods during the testing stage one can clearly see that all of the methods provide decent performance in terms of tracking the dynamic changes in monthly runoff demonstrating the feasibility of forecasting models as a whole the modified svm methods combined with other methods outperform the original svm demonstrating the importance of parameter optimization and data partitioning for improving the performance of the svm model the proposed hybrid method outperforms all other methods in terms of approximating the variation tendencies of monthly streamflow proving the effectiveness of the combined elements in terms of enhancing the generalization capability of the forecasting model therefore it can be concluded that the proposed hybrid method is an effective tool for forecasting the monthly runoff series of three gorges the original and forecasted peak flows during the testing phase are presented in fig 8 one can see that all of the forecasting models can trace the changes in peak flow to some extent but the performance of the hybrid method is superior to those of the traditional methods for example the absolute relative error of the average forecasting results of the hybrid method is approximately 3 8 which is less than the values of 15 9 for ann 7 9 for elm and 13 5 for svm for the maximum peak flow the underestimation of the hybrid method 9 8 is less the values of 43 1 for ann 32 9 for elm 47 6 for svm and 28 8 for svm emd therefore the proposed hybrid method is a promising alternative tool in terms of capturing the peak flows of monthly streamflow in three gorges 4 5 2 results for the danjiangkou reservoir table 3 lists the forecasting results obtained by different methods for the danjiangkou reservoir one can see that the results of the ann and elm methods are inferior to those of the other methods the modified svm methods outperform the ann elm and svm methods the hybrid method exhibits the best performance in terms of all indexes for example during the training phase the proposed method is capable of reducing the values of ce and r by approximately 35 9 and 89 1 compared to the svm this reaffirms the superior performance of the proposed hybrid method for monthly runoff prediction fig 9 presents the prediction results for the compared methods for the danjiangkou reservoir during the testing phase it can be seen that the performances of all methods for monthly runoff simulation are satisfactory the hybrid method exhibits the best performance with a trend line very close to the observed data line in contrast there are clear deviations between the observed data and the outputs of the other methods additionally the standard svm method fails to capture the abrupt changes in runoff during flood season unlike the modified svm methods therefore the proposed hybrid method is an effective tool for monthly streamflow prediction because it can provide superior performance compared to several existing methods during the testing phase 4 6 discussion of results our simulations revealed that there are clear differences between the elm ann and svm methods indicating the importance of training tools in forecasting models for the traditional ann model the gradient based training strategy suffers from a few shortcomings such as overfitting and dimensionality issues dong et al 2019 ren et al 2018 yan et al 2019 the standard elm method tends to fall into local optima based on the predetermination of input hidden weights and hidden biases the conventional svm method utilizing the structural risk minimization principle can overcome the weaknesses of ann and elm to some extent and provide relatively good forecasting results however runoff is affected by a variety of factors and contains different frequency components feng et al 2019c hui et al 2016a hui et al 2016b madani 2014 zhao et al 2019 therefore for a single forecasting model it is often difficult to fully reflect the formation mechanisms and change rules of natural streamflow accurately since only one resolution component is utilized to establish the prediction module indicating that other resolution subcomponents in the original runoff time series cannot be separated effectively to solve this problem decomposition methods emd eemd and vmd are used to identify different resolution intervals the features of each subseries such as periodicity and volatility can then be clearly separated resulting in a significant reduction in modeling difficulty therefore the performances of the modified svm methods such as svm emd and svm eemd were superior to those of the standard svm method which matches the results of recent similar studies huang et al 2014 napolitano et al 2011 tan et al 2018 the proposed hybrid method outperformed all of the compared methods possible reasons for the superiority of the hybrid method are analyzed below first vmd decomposes an original monthly time series into several subcomponents facilitating effective identification of frequency changes in the original runoff data series second the svm method is adopted to model the complicated input output relationships hidden in each subseries and the qpso method is used to identify the optimal computational parameters which can effectively improve the generalization ability of svms finally final forecasting results are obtained by summing the simulated outputs of all svm models providing a synergetic effect and improving the performance of the hybrid forecasting model niu et al 2019 overall the incorporation of data decomposition and swarm intelligence into the forecasting model can provide accurate monthly streamflow forecasting results for operators which can serve as worthy technical references for the global research community in terms of hydrological prediction it should be noted that although the feasibility of the proposed method for monthly runoff prediction was verified utilizing real world data there are still several potential directions for future research the first is to test additional data decomposition strategies to increase the quality of obtained subcomponents the second is to develop new effective swarm intelligence methods for finding better parameter combinations for the forecasting model the last is to test additional artificial intelligence or machine learning methods to improve the generalization capabilities of the forecasting model in the future it is necessary to expand our research based on these three aspects and develop more practical forecasting methods to provide technical support for water resource management 5 conclusion over the past few decades methods for improving hydrological forecasting accuracy have received significant attention from scholars and engineers in the water resources field to enrich hydrological forecasting theory we developed a hybrid forecasting model for monthly runoff prediction first vmd is used to decompose an original runoff series into a series of subcomponents second an svm optimized by qpso is utilized to forecast all subcomponents finally the sum of the forecasted values of all subcomponents is treated as the final forecasted value monthly streamflow data from two huge reservoirs in china three gorges and danjiangkou reservoirs were collected to test the performance of the developed forecasting model the results revealed that the proposed hybrid model can provide better forecasting results than several existing methods with respect to three statistical indexes therefore the proposed method based on data decomposition and parameter optimization strategies is a promising alternative for improving the forecasting results of mid to long term

5742,this study presents a comprehensive inter comparison between two widely used rainfall datasets the global precipitation climatology project gpcp and the era interim reanalysis and the recently released era 5 which will replace era interim as the main european centre for medium range weather and forecasting ecmwf reanalysis by 2020 systematic and random error components were computed for the reanalysis datasets over the 1979 2018 period using gpcp as reference the analysis was taken at monthly timescale at 2 5 spatial resolution limited by gpcp despite its resolution limitations and complex algorithms gpcp has been extensively used for model evaluation due to its global and long term over 40 years coverage over most of the tropics and over localized mid latitude regions era 5 showed lower bias and unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse as well as higher correlations compared to era interim throughout the rest of the globe these error metrics displayed similar values between both reanalysis except over localized regions of the eastern tropical pacific the andes and the himalayas where era interim outperformed era 5 a process based analysis revealed that era interim tended to overestimate deep convection and moisture flux convergence over the tropical oceans and land leading to excessive rainfall similarly era interim showed significant rainfall underestimation over the mid latitude oceans due to underestimation of deep convection and moisture flux convergence both cases were significantly improved in era 5 likely due to its improved parameterizations and higher resolution indeed the differences in monthly rainfall between the two reanalysis were mainly due to improved dynamical circulation rather than thermodynamical clausius clapeyron processes or surface evaporation changes nonetheless the results also revealed improved representation of the moisture sink source patterns over the tropical oceans in era 5 finally there were significant differences in the long term rainfall trend patterns amongst the three datasets with differences reaching 30 decade that can extend even to the sign of the trend with the most notorious differences occurring over tropical africa furthermore era 5 didn t show improved representation of these trends in fact the trend of global mean rainfall in era interim was closer to gpcp than era 5 keywords rainfall datasets reanalysis rainfall variability climate dynamics 1 introduction rainfall is a key variable for hydrology meteorology and climatology and for many of their applications to society including water resource and disaster risk management agriculture amongst many others accurate rainfall observations are critical not only for direct quantitative estimation but also for guiding and improving our theoretical understanding of the processes involved and for evaluation of the numerical models from which weather forecasts and climate projections are obtained however rainfall estimation is a notoriously difficult challenge because rainfall fields as well as most of the other relevant atmospheric variables are the result of several nonlinear interactions among many physical processes resulting in complex variability over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales e g lovejoy and schertzer 2013 furthermore the mechanisms governing rainfall variability are themselves variable depending on the surface forcing e g nykanen 2008 nogueira et al 2013 rainfall type and intensity over and gupta 1994 nogueira and barros 2014 2015 and time scale considered allen and ingram 2002 allan et al 2010 bala et al 2010 nogueira 2019a b c gridded rainfall observational datasets are particularly relevant since they quantify both the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall over the past decades numerous gridded observational based rainfall datasets have been developed differing in terms of data sources coverage spatial and temporal resolution and algorithms see sun et al 2018 for a recent review in very simple terms they can be split into four main categories rain gauge based satellite based merged and atmospheric reanalysis direct rainfall observations by rain gauges are indispensable representing a relatively long and accurate record but their spatial coverage is limited especially over the oceans even over land the total area measured by all currently available rain gauges at global scale is surprisingly small equivalent to less than half a football field kidd et al 2010 consequently gauge based gridded datasets are typically only available over land and even for land their quality is highly heterogenous over different regions depending on the density of the station network their homogeneity the interpolation algorithms employed the quality control procedures etc the fast development of space observation technology in the second half of the twentieth century has brought major progresses to rainfall observation see sun et al 2018 for a recent review satellite based observations can provide regular rainfall estimates over vast areas of the globe however their temporal coverage is limited to the satellite era since the late 1970s and they are affected by significant systematic and random errors many of these uncertainties are due to the indirect nature of relationship between the quantities measured by the satellite instruments and the derived rainfall amount additionally the accuracy depends on the region e g typically less accurate over complex orography dry regions inland water bodies season rainfall type and amount etc see e g hu et al 2019 for recent a discussion on these issues more recently several attempts have been made to merge satellite based and gauge based information leveraging on the individual advantages of each data type in order to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimates atmospheric reanalysis products are produced by combining numerical weather forecasts with observations of multiple variables from multiple using data assimilation technology they are affected by multiple uncertainty sources including numerical model errors finite resolution parameterizations etc observation errors data assimilation issues and heterogeneity of the data sources in space and time e g bosilovich et al 2008 furthermore rainfall fields in atmospheric reanalysis aren t generally part of the analyzed fields but rather result from model forecasts that incorporate the observations into the initial conditions nonetheless reanalysis datasets are widely used for climate research largely due to their ability to provide continuous long records of multiple climate variables including rainfall over the full globe which are largely constrained by observations and a with a good degree of physical spatial and temporal coherency dee et al 2014 in recent years many studies have focused on comparing and evaluating observational based rainfall products on different spatial and temporal scales e g jiang et al 2012 kidd et al 2012 derin yilmaz 2014 maggioni et al 2016 gehne et al 2016 sun et al 2018 beck et al 2019 hu et al 2019 overall these studies have highlighted that all types observational based rainfall estimates have strengths and weaknesses and that there is no single best dataset the significant differences amongst datasets demonstrate the significant uncertainties in rainfall observation nonetheless these studies have also pointed out the added value of merging rainfall estimates from disparate sources and the advantages of reanalysis datasets in their long wide spatial and temporal coverage of multiple relevant climate variables with relatively good physical consistency for many climate research applications here we compare rainfall estimates from three different datasets all of them providing global coverage over the considered 40 year period 1979 2018 the first is the widely used global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 monthly dataset adler et al 2018 which provides global rainfall estimates by merging a variety of data sources including satellite microwave and infrared measurements and surface rain gauges the second is the also widely european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf third generation reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 which was until recently one of the most accurate global reanalysis available e g beck et al 2019 finally the recently released ecmwf s fifth generation reanalysis era 5 hersbach et al 2018 was considered era 5 has important changes compared to era interim including more improved numerical model and data assimilation schemes higher spatial and temporal resolution assimilation of more observations and improved versions of input observation and forcing datasets since era 5 will replace era interim as the main ecmwf reanalysis product its evaluation is an important task preliminary studies on the newer version of the ecmwf numerical model used in era 5 suggested improvements in the representation of tropical rainfall variability compared to the older version used in era interim hirons et al 2013 hersbach et al 2018 showed improvements in the representation of rainfall in era 5 compared to era interim for global mean rainfall using gpcp as reference and a for few case studies including a tropical cyclone and the variability over 1 month in the north atlantic other recent works have documented the increased accuracy of era 5 in matching observations compared to era interim for several variables regions and periods these include total precipitation over arctic sea ice wang et al 2019 daily rainfall over continental united states over the 2008 2017 period beck et al 2019 atmospheric precipitable water vapor over china zhang et al 2019 surface winds over the global oceans rivas and stoffelen 2019 and global solar radiation urraca et al 2018 additionally albergel et al 2018 have demonstrated the improvements in the simulation of evaporation soil moisture river discharge and snow depth over the continental united states by a land surface model forced by era 5 compared to the same model forced by era interim which the author attributed to better rainfall estimates in era 5 however a comprehensive evaluation of era 5 rainfall estimates over the entire globe and a long period has not been performed yet to the best of the author s knowledge this problem was addressed here by comparing the systematic and random errors in era 5 and era interim over the 1979 2018 period using gpcp as reference the differences between the rainfall estimates in the two reanalysis was further studied by a process based analysis aiming to pinpoint the main physical drivers of the differences thus shedding light on the dominant processes and providing guidance for future developments the present manuscript is organized as follows section 2 presents the considered datasets error metrics and process based physical analysis section 3 presents the results on the rainfall inter comparison between the three era 5 era interim and gpcp here considered as reference including the systematic and random errors in global mean and regional rainfall time series the process based analysis over the tropics and mid latitudes and the rainfall trends over the considered 40 year period finally the main conclusions are summarized and discussed in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 datasets the global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 dataset adler et al 2018 provides rainfall estimates at monthly time scale covering the full globe at 2 5 resolution gpcp is produced by merging a variety of data sources including passive microwave based rainfall retrievals from the special sensor microwave imager ssm i and the special sensor microwave image sounder ssmis infrared rainfall estimates from geostationary and polar orbiting satellites and surface rain gauges including the global precipitation climatology center gpcc dataset over land era interim is the third generation global atmospheric reanalysis produced by ecmwf dee et al 2011 while era 5 is their fifth generation global atmospheric reanalysis hersbach et al 2018 both reanalysis employ four dimensional variational data assimilation 4d var of satellite and in situ observations both cover the full globe from the period of 1 january 1979 onwards although era 5 will be extended to start in 1950 and will continue to be produced in near real time in the future fully replacing era interim which will stop being produced before 2020 moreover era 5 features several improvements compared to era interim i a more recent and improved version of the ecmwf integrated forecast system ifs cycle 41r2 versus cycle 31r2 including several improvements in model parameterizations e g convection and microphysics and data assimilation algorithm ii higher spatial resolution 0 25 against 0 75 horizontally and 137 levels against 60 vertical levels iii higher temporal resolution 1 hourly against 6 hourly with forecast fields at 3 hourly in era interim iv assimilation of substantially more and newer versions of observational datasets v uses newer and better forcing datasets such as for sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration 2 2 dataset inter comparison metrics the monthly averaged rainfall flux fields from era 5 and era interim over the 1979 2018 period were interpolated from their original resolutions into the 2 5 2 5 resolution grid of gpcp to allow direct comparison the bias and the unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse were computed for each grid point of the interpolated fields over the 1979 2018 period using gpcp as reference the bias is a measure of the systematic differences while the ubrmse is a measure of the match between the residues of both time series after removal of the bias in other words bias measures the overall agreement in the mean of the time series while ubrmse measures the overall agreement in both phase and amplitude of the variability of the time series many climate studies focusing on different climate variables analyze the anomalies rather than the total amounts this decomposition allows a better inter comparison between different periods and different datasets by removing systematic biases and accounting for different underlying model climatologies here as is typically done the monthly rainfall time series over each grid point was decomposed into a seasonal cycle periodic component and anomalies non periodic component the seasonal cycle corresponded to the climatological average for each month over the 1981 2010 period the anomalies were obtained by removing the seasonal signal from the monthly time series then the systematic and random differences between reanalysis and gpcp were studied in both components the correlation coefficients between anomaly time series was also quantified notice that the interpolation resolution of 2 5 limited by gpcp considered here is much coarser than the original resolutions of era interim 0 75 and era 5 0 25 more detailed insights into some aspects of the rainfall fields e g localized extreme events and convective storms could be provided by comparing against higher resolution rainfall observational datasets however the currently available high resolution rainfall datasets do not provide the long term and global coverage of gpcp which allows for a comprehensive analysis of the entire reanalysis rainfall fields presented in this study additionally it is important to notice that gpcp rainfall estimates as all other available observational rainfall datasets as pointed out in the introduction are affected by significant uncertainties the estimated error in gpcp global mean precipitation is 7 but the skill can vary significantly between different regions reaching values around 10 15 over the western tropical pacific adler et al 2012 2017 nonetheless gpcp s global mean precipitation over land and ocean fitted well into large scale water budgets using estimates of the relevant other variables e g evaporation and transport adler et al 2017 moreover gpcp matches well the gauge based observations in tropical land sun et al 2018 as expected since it includes rain gauge information furthermore the presence choice of using gpcp as reference is grounded by its wide use in climate research for numerous investigations of rainfall spatial and temporal variability e g gu et al 2007 benedict and randall 2007 tan et al 2015 nogueira 2017 2019a b c adler et al 2018 gu and adler 2018 amongst many others it has also been widely used for evaluation and calibration of numerical models including for the phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 which underlies the intergovernamental panel on climate change 5th assessment report ipcc ar5 christensen et al 2013 2 3 process based rainfall comparison the differences between era 5 and era interim in resolution convective and microphysical parameterizations assimilated data can cause significant differences to the rainfall variability hirons et al 2013 hersbach et al 2018 here these differences were studied by process based analysis based on the thermodynamic and dynamic processes this task was achieved by relating systematic and random components of the differences in rainfall against the differences in surface temperature t precipitable water vapor pwv surface evaporation ev moisture flux divergence div q and pressure vertical velocity ω the consideration of pwv and t was grounded by the clausius clapeyron relationship which provides a good starting for the thermodynamic process based analysis of the differences in rainfall between era 5 and era interim it implies that the water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7 for a 1 c change in temperature indeed the clausius clapeyron scaling of precipitable water vapor against surface temperature has been robustly verified at global mean scale from both observations and models e g wentz and schabel 2000 allen and ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 schneider et al 2010 trenberth 2011 nogueira 2019a one may also expect rainfall to increase with atmospheric moisture content and consequently the clausius clapeyron relationship may be extended to model the sensitivity of global mean rainfall to temperature fluctuations in fact such relationship has been reported at global scale by several previous investigations e g allen ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 stephens and ellis 2008 schneider et al 2010 trenberth 2011 allan et al 2010 2014 nogueira 2019a b however in contrast to the overall agreement on the sensitivity of precipitable water vapor these studies have also pointed out much larger spread in the magnitude of the correlation and of the sensitivity coefficients which are typically in the 1 3 c range one widely accepted explanation for the weaker sensitivity of rainfall to temperature fluctuations comes from earth s radiative budget constraints where the latent heat released associated with precipitation must be balanced by the outgoing longwave radiation allen and ingram 2002 stephens and ellis 2008 a further source of complexity comes from the fact that the clausius clapeyron relationship is a key mechanism of global mean atmospheric water vapor and rainfall variability only at time scales larger than 1 2 years but not at faster time scales nogueira 2019a b the sensitivity of the water cycle at regional scales is a considerably more complex problem on the one hand the sensitivity of precipitable water vapor to surface temperature fluctuations has been shown to hold at regional scale over the oceans but generally not over land trenberth et al 2005 wagner et al 2006 trenberth 2011 nogueira 2019c these studies suggested that the primary reason for this heterogeneity comes from the constraints imposed by limited soil moisture availability and evaporation over land on the other hand the regional sensitivity of rainfall is also significantly modulated by dynamical circulation changes which play a significant role in the rainfall response to climate change representing the major uncertainty source in rainfall simulated by climate models shepherd 2014 xie et al 2015 indeed complex circulations changes are expected to occur as a response to temperature fluctuations associated with changes in the intensity of convection horizontal and vertical temperature and moisture gradients and moisture convergence patterns which in turn cause large spatial heterogeneity on the regional rainfall sensitivity e g chou and neelin 2004 held and soden 2006 vecchi and soden 2007 schneider et al 2010 nogueira 2017 2019c here div q and ω were taken as proxies for the dynamical changes based on previous researches showing the key role played by these variables in modulating regional rainfall variability o gorman and schneider 2009 schneider et al 2010 pendergrass and gerber 2016 nogueira 2017 2019c the vertical velocity was taken at 500 hpa and 900 hpa in order to account for deeper and shallower convective changes finally surface evaporation allows to close the regional averaged atmospheric water budget see peixoto and oort 1992 3 results 3 1 inter comparison of global mean rainfall global mean rainfall flux averaged over the 1979 2018 period was 2 69 mm day in gpcp 2 93 mm day in era interim and 2 91 mm day in era 5 this corresponds to a very small 0 02 mm day bias reduction in era 5 compared to era interim the ubrmse computed from monthly time series of global mean rainfall flux also decreased by 0 02 mm day from 0 09 mm day in era interim to 0 07 mm day in era 5 additionally there was a significant increase in the correlation coefficient of monthly global mean rainfall flux anomaly time series between reanalysis and gpcp from 0 06 in era interim to 0 38 in era 5 finally the trend in global mean rainfall flux was over the 1979 2018 period was 0 2 decade in both era interim and gpcp respectively with p values of 0 04 and 0 01 while era 5 showed a larger trend of 1 decade p value 0 01 the trends were computed from the monthly anomaly time series identical trend values within 0 01 decade were obtained from yearly averaged time series of total rainfall the faster trend in era 5 comes from the last 10 years of the series where the divergence between gpcp and era 5 is largest see supplementary fig 1 a detailed analysis of these differences in global mean rainfall would require additional observational datasets to understand the difference is the last decade and looking at the global energy budget which is a key factor for the slow variability of global mean rainfall e g stephens and ellis 2008 nogueira 2019b however such detailed analysis is beyond the scope of the present manuscript for the sake of brevity while global mean rainfall contains relevant information on the earth s climate system namely on the intensity of the water cycle most applications require information about the spatial distribution of rainfall hence the systematic and random components of the differences in spatial rainfall patterns between reanalysis and gpcp are presented below 3 2 inter comparison of bias and rmse patterns at first glance global rainfall flux patterns averaged over the 1979 2018 period are similar between era 5 era interim and gpcp see supplementary fig 2 with the main wet regions intertropical convergence zone itcz the south pacific convergence zone spcz mid latitude storm tracks and dry regions subtropical and polar deserts standing out however a detailed analysis revealed significant differences amongst the three datasets era 5 fig 1 a and era interim fig 1c showed systematic overestimation and underestimation of rainfall compared to gpcp over different regions of the globe specifically era 5 displayed strong positive biases greater than 1 mm day over most of the tropical oceans and over the himalayas and the andes fig 1a the magnitude of the negative biases in era 5 was generally weaker although strong localized systematic underestimation larger than 1 mm day emerged for example over the norwegian sea or the over the southeastern coastal region of south america overall era interim showed a similar global pattern for rainfall flux bias as era 5 fig 1c but with significantly larger magnitude over most of tropics indeed compared to era interim era 5 reduced significantly the positive bias over tropical oceans central africa southeastern asia indonesia central and southern brazil and over the northern hemisphere western sub tropical regions of the pacific and the atlantic fig 1e despite the overall improvement one must notice that there are regions where the bias is increased in era 5 compared to era interim fig 1e however most of these differences have small magnitude on the order of a few tens of millimeters perhaps the only notable exceptions where era 5 biases are significantly larger than era interim are a narrow band over the tropical eastern pacific and localized areas over the northern and southern andes in south america in general the ubrmse patterns in both era 5 fig 1b and era interim fig 1d resemble the global rainfall flux distribution see supplementary fig 2 fig 1f shows that ubrmse was generally lower in era 5 compared to era interim over most of the tropics with largest reductions occurring over northern south america central africa and southeastern asia over the mid latitudes and polar regions ubrmse was nearly identical between both reanalysis era 5 showed increased ubrmse than era interim over a narrow band of the tropical eastern pacific and over the southern andes although these differences are essentially below 1 mm day next the systematic and random differences between reanalysis and gpcp were studied in both periodic and non periodic components this analysis considered only regions where the long term 1979 2018 average rainfall flux was larger than 1 mm day aiming to minimize signal to noise problems as expected the systematic differences i e the biases were mainly reflected in the average seasonal cycle fig 2 a and fig 2b these systematic errors were effectively removed by taking the anomalies cf supplementary fig 2 i e they were mostly removed by removing the seasonal component the reduced bias in era 5 compared to era interim shown in fig 1 was also clearly reflected in the comparison of the rainfall flux seasonal component bias between era 5 and era interim fig 2e ubrmse showed relevant values in both reanalysis for the seasonal cycle component fig 2b and 2d and for the anomalies fig 3 a and 3c the reduction of ubrmse over the tropics in era 5 compared to era interim was also present in both periodic fig 2f and non periodic components fig 3f additionally both components showed largest reductions of ubrmse for era 5 over the same regions eastern equatorial pacific tropical atlantic and indic central africa northern south america and southeastern asia and with largest ubrmse increases in era 5 compared to era interim over the narrow band in the eastern tropical pacific however it is important to highlight that for the seasonal cycle ubrmse measures the variability of the differences between reanalysis and gpcp only over 12 points months and hence the statistics may not robust the correlations of monthly rainfall flux anomaly time series at each grid point between era 5 and gpcp fig 3b and era interim and gpcp fig 3d showed mostly strong positive values over tropical oceans ranging between 0 6 and 0 9 generally the correlations were lower over the mid latitude oceans 0 6 0 7 and even lower 0 5 over ocean regions poleward of 60 the results also showed remarkably high correlations 1 over most land regions in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere where observation coverage is best which impacts both gpcp and reanalysis products in contrast over tropical africa and south america the magnitude of the correlations was remarkably low notice that while these correspond to regions where era 5 had the largest improvements in correlation compared to era interim fig 3f the correlations remain mostly below 0 5 even in era 5 outside these regions era 5 displayed only slight increases in correlation over the tropical oceans improvements 0 1 and essentially no change for the rest of the world 3 3 dominant drivers of tropical rainfall systematic differences in this section a process based analysis on the causes for the bias differences between era 5 and era interim in mean rainfall flux over the tropics is presented here considered over the entire 0 30 degrees of latitude in both hemispheres for this analysis the grid points where the absolute bias differences between both reanalysis were below 0 1 mm day were discarded the bias was compared only for the seasonal cycle components since it was shown to be responsible for most of the systematic differences in general most but not all of the bias reduction over the tropical regions shown in fig 2e and particularly the larger magnitude decreases results from a reduction of mean rainfall flux over the oceans fig 4 and continents fig 5 in contrast the fewer grid points over the tropical oceans and land where the bias increased in era 5 correspond essentially to increased rainfall flux over the tropical oceans the bias reduction in era 5 showed no dependency on differences in local same grid point mean surface temperature fig 4a nor differences in local mean precipitable water vapor fig 4b notice that sea surface temperature comes from forcing observational based datasets in both era 5 and era interim resulting in small magnitude differences of the mean sea surface temperature between both reanalysis 0 5 k notice that despite the small magnitude differences fig 4a shows that tropical oceans in era 5 are slightly but systematically cooler then in era interim fig 4c shows systematic changes to the moisture sink source balance of the tropical oceans between era 5 and era interim corresponding to an inverse proportionality between mean rainfall flux and mean surface evaporation over tropical land the differences in mean surface temperature between era 5 and era interim had larger magnitude fig 5a compared to the oceans era 5 displayed a warmer land surface than era interim over most of the considered grid points the distinct behavior found for surface temperature between land and ocean may be explained by the lower thermal inertia of land and consequent a larger amplitude response but also and perhaps more importantly because land surface temperature in both reanalysis is simulated by a coupled land surface model rather than a prescribed forcing fig 5a reveals a moderate link between the largest decreases in mean rainfall flux and largest bias reductions to increases in mean surface temperature over tropical land there was no clear relation between differences in mean rainfall flux and mean evaporation over tropical land fig 5c but the average evaporation over tropical land was higher in era 5 over most of the considered grid points even in most of the grid points where average rainfall flux decreased in era 5 the largest mean rainfall flux decreases and surface temperature increases over tropical land tend to correspond to small decreases in mean precipitable water vapor in the atmospheric column above fig 5b the strongest relation over tropical oceans and land was between differences in mean rainfall flux and bias and the changes in deep convection intensity as measured by ω at 500 hpa figs 4e and 5e and moisture flux divergence convergence figs 4d and 5d the link between differences in mean rainfall flux and vertical motion at 900 hpa was much weaker over the tropical oceans fig 4f and land fig 5f suggesting that changes to deep convection played a dominant role in the rainfall differences between era 5 and era interim this result agrees with nogueira 2017 findings that rainfall variability at monthly to decadal time scales over the wettest regions of the planet including the tropical convergence zones is mainly controlled by the deep convective and moisture convergence dynamics moreover these results confirm and extend hirons et al 2013 findings on the added value of the improved convective parameterization used in era 5 for 1 day forecasts of tropical rainfall when compared to the older implementation used in era interim mainly due to a better representation of the rainfall moisture relationship inhibiting the premature development of deep convection 3 4 dominant drivers of tropical rainfall random differences next the process based analysis was employed to study the differences in rainfall flux ubrmse between era 5 and era interim over the tropics here the changes between both datasets in terms of variability of the anomalies of rainfall flux and other relevant variables was considered as measured by the standard deviation of their monthly time series only the ubrmse computed from rainfall flux anomalies was considered while the seasonal cycle displayed significant ubrmse values particularly over the tropics cf fig 2 this measures the variability of the differences between reanalysis and gpcp only over 12 points months composing the seasonal cycle and hence the statistics may not robust as pointed out in section 3 1 over the tropical oceans the increased ubrmse in era 5 was associated with increases in rainfall flux variability while decreased ubrmse in era 5 was associated with both increased and decreased rainfall flux variability fig 6 over tropical land the results showed only a few localized ubrmse increases in era 5 compared to era interim cf fig 2e while the largest ubrmse decreases were associated with decreased rainfall flux variability fig 7 analogous to the findings for the differences in tropical mean rainfall flux there was a strong linear relationship between increases to rainfall flux variability and increased variability of vertical motion at 500 hpa and moisture flux divergence over tropical oceans fig 6d and e and over tropical land fig 7d and e the differences in tropical sea surface temperature variability were small between era 5 and era interim fig 6a for the same reasons discussed above for the mean differences also there was no clear relation between changes to rainfall flux variability and sea surface temperature variability over the tropics most of the largest decreases in ubrmse in era 5 over tropical ocean were associated with decreased variability in precipitable water vapor fig 6b and in surface evaporation fig 6c however the relationship of the variability between these variables and rainfall flux wasn t linear over tropical land a similar relation between the largest ubrmse decreases in era 5 and precipitable water vapor fig 7b and surface evaporation fig 7c was found finally no clear link was found between changes to ubrmse nor rainfall flux variability to land surface temperature over the tropics fig 7a as a final note on tropical rainfall it is important to highlight that the el niño southern oscillation enso is a well known driver for changes to tropical rainfall patterns enso is related to changes in the sea surface temperature over the tropical pacific e g van oldenborgh et al 2005 gu et al 2007 nogueira 2019c however probably due to the small differences in the sea surface temperature forcing datasets between era 5 and era interim no relation was found between the rainfall differences in the two reanalysis and enso not shown as measured by the niño 3 4 index e g trenberth 1997 3 5 dominant drivers of mid latitude rainfall systematic differences overall the differences in bias between era 5 and era interim were smaller over the mid latitudes than over the tropics see figs 1e and 2e here the mid latitudes were considered as the regions between 30 and 60 degrees of latitude in both hemispheres fig 8 shows that for most of the mid latitude grid points with bias differences greater than 0 1 mm day between both reanalysis era 5 displayed larger average rainfall flux than era interim including over the mid latitude grid points where the largest bias reductions occurred but also over mid latitude grid points where the bias increased slightly in era 5 furthermore the sea surface temperature fig 8a and precipitable water vapor fig 8b over mid latitude oceans were most often slightly lower in era 5 than in era interim respectively within 1 k colder and within 0 7 mm drier nonetheless there was no clear link between the changes in mean rainfall flux and sea surface temperature nor precipitable water vapor over the mid latitude oceans most of the considered grid points over the mid latitude oceans displayed decreased mean surface evaporation in era 5 and there was some relation between the magnitude this decrease with the mean rainfall flux decrease fig 8c the strong linear relation between changes to mean rainfall flux and mean moisture flux divergence found over the tropics was somewhat weaker over the mid latitudes fig 8d although still present most often largest increases to mean rainfall flux over the mid latitude oceans and largest bias reductions were associated to increased moisture flux convergence additionally there was a mean rainfall flux increase and bias decrease showed a clear linear relation to mean ω at 500 hpa decrease fig 8e and a weak relation with mean ω at 900 hpa decrease fig 8f thus the changes to deep convection also played an important role in the differences between era 5 and era interim rainfall patterns over the mid latitude oceans again in agreement in hirons et al 2013 and nogueira 2017 results over mid latitude land regions the largest decreases in rainfall flux bias in era 5 compared to era interim were associated with decreased mean rainfall flux fig 9 notice however that some lower but significant bias decreases were also associated with increased mean rainfall fig 9 overall over mid latitude land there was no clear relation between differences in mean rainfall flux and in land surface temperature fig 9a fig 9b shows a relatively linear relationship between differences in mean rainfall flux and in mean precipitable water vapor with largest decreases in bias corresponding to decreased precipitable water vapor while most of the largest decreases in bias correspond to increased surface evaporation fig 9c the linear relation between rainfall flux and surface evaporation was weak over mid latitude land for example for small increases in evaporation the bias and mean rainfall flux may increase or decrease contrary to the mid latitude oceans over mid latitude land grid points the differences in mean rainfall flux displayed stronger relation to moisture flux divergence changes fig 9d than to vertical velocity at either 500 hpa fig 9e or at 900 hpa fig 9f 3 6 dominant drivers of mid latitude rainfall random differences over mid latitude oceans the differences in ubrmse between era 5 and era interim were generally low mostly below 1 mm day cf fig 3f and with slightly increased variability in era 5 compared to era interim over most grid points with ubrmse 0 1 mm day fig 10 over these grid points era 5 displayed generally increased variability for surface evaporation fig 10c although there was no clear relationship between surface evaporation and rainfall flux variability fig 10b hints a linear relation between differences in variability of rainfall flux and precipitable water vapor over mid latitude oceans although the number of grid points with ubrmse 0 1 mm day and the magnitude of the differences were small similar linear relationships were also found over this mid latitude oceans between rainfall flux variability and moisture flux divergence fig 10d and ω at 500 hpa fig 10e but not for ω at 900 hpa fig 10f the differences in ubrmse between era 5 and era interim were also relatively small over mid latitude land grid points mostly below 1 mm day cf fig 3f the largest decreases increases in ubrmse were associated with reduced increased rainfall flux variability fig 11 in turn these changes in rainfall flux variability showed no clear dependence of land surface temperature fig 11a precipitable water vapor fig 11b surface evaporation fig 11c nor ω at 900 hpa fig 11f in contrast mid latitude grid points displayed clear linear relationships were found between increased rainfall flux variability and increased variability in moisture flux divergence fig 11d and ω at 500 hpa fig 11e 3 7 regional rainfall trends in section 3 it was pointed out that the trend in global mean rainfall flux over the 1979 2018 period was 0 2 decade in both era interim and gpcp but 1 decade in era 5 in this section the spatial pattern of the rainfall flux trends in the three datasets are evaluated and compared fig 12 shows the trend maps at 2 5 2 5 resolution with grey shading representing pixels where the average 1979 2018 climatological average rainfall flux was below 1 mm day or where the p value for the estimate trends was greater than 0 05 i e the trends were considered non significant all datasets displayed regions with significant positive and negative trends and regions with non significant trends however there were clear differences in the patterns between the three datasets the most notorious difference was probably the distinct behavior over central africa where gpcp showed positive rainfall flux trends fig 12a while era 5 fig 12b and era interim fig 12c showed strong negative trends with era interim difference being the largest reaching trends with magnitude larger than 30 decade using gpcp as reference era 5 performed worse than era interim over eastern asia and southeastern south america with the former displaying stronger negative trends cf fig 12d and e while gpcp displayed mostly weak negative or non significant values on the other hand era interim showed a stronger negative trend over central united states than era 5 where gpcp showed mostly non significant trends notice that over the atlantic sector of the arctic ocean both reanalysis underestimated then strong positive trends in gpcp but this result was likely undermined by the frozen precipitation processes that were not considered here fig 12 also shows that compared to gpcp era interim also clearly overestimated the rainfall flux trends over eastern central africa and even more so northern south america while the performance of era 5 was closer to gpcp in contrast era 5 was further from gpcp trends than era interim over the central and eastern equatorial pacific and over the north atlantic and pacific storm tracks indeed over these storm track regions era 5 showed positive trends contrasting with gpcp negative trends era interim displayed weaker positive trends and in that sense its results were closer to gpcp overall the comparison of the rainfall flux trends amongst the three datasets displayed significant differences which are often larger than 20 30 and can even extend to the sign of the trend there was no clear improvement in rainfall flux trend patterns between era interim and era 5 4 summary and discussion rainfall is a crucial variable for hydrology meteorology and climatology and its applications however its quantitative estimation is difficult task due to complex variability of rainfall fields over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales with different governing processes at different scales here a comprehensive evaluation of monthly rainfall fields was performed over a 40 year period 1979 2018 for three important long term global datasets i the widely used ecmwf era interim reanalysis which combines numerical model forecasts with observations from multiple sources ii the recently released ecmwf era 5 reanalysis which will replace era interim and includes several improvements compared to its predecessor and iii the also widely used gpcp which merges rain gauge and satellite based rainfall estimates from multiple sources and was considered here as the reference dataset the bias and ubrme for global mean rainfall flux in era 5 was slightly lower than in era interim 0 02 mm day and the correlation of the global mean rainfall flux anomalies was higher 0 06 against 0 38 but era interim matched gpcp for the global mean rainfall flux trend while era 5 overestimated it 1 decade regional analysis reveals large differences between the rainfall flux trends in the three datasets particularly over tropical africa where even the sign of the trend doesn t match between gpcp and reanalysis there was no clear improvement in the trends between era 5 and era interim when considering gpcp as reference however era 5 rainfall flux monthly time series were closer to gpcp than era interim over most of the tropics where the bias and ubrmse were typically lower and correlation coefficients higher era 5 and era interim displayed similar performance throughout most of the other regions except over localized regions in the eastern tropical pacific and over the andes and himalayas where era interim outperformed era 5 as expected the systematic component of the errors was reflected by the seasonal cycle and could be effectively removed by taking the anomalies the random component of the errors was present in both seasonal cycle and anomalies although the former wasn t statistically robust since it is based only on 12 data points a process based analysis showed that typically era interim tends to overestimate the tropical deep convection both over land and oceans resulting in an overestimation of tropical rainfall this problem was improved in era 5 suggesting that the latter reanalysis represents better tropical circulation patterns particularly the deep convection intensity and moisture flux convergence patterns over the mid latitude oceans the systematic underestimation of rainfall flux by era interim was also improved in era 5 resulting mainly from increased moisture flux convergence and ω at 500 hpa in contrast over the mid latitude land the largest improvements in mean rainfall flux in era 5 compared to era interim were associated with reduced deep convection and moisture flux convergence and thus reduced rainfall flux the differences in random errors over mid latitudes between era 5 and era interim were small but some relation to moisture flux convergence and 500 hpa vertical velocity was also noticeable the clausius clapeyron relationship wasn t relevant in explaining the differences between era 5 and era interim rainfall on the one hand the small differences in sea surface temperature forcing dataset between era 5 and era interim could explain the small role played by the thermodynamic process in their differences in rainfall on the other hand even over land where large surface temperature differences existed in reanalysis land surface temperature is simulated and not a forcing dataset either no relation to differences in rainfall flux were found or the signal change in temperature did not match the change in rainfall flux expected by the clausius clapeyron effect changes to mean surface evaporation weren t directly responsible by differences in rainfall flux except for some grid points over tropical land where era 5 displayed decreased variability in surface evaporation and rainfall flux associated with decreased ubrmse but even over these grid points decreased rainfall flux variability and ubrmse was more tightly related to changes to moisture flux divergence and ω at 500 hpa than to surface evaporation systematic surface evaporation increases were also found over tropical land and ocean grid points associated with systematic rainfall and bias decreases suggesting improvements to the mean moisture tropical sink sources patterns in era 5 the critical role played by improvements to circulation patterns in explaining the improved rainfall in era 5 agrees with nogueira 2017 findings that rainfall variability at monthly to decadal time scales over the wettest regions of the planet including the tropical convergence zones is mainly controlled by the deep convective and moisture convergence dynamics it also agrees with studies by hirons et al 2013 and hersbach et al 2019 demonstrating the improvement in the simulation of rainfall over the tropics and mid latitude storm tracks by the newer version of the ecmwf model used in era 5 compared to its earlier versions used in era interim mainly due to improved convective and microphysics parameterization but also very likely due to improved resolution in conclusion era 5 provides improved quality and higher resolution spatial and temporal rainfall fields compared to previous generation reanalysis additionally era 5 also provides coherent high resolution patterns for other relevant variables with increased quality and quantity of assimilated observations this has important implications many applications including water resources management agriculture and risk management for water related extreme events e g

5742,this study presents a comprehensive inter comparison between two widely used rainfall datasets the global precipitation climatology project gpcp and the era interim reanalysis and the recently released era 5 which will replace era interim as the main european centre for medium range weather and forecasting ecmwf reanalysis by 2020 systematic and random error components were computed for the reanalysis datasets over the 1979 2018 period using gpcp as reference the analysis was taken at monthly timescale at 2 5 spatial resolution limited by gpcp despite its resolution limitations and complex algorithms gpcp has been extensively used for model evaluation due to its global and long term over 40 years coverage over most of the tropics and over localized mid latitude regions era 5 showed lower bias and unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse as well as higher correlations compared to era interim throughout the rest of the globe these error metrics displayed similar values between both reanalysis except over localized regions of the eastern tropical pacific the andes and the himalayas where era interim outperformed era 5 a process based analysis revealed that era interim tended to overestimate deep convection and moisture flux convergence over the tropical oceans and land leading to excessive rainfall similarly era interim showed significant rainfall underestimation over the mid latitude oceans due to underestimation of deep convection and moisture flux convergence both cases were significantly improved in era 5 likely due to its improved parameterizations and higher resolution indeed the differences in monthly rainfall between the two reanalysis were mainly due to improved dynamical circulation rather than thermodynamical clausius clapeyron processes or surface evaporation changes nonetheless the results also revealed improved representation of the moisture sink source patterns over the tropical oceans in era 5 finally there were significant differences in the long term rainfall trend patterns amongst the three datasets with differences reaching 30 decade that can extend even to the sign of the trend with the most notorious differences occurring over tropical africa furthermore era 5 didn t show improved representation of these trends in fact the trend of global mean rainfall in era interim was closer to gpcp than era 5 keywords rainfall datasets reanalysis rainfall variability climate dynamics 1 introduction rainfall is a key variable for hydrology meteorology and climatology and for many of their applications to society including water resource and disaster risk management agriculture amongst many others accurate rainfall observations are critical not only for direct quantitative estimation but also for guiding and improving our theoretical understanding of the processes involved and for evaluation of the numerical models from which weather forecasts and climate projections are obtained however rainfall estimation is a notoriously difficult challenge because rainfall fields as well as most of the other relevant atmospheric variables are the result of several nonlinear interactions among many physical processes resulting in complex variability over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales e g lovejoy and schertzer 2013 furthermore the mechanisms governing rainfall variability are themselves variable depending on the surface forcing e g nykanen 2008 nogueira et al 2013 rainfall type and intensity over and gupta 1994 nogueira and barros 2014 2015 and time scale considered allen and ingram 2002 allan et al 2010 bala et al 2010 nogueira 2019a b c gridded rainfall observational datasets are particularly relevant since they quantify both the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall over the past decades numerous gridded observational based rainfall datasets have been developed differing in terms of data sources coverage spatial and temporal resolution and algorithms see sun et al 2018 for a recent review in very simple terms they can be split into four main categories rain gauge based satellite based merged and atmospheric reanalysis direct rainfall observations by rain gauges are indispensable representing a relatively long and accurate record but their spatial coverage is limited especially over the oceans even over land the total area measured by all currently available rain gauges at global scale is surprisingly small equivalent to less than half a football field kidd et al 2010 consequently gauge based gridded datasets are typically only available over land and even for land their quality is highly heterogenous over different regions depending on the density of the station network their homogeneity the interpolation algorithms employed the quality control procedures etc the fast development of space observation technology in the second half of the twentieth century has brought major progresses to rainfall observation see sun et al 2018 for a recent review satellite based observations can provide regular rainfall estimates over vast areas of the globe however their temporal coverage is limited to the satellite era since the late 1970s and they are affected by significant systematic and random errors many of these uncertainties are due to the indirect nature of relationship between the quantities measured by the satellite instruments and the derived rainfall amount additionally the accuracy depends on the region e g typically less accurate over complex orography dry regions inland water bodies season rainfall type and amount etc see e g hu et al 2019 for recent a discussion on these issues more recently several attempts have been made to merge satellite based and gauge based information leveraging on the individual advantages of each data type in order to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimates atmospheric reanalysis products are produced by combining numerical weather forecasts with observations of multiple variables from multiple using data assimilation technology they are affected by multiple uncertainty sources including numerical model errors finite resolution parameterizations etc observation errors data assimilation issues and heterogeneity of the data sources in space and time e g bosilovich et al 2008 furthermore rainfall fields in atmospheric reanalysis aren t generally part of the analyzed fields but rather result from model forecasts that incorporate the observations into the initial conditions nonetheless reanalysis datasets are widely used for climate research largely due to their ability to provide continuous long records of multiple climate variables including rainfall over the full globe which are largely constrained by observations and a with a good degree of physical spatial and temporal coherency dee et al 2014 in recent years many studies have focused on comparing and evaluating observational based rainfall products on different spatial and temporal scales e g jiang et al 2012 kidd et al 2012 derin yilmaz 2014 maggioni et al 2016 gehne et al 2016 sun et al 2018 beck et al 2019 hu et al 2019 overall these studies have highlighted that all types observational based rainfall estimates have strengths and weaknesses and that there is no single best dataset the significant differences amongst datasets demonstrate the significant uncertainties in rainfall observation nonetheless these studies have also pointed out the added value of merging rainfall estimates from disparate sources and the advantages of reanalysis datasets in their long wide spatial and temporal coverage of multiple relevant climate variables with relatively good physical consistency for many climate research applications here we compare rainfall estimates from three different datasets all of them providing global coverage over the considered 40 year period 1979 2018 the first is the widely used global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 monthly dataset adler et al 2018 which provides global rainfall estimates by merging a variety of data sources including satellite microwave and infrared measurements and surface rain gauges the second is the also widely european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf third generation reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 which was until recently one of the most accurate global reanalysis available e g beck et al 2019 finally the recently released ecmwf s fifth generation reanalysis era 5 hersbach et al 2018 was considered era 5 has important changes compared to era interim including more improved numerical model and data assimilation schemes higher spatial and temporal resolution assimilation of more observations and improved versions of input observation and forcing datasets since era 5 will replace era interim as the main ecmwf reanalysis product its evaluation is an important task preliminary studies on the newer version of the ecmwf numerical model used in era 5 suggested improvements in the representation of tropical rainfall variability compared to the older version used in era interim hirons et al 2013 hersbach et al 2018 showed improvements in the representation of rainfall in era 5 compared to era interim for global mean rainfall using gpcp as reference and a for few case studies including a tropical cyclone and the variability over 1 month in the north atlantic other recent works have documented the increased accuracy of era 5 in matching observations compared to era interim for several variables regions and periods these include total precipitation over arctic sea ice wang et al 2019 daily rainfall over continental united states over the 2008 2017 period beck et al 2019 atmospheric precipitable water vapor over china zhang et al 2019 surface winds over the global oceans rivas and stoffelen 2019 and global solar radiation urraca et al 2018 additionally albergel et al 2018 have demonstrated the improvements in the simulation of evaporation soil moisture river discharge and snow depth over the continental united states by a land surface model forced by era 5 compared to the same model forced by era interim which the author attributed to better rainfall estimates in era 5 however a comprehensive evaluation of era 5 rainfall estimates over the entire globe and a long period has not been performed yet to the best of the author s knowledge this problem was addressed here by comparing the systematic and random errors in era 5 and era interim over the 1979 2018 period using gpcp as reference the differences between the rainfall estimates in the two reanalysis was further studied by a process based analysis aiming to pinpoint the main physical drivers of the differences thus shedding light on the dominant processes and providing guidance for future developments the present manuscript is organized as follows section 2 presents the considered datasets error metrics and process based physical analysis section 3 presents the results on the rainfall inter comparison between the three era 5 era interim and gpcp here considered as reference including the systematic and random errors in global mean and regional rainfall time series the process based analysis over the tropics and mid latitudes and the rainfall trends over the considered 40 year period finally the main conclusions are summarized and discussed in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 datasets the global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 dataset adler et al 2018 provides rainfall estimates at monthly time scale covering the full globe at 2 5 resolution gpcp is produced by merging a variety of data sources including passive microwave based rainfall retrievals from the special sensor microwave imager ssm i and the special sensor microwave image sounder ssmis infrared rainfall estimates from geostationary and polar orbiting satellites and surface rain gauges including the global precipitation climatology center gpcc dataset over land era interim is the third generation global atmospheric reanalysis produced by ecmwf dee et al 2011 while era 5 is their fifth generation global atmospheric reanalysis hersbach et al 2018 both reanalysis employ four dimensional variational data assimilation 4d var of satellite and in situ observations both cover the full globe from the period of 1 january 1979 onwards although era 5 will be extended to start in 1950 and will continue to be produced in near real time in the future fully replacing era interim which will stop being produced before 2020 moreover era 5 features several improvements compared to era interim i a more recent and improved version of the ecmwf integrated forecast system ifs cycle 41r2 versus cycle 31r2 including several improvements in model parameterizations e g convection and microphysics and data assimilation algorithm ii higher spatial resolution 0 25 against 0 75 horizontally and 137 levels against 60 vertical levels iii higher temporal resolution 1 hourly against 6 hourly with forecast fields at 3 hourly in era interim iv assimilation of substantially more and newer versions of observational datasets v uses newer and better forcing datasets such as for sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration 2 2 dataset inter comparison metrics the monthly averaged rainfall flux fields from era 5 and era interim over the 1979 2018 period were interpolated from their original resolutions into the 2 5 2 5 resolution grid of gpcp to allow direct comparison the bias and the unbiased root mean squared error ubrmse were computed for each grid point of the interpolated fields over the 1979 2018 period using gpcp as reference the bias is a measure of the systematic differences while the ubrmse is a measure of the match between the residues of both time series after removal of the bias in other words bias measures the overall agreement in the mean of the time series while ubrmse measures the overall agreement in both phase and amplitude of the variability of the time series many climate studies focusing on different climate variables analyze the anomalies rather than the total amounts this decomposition allows a better inter comparison between different periods and different datasets by removing systematic biases and accounting for different underlying model climatologies here as is typically done the monthly rainfall time series over each grid point was decomposed into a seasonal cycle periodic component and anomalies non periodic component the seasonal cycle corresponded to the climatological average for each month over the 1981 2010 period the anomalies were obtained by removing the seasonal signal from the monthly time series then the systematic and random differences between reanalysis and gpcp were studied in both components the correlation coefficients between anomaly time series was also quantified notice that the interpolation resolution of 2 5 limited by gpcp considered here is much coarser than the original resolutions of era interim 0 75 and era 5 0 25 more detailed insights into some aspects of the rainfall fields e g localized extreme events and convective storms could be provided by comparing against higher resolution rainfall observational datasets however the currently available high resolution rainfall datasets do not provide the long term and global coverage of gpcp which allows for a comprehensive analysis of the entire reanalysis rainfall fields presented in this study additionally it is important to notice that gpcp rainfall estimates as all other available observational rainfall datasets as pointed out in the introduction are affected by significant uncertainties the estimated error in gpcp global mean precipitation is 7 but the skill can vary significantly between different regions reaching values around 10 15 over the western tropical pacific adler et al 2012 2017 nonetheless gpcp s global mean precipitation over land and ocean fitted well into large scale water budgets using estimates of the relevant other variables e g evaporation and transport adler et al 2017 moreover gpcp matches well the gauge based observations in tropical land sun et al 2018 as expected since it includes rain gauge information furthermore the presence choice of using gpcp as reference is grounded by its wide use in climate research for numerous investigations of rainfall spatial and temporal variability e g gu et al 2007 benedict and randall 2007 tan et al 2015 nogueira 2017 2019a b c adler et al 2018 gu and adler 2018 amongst many others it has also been widely used for evaluation and calibration of numerical models including for the phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 which underlies the intergovernamental panel on climate change 5th assessment report ipcc ar5 christensen et al 2013 2 3 process based rainfall comparison the differences between era 5 and era interim in resolution convective and microphysical parameterizations assimilated data can cause significant differences to the rainfall variability hirons et al 2013 hersbach et al 2018 here these differences were studied by process based analysis based on the thermodynamic and dynamic processes this task was achieved by relating systematic and random components of the differences in rainfall against the differences in surface temperature t precipitable water vapor pwv surface evaporation ev moisture flux divergence div q and pressure vertical velocity ω the consideration of pwv and t was grounded by the clausius clapeyron relationship which provides a good starting for the thermodynamic process based analysis of the differences in rainfall between era 5 and era interim it implies that the water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by about 7 for a 1 c change in temperature indeed the clausius clapeyron scaling of precipitable water vapor against surface temperature has been robustly verified at global mean scale from both observations and models e g wentz and schabel 2000 allen and ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 schneider et al 2010 trenberth 2011 nogueira 2019a one may also expect rainfall to increase with atmospheric moisture content and consequently the clausius clapeyron relationship may be extended to model the sensitivity of global mean rainfall to temperature fluctuations in fact such relationship has been reported at global scale by several previous investigations e g allen ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 stephens and ellis 2008 schneider et al 2010 trenberth 2011 allan et al 2010 2014 nogueira 2019a b however in contrast to the overall agreement on the sensitivity of precipitable water vapor these studies have also pointed out much larger spread in the magnitude of the correlation and of the sensitivity coefficients which are typically in the 1 3 c range one widely accepted explanation for the weaker sensitivity of rainfall to temperature fluctuations comes from earth s radiative budget constraints where the latent heat released associated with precipitation must be balanced by the outgoing longwave radiation allen and ingram 2002 stephens and ellis 2008 a further source of complexity comes from the fact that the clausius clapeyron relationship is a key mechanism of global mean atmospheric water vapor and rainfall variability only at time scales larger than 1 2 years but not at faster time scales nogueira 2019a b the sensitivity of the water cycle at regional scales is a considerably more complex problem on the one hand the sensitivity of precipitable water vapor to surface temperature fluctuations has been shown to hold at regional scale over the oceans but generally not over land trenberth et al 2005 wagner et al 2006 trenberth 2011 nogueira 2019c these studies suggested that the primary reason for this heterogeneity comes from the constraints imposed by limited soil moisture availability and evaporation over land on the other hand the regional sensitivity of rainfall is also significantly modulated by dynamical circulation changes which play a significant role in the rainfall response to climate change representing the major uncertainty source in rainfall simulated by climate models shepherd 2014 xie et al 2015 indeed complex circulations changes are expected to occur as a response to temperature fluctuations associated with changes in the intensity of convection horizontal and vertical temperature and moisture gradients and moisture convergence patterns which in turn cause large spatial heterogeneity on the regional rainfall sensitivity e g chou and neelin 2004 held and soden 2006 vecchi and soden 2007 schneider et al 2010 nogueira 2017 2019c here div q and ω were taken as proxies for the dynamical changes based on previous researches showing the key role played by these variables in modulating regional rainfall variability o gorman and schneider 2009 schneider et al 2010 pendergrass and gerber 2016 nogueira 2017 2019c the vertical velocity was taken at 500 hpa and 900 hpa in order to account for deeper and shallower convective changes finally surface evaporation allows to close the regional averaged atmospheric water budget see peixoto and oort 1992 3 results 3 1 inter comparison of global mean rainfall global mean rainfall flux averaged over the 1979 2018 period was 2 69 mm day in gpcp 2 93 mm day in era interim and 2 91 mm day in era 5 this corresponds to a very small 0 02 mm day bias reduction in era 5 compared to era interim the ubrmse computed from monthly time series of global mean rainfall flux also decreased by 0 02 mm day from 0 09 mm day in era interim to 0 07 mm day in era 5 additionally there was a significant increase in the correlation coefficient of monthly global mean rainfall flux anomaly time series between reanalysis and gpcp from 0 06 in era interim to 0 38 in era 5 finally the trend in global mean rainfall flux was over the 1979 2018 period was 0 2 decade in both era interim and gpcp respectively with p values of 0 04 and 0 01 while era 5 showed a larger trend of 1 decade p value 0 01 the trends were computed from the monthly anomaly time series identical trend values within 0 01 decade were obtained from yearly averaged time series of total rainfall the faster trend in era 5 comes from the last 10 years of the series where the divergence between gpcp and era 5 is largest see supplementary fig 1 a detailed analysis of these differences in global mean rainfall would require additional observational datasets to understand the difference is the last decade and looking at the global energy budget which is a key factor for the slow variability of global mean rainfall e g stephens and ellis 2008 nogueira 2019b however such detailed analysis is beyond the scope of the present manuscript for the sake of brevity while global mean rainfall contains relevant information on the earth s climate system namely on the intensity of the water cycle most applications require information about the spatial distribution of rainfall hence the systematic and random components of the differences in spatial rainfall patterns between reanalysis and gpcp are presented below 3 2 inter comparison of bias and rmse patterns at first glance global rainfall flux patterns averaged over the 1979 2018 period are similar between era 5 era interim and gpcp see supplementary fig 2 with the main wet regions intertropical convergence zone itcz the south pacific convergence zone spcz mid latitude storm tracks and dry regions subtropical and polar deserts standing out however a detailed analysis revealed significant differences amongst the three datasets era 5 fig 1 a and era interim fig 1c showed systematic overestimation and underestimation of rainfall compared to gpcp over different regions of the globe specifically era 5 displayed strong positive biases greater than 1 mm day over most of the tropical oceans and over the himalayas and the andes fig 1a the magnitude of the negative biases in era 5 was generally weaker although strong localized systematic underestimation larger than 1 mm day emerged for example over the norwegian sea or the over the southeastern coastal region of south america overall era interim showed a similar global pattern for rainfall flux bias as era 5 fig 1c but with significantly larger magnitude over most of tropics indeed compared to era interim era 5 reduced significantly the positive bias over tropical oceans central africa southeastern asia indonesia central and southern brazil and over the northern hemisphere western sub tropical regions of the pacific and the atlantic fig 1e despite the overall improvement one must notice that there are regions where the bias is increased in era 5 compared to era interim fig 1e however most of these differences have small magnitude on the order of a few tens of millimeters perhaps the only notable exceptions where era 5 biases are significantly larger than era interim are a narrow band over the tropical eastern pacific and localized areas over the northern and southern andes in south america in general the ubrmse patterns in both era 5 fig 1b and era interim fig 1d resemble the global rainfall flux distribution see supplementary fig 2 fig 1f shows that ubrmse was generally lower in era 5 compared to era interim over most of the tropics with largest reductions occurring over northern south america central africa and southeastern asia over the mid latitudes and polar regions ubrmse was nearly identical between both reanalysis era 5 showed increased ubrmse than era interim over a narrow band of the tropical eastern pacific and over the southern andes although these differences are essentially below 1 mm day next the systematic and random differences between reanalysis and gpcp were studied in both periodic and non periodic components this analysis considered only regions where the long term 1979 2018 average rainfall flux was larger than 1 mm day aiming to minimize signal to noise problems as expected the systematic differences i e the biases were mainly reflected in the average seasonal cycle fig 2 a and fig 2b these systematic errors were effectively removed by taking the anomalies cf supplementary fig 2 i e they were mostly removed by removing the seasonal component the reduced bias in era 5 compared to era interim shown in fig 1 was also clearly reflected in the comparison of the rainfall flux seasonal component bias between era 5 and era interim fig 2e ubrmse showed relevant values in both reanalysis for the seasonal cycle component fig 2b and 2d and for the anomalies fig 3 a and 3c the reduction of ubrmse over the tropics in era 5 compared to era interim was also present in both periodic fig 2f and non periodic components fig 3f additionally both components showed largest reductions of ubrmse for era 5 over the same regions eastern equatorial pacific tropical atlantic and indic central africa northern south america and southeastern asia and with largest ubrmse increases in era 5 compared to era interim over the narrow band in the eastern tropical pacific however it is important to highlight that for the seasonal cycle ubrmse measures the variability of the differences between reanalysis and gpcp only over 12 points months and hence the statistics may not robust the correlations of monthly rainfall flux anomaly time series at each grid point between era 5 and gpcp fig 3b and era interim and gpcp fig 3d showed mostly strong positive values over tropical oceans ranging between 0 6 and 0 9 generally the correlations were lower over the mid latitude oceans 0 6 0 7 and even lower 0 5 over ocean regions poleward of 60 the results also showed remarkably high correlations 1 over most land regions in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere where observation coverage is best which impacts both gpcp and reanalysis products in contrast over tropical africa and south america the magnitude of the correlations was remarkably low notice that while these correspond to regions where era 5 had the largest improvements in correlation compared to era interim fig 3f the correlations remain mostly below 0 5 even in era 5 outside these regions era 5 displayed only slight increases in correlation over the tropical oceans improvements 0 1 and essentially no change for the rest of the world 3 3 dominant drivers of tropical rainfall systematic differences in this section a process based analysis on the causes for the bias differences between era 5 and era interim in mean rainfall flux over the tropics is presented here considered over the entire 0 30 degrees of latitude in both hemispheres for this analysis the grid points where the absolute bias differences between both reanalysis were below 0 1 mm day were discarded the bias was compared only for the seasonal cycle components since it was shown to be responsible for most of the systematic differences in general most but not all of the bias reduction over the tropical regions shown in fig 2e and particularly the larger magnitude decreases results from a reduction of mean rainfall flux over the oceans fig 4 and continents fig 5 in contrast the fewer grid points over the tropical oceans and land where the bias increased in era 5 correspond essentially to increased rainfall flux over the tropical oceans the bias reduction in era 5 showed no dependency on differences in local same grid point mean surface temperature fig 4a nor differences in local mean precipitable water vapor fig 4b notice that sea surface temperature comes from forcing observational based datasets in both era 5 and era interim resulting in small magnitude differences of the mean sea surface temperature between both reanalysis 0 5 k notice that despite the small magnitude differences fig 4a shows that tropical oceans in era 5 are slightly but systematically cooler then in era interim fig 4c shows systematic changes to the moisture sink source balance of the tropical oceans between era 5 and era interim corresponding to an inverse proportionality between mean rainfall flux and mean surface evaporation over tropical land the differences in mean surface temperature between era 5 and era interim had larger magnitude fig 5a compared to the oceans era 5 displayed a warmer land surface than era interim over most of the considered grid points the distinct behavior found for surface temperature between land and ocean may be explained by the lower thermal inertia of land and consequent a larger amplitude response but also and perhaps more importantly because land surface temperature in both reanalysis is simulated by a coupled land surface model rather than a prescribed forcing fig 5a reveals a moderate link between the largest decreases in mean rainfall flux and largest bias reductions to increases in mean surface temperature over tropical land there was no clear relation between differences in mean rainfall flux and mean evaporation over tropical land fig 5c but the average evaporation over tropical land was higher in era 5 over most of the considered grid points even in most of the grid points where average rainfall flux decreased in era 5 the largest mean rainfall flux decreases and surface temperature increases over tropical land tend to correspond to small decreases in mean precipitable water vapor in the atmospheric column above fig 5b the strongest relation over tropical oceans and land was between differences in mean rainfall flux and bias and the changes in deep convection intensity as measured by ω at 500 hpa figs 4e and 5e and moisture flux divergence convergence figs 4d and 5d the link between differences in mean rainfall flux and vertical motion at 900 hpa was much weaker over the tropical oceans fig 4f and land fig 5f suggesting that changes to deep convection played a dominant role in the rainfall differences between era 5 and era interim this result agrees with nogueira 2017 findings that rainfall variability at monthly to decadal time scales over the wettest regions of the planet including the tropical convergence zones is mainly controlled by the deep convective and moisture convergence dynamics moreover these results confirm and extend hirons et al 2013 findings on the added value of the improved convective parameterization used in era 5 for 1 day forecasts of tropical rainfall when compared to the older implementation used in era interim mainly due to a better representation of the rainfall moisture relationship inhibiting the premature development of deep convection 3 4 dominant drivers of tropical rainfall random differences next the process based analysis was employed to study the differences in rainfall flux ubrmse between era 5 and era interim over the tropics here the changes between both datasets in terms of variability of the anomalies of rainfall flux and other relevant variables was considered as measured by the standard deviation of their monthly time series only the ubrmse computed from rainfall flux anomalies was considered while the seasonal cycle displayed significant ubrmse values particularly over the tropics cf fig 2 this measures the variability of the differences between reanalysis and gpcp only over 12 points months composing the seasonal cycle and hence the statistics may not robust as pointed out in section 3 1 over the tropical oceans the increased ubrmse in era 5 was associated with increases in rainfall flux variability while decreased ubrmse in era 5 was associated with both increased and decreased rainfall flux variability fig 6 over tropical land the results showed only a few localized ubrmse increases in era 5 compared to era interim cf fig 2e while the largest ubrmse decreases were associated with decreased rainfall flux variability fig 7 analogous to the findings for the differences in tropical mean rainfall flux there was a strong linear relationship between increases to rainfall flux variability and increased variability of vertical motion at 500 hpa and moisture flux divergence over tropical oceans fig 6d and e and over tropical land fig 7d and e the differences in tropical sea surface temperature variability were small between era 5 and era interim fig 6a for the same reasons discussed above for the mean differences also there was no clear relation between changes to rainfall flux variability and sea surface temperature variability over the tropics most of the largest decreases in ubrmse in era 5 over tropical ocean were associated with decreased variability in precipitable water vapor fig 6b and in surface evaporation fig 6c however the relationship of the variability between these variables and rainfall flux wasn t linear over tropical land a similar relation between the largest ubrmse decreases in era 5 and precipitable water vapor fig 7b and surface evaporation fig 7c was found finally no clear link was found between changes to ubrmse nor rainfall flux variability to land surface temperature over the tropics fig 7a as a final note on tropical rainfall it is important to highlight that the el niño southern oscillation enso is a well known driver for changes to tropical rainfall patterns enso is related to changes in the sea surface temperature over the tropical pacific e g van oldenborgh et al 2005 gu et al 2007 nogueira 2019c however probably due to the small differences in the sea surface temperature forcing datasets between era 5 and era interim no relation was found between the rainfall differences in the two reanalysis and enso not shown as measured by the niño 3 4 index e g trenberth 1997 3 5 dominant drivers of mid latitude rainfall systematic differences overall the differences in bias between era 5 and era interim were smaller over the mid latitudes than over the tropics see figs 1e and 2e here the mid latitudes were considered as the regions between 30 and 60 degrees of latitude in both hemispheres fig 8 shows that for most of the mid latitude grid points with bias differences greater than 0 1 mm day between both reanalysis era 5 displayed larger average rainfall flux than era interim including over the mid latitude grid points where the largest bias reductions occurred but also over mid latitude grid points where the bias increased slightly in era 5 furthermore the sea surface temperature fig 8a and precipitable water vapor fig 8b over mid latitude oceans were most often slightly lower in era 5 than in era interim respectively within 1 k colder and within 0 7 mm drier nonetheless there was no clear link between the changes in mean rainfall flux and sea surface temperature nor precipitable water vapor over the mid latitude oceans most of the considered grid points over the mid latitude oceans displayed decreased mean surface evaporation in era 5 and there was some relation between the magnitude this decrease with the mean rainfall flux decrease fig 8c the strong linear relation between changes to mean rainfall flux and mean moisture flux divergence found over the tropics was somewhat weaker over the mid latitudes fig 8d although still present most often largest increases to mean rainfall flux over the mid latitude oceans and largest bias reductions were associated to increased moisture flux convergence additionally there was a mean rainfall flux increase and bias decrease showed a clear linear relation to mean ω at 500 hpa decrease fig 8e and a weak relation with mean ω at 900 hpa decrease fig 8f thus the changes to deep convection also played an important role in the differences between era 5 and era interim rainfall patterns over the mid latitude oceans again in agreement in hirons et al 2013 and nogueira 2017 results over mid latitude land regions the largest decreases in rainfall flux bias in era 5 compared to era interim were associated with decreased mean rainfall flux fig 9 notice however that some lower but significant bias decreases were also associated with increased mean rainfall fig 9 overall over mid latitude land there was no clear relation between differences in mean rainfall flux and in land surface temperature fig 9a fig 9b shows a relatively linear relationship between differences in mean rainfall flux and in mean precipitable water vapor with largest decreases in bias corresponding to decreased precipitable water vapor while most of the largest decreases in bias correspond to increased surface evaporation fig 9c the linear relation between rainfall flux and surface evaporation was weak over mid latitude land for example for small increases in evaporation the bias and mean rainfall flux may increase or decrease contrary to the mid latitude oceans over mid latitude land grid points the differences in mean rainfall flux displayed stronger relation to moisture flux divergence changes fig 9d than to vertical velocity at either 500 hpa fig 9e or at 900 hpa fig 9f 3 6 dominant drivers of mid latitude rainfall random differences over mid latitude oceans the differences in ubrmse between era 5 and era interim were generally low mostly below 1 mm day cf fig 3f and with slightly increased variability in era 5 compared to era interim over most grid points with ubrmse 0 1 mm day fig 10 over these grid points era 5 displayed generally increased variability for surface evaporation fig 10c although there was no clear relationship between surface evaporation and rainfall flux variability fig 10b hints a linear relation between differences in variability of rainfall flux and precipitable water vapor over mid latitude oceans although the number of grid points with ubrmse 0 1 mm day and the magnitude of the differences were small similar linear relationships were also found over this mid latitude oceans between rainfall flux variability and moisture flux divergence fig 10d and ω at 500 hpa fig 10e but not for ω at 900 hpa fig 10f the differences in ubrmse between era 5 and era interim were also relatively small over mid latitude land grid points mostly below 1 mm day cf fig 3f the largest decreases increases in ubrmse were associated with reduced increased rainfall flux variability fig 11 in turn these changes in rainfall flux variability showed no clear dependence of land surface temperature fig 11a precipitable water vapor fig 11b surface evaporation fig 11c nor ω at 900 hpa fig 11f in contrast mid latitude grid points displayed clear linear relationships were found between increased rainfall flux variability and increased variability in moisture flux divergence fig 11d and ω at 500 hpa fig 11e 3 7 regional rainfall trends in section 3 it was pointed out that the trend in global mean rainfall flux over the 1979 2018 period was 0 2 decade in both era interim and gpcp but 1 decade in era 5 in this section the spatial pattern of the rainfall flux trends in the three datasets are evaluated and compared fig 12 shows the trend maps at 2 5 2 5 resolution with grey shading representing pixels where the average 1979 2018 climatological average rainfall flux was below 1 mm day or where the p value for the estimate trends was greater than 0 05 i e the trends were considered non significant all datasets displayed regions with significant positive and negative trends and regions with non significant trends however there were clear differences in the patterns between the three datasets the most notorious difference was probably the distinct behavior over central africa where gpcp showed positive rainfall flux trends fig 12a while era 5 fig 12b and era interim fig 12c showed strong negative trends with era interim difference being the largest reaching trends with magnitude larger than 30 decade using gpcp as reference era 5 performed worse than era interim over eastern asia and southeastern south america with the former displaying stronger negative trends cf fig 12d and e while gpcp displayed mostly weak negative or non significant values on the other hand era interim showed a stronger negative trend over central united states than era 5 where gpcp showed mostly non significant trends notice that over the atlantic sector of the arctic ocean both reanalysis underestimated then strong positive trends in gpcp but this result was likely undermined by the frozen precipitation processes that were not considered here fig 12 also shows that compared to gpcp era interim also clearly overestimated the rainfall flux trends over eastern central africa and even more so northern south america while the performance of era 5 was closer to gpcp in contrast era 5 was further from gpcp trends than era interim over the central and eastern equatorial pacific and over the north atlantic and pacific storm tracks indeed over these storm track regions era 5 showed positive trends contrasting with gpcp negative trends era interim displayed weaker positive trends and in that sense its results were closer to gpcp overall the comparison of the rainfall flux trends amongst the three datasets displayed significant differences which are often larger than 20 30 and can even extend to the sign of the trend there was no clear improvement in rainfall flux trend patterns between era interim and era 5 4 summary and discussion rainfall is a crucial variable for hydrology meteorology and climatology and its applications however its quantitative estimation is difficult task due to complex variability of rainfall fields over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales with different governing processes at different scales here a comprehensive evaluation of monthly rainfall fields was performed over a 40 year period 1979 2018 for three important long term global datasets i the widely used ecmwf era interim reanalysis which combines numerical model forecasts with observations from multiple sources ii the recently released ecmwf era 5 reanalysis which will replace era interim and includes several improvements compared to its predecessor and iii the also widely used gpcp which merges rain gauge and satellite based rainfall estimates from multiple sources and was considered here as the reference dataset the bias and ubrme for global mean rainfall flux in era 5 was slightly lower than in era interim 0 02 mm day and the correlation of the global mean rainfall flux anomalies was higher 0 06 against 0 38 but era interim matched gpcp for the global mean rainfall flux trend while era 5 overestimated it 1 decade regional analysis reveals large differences between the rainfall flux trends in the three datasets particularly over tropical africa where even the sign of the trend doesn t match between gpcp and reanalysis there was no clear improvement in the trends between era 5 and era interim when considering gpcp as reference however era 5 rainfall flux monthly time series were closer to gpcp than era interim over most of the tropics where the bias and ubrmse were typically lower and correlation coefficients higher era 5 and era interim displayed similar performance throughout most of the other regions except over localized regions in the eastern tropical pacific and over the andes and himalayas where era interim outperformed era 5 as expected the systematic component of the errors was reflected by the seasonal cycle and could be effectively removed by taking the anomalies the random component of the errors was present in both seasonal cycle and anomalies although the former wasn t statistically robust since it is based only on 12 data points a process based analysis showed that typically era interim tends to overestimate the tropical deep convection both over land and oceans resulting in an overestimation of tropical rainfall this problem was improved in era 5 suggesting that the latter reanalysis represents better tropical circulation patterns particularly the deep convection intensity and moisture flux convergence patterns over the mid latitude oceans the systematic underestimation of rainfall flux by era interim was also improved in era 5 resulting mainly from increased moisture flux convergence and ω at 500 hpa in contrast over the mid latitude land the largest improvements in mean rainfall flux in era 5 compared to era interim were associated with reduced deep convection and moisture flux convergence and thus reduced rainfall flux the differences in random errors over mid latitudes between era 5 and era interim were small but some relation to moisture flux convergence and 500 hpa vertical velocity was also noticeable the clausius clapeyron relationship wasn t relevant in explaining the differences between era 5 and era interim rainfall on the one hand the small differences in sea surface temperature forcing dataset between era 5 and era interim could explain the small role played by the thermodynamic process in their differences in rainfall on the other hand even over land where large surface temperature differences existed in reanalysis land surface temperature is simulated and not a forcing dataset either no relation to differences in rainfall flux were found or the signal change in temperature did not match the change in rainfall flux expected by the clausius clapeyron effect changes to mean surface evaporation weren t directly responsible by differences in rainfall flux except for some grid points over tropical land where era 5 displayed decreased variability in surface evaporation and rainfall flux associated with decreased ubrmse but even over these grid points decreased rainfall flux variability and ubrmse was more tightly related to changes to moisture flux divergence and ω at 500 hpa than to surface evaporation systematic surface evaporation increases were also found over tropical land and ocean grid points associated with systematic rainfall and bias decreases suggesting improvements to the mean moisture tropical sink sources patterns in era 5 the critical role played by improvements to circulation patterns in explaining the improved rainfall in era 5 agrees with nogueira 2017 findings that rainfall variability at monthly to decadal time scales over the wettest regions of the planet including the tropical convergence zones is mainly controlled by the deep convective and moisture convergence dynamics it also agrees with studies by hirons et al 2013 and hersbach et al 2019 demonstrating the improvement in the simulation of rainfall over the tropics and mid latitude storm tracks by the newer version of the ecmwf model used in era 5 compared to its earlier versions used in era interim mainly due to improved convective and microphysics parameterization but also very likely due to improved resolution in conclusion era 5 provides improved quality and higher resolution spatial and temporal rainfall fields compared to previous generation reanalysis additionally era 5 also provides coherent high resolution patterns for other relevant variables with increased quality and quantity of assimilated observations this has important implications many applications including water resources management agriculture and risk management for water related extreme events e g

5743,this paper provides through laboratory experiments the flow discharge passing from a flooded street to a building area through different types of damaged openings a door a window and a gate along with a sensitivity analysis of this discharge to the presence of obstacles or facade details four flow regimes in the street are tested representing a high or low street slope with a high and low water depth these flows resemble that over rectangular side weirs with the major difference that obstacles are usually located near the opening in the street or on the facade 26 configurations of obstacles are then included one after the other and their impact on the flow intrusion is measured for the flow cases without obstacle the agreement of the semi analytical equations available in the literature strongly varies from one equation to another on the other hand the 220 tested flow cases reveal that the location of the obstacle with regards to the opening strongly modifies the impact of the obstacles that increasing the froude number tends to increase the impact of the obstacles and that obstacles have a higher impact on the intrusion discharge through a window than to a door or a gate finally we conclude that the largest obstacles typically parked cars located in the vicinity of openings should be somehow included in operational numerical models that calculate urban floods for

difference with an obstacle configuration vs without obstacle 1 introduction between 1995 and 2015 floods accounted for 43 of all weather related disaster events affecting 2 3 billion and killing 157 000 people unisdr and cred 2015 besides in 2018 four flood events were among the top ten deadliest disaster events guha sapir 2018 being prepared and managing flooding events is then of high priority for authorities fang 2016 besides the number of inhabitants living within urban areas keeps increasing from 33 35 of the world population in 1980 to 55 27 in 2018 united nations population division 2018 and up to a prevision of 70 in 2050 gross 2016 this growing urbanization results in an increase of flooding risk within urbanized areas chen et al 2015 among the tasks aiming at dealing with such risk events the zonation of flood risk level throughout the city wu et al 2015 and the planning of citizen evacuation baba et al 2017 are getting more and more attention these tools are generated by post processing the urban flood simulation scenarios computed using operational 2d shallow water equation models mignot et al 2006 the complexity and efficiency of these operational numerical tools has been strongly increasing for the last 15 years reproducing more and more flow processes such as i the flow exchanges between the flooded streets and the underground sewer network chang et al 2018 or large areas such as malls or metro takayama et al 2007 ii the flow interactions with urban furniture bazin et al 2017 or iii planing the evacuation of inhabitants ishigaki 2008 however mignot et al 2019 recently listed the remaining flow processes taking place during urban flood events not reproduced by operational 2d numerical model for instance mignot et al 2019 state that no pollution dispersion model was developed and tested to reproduce urban flood pollution releases similarly these authors state that the operational numerical models reproducing urban floods do not simulate the flow entering the building areas individual houses or building blocks but rather consider the facades along the streets as impervious this is odd given the level of damage and risk of the flow invading the building areas industrial commercial and living spaces where material can be strongly damaged such as all electronic tools walls and furniture can rapidly rot and strong risk of drowning exist for inhabitant occupying the buildings we believe 1 that operational numerical models that simulate urban floods to assess the spatial distribution of level of risk should reproduce the flow invading building areas and 2 that the validation of these models analytical or empirical requires experimental data present work then aims at modeling experimentally flow intrusions from a flooded street towards a building for future calibration validation of models to be developed a few authors dedicated their research to the flow intrusion within a single building with openings either experimentally liu et al 2018 or numerically gems et al 2016 or within a group of buildings facing the incoming flow in a highly simplified configuration within a straight channel zhou et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge the only work dedicated to realistic flow intrusions in partially urbanized area was performed by sturm et al 2018 with large separated buildings with open doors and windows in a village adjacent to an overtopping torrent however the process of flow within a highly urbanized area where the water flows in a street network and passes from the streets to the building areas was not studied neither experimentally or numerically during an urban flood part of the water flowing in the streets enters the buildings through what we will call here openings the most common ones are doors windows and gates openings are usually initially closed during frequent floods flow intrusion thus takes place through leakage on the sides of openings or through overflows from sewer surcharges for example through plumbing and sanitary elements during extreme flood events the submerged openings can open by themselves get damaged or be entirely removed in these last cases the flow through the openings is expected to behave similarly as that over side weirs as long as the level of water does not reach the top of the opening of quite large thickness typically that of the wall one first objective of the present work is then to evaluate if the flow discharge through openings within urban facades can be predicted by available side weir formulas from the literature one concern nevertheless is that the flow through openings is expected to be affected by the obstacles located in the street and on the facade such as trees mailboxes parked cars bus shelters traffic lights depending on their sizes and locations with regards to the facade and to the opening how the obstacles alter the flow discharge passing from the streets to the buildings is of major importance indeed if their impact on the intrusion discharge is high these obstacles must be included in the topography of the 2d flood simulations or in the semi analytic weir formulas coupled to the 2d models oppositely if their impact is negligible they can be discarded consequently it is highly important to identify for each type of opening and flood regime the magnitude of impact of all obstacles on the intrusion discharges the present work finally aims at investigating the processes governing the flow intrusion from a flooded street towards a building area evaluating the capacities of existing analytical formulas to predict the intrusion discharge through facade openings for configurations without obstacles quantifying the impact of obstacles typically encountered in a street or on a facade on the flow intrusion discharge generating a database of flow intrusion towards building areas during urban floods this work will then provide for numerical models both a database and a sensitivity analysis dedicated to the intrusion towards buildings during urban floods the paper is organized as follows the first section introduces the experimental set up and measurement devices used in the present research along with the research methodology including a list of tested i openings ii flow configurations and iii obstacles the second section presents the flow patterns of flow intrusion without any obstacle and evaluates the capacities of existing analytical formulas to predict the intrusion flow discharge for all tested openings and flood regimes the following section then evaluates the impact of different obstacles on this intrusion discharge the paper ends up with a discussion regarding the necessity to include obstacles in operational models of flood simulation 2 experimental setup and methodology 2 1 experimental set up the experiments are performed at the laboratory of fluid mechanics and acoustics lmfa at the university of lyon insa lyon france the facility reproduces a highly simplified 1 12 scale model of a street and an adjacent facade within which various openings can be included to reproduce the intrusion flow from the flooded street towards a building area neither the layout within the building area nor the possible backward flow from the building area to the street are reproduced here for sake of simplicity a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 it consists of a 8 35 m long and 0 79 m wide straight and smooth open channel of rectangular cross section and constant slope 1 8 1000 referred to as street side on the figure the topography of the street profile is kept horizontal the elevation of the sidewalk being neglected the discharge q u entering the channel upstream is measured in the pumping loop using one of the two available electromagnetic flowmeters endress hauser the first one is in the range q 5 40 l s with an uncertainty of 0 2 l s while the other is q 0 5 l s with an uncertainty of 0 05 l s the upstream boundary condition consists of a grid buffer and a honeycomb with small mesh 0 5 cm alveolus in order to stabilize the inflow furthermore a sharp crested tailgate at the outlet of the channel is used to adjust the water depth to the desired value in front of the opening water depths along the center of the channel h u h 1 h 3 h d from up to downstream on fig 1 are measured using a digital point gauge the left wall of the channel along y 0 axis is made of a 1 cm thick pvc plate within which openings can be machined at a distance l u 5 5 m downstream from the channel entrance the center of the axis system x y z is located at the bottom of the center of the opening along the street side of the pvc plate with x the streamwise axis y the transverse axis towards the street side and z the direction perpendicular to the bed as the intrusion discharge q w passing through the opening flows towards the outlet of the building side it is measured using a previously calibrated triangular weir the corresponding upstream flow elevation is measured using an ultrasonic sensor note that a step upstream from the triangular weir along with the 1 8 1000 slope of the building side prevent from any backward effect of the weir affecting the intrusion discharge finally the outlet discharge downstream from the street is obtained by resting the two measured discharges q d q u q w for a few configurations the surface velocity field in street side near the opening is measured by lspiv large scale particle image velocimetry with a camera located 1 5 m above the flume recording images of the free surface seeded with dry sawdust at a frequency equal to 50 frames per second also 2d fields of the water level are measured in the same area using an ultrasonic sensor fixed on an automated mobile car moving along both x and y directions 2 2 list of openings op by looking at photos of highly urbanized areas it appears that most openings connecting streets to building areas are windows doors and gates as these openings are damaged removed they leave a large open space available for flow intrusion to model these configurations 4 types of openings are considered and sketched in fig 2 op 1 an open window op 2 is an open damaged door op 3 a wider window and op 4 represents a simplified closed gate with a grid on top these openings are created in the model by simply drilling the vertical pvc plate at the interface between the street and the building so that the intrusion water can freely flow through the white areas of each opening in fig 2 2 3 tested flow configurations f four different flow configurations are selected to reproduce four flood events two with a high and two with a low street slope typically 1 1000 and 1 100 two with a high and two with a low water level typically 30 cm and 1 2 m as given in table 1 with the froude number fr 1 q u bh 1 gh 1 and reynolds number re 1 4 q u b 2 h 1 ν f 1 and f 2 are flow configurations with a low froude number corresponding to a low slope urban area while f 3 f 4 and f 5 are configurations with a high froude number corresponding to a high slope urban area f 1 and f 3 are configurations with a low water depth 2 5 cm at laboratory scale that is 12x 2 5 30 cm at real scale while f 2 f 4 and f 5 are configurations with a high water depth about 10 cm at laboratory scale that is 12 10 1 2 m at real scale 2 4 list of obstacles as for openings the analysis of street photographs permitted to list the most common obstacles encountered in the streets and on the facades for sake of simplicity we brought together all obstacles having the same typical size and location with regards to the street and the opening note that only big enough and fixed obstacles are considered herein mobile obstacles such as waste containers potted plants can also affect the flow intrusion if they are transported by the flow and partially block the opening but mobile obstacles are not considered herein moreover for the highest water levels and flow velocity magnitudes some obstacles such as parked cars are expected to be set in motion smith et al 2019 either blocking the opening or being swept away further downstream however this effect is not considered herein for sake of simplicity we end up with four main types of obstacles 1 cars bus shelters noted 1 as id in table 2 these are parked cars or bus shelters classically located on or just adjacent to the sidewalk in front of building facades 2 facade details noted 2 as id in table 2 these are trees utility poles mailboxes and all other obstacles located on the sidewalk close to the facade these obstacles are usually of relatively small horizontal size 3 street details noted 3 as id in table 2 these are trees utility poles street lights traffic signs and all other obstacles located on the sidewalk near the traffic lane these obstacles are assumed to be of same typical size as facade details 4 additional obstacles noted 4 as id in table 2 these are all obstacles that do not fit in the three previous types here we consider a porch inside the building area a windowsill attached to the facade and stairs to access elevated doors following this typology 19 obstacle configurations plus 7 combinations see below are selected and listed in table 2 these obstacle configurations are composed of 1 6 obstacle elements listed as 2 nd column of table 2 which shapes dimensions and locations are sketched on fig 3 some obstacle configurations comprise a single obstacle a car a tree a mailbox a porch others comprise couples or alignments of individual obstacles a couple row of park cars of trees and finally more complex configurations include an additional fixed car in the middle of the street as sketched on fig 3 all obstacle elements have simplified shapes apart from two obstacles of type 4 the windowsill and stair they are all rectangular prisms mounted on the bottom of the flume and emerging across the free surface large obstacles elements 1 15 27 are made of impervious bricks see also fig 3 and smaller obstacles 16 26 of impervious square bars the dimensions of the obstacles indicated on fig 3 are selected to fit at most with real dimensions according to the considered 1 12 scale cars bus shelters are 335 mm long and 162 mm wide about 4 2 m at real scale street and facade details are 20 mm square base 24 cm at real scale fig 4 depicts three examples of obstacle configurations 2 5 measurement uncertainties and scale effects for a given flow configuration the uncertainties regarding the measured intrusion discharge q w are related to uncertainties regarding the exact location of obstacle to evaluate this source of uncertainties three obstacles configurations are added and removed three times for two flow conditions f 1 and f 4 with opening op 2 typical variations of the intrusion discharge among the three repetitions equal 0 91 for the flow with low froude number and 0 93 with the high froude number the measurement method used to estimate the intrusion discharge q w is measured using a triangular weir for which the water depth upstream from the weir is measured by an ultrasonic probe and the discharge is computed using the previously calibrated rating curve uncertainties regarding the measured water depth is estimated by repeating at different times several same flow opening obstacle configurations the variability between the measured water depths remains smaller than 1 8 for the low froude number cases and 2 0 for the high froude number cases moreover uncertainties reported when establishing the calibration curve of the triangular weir is about 1 5 for the measured discharge in the end the measured intrusion discharge uncertainty does not exceed 3 note that by sake of clarity results graphs in the sequel do not contain errorbars related to this level of uncertainty moreover scale effects are expected to distort the extrapolation of the measurements obtained on the present small scale model 1 12 to the real prototype scale indeed while the length ratios and froude number are at scale with real events the reynolds numbers considered herein table 1 are much lower than those of real scale using a froude similarity the prototype reynolds number is expected to be 12 3 2 times higher than the model reynolds number similarly the weber number we accounting for the influence of surface tension will vary above the windows crest we is estimated smaller than about 100 in the experiments indicating that some capillary effects can affect present results they will be absent at the prototype scale indeed assuming roughly that the inlet discharge is correctly estimated by a de marchi formula eq 1 with a constant discharge coefficient the prototype weber number will be 12 2 times higher than in experiments care should thus be taken when extrapolating the present results to real scale flood events 2 6 methodology note that all openings are studied for the flows without obstacle while only three openings op 1 op 2 and op 4 are used with obstacles moreover for the elevated openings op 1 op 3 and op 4 the low water level for flows f 1 and f 3 does not reach the opening and these configurations are discarded to summarize we measure the flow intrusion for 10 combinations of flow openings without obstacles and 8 combinations of flow openings with the 26 obstacle configurations except for obstacles 4 b only used with the window op 1 and 4 c only used with the door op 2 for each combination of flow and opening configuration the following strategy is employed 1 the boundary conditions are adjusted according to table 1 the upstream discharge q u and the weir crest height to reach the desired water depth this flow is labeled 0 i e without obstacle in the sequel the intrusion discharge is recorded 2 each obstacle configuration is installed in the channel one after the other and the intrusion discharge is recorded once the steady state is reached it is verified that h 1 hardly varies when changing the obstacles 3 flow configurations without obstacles present results section depicts the intrusion flow from the flooded street to the building area in absence of any obstacle in the street or on the facade 3 1 flow description fig 5 a depicts the surface velocity field in the street near the opening for flow f 2 with opening op 2 and fig 6 a depicts the 2d field of water elevation field for flow f 4 with opening op 2 in such condition the flow pattern is very similar to canonical flow configuration at a rectangular side weir as expected when approaching the opening section the surface velocity increases and rotates towards the opening while the velocity downstream the opening strongly decreases due to the intrusion discharge leaving the street side the discharge in the street decreases towards downstream so that the mean velocity in the sections downstream the opening is smaller than that upstream moreover the water depth field shows a local depression with low water levels near the upstream corner of the opening and a local maximum of water level near the downstream corner this behavior is in agreement with previously measured water level profiles along rectangular side weirs as that from bagheri et al 2013 3 2 discharge equation the prediction of intrusion discharge through a rectangular side weir adjacent to a straight and smooth rectangular channel has been performed by many authors listed in table 3 since the 1970 s emiroglu et al 2011 listed more than 1500 measured intrusion discharges available in the literature most authors proposed semi empirical formulas permitting to predict the intrusion discharge using the classical de marchi 1934 equation see table 4 1 c d 3 2 q w 2 g h 1 p 3 2 l where p is the crest height l the length of the lateral weir and h 1 the water depth at the upstream section of the opening along the center of the channel the authors then proposed semi empirical formulas for the discharge coefficient c d based on the non dimensional parameters that arise from the dimensional analysis fr 1 p h 1 and l b with b the channel width table 3 lists 12 among the best known available formulas for coefficient c d made more and more complex along time along with the ranges of parameters used for fitting their formulas for sake of comparison the three last lines of table 3 comprise the range of parameters of our experimental campaigns see table 1 in order to test the validity of the formulas from table 3 fig 7 plots δ q w the error in predicted intrusion discharge compared to present measurements the general agreement is quite poor as could be expected given the low agreement between these formulas already mentioned by emiroglu et al 2011 nevertheless swamee et al 1994 formula appears to perform well averaged error of 6 for predicting the intrusion discharge through open windows op1 and op3 while formulas from nandesamoorthy and thomson 1972 yu tech 1972 and jalili and borghei 1996 appear to perform well averaged error of 10 for the intrusion discharge through the door op2 4 impact of obstacles on the flow intrusion as discussed above flow intrusion from a flooded street to an adjacent building area is made more complicated than a classical rectangular side weir due to the presence of obstacles in the street and on the facade the aim of present section is then to identify the effect of such obstacles on the flow pattern near the opening and on the intrusion flow discharge 4 1 flow description fig 5 b depicts the impact of a single car parked just downstream an open door on the surface velocity field near the door op 2 for flow f 2 as expected low velocity regions are measured upstream downstream and on the side of the obstacle indeed flow detachment on the side and downstream from the car is enhanced by the sharp corners of the obstacle the flow approaching the obstacle rotates towards both sides towards the open door on the left side and towards the center of the street on the right side of the obstacle this behavior is very similar to that measured by mignot et al 2013 around standing obstacles in the middle of flooded crossroads moreover fig 6 a and b compares the free surface elevation with and without this parked car for a flow with a higher froude number as expected the water level is increased in front of the car and decreased on its sides globally the whole flow pattern in the vicinity of the obstacle appears to be strongly affected by the obstacle so that the corresponding intrusion flow discharge is also expected to be much affected 4 2 impact of obstacles on the intrusion discharge the aim of present section is to quantify the impact of obstacles on the intrusion discharge toward the building area the relative difference between intrusion discharge with an obstacle o i and without any obstacle for the same opening and flow configuration reads δ q w q w i q w 0 q w 0 where subscript 0 refers to the configuration without obstacle fig 8 plots the impact of the 26 obstacle configurations on the 8 tested flow configurations openings flow conditions and reveals that the obstacles impact the intrusion discharge up to 100 moreover some obstacles increase δ q w 0 while others decrease δ q w 0 the intrusion discharge as expected the large obstacles cars bus shelters assumed to remain fixed for sake of simplicity have a more significant impact than the smaller obstacles facade and street details on the other hand for a given obstacle configuration a given abscissa on the figure the sign of δ q w mostly stays the same for the 8 flow configurations except for some given obstacles e g 1 a dw or 1 b 2 dw a deeper analysis on these impacts is proposed in the next section with the influence of i the position of the obstacle with regards to the opening ii the froude number and iii the non dimensional water depth of the approaching flow in the street and iv finally the type of opening 4 2 1 influence of the position of the obstacle single cars fig 9 plots δ q w for the four single car configurations with the car located upstream up in front of cent downstream dw from the opening or in the middle of the street mid the figure shows that the location of the obstacle strongly affects the intrusion discharge with a positive δ q w when the car is located downstream from the opening and a negative value for the other locations as expected the intrusion is particularly reduced when the car is located just in front of i e blocking the opening moreover the variability of the influence of a single parked car location is very high up to 80 i e of same order as the intrusion discharge itself 4 2 2 influence of the froude number in fig 9 δ q w is split as a function of the froude number blue boxes refer to flow configurations with a low froude number while red boxes refer to flow configurations with a high froude number the tendendy is similar for the 4 opening water depth configurations the modification of intrusion discharge is much larger with the higher froude number to get a more quantified effet of the froude number fig 10 plots for the four same opening water depth configurations the absolute value of ratio δ q w between the high and low froude numbers for the 26 obstacle configurations with 2 δ q w ratio δ q w high froude number δ q w low froude number in agreement with fig 9 the modification of intrusion discharges usually increases as the froude number increases and this increase can reach up to 100 however for some configurations the increasing froude number decreases the impact of the obstacle but more interestingly for these obstacles configurations the increasing froude number either increase or decrease the obstacle impact on δ q w depending of the flow and the opening properties for instance in the case of the street detail centered in front the door 3 a cent with op 2 δ q w ratio is below 1 for flow cases with a high water depth f 2 f 4 but above 1 with a low water depth f 1 f 3 4 2 3 influence of the water depth this section aims at establishing how the impact of obstacles is affected by the water depth this analysis can only be performed for the door op 2 as for the elevated openings the low water depth does not lead to any flow intrusion fig 11 compares the intrusion discharges with low and high water depths for two configurations with low and high froude number using δ q w ratio 3 δ q w ratio δ q w high water depth δ q w low water depth the impact of obstacles appears to be strongly affected by the water depth some ratios reaching up to 10 or 1 10 however no main tendency arises from this analysis 4 2 4 influence of the type of opening finally the absolute value of obstacle impact on the intrusion discharge δ q w is plotted on fig 12 for the three openings for the flow configuration with a high froude number and a high water depth for most obstacle configurations the impact of the obstacle on the intrusion discharge is maximum for the window op 1 then for the door op 2 and finally the gate op 4 this result is logical as a given water depth fluctuation induced by the presence of an obstacle promotes a higher relative variation above an elevated side weir i e the window than above a mounted opening i e the door this is consistent with differences that are higher when the obstacle is located downstream i e for configurations 1a dw 1b 2 dw and 1a dw 2c fig 13 4 3 impact of the obstacle shape simplification as exposed above all obstacles have a highly simplified shape they are rectangular prism mounted on the bed and emerging across the free surface to estimate the effect of simplifying the shape of the obstacles a realistic car of scale 1 12 is inserted fixed on the bed either looking upstream car up or downstream car dw at the same location as obstacle configuration 1a mid that is obstacle element 15 in fig 3 the impact of the realistic car on the intrusion discharge is compared to that of the simplified shape obstacle with the door as opening op 2 for two flows with high water depths while all three obstacles hardly impact the intrusion discharge for the low froude number with the high froude number the intrusion discharge highly differs between the realistic and simplified shapes and in a lesser extent with the car orientation these differences are attributed to the water passing below the car which is not the case for the simplified obstacle shapes that mimic with higher fidelity the bus shelters these results do not affect the conclusions of present sensitivity analysis that exhibits a variability of several tens of percent of the intrusion discharge in presence absence of obstacles however they show that a quantitative estimate of the intrusion discharge for a particular opening obstacle case would require realistic ad hoc models of furniture face details 5 discussion and conclusions this work aimed at investigating the flow processes involved as a flow passes from a flooded street to an adjacent building area via an opening in the facade and measuring the corresponding discharge three openings and four flow regimes were tested moreover 26 obstacle configuration representative of typical obstacles encountered in streets were included for three of the openings to assess the impact of these obstacles on the intrusion discharge it was observed that the flow pattern through an opening is quite similar to that over a lateral rectangular side weir commonly described in the literature the semi analytical laws available in the literature to predict the intrusion discharges were then tested for the flow configurations without obstacles it appears that while some equations fairly agree with present measurements for the flows through doors nandesamoorthy and thomson 1972 yu tech 1972 and jalili and borghei 1996 with a typical difference of 10 and others through windows swamee et al 1994 with a typical difference of 6 other equations strongly over or under estimate the intrusion discharge by up to 100 when adding obstacles the flow pattern and intrusion discharge are affected the impact of the obstacles strongly depends on the following parameters the location of the obstacle s with regards to the opening the froude number and water depth of the approaching flow in the street and the characteristics of the opening globally urban furniture without parked cars affect the intrusion discharge increasing or decreasing it by about 12 for doors to 15 for windows when the froude number is high 0 5 and about 3 for doors to 5 for windows when the froude number is lower 0 2 obstacles miming parked cars or bus shelters with or without urban furniture affect the intrusion discharge by about 50 for doors to 80 for windows when the froude number is high and about 5 for doors to 15 for windows when the froude number is lower this work then permitted to evaluate the level of variability of the intrusion discharge towards a building with regards to the hydraulic and geometric parameters of the flooded street and of the opening and to the type of obstacle that can be encountered during urban floods it provides an estimate of the errors made by numerical computations according to the degree of details of the street facade geometry finally this database gathering 220 measured intrusion discharges is now available for the inclusion and calibration of analytical empirical equations in operational models adapted to simulate urban floods including openings in these models would however require to identify their locations along with their characteristics width crest elevation along the facades this information is sometimes available in gis data bases of the cities or would have to be located using photographs such as in google street view regarding the impact of obstacles on the flow discharge a simple first step would be to identify the facades in front of which cars parking is permitted and to consider the effect of parked cars only for these openings nevertheless the approach presented herein was much simplified and thus present several major limitations first a single opening was considered while several neighboring openings on a facade may be damaged simultaneously in this case the intrusion flow pattern towards one opening is expected to be affected by the intrusions through the openings located upstream second openings considered herein are expected to be removed by the flow leaving a large rectangular open space for the flow intrusion in the reality the openings are expected to be only partially damaged and more complex shapes of open spaces are expected to be encountered third in the present work no backward effect of the flow within the building area is considered the intrusion flow through the opening remains similar to that over an unsubmerged side weir in a real situation the storage capacity of a building and the outflows from the building to a neighboring street through another opening are limited so that stored volume of water is expected to affect the intrusion discharge in the same way as for a partially submerged side weir fourth some obstacles not attached to the ground such as trash containers potted plants cars smith et al 2019 can be mobile under high flow levels and if partially blocking the openings could also affect the intrusion discharges fifth in some wide streets the width of the sidewalk can be large enough so that the effect of the parked cars on the flow intrusion dramatically reduces next step for the understanding of flow exchanges between streets and building areas during urban floods will then be to consider experimental set ups that represent small urban districts where the building areas are connected to several surrounding streets with various openings as proposed by mejia morales et al in press credit authorship contribution statement emmanuel

5743,this paper provides through laboratory experiments the flow discharge passing from a flooded street to a building area through different types of damaged openings a door a window and a gate along with a sensitivity analysis of this discharge to the presence of obstacles or facade details four flow regimes in the street are tested representing a high or low street slope with a high and low water depth these flows resemble that over rectangular side weirs with the major difference that obstacles are usually located near the opening in the street or on the facade 26 configurations of obstacles are then included one after the other and their impact on the flow intrusion is measured for the flow cases without obstacle the agreement of the semi analytical equations available in the literature strongly varies from one equation to another on the other hand the 220 tested flow cases reveal that the location of the obstacle with regards to the opening strongly modifies the impact of the obstacles that increasing the froude number tends to increase the impact of the obstacles and that obstacles have a higher impact on the intrusion discharge through a window than to a door or a gate finally we conclude that the largest obstacles typically parked cars located in the vicinity of openings should be somehow included in operational numerical models that calculate urban floods for

difference with an obstacle configuration vs without obstacle 1 introduction between 1995 and 2015 floods accounted for 43 of all weather related disaster events affecting 2 3 billion and killing 157 000 people unisdr and cred 2015 besides in 2018 four flood events were among the top ten deadliest disaster events guha sapir 2018 being prepared and managing flooding events is then of high priority for authorities fang 2016 besides the number of inhabitants living within urban areas keeps increasing from 33 35 of the world population in 1980 to 55 27 in 2018 united nations population division 2018 and up to a prevision of 70 in 2050 gross 2016 this growing urbanization results in an increase of flooding risk within urbanized areas chen et al 2015 among the tasks aiming at dealing with such risk events the zonation of flood risk level throughout the city wu et al 2015 and the planning of citizen evacuation baba et al 2017 are getting more and more attention these tools are generated by post processing the urban flood simulation scenarios computed using operational 2d shallow water equation models mignot et al 2006 the complexity and efficiency of these operational numerical tools has been strongly increasing for the last 15 years reproducing more and more flow processes such as i the flow exchanges between the flooded streets and the underground sewer network chang et al 2018 or large areas such as malls or metro takayama et al 2007 ii the flow interactions with urban furniture bazin et al 2017 or iii planing the evacuation of inhabitants ishigaki 2008 however mignot et al 2019 recently listed the remaining flow processes taking place during urban flood events not reproduced by operational 2d numerical model for instance mignot et al 2019 state that no pollution dispersion model was developed and tested to reproduce urban flood pollution releases similarly these authors state that the operational numerical models reproducing urban floods do not simulate the flow entering the building areas individual houses or building blocks but rather consider the facades along the streets as impervious this is odd given the level of damage and risk of the flow invading the building areas industrial commercial and living spaces where material can be strongly damaged such as all electronic tools walls and furniture can rapidly rot and strong risk of drowning exist for inhabitant occupying the buildings we believe 1 that operational numerical models that simulate urban floods to assess the spatial distribution of level of risk should reproduce the flow invading building areas and 2 that the validation of these models analytical or empirical requires experimental data present work then aims at modeling experimentally flow intrusions from a flooded street towards a building for future calibration validation of models to be developed a few authors dedicated their research to the flow intrusion within a single building with openings either experimentally liu et al 2018 or numerically gems et al 2016 or within a group of buildings facing the incoming flow in a highly simplified configuration within a straight channel zhou et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge the only work dedicated to realistic flow intrusions in partially urbanized area was performed by sturm et al 2018 with large separated buildings with open doors and windows in a village adjacent to an overtopping torrent however the process of flow within a highly urbanized area where the water flows in a street network and passes from the streets to the building areas was not studied neither experimentally or numerically during an urban flood part of the water flowing in the streets enters the buildings through what we will call here openings the most common ones are doors windows and gates openings are usually initially closed during frequent floods flow intrusion thus takes place through leakage on the sides of openings or through overflows from sewer surcharges for example through plumbing and sanitary elements during extreme flood events the submerged openings can open by themselves get damaged or be entirely removed in these last cases the flow through the openings is expected to behave similarly as that over side weirs as long as the level of water does not reach the top of the opening of quite large thickness typically that of the wall one first objective of the present work is then to evaluate if the flow discharge through openings within urban facades can be predicted by available side weir formulas from the literature one concern nevertheless is that the flow through openings is expected to be affected by the obstacles located in the street and on the facade such as trees mailboxes parked cars bus shelters traffic lights depending on their sizes and locations with regards to the facade and to the opening how the obstacles alter the flow discharge passing from the streets to the buildings is of major importance indeed if their impact on the intrusion discharge is high these obstacles must be included in the topography of the 2d flood simulations or in the semi analytic weir formulas coupled to the 2d models oppositely if their impact is negligible they can be discarded consequently it is highly important to identify for each type of opening and flood regime the magnitude of impact of all obstacles on the intrusion discharges the present work finally aims at investigating the processes governing the flow intrusion from a flooded street towards a building area evaluating the capacities of existing analytical formulas to predict the intrusion discharge through facade openings for configurations without obstacles quantifying the impact of obstacles typically encountered in a street or on a facade on the flow intrusion discharge generating a database of flow intrusion towards building areas during urban floods this work will then provide for numerical models both a database and a sensitivity analysis dedicated to the intrusion towards buildings during urban floods the paper is organized as follows the first section introduces the experimental set up and measurement devices used in the present research along with the research methodology including a list of tested i openings ii flow configurations and iii obstacles the second section presents the flow patterns of flow intrusion without any obstacle and evaluates the capacities of existing analytical formulas to predict the intrusion flow discharge for all tested openings and flood regimes the following section then evaluates the impact of different obstacles on this intrusion discharge the paper ends up with a discussion regarding the necessity to include obstacles in operational models of flood simulation 2 experimental setup and methodology 2 1 experimental set up the experiments are performed at the laboratory of fluid mechanics and acoustics lmfa at the university of lyon insa lyon france the facility reproduces a highly simplified 1 12 scale model of a street and an adjacent facade within which various openings can be included to reproduce the intrusion flow from the flooded street towards a building area neither the layout within the building area nor the possible backward flow from the building area to the street are reproduced here for sake of simplicity a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 it consists of a 8 35 m long and 0 79 m wide straight and smooth open channel of rectangular cross section and constant slope 1 8 1000 referred to as street side on the figure the topography of the street profile is kept horizontal the elevation of the sidewalk being neglected the discharge q u entering the channel upstream is measured in the pumping loop using one of the two available electromagnetic flowmeters endress hauser the first one is in the range q 5 40 l s with an uncertainty of 0 2 l s while the other is q 0 5 l s with an uncertainty of 0 05 l s the upstream boundary condition consists of a grid buffer and a honeycomb with small mesh 0 5 cm alveolus in order to stabilize the inflow furthermore a sharp crested tailgate at the outlet of the channel is used to adjust the water depth to the desired value in front of the opening water depths along the center of the channel h u h 1 h 3 h d from up to downstream on fig 1 are measured using a digital point gauge the left wall of the channel along y 0 axis is made of a 1 cm thick pvc plate within which openings can be machined at a distance l u 5 5 m downstream from the channel entrance the center of the axis system x y z is located at the bottom of the center of the opening along the street side of the pvc plate with x the streamwise axis y the transverse axis towards the street side and z the direction perpendicular to the bed as the intrusion discharge q w passing through the opening flows towards the outlet of the building side it is measured using a previously calibrated triangular weir the corresponding upstream flow elevation is measured using an ultrasonic sensor note that a step upstream from the triangular weir along with the 1 8 1000 slope of the building side prevent from any backward effect of the weir affecting the intrusion discharge finally the outlet discharge downstream from the street is obtained by resting the two measured discharges q d q u q w for a few configurations the surface velocity field in street side near the opening is measured by lspiv large scale particle image velocimetry with a camera located 1 5 m above the flume recording images of the free surface seeded with dry sawdust at a frequency equal to 50 frames per second also 2d fields of the water level are measured in the same area using an ultrasonic sensor fixed on an automated mobile car moving along both x and y directions 2 2 list of openings op by looking at photos of highly urbanized areas it appears that most openings connecting streets to building areas are windows doors and gates as these openings are damaged removed they leave a large open space available for flow intrusion to model these configurations 4 types of openings are considered and sketched in fig 2 op 1 an open window op 2 is an open damaged door op 3 a wider window and op 4 represents a simplified closed gate with a grid on top these openings are created in the model by simply drilling the vertical pvc plate at the interface between the street and the building so that the intrusion water can freely flow through the white areas of each opening in fig 2 2 3 tested flow configurations f four different flow configurations are selected to reproduce four flood events two with a high and two with a low street slope typically 1 1000 and 1 100 two with a high and two with a low water level typically 30 cm and 1 2 m as given in table 1 with the froude number fr 1 q u bh 1 gh 1 and reynolds number re 1 4 q u b 2 h 1 ν f 1 and f 2 are flow configurations with a low froude number corresponding to a low slope urban area while f 3 f 4 and f 5 are configurations with a high froude number corresponding to a high slope urban area f 1 and f 3 are configurations with a low water depth 2 5 cm at laboratory scale that is 12x 2 5 30 cm at real scale while f 2 f 4 and f 5 are configurations with a high water depth about 10 cm at laboratory scale that is 12 10 1 2 m at real scale 2 4 list of obstacles as for openings the analysis of street photographs permitted to list the most common obstacles encountered in the streets and on the facades for sake of simplicity we brought together all obstacles having the same typical size and location with regards to the street and the opening note that only big enough and fixed obstacles are considered herein mobile obstacles such as waste containers potted plants can also affect the flow intrusion if they are transported by the flow and partially block the opening but mobile obstacles are not considered herein moreover for the highest water levels and flow velocity magnitudes some obstacles such as parked cars are expected to be set in motion smith et al 2019 either blocking the opening or being swept away further downstream however this effect is not considered herein for sake of simplicity we end up with four main types of obstacles 1 cars bus shelters noted 1 as id in table 2 these are parked cars or bus shelters classically located on or just adjacent to the sidewalk in front of building facades 2 facade details noted 2 as id in table 2 these are trees utility poles mailboxes and all other obstacles located on the sidewalk close to the facade these obstacles are usually of relatively small horizontal size 3 street details noted 3 as id in table 2 these are trees utility poles street lights traffic signs and all other obstacles located on the sidewalk near the traffic lane these obstacles are assumed to be of same typical size as facade details 4 additional obstacles noted 4 as id in table 2 these are all obstacles that do not fit in the three previous types here we consider a porch inside the building area a windowsill attached to the facade and stairs to access elevated doors following this typology 19 obstacle configurations plus 7 combinations see below are selected and listed in table 2 these obstacle configurations are composed of 1 6 obstacle elements listed as 2 nd column of table 2 which shapes dimensions and locations are sketched on fig 3 some obstacle configurations comprise a single obstacle a car a tree a mailbox a porch others comprise couples or alignments of individual obstacles a couple row of park cars of trees and finally more complex configurations include an additional fixed car in the middle of the street as sketched on fig 3 all obstacle elements have simplified shapes apart from two obstacles of type 4 the windowsill and stair they are all rectangular prisms mounted on the bottom of the flume and emerging across the free surface large obstacles elements 1 15 27 are made of impervious bricks see also fig 3 and smaller obstacles 16 26 of impervious square bars the dimensions of the obstacles indicated on fig 3 are selected to fit at most with real dimensions according to the considered 1 12 scale cars bus shelters are 335 mm long and 162 mm wide about 4 2 m at real scale street and facade details are 20 mm square base 24 cm at real scale fig 4 depicts three examples of obstacle configurations 2 5 measurement uncertainties and scale effects for a given flow configuration the uncertainties regarding the measured intrusion discharge q w are related to uncertainties regarding the exact location of obstacle to evaluate this source of uncertainties three obstacles configurations are added and removed three times for two flow conditions f 1 and f 4 with opening op 2 typical variations of the intrusion discharge among the three repetitions equal 0 91 for the flow with low froude number and 0 93 with the high froude number the measurement method used to estimate the intrusion discharge q w is measured using a triangular weir for which the water depth upstream from the weir is measured by an ultrasonic probe and the discharge is computed using the previously calibrated rating curve uncertainties regarding the measured water depth is estimated by repeating at different times several same flow opening obstacle configurations the variability between the measured water depths remains smaller than 1 8 for the low froude number cases and 2 0 for the high froude number cases moreover uncertainties reported when establishing the calibration curve of the triangular weir is about 1 5 for the measured discharge in the end the measured intrusion discharge uncertainty does not exceed 3 note that by sake of clarity results graphs in the sequel do not contain errorbars related to this level of uncertainty moreover scale effects are expected to distort the extrapolation of the measurements obtained on the present small scale model 1 12 to the real prototype scale indeed while the length ratios and froude number are at scale with real events the reynolds numbers considered herein table 1 are much lower than those of real scale using a froude similarity the prototype reynolds number is expected to be 12 3 2 times higher than the model reynolds number similarly the weber number we accounting for the influence of surface tension will vary above the windows crest we is estimated smaller than about 100 in the experiments indicating that some capillary effects can affect present results they will be absent at the prototype scale indeed assuming roughly that the inlet discharge is correctly estimated by a de marchi formula eq 1 with a constant discharge coefficient the prototype weber number will be 12 2 times higher than in experiments care should thus be taken when extrapolating the present results to real scale flood events 2 6 methodology note that all openings are studied for the flows without obstacle while only three openings op 1 op 2 and op 4 are used with obstacles moreover for the elevated openings op 1 op 3 and op 4 the low water level for flows f 1 and f 3 does not reach the opening and these configurations are discarded to summarize we measure the flow intrusion for 10 combinations of flow openings without obstacles and 8 combinations of flow openings with the 26 obstacle configurations except for obstacles 4 b only used with the window op 1 and 4 c only used with the door op 2 for each combination of flow and opening configuration the following strategy is employed 1 the boundary conditions are adjusted according to table 1 the upstream discharge q u and the weir crest height to reach the desired water depth this flow is labeled 0 i e without obstacle in the sequel the intrusion discharge is recorded 2 each obstacle configuration is installed in the channel one after the other and the intrusion discharge is recorded once the steady state is reached it is verified that h 1 hardly varies when changing the obstacles 3 flow configurations without obstacles present results section depicts the intrusion flow from the flooded street to the building area in absence of any obstacle in the street or on the facade 3 1 flow description fig 5 a depicts the surface velocity field in the street near the opening for flow f 2 with opening op 2 and fig 6 a depicts the 2d field of water elevation field for flow f 4 with opening op 2 in such condition the flow pattern is very similar to canonical flow configuration at a rectangular side weir as expected when approaching the opening section the surface velocity increases and rotates towards the opening while the velocity downstream the opening strongly decreases due to the intrusion discharge leaving the street side the discharge in the street decreases towards downstream so that the mean velocity in the sections downstream the opening is smaller than that upstream moreover the water depth field shows a local depression with low water levels near the upstream corner of the opening and a local maximum of water level near the downstream corner this behavior is in agreement with previously measured water level profiles along rectangular side weirs as that from bagheri et al 2013 3 2 discharge equation the prediction of intrusion discharge through a rectangular side weir adjacent to a straight and smooth rectangular channel has been performed by many authors listed in table 3 since the 1970 s emiroglu et al 2011 listed more than 1500 measured intrusion discharges available in the literature most authors proposed semi empirical formulas permitting to predict the intrusion discharge using the classical de marchi 1934 equation see table 4 1 c d 3 2 q w 2 g h 1 p 3 2 l where p is the crest height l the length of the lateral weir and h 1 the water depth at the upstream section of the opening along the center of the channel the authors then proposed semi empirical formulas for the discharge coefficient c d based on the non dimensional parameters that arise from the dimensional analysis fr 1 p h 1 and l b with b the channel width table 3 lists 12 among the best known available formulas for coefficient c d made more and more complex along time along with the ranges of parameters used for fitting their formulas for sake of comparison the three last lines of table 3 comprise the range of parameters of our experimental campaigns see table 1 in order to test the validity of the formulas from table 3 fig 7 plots δ q w the error in predicted intrusion discharge compared to present measurements the general agreement is quite poor as could be expected given the low agreement between these formulas already mentioned by emiroglu et al 2011 nevertheless swamee et al 1994 formula appears to perform well averaged error of 6 for predicting the intrusion discharge through open windows op1 and op3 while formulas from nandesamoorthy and thomson 1972 yu tech 1972 and jalili and borghei 1996 appear to perform well averaged error of 10 for the intrusion discharge through the door op2 4 impact of obstacles on the flow intrusion as discussed above flow intrusion from a flooded street to an adjacent building area is made more complicated than a classical rectangular side weir due to the presence of obstacles in the street and on the facade the aim of present section is then to identify the effect of such obstacles on the flow pattern near the opening and on the intrusion flow discharge 4 1 flow description fig 5 b depicts the impact of a single car parked just downstream an open door on the surface velocity field near the door op 2 for flow f 2 as expected low velocity regions are measured upstream downstream and on the side of the obstacle indeed flow detachment on the side and downstream from the car is enhanced by the sharp corners of the obstacle the flow approaching the obstacle rotates towards both sides towards the open door on the left side and towards the center of the street on the right side of the obstacle this behavior is very similar to that measured by mignot et al 2013 around standing obstacles in the middle of flooded crossroads moreover fig 6 a and b compares the free surface elevation with and without this parked car for a flow with a higher froude number as expected the water level is increased in front of the car and decreased on its sides globally the whole flow pattern in the vicinity of the obstacle appears to be strongly affected by the obstacle so that the corresponding intrusion flow discharge is also expected to be much affected 4 2 impact of obstacles on the intrusion discharge the aim of present section is to quantify the impact of obstacles on the intrusion discharge toward the building area the relative difference between intrusion discharge with an obstacle o i and without any obstacle for the same opening and flow configuration reads δ q w q w i q w 0 q w 0 where subscript 0 refers to the configuration without obstacle fig 8 plots the impact of the 26 obstacle configurations on the 8 tested flow configurations openings flow conditions and reveals that the obstacles impact the intrusion discharge up to 100 moreover some obstacles increase δ q w 0 while others decrease δ q w 0 the intrusion discharge as expected the large obstacles cars bus shelters assumed to remain fixed for sake of simplicity have a more significant impact than the smaller obstacles facade and street details on the other hand for a given obstacle configuration a given abscissa on the figure the sign of δ q w mostly stays the same for the 8 flow configurations except for some given obstacles e g 1 a dw or 1 b 2 dw a deeper analysis on these impacts is proposed in the next section with the influence of i the position of the obstacle with regards to the opening ii the froude number and iii the non dimensional water depth of the approaching flow in the street and iv finally the type of opening 4 2 1 influence of the position of the obstacle single cars fig 9 plots δ q w for the four single car configurations with the car located upstream up in front of cent downstream dw from the opening or in the middle of the street mid the figure shows that the location of the obstacle strongly affects the intrusion discharge with a positive δ q w when the car is located downstream from the opening and a negative value for the other locations as expected the intrusion is particularly reduced when the car is located just in front of i e blocking the opening moreover the variability of the influence of a single parked car location is very high up to 80 i e of same order as the intrusion discharge itself 4 2 2 influence of the froude number in fig 9 δ q w is split as a function of the froude number blue boxes refer to flow configurations with a low froude number while red boxes refer to flow configurations with a high froude number the tendendy is similar for the 4 opening water depth configurations the modification of intrusion discharge is much larger with the higher froude number to get a more quantified effet of the froude number fig 10 plots for the four same opening water depth configurations the absolute value of ratio δ q w between the high and low froude numbers for the 26 obstacle configurations with 2 δ q w ratio δ q w high froude number δ q w low froude number in agreement with fig 9 the modification of intrusion discharges usually increases as the froude number increases and this increase can reach up to 100 however for some configurations the increasing froude number decreases the impact of the obstacle but more interestingly for these obstacles configurations the increasing froude number either increase or decrease the obstacle impact on δ q w depending of the flow and the opening properties for instance in the case of the street detail centered in front the door 3 a cent with op 2 δ q w ratio is below 1 for flow cases with a high water depth f 2 f 4 but above 1 with a low water depth f 1 f 3 4 2 3 influence of the water depth this section aims at establishing how the impact of obstacles is affected by the water depth this analysis can only be performed for the door op 2 as for the elevated openings the low water depth does not lead to any flow intrusion fig 11 compares the intrusion discharges with low and high water depths for two configurations with low and high froude number using δ q w ratio 3 δ q w ratio δ q w high water depth δ q w low water depth the impact of obstacles appears to be strongly affected by the water depth some ratios reaching up to 10 or 1 10 however no main tendency arises from this analysis 4 2 4 influence of the type of opening finally the absolute value of obstacle impact on the intrusion discharge δ q w is plotted on fig 12 for the three openings for the flow configuration with a high froude number and a high water depth for most obstacle configurations the impact of the obstacle on the intrusion discharge is maximum for the window op 1 then for the door op 2 and finally the gate op 4 this result is logical as a given water depth fluctuation induced by the presence of an obstacle promotes a higher relative variation above an elevated side weir i e the window than above a mounted opening i e the door this is consistent with differences that are higher when the obstacle is located downstream i e for configurations 1a dw 1b 2 dw and 1a dw 2c fig 13 4 3 impact of the obstacle shape simplification as exposed above all obstacles have a highly simplified shape they are rectangular prism mounted on the bed and emerging across the free surface to estimate the effect of simplifying the shape of the obstacles a realistic car of scale 1 12 is inserted fixed on the bed either looking upstream car up or downstream car dw at the same location as obstacle configuration 1a mid that is obstacle element 15 in fig 3 the impact of the realistic car on the intrusion discharge is compared to that of the simplified shape obstacle with the door as opening op 2 for two flows with high water depths while all three obstacles hardly impact the intrusion discharge for the low froude number with the high froude number the intrusion discharge highly differs between the realistic and simplified shapes and in a lesser extent with the car orientation these differences are attributed to the water passing below the car which is not the case for the simplified obstacle shapes that mimic with higher fidelity the bus shelters these results do not affect the conclusions of present sensitivity analysis that exhibits a variability of several tens of percent of the intrusion discharge in presence absence of obstacles however they show that a quantitative estimate of the intrusion discharge for a particular opening obstacle case would require realistic ad hoc models of furniture face details 5 discussion and conclusions this work aimed at investigating the flow processes involved as a flow passes from a flooded street to an adjacent building area via an opening in the facade and measuring the corresponding discharge three openings and four flow regimes were tested moreover 26 obstacle configuration representative of typical obstacles encountered in streets were included for three of the openings to assess the impact of these obstacles on the intrusion discharge it was observed that the flow pattern through an opening is quite similar to that over a lateral rectangular side weir commonly described in the literature the semi analytical laws available in the literature to predict the intrusion discharges were then tested for the flow configurations without obstacles it appears that while some equations fairly agree with present measurements for the flows through doors nandesamoorthy and thomson 1972 yu tech 1972 and jalili and borghei 1996 with a typical difference of 10 and others through windows swamee et al 1994 with a typical difference of 6 other equations strongly over or under estimate the intrusion discharge by up to 100 when adding obstacles the flow pattern and intrusion discharge are affected the impact of the obstacles strongly depends on the following parameters the location of the obstacle s with regards to the opening the froude number and water depth of the approaching flow in the street and the characteristics of the opening globally urban furniture without parked cars affect the intrusion discharge increasing or decreasing it by about 12 for doors to 15 for windows when the froude number is high 0 5 and about 3 for doors to 5 for windows when the froude number is lower 0 2 obstacles miming parked cars or bus shelters with or without urban furniture affect the intrusion discharge by about 50 for doors to 80 for windows when the froude number is high and about 5 for doors to 15 for windows when the froude number is lower this work then permitted to evaluate the level of variability of the intrusion discharge towards a building with regards to the hydraulic and geometric parameters of the flooded street and of the opening and to the type of obstacle that can be encountered during urban floods it provides an estimate of the errors made by numerical computations according to the degree of details of the street facade geometry finally this database gathering 220 measured intrusion discharges is now available for the inclusion and calibration of analytical empirical equations in operational models adapted to simulate urban floods including openings in these models would however require to identify their locations along with their characteristics width crest elevation along the facades this information is sometimes available in gis data bases of the cities or would have to be located using photographs such as in google street view regarding the impact of obstacles on the flow discharge a simple first step would be to identify the facades in front of which cars parking is permitted and to consider the effect of parked cars only for these openings nevertheless the approach presented herein was much simplified and thus present several major limitations first a single opening was considered while several neighboring openings on a facade may be damaged simultaneously in this case the intrusion flow pattern towards one opening is expected to be affected by the intrusions through the openings located upstream second openings considered herein are expected to be removed by the flow leaving a large rectangular open space for the flow intrusion in the reality the openings are expected to be only partially damaged and more complex shapes of open spaces are expected to be encountered third in the present work no backward effect of the flow within the building area is considered the intrusion flow through the opening remains similar to that over an unsubmerged side weir in a real situation the storage capacity of a building and the outflows from the building to a neighboring street through another opening are limited so that stored volume of water is expected to affect the intrusion discharge in the same way as for a partially submerged side weir fourth some obstacles not attached to the ground such as trash containers potted plants cars smith et al 2019 can be mobile under high flow levels and if partially blocking the openings could also affect the intrusion discharges fifth in some wide streets the width of the sidewalk can be large enough so that the effect of the parked cars on the flow intrusion dramatically reduces next step for the understanding of flow exchanges between streets and building areas during urban floods will then be to consider experimental set ups that represent small urban districts where the building areas are connected to several surrounding streets with various openings as proposed by mejia morales et al in press credit authorship contribution statement emmanuel

5744,cluster analysis methods are one of the most widely used types of methods in regionalization of watersheds for regional flood frequency analysis several cluster analysis algorithms have been used in regional frequency analysis studies in the last decades which most of them have been data driven algorithms that identify clusters based on distances or dissimilarities between data points finite mixture models are a type of statistical models that are able to identify the clusters based on frequency distributions in this study the performance of finite mixture models for regionalization of watersheds was evaluated by applying gaussian mixture models for regionalization of watersheds of karun e bozorg in the southwest of iran gaussian mixture models are the best known type of finite mixture models the performance of this method was evaluated according to the homogeneity of regions and the accuracy of flood quantile estimates in addition the results of the proposed method were compared with the results provided by using a well known and efficient data driven hybrid clustering algorithms according to the results the gaussian mixture models clearly outperformed the hybrid clustering algorithm in identifying homogeneous regions while one of the gaussian mixture models assigned all the watersheds to homogeneous regions for five different choices of the number of regions the hybrid clustering algorithm assigned all the watersheds homogeneous regions only for one choice of the number of regions also the flood estimates provided based on the regions identified by the gaussian mixture model and the hybrid clustering algorithm were compared with the at site estimates as evidenced by the results the flood estimates related to the regions identified by the gaussian mixture model are less deviated from at site estimates in terms of the error measures in general results show that finite mixture models can be considered as an efficient option to perform regionalization of watersheds in regional flood frequency analysis studies keywords clustering gaussian mixture models homogeneity regionalization regional flood frequency analysis 1 introduction floods are one type of hydrological extreme events that affect several aspects of human life understanding the behavior and statistical attributes of floods can play an important role to improve flood management plans flood frequency analysis ffa methods are statistical methods to estimate the magnitude of a flood corresponding to a specific return period if the flood data record of a watershed is long enough the flood frequency analysis can be implemented for the watershed based on its flood data this type of flood frequency analysis is called at site flood frequency analysis however when a watershed is ungauged it is not possible to estimate flood quantiles of the watershed by at site flood frequency analysis in addition if the flood data record of a watershed is very short the flood estimates provided by the at site flood frequency analysis methods may not be reliable in such cases regional flood frequency analysis rffa can be an appropriate alternative most of the rffa methods are based on the index flood method developed by dalrymple 1960 hosking and wallis 1993 hosking and wallis 1997 developed a rffa algorithm based on the use of l moments which were used in several studies for regional frequency analysis of hydrologic extreme events e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 srinivas et al 2008 viglione et al 2007 sadri and burn 2011 farsadnia et al 2014 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 as stated in several rffa studies rffa usually includes two main steps regionalization and flood estimation in regionalization step the aim is to form or identify the groups of watersheds named homogeneous regions a homogeneous region is a group of watersheds that they have similar flood generation mechanism flood estimation step aims at fitting a regional frequency distribution to each homogeneous region and estimating flood quantiles for each watershed of the region in regionalization the similarity of the flood generation mechanisms is often assessed based on the similarity of feature vectors of watersheds the feature vectors include some features which are effective on the flood generation mechanism e g physiographical attributes geological characteristics climatological and meteorological attributes land use and vegetation type or some flood related features e g flood statistics the first group is called watershed features and the second group is called flood related feature in this article since the feature vectors consist of several features and may not include the geographical location attributes the watersheds belonging to a region are not essentially geographically contiguous the use of the flood related features can usually increase the homogeneity of regions because of their direct relation to the flood data of watersheds this is an important advantage of the use of flood related features in forming the feature vectors on the other hand it is not possible to calculate the flood related features for ungauged watersheds and so when the objective of rffa is to estimate the flood quantiles for one or more ungauged watersheds it is not possible to use the flood related features to form the feature vectors in such cases the watershed features can be used even to regionalize the ungauged watersheds there are two major approaches to form the regions forming the fixed region and forming the region of influence or hydrological neighborhood the methods based on the cluster analysis often follow the fixed region approach whereas the method region of influence roi burn 1990 and the hydrological neighborhood methods based on canonical correlation analysis cca adopt the region of influence approach e g cavadias 1990 cavadias et al 2001 ouarda et al 2001 the cluster analysis methods are multivariate statistical analysis methods for grouping data points based on their similarities and differences several types and techniques of cluster analysis have been utilized for regionalization of watersheds in rffa studies because of their ability in dealing with multivariate data e g acreman and sinclair 1986 bhaskar and o connor 1989 burn 1989 hall and minns 1999 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 srinivas et al 2008 sadri and burn 2011 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 abdi et al 2017 there are several categorizations of clustering methods and algorithms for example clustering algorithms can be divided into two main groups named hierarchical and partitional algorithms which each group may have some advantages and disadvantages for different applications the hierarchica algorithms often do not need initialization such as determination of the initial cluster centers it is not possible to move a data point from one cluster to another in the same level on the other hand for some partitional algorithms it is required to determine the initial cluster centers but they are capable to move the data points between different clusters in sequent iterations to minimize the objective function of clustering ward s algorithm ward 1963 can be mentioned as one of the widely used hierarchical algorithms in the regionalization studies whereas among the partitional algorithms k means hartigan and wong 1979 has been applied in several regionalization studies in another categorization clustering can be implemented as hard and fuzzy while in hard clustering each data point can belong to only one cluster in fuzzy clustering each data point can belong to more than one cluster simultaneously the most important fuzzy clustering used in the regionalization studies is fuzzy c means fcm algorithm bezdek 1981 whereas most of aforementioned clustering algorithms can be categorized as hard clustering algorithms in addition to the mentioned clustering algorithms there are some techniques such as self organizing feature maps sofm that may not be considered as a clustering algorithm but they can be used as a tool for clustering ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 kohonen s sofm kohonen 1982 has been the most widely used type of sofm in the studies related to regionalization of watersheds and rffa furthermore some hybrid algorithms have been developed and used in the regionalization studies to exploit the capabilities of different clustering algorithms and improve their performances a list of some studies which utilized cluster analysis methods to regionalized watersheds are presented in table 1 since the homogeneity measures are based on the regional flood statistics it is logical to use flood statistics of the watersheds to measure the similarities and differences between the watersheds for forming the regions however when flood estimation for ungauged watersheds is one of the objectives of the rffa the lack of flood data in the ungauged watersheds is an obstacle to assign these sites to the regions therefore in several studies the regionalization of watersheds is implemented only based on the watershed features such as physiographic characteristics meteorological features geological attributes geographical location characteristics soil type and land use descriptors e g acreman and sinclair 1986 nathan and mcmahon 1990 hall and minns 1999 burn and goel 2000 hall et al 2002 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 srinivas et al 2008 farsadnia et al 2014 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 the cluster analysis method can be categorized into data driven and model based clustering methods in most data driven clustering methods the regions are identified based on the similarities and differences between the data points which are measured by the distance measures e g euclidean manhattan minkowski chebyshev and mahalanobis distance measures on the other hand in model based clustering methods the data points that belong to a cluster are those that a probability density function is fitted to them appropriately although different clustering methods have been used for regionalization of watersheds in several studies most of the used methods have been data driven methods and the model based methods have not attracted much attention therefore in the current study the application of model based clustering for regionalization of watersheds to implement rffa was examined by focusing on finite mixture models fmm for this purpose a well known family of fmm named gaussian mixture models gmm was applied to regionalize the watersheds of karun e bozorg basin in the south west of iran for implementing rffa the results were evaluated and compared with the results provided by applying a well known and efficient data driven clustering method it should be noted that in the current study fmm and their well known family gmm were not used as flood frequency distributions but they were used as a clustering method for regionalization of watersheds in the present study fmm or gmm was used a statistical clustering method to regionalize the watersheds it was used to cluster watersheds based on two different types of feature vectors the first type of the feature vectors included the watershed features and the second type consisted of the flood related features not flood data record 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and datasets to examine the proposed regionalization method and evaluate its performance the basin karun e bozorg located in the south west of iran fig 1 was chosen as the case study the total area of the basin is about 67257 km 2 karun and dez are two main rivers of the basin which join together in the upstream of the city ahvaz and make the river karun e bozorg the longitude varies between 48 05 dd e and 52 00 dd e and the latitude varies from 29 10 dd n to 34 12 dd n over the basin for applying the regionalization methods 42 gauging stations and their corresponding watersheds were selected over the basin the stream flow in the selected stations was unregulated and the flood record length in each station was equal or greater than 10 years annual peak flow data records were used as the flood data to implement rffa the record length was varying in the range 10 45 with the mean value equal to 27 years 2 2 regionalization of watersheds by the clustering algorithm wakm ward s hierarchical clustering algorithm ward 1963 and the partitional clustering algorithm k means hartigan and wong 1979 are two clustering algorithms widely used for regionalization of watersheds in rffa studies e g hosking and wallis 1997 jingyi and hall 2004 lin and chen 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 kingston et al 2011 satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 kar et al 2012 ssegane et al 2012 ilorme and griffis 2013 farsadnia et al 2014 smith et al 2015 abdi et al 2017 wakm clustering algorithm first used by ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 for regionalization of watersheds of the state of indiana in the u s and provided more suitable results in comparison with three hierarchical algorithms including single linkage complete linkage and ward and the partitional algorithm k means wakm which consists of ward and k means algorithms also provided better results compared to two other hybrid algorithms namely the combinations of single linkage and complete linkage with k means in wakm the initial clusters are identified by ward s algorithm for a desirable number of clusters then the centers of the initial clusters are used as the initial cluster centers of k means for final clustering and identifying the regions in this study wakm was utilized for regionalization of watersheds and its results were compared with the results provided by the finite mixture models fmm to read more details about the algorithms ward k means and wakm see ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 2008 2 3 regionalization of watersheds by finite mixture models the basic assumption in model based clustering by finite mixture models fmm is that a population consists of a number of subpopulations that each of them has a probability density function the mixture of the probability density functions of the subpopulations forms a finite mixture model for the population raftery and dean 2006 when the objective is to cluster the data each subpopulation can be considered as a cluster the subpopulations often are modeled by the members of the same parametric probability density function family the general form of a finite mixture model including c subpopulation or clusters is presented in eq 1 1 f x c 1 c π c f c x ϕ c where x is the multivariate feature vector π c denotes the proportion of the size of the subpopulation c to the population size f c represents the probability density function of the subpopulation c and ϕ c is the parameter vector of the subpopulation c raftery and dean 2006 by using bayes rule the mixture models can be used to assign the data points to the clusters the data point x is assigned to the cluster h if the posterior probability of its assignment to the subpopulation h is greater than all the posterior probabilities related to other clusters i e τ h x τ c x c 1 c where τ h x π h f h x c 1 c π c f c x represents the posterior probability of its assignment to the subpopulation h since the denominator is the same for all the posterior probabilities the bayes rule can be simplified as x is assigned to the cluster h if h argmax c π c f c x the bayes rule can be estimated by substituting the unknown parameters with their estimated values raftery and dean 2006 gaussian mixture models gmm are the most well known and widely used family of finite mixture models in gmm it is supposed that all the subpopulations have gaussian distributions in this study the gaussian mixture models were applied for regionalization of watersheds the method named expectation maximization em dempster et al 1977 was used to fit gmm to the data to read more about gmm and em algorithms see bishop 2006 everitt et al 2011 it should be noted that in the situations like regionalization of watersheds fmms or gmms are used as clustering methods clustering is an unsupervised learning problem and so we don t dealing with predefined and specific groups or classes of data points but we are trying to recognize unknown patterns existed in data set by using clustering methods the gaussianity assumption in gmm is not related to some specified subpopulation in data set but it is an assumption to start solving the clustering problem and searching to find the best solution for the problem that they are consistent with the assumption before solving the clustering problem by gmm through em algorithm the gaussianity assumption cannot be examined because there is no specified subpopulation or cluster the expectation maximization em algorithms are used to provide such solutions clusters in the form of fmm or gmm in fact em algorithm is used as a particular type of maximum likelihood method to estimate parameters of multivariate gaussian distributions for subpopulations clusters and provide the best choice among different possible solutions for the clustering problem also it is worth noting that gmm can be considered as a universal function approximator and so it can be applied without any question about the data distribution if it is gaussian distributed or not it means that regardless of the original distribution of the data set when allowing a significant number of mixture components it is expected that the gmm approaches the true distribution in the current study the r package mclust 5 4 2 was utilized to perform computations related to gmm there are ten options of em algorithms for clustering of multivariate data which all of them were examined for each number of clusters or regions c the option that provided best results in terms of the homogeneity of regions was selected for regionalization of watersheds by gmm for rffa the objective of the regionalization of watersheds is to identify the regions that are homogeneous and a probability density function can be fitted to the data related to each region appropriately since in the model based clustering the clusters are identified based on their probability density functions it is expected that the use of fmm results in forming more homogeneous regions it is reasonable to use the features that represent or describe the probability density function of data of watersheds in order to form the regionalization feature vectors in the present study two types of feature vectors were formed to address this issue the first type included some geographical physiographical and meteorological attributes of the watersheds the first type feature vectors are called watershed feature vectors and are denoted by v w hereafter in this article the watershed features include the features longitude latitude elevation from sea level drainage area main stream length main stream slope and gravelius coefficient the descriptive statistics of the watershed features are presented in table 2 the logarithmic transform was applied to the watershed features data to modify their asymmetry and skewness in addition to neutralize the effects of dimensional and variance differences all the watershed features were standardized by eq 2 in eq 2 y ij and x ij represent the value of the j th feature in the i th watershed and the standardized value of the j th feature in the i th watershed also y j and s j denote the mean value and standard deviation of the j th feature over all the watersheds 2 x ij y ij y j s j the values of first second and third quartiles of the flood data in each watershed are used to form the second type of the regionalization feature vectors which are named flood related feature vectors hereafter in this article the second type feature vectors are represented by v f it is worth noting that the assumption that is referred to as the basic assumption in model based clustering by finite mixture models in this study is related to clustering these two types of feature vectors not flood data records and their frequency distributions both gmm and wakm were applied to both types of feature vectors for regionalization of the watersheds to evaluate the performances of the algorithms and the effects of the use of different feature vectors 2 4 discordancy assessment homogeneity evaluation and flood quantile estimation to identify the sites or watersheds which are inappropriate for rffa hosking and wallis 1993 developed the discordancy measure d based on the l moment ratios for each site or watershed in a group of n watersheds the discordancy measure d is defined as eq 3 3 d 1 3 n u i u t a 1 u i u where a i 1 n u i u u i u t u i t i t 3 i t 4 i and u n 1 i 1 n u i hosking and wallis 1997 for the i th watershed t i t 3 i t 4 i denote the sample l moment ratios l cv l skewness and l kurtosis respectively which are defined as eqs 4 6 4 t l 2 l 1 5 t l 3 l 2 6 t l 4 l 2 where l 1 l 2 l 3 and l 4 represent the first second third and fourth sample l moments to find more details about calculation of l moments see hosking and wallis 1997 the flood data collected from 42 gauging stations were evaluated by the discordancy measure d according to hosking and wallis 1997 for the number of watersheds greater than 14 if d 3 for a watershed the watershed is considered as discordant since the value of d was not greater than 3 for any watershed no watershed was considered as discordant in rffa homogeneity measures or tests are used to evaluate the homogeneity of regions hosking and wallis 1993 proposed the three heterogeneity measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 for the homogeneity assessment of regions the heterogeneity measures are calculated by fitting a three parameter kappa distribution on the regional average l moment ratios of the regions and performing monte carlo simulation experiments in a large number n sim n sim 1000 for the current study the heterogeneity measures h have been used in several studies e g hosking and wallis 1997 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 viglione et al 2007 srinivas et al 2008 sadri and burn 2011 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 abdi et al 2017 ahani et al 2018 and more details about their calculation can be found in hosking and wallis 1997 a region is regarded as acceptably homogeneous if h 1 it is considered as possibly heterogeneous if 1 h 2 and it is identified as definitely heterogeneous if h 2 hosking and wallis 1997 in the current study a region is considered as homogeneous if h 1 1 and h 2 1 and h 3 1 simultaneously although the homogeneity of regions can be evaluated by the measures h it cannot be much useful when the objective is to compare some different regionalizations in which the number of regions number of homogeneous regions sizes of homogeneous and heterogeneous regions and assignment of the watersheds to the regions are different from each other so a criterion is required that is able to compare the homogeneity provided by different regionalizations therefore in this study a criterion named homogeneity ratio hr is defined as eq 7 7 hr n hom n where n hom represents the number of watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions and n denotes the total number of the regionalized watersheds it is clear that hr varies in the range 0 1 and when n hom increases and hr tends to1 the homogeneity provided by the regionalization is more desirable if hr 1 all the watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions or in other words all the regions are homogeneous this state is called complete homogeneity hereafter in this article after regionalization a regional frequency distribution must be fitted to each region in this study the goodness of fit measure z suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 was used to determine the regional frequency distributions for each region five three parameter distributions namely generalized normal gno generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized extreme value gev and pearson type iii pe3 were examined to find the appropriate regional frequency distribution the parameter estimation for the mentioned distributions was performed by l moments method hosking and wallis 1997 after that the mean value of flood data in each watershed was calculated as index flood to change the regional distribution into the specific frequency distribution of each watershed the flood quantiles were estimated for to the return periods t 5 10 25 50 100 250 500 years which are the typical return periods to design the open channels flood control facilities transportation infrastructures and hydraulic structures such as urban drainage networks levees highway culverts and bridges however it should be noted that according to the 5 t rule reed et al 1999 if the total number of flood data in a region is equal to 5 t for each watershed of the region the greatest return period for which the reliable flood quantile can be estimated is t so even if all the watersheds in the selected case study belong to one region the maximum reliable return period is equal to t 227 years in fact the return period t 500 years is considered to ensure that there is no considerable change in the performances of different methods in flood estimation for longer return periods in comparison with the shorter ones to evaluate the effects of the different regionalizations on the flood estimation the flood quantile estimates provided by rffa methods were compared with the at site flood quantile estimates for each regionalization three relative error measures including mean relative error mre mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square relative error rmsre were calculated for each return period as eq 5 6 and 7 8 mre i 1 n q i as q i r q i as n 9 mare i 1 n q i as q i r q i as n 10 rmsre i 1 n q i as q i r q i as 2 n where q i as denotes at site flood quantile estimate for the i th watershed q i r represents the flood quantile estimate provided by rffa for the i th watershed and n is the total number of watersheds 3 results and discussion after the discordancy assessment the regionalization of watersheds was implemented by wakm and gmm considering the number of watersheds and the lengths of flood data records the regionalization was implemented for the number of regions c 2 3 8 based on the 5 t rule a rule of thumb can be considered to determine the maximum number of regions assuming that the flood data record length in all the watersheds is the same there must be at least 5 watersheds with the flood data record length equal to t in each region to make it possible to provide reliable flood estimates corresponding to the return period t since there were 42 watersheds in the selected case study the maximum number of regions was determined as c 8 42 5 8 the regionalization was implemented by both wakm and gmm based on both the feature vectors v w and v f the value of homogeneity ration hr was calculated for each regionalization the hr values can be observed in fig 2 in which wakm w and wakm f denote the regionalizations by wakm based on the feature vectors v w and v f respectively and gmm w and gmm f denote the regionalizations by gmm based on the feature vectors v w and v f respectively as seen in fig 2 among the four regionalization options the regionalization by wakm based on the feature vectors v w provided the lowest homogeneity in terms of hr in most cases the lowest value of hr provided by wakm w is equal to 0 for c 2 and the greatest value is equal to 0 64 for c 8 if the regionalization based on v w is implemented by the best gmm option the results of regionalization are improved considerably for all the number of regions c the hr values provided by gmm w are greater than or equal to the hr values provided by wakm w for regionalizations implemented by gmm w hr varies between 0 26 and 0 86 and its maximum value is related to c 6 when the regions were identified based on the feature vectors v f the homogeneity was improved for most values of c in comparison with the regionalizations based on v w according to the results the regionalization by wakm based on v f provides hr values that higher than those provided by wakm w and gmm w the important point is that wakm f reaches hr 1 for c 7 that means providing the complete homogeneity or assigning all the watersheds to the homogeneous regions this is the desirable regionalization condition for rffa in the next step the feature vectors v f were applied for regionalization of watersheds by gmm as evidenced by fig 2 for all the values of c the hr values provided by gmm f are superior to those provided by the three other regionalization options only for c 7 the results provided by wakm f and gmm f are the same in terms of hr satisfying the complete homogeneity hr 1 for c 4 proves the excellent performance of gmm f compared to the three other options in these regionalization states all the watersheds were assigned to the homogeneous regions which is an appropriate condition for rffa in general according to the results presented in fig 2 when v f is for regionalization of watersheds the performances of both method wakm and gmm in assigning the watersheds to the homogeneous regions are improved noticeably in fact the hr values related to wakm f are greater than the values related to wakm w and the hr values related to gmm f are greater than the values related to gmm w in addition in regionalization based on both types of feature vectors v w and v f gmm provides better results in terms of the number of the watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions in other words the hr values calculated for gmm w are greater than the values calculated for wakm w and the hr values calculated for gmm f are greater than the values calculated for wakm f the sizes of the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f in terms of station years are shown in figs 3 and 4 for the optimal number of regions for each of them the optimal number of regions for each regionalization option is the lowest number of regions for which the complete homogeneity hr 1 can be reached so the optimal number of regions for wakm f and gmm f is equal to 7 and 4 respectively reaching the complete homogeneity by gmm f for c 4 can be considered as an advantage in comparison with wakm f that satisfies the complete homogeneity for c 7 because the lower number of regions roughly means formation of larger regions in terms of station years and when a region size increases it becomes possible to provide the flood estimates corresponding to the larger return periods as shown in figs 3 and 4 the average size of the regions identified by wakm f is equal to 163 station years whereas the average size of the regions identified by gmm f is equal to 285 station years according to the 5 t rule reed et al 1999 to provide reliable flood quantiles related to the return period t for the watersheds belonging to a region the total number of flood data recorded in all the watersheds of the region at least must be equal to 5 t therefore regarding the average sizes of the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f for their optimal number of regions on average the greatest return period for reliable flood estimation based on the regions provided by wakm f is t 33 years and for reliable flood estimation based on the regions identified by gmm f is t 57 years however the variability of the region size for each regionalization option is considerable and so the 5 t rule must be applied to each region separately considering the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f the largest region identified by wakm f contains 392 station years of flood data while the size of the largest region identified by gmm f is equal to 649 station years so based on the 5 t rule the greatest return period for reliable flood estimation for 15 watersheds belonging to the largest region identified by wakm f is about 78 years on the other hand the greatest return period for reliable flood estimation for 24 watersheds belonging to the largest region identified by gmm f is about 130 years since c 4 was the lowest number of regions for which gmm f provided the complete homogeneity hr 1 rffa was implemented for c 4 in the study area in fig 5 the values of the heterogeneity measures h are seen for the four regions identified by each of the four regionalization options among the four regions identified by wakm w the regions 2 and 4 are heterogeneous clearly and also the region 1 is identified as heterogeneous according to the measure h 3 though its heterogeneity is not noticeable only the region 3 satisfies homogeneity conditions completely fig 5 a the three heterogeneous regions include 31 watersheds and 11 watersheds belong to the homogeneous region for c 4 regionalization by wakm w results in hr 0 26 fig 2 wakm f provides three homogeneous regions and one heterogeneous region a small heterogeneity can be identified only based on the measures h 2 and h 3 for the region 4 fig 5 b only 5 watersheds belong to the heterogeneous region and 37 watersheds belong to the three homogeneous regions for c 4 wakm f provides hr 0 88 fig 2 applying gmm w results in identifying two homogenous and two heterogeneous regions fig 5 c the regions 1 and 2 which are homogeneous contain 18 watersheds while the regions 3 and 4 which are heterogeneous include 24 watersheds for c 4 hr 0 42 for the regionalization implemented by gmm w fig 2 use of gmm f to identify four regions results in forming four homogeneous regions fig 5 d all the regions are homogeneous based on the three measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 so all the watersheds 42 watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions and hr 1 according to the results presented in fig 5 gmm f is the only regionalization option that provides complete homogeneity hr 1 for c 4 also the results provided by wakm f can be acceptable in terms of the homogeneity of regions therefore the regions identified by gmm f and wakm f were used in the next step of rffa that is the flood quantile estimation the results of calculation of the error measures for the flood estimates provided by wakm f and gmm f are presented in fig 6 for t 25 50 years the values of mre for the regionalization by wakm f are lower than the values related to the regionalization by gmm f but for t 5 10 100 years the mre values calculated based on the regions provided by gmm f are closer to zero than those calculated based on the regions provided by wakm f fig 6 a according to the values of mare for t 5 10 25 50 100 years the deviation of the flood quantiles estimated based on the regionalization implemented by gmm f from the at site estimates are lower than the estimates related to the regions provided by wakm f fig 6 b in addition the results related to the calculation of rmsre are in complete consistency with the results related to mare and show the better performance of rffa based on the regionalization implemented by gmm f therefore as evidenced by the results shown in fig 6 applying gmm f for regionalization of watersheds results in the flood estimates closer to the at site estimates in comparison with the use of wakm f though the differences are not much considerable it should be mentioned that the increasing trend in the difference between the error measures of the estimates provided based on the use of wakm f and gmm f continues when the return period increases up to t 250 500 years however the results related to t 250 500 years are not presented in fig 6 because according to the 5 t rule and the region sizes it is not possible to provide reliable flood quantile estimates for these return periods 4 conclusions in the current study the finite mixture models fmm were used to regionalize the watersheds for rffa the main assumption in using fmm is that a population consists of some subpopulation that a specific probability density function can be fitted to the data of each of them fmm is a mixture of some probability density functions that can be applied to model the population fmm can be used as a statistical method for clustering of data in this study the gaussian mixture models gmm which are the most widely used family of fmm were utilized for regionalization of watersheds of karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran in addition to gmm the regionalization was implemented by the hybrid clustering algorithm wakm ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 the regionalization was implemented by both gmm and wakm based on two types of feature vectors v w and v f which the first one consists of the watershed features and the second one consists of the flood statistics the evaluation of results based on the heterogeneity measures h and the homogeneity ration hr shows that the regionalization option gmm f which denotes regionalization by gmm based on the feature vectors v f provides the greatest values of hr for all the number of regions c 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 which means assigning the largest number of the watersheds to the homogeneous regions in addition only gmm f provides the complete homogeneity hr 1 for 4 c 8 among the other regionalization option only wakm f which represents regionalization by wakm based on the feature vectors v f provides complete homogeneity for c 7 in general the results indicate that both wakm and gmm provide better results in the regionalization based on v f in comparison with the regionalization based on v w it means that the use of the flood statistics may improve the results of the regionalization in terms of the homogeneity ratio however there is a limitation for using the feature vectors v f for regionalization of ungauged watersheds also according to the results in regionalization based on both types of the feature vectors v w and v f gmm provides more appropriate results in terms of hr in comparison with wakm furthermore the comparison of the flood estimates provided based on the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f shows that for c 4 the flood estimates related to the use of gmm f are closer to the at site estimates in comparison with the flood estimates related to the use of wakm f this means that gmm can be considered as a useful method for regionalization of watersheds for rffa the use of non gaussian mixture models such as dirichlet mixture models which do not have some limitations of gmm e g assumption of symmetry in all the subpopulations or clusters can be followed as a complement of this study also the simultaneous use of fmm in regionalization of watersheds and fitting the regional frequency distribution and the flood estimation can be studied in future researches credit authorship contribution

5744,cluster analysis methods are one of the most widely used types of methods in regionalization of watersheds for regional flood frequency analysis several cluster analysis algorithms have been used in regional frequency analysis studies in the last decades which most of them have been data driven algorithms that identify clusters based on distances or dissimilarities between data points finite mixture models are a type of statistical models that are able to identify the clusters based on frequency distributions in this study the performance of finite mixture models for regionalization of watersheds was evaluated by applying gaussian mixture models for regionalization of watersheds of karun e bozorg in the southwest of iran gaussian mixture models are the best known type of finite mixture models the performance of this method was evaluated according to the homogeneity of regions and the accuracy of flood quantile estimates in addition the results of the proposed method were compared with the results provided by using a well known and efficient data driven hybrid clustering algorithms according to the results the gaussian mixture models clearly outperformed the hybrid clustering algorithm in identifying homogeneous regions while one of the gaussian mixture models assigned all the watersheds to homogeneous regions for five different choices of the number of regions the hybrid clustering algorithm assigned all the watersheds homogeneous regions only for one choice of the number of regions also the flood estimates provided based on the regions identified by the gaussian mixture model and the hybrid clustering algorithm were compared with the at site estimates as evidenced by the results the flood estimates related to the regions identified by the gaussian mixture model are less deviated from at site estimates in terms of the error measures in general results show that finite mixture models can be considered as an efficient option to perform regionalization of watersheds in regional flood frequency analysis studies keywords clustering gaussian mixture models homogeneity regionalization regional flood frequency analysis 1 introduction floods are one type of hydrological extreme events that affect several aspects of human life understanding the behavior and statistical attributes of floods can play an important role to improve flood management plans flood frequency analysis ffa methods are statistical methods to estimate the magnitude of a flood corresponding to a specific return period if the flood data record of a watershed is long enough the flood frequency analysis can be implemented for the watershed based on its flood data this type of flood frequency analysis is called at site flood frequency analysis however when a watershed is ungauged it is not possible to estimate flood quantiles of the watershed by at site flood frequency analysis in addition if the flood data record of a watershed is very short the flood estimates provided by the at site flood frequency analysis methods may not be reliable in such cases regional flood frequency analysis rffa can be an appropriate alternative most of the rffa methods are based on the index flood method developed by dalrymple 1960 hosking and wallis 1993 hosking and wallis 1997 developed a rffa algorithm based on the use of l moments which were used in several studies for regional frequency analysis of hydrologic extreme events e g ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 srinivas et al 2008 viglione et al 2007 sadri and burn 2011 farsadnia et al 2014 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 as stated in several rffa studies rffa usually includes two main steps regionalization and flood estimation in regionalization step the aim is to form or identify the groups of watersheds named homogeneous regions a homogeneous region is a group of watersheds that they have similar flood generation mechanism flood estimation step aims at fitting a regional frequency distribution to each homogeneous region and estimating flood quantiles for each watershed of the region in regionalization the similarity of the flood generation mechanisms is often assessed based on the similarity of feature vectors of watersheds the feature vectors include some features which are effective on the flood generation mechanism e g physiographical attributes geological characteristics climatological and meteorological attributes land use and vegetation type or some flood related features e g flood statistics the first group is called watershed features and the second group is called flood related feature in this article since the feature vectors consist of several features and may not include the geographical location attributes the watersheds belonging to a region are not essentially geographically contiguous the use of the flood related features can usually increase the homogeneity of regions because of their direct relation to the flood data of watersheds this is an important advantage of the use of flood related features in forming the feature vectors on the other hand it is not possible to calculate the flood related features for ungauged watersheds and so when the objective of rffa is to estimate the flood quantiles for one or more ungauged watersheds it is not possible to use the flood related features to form the feature vectors in such cases the watershed features can be used even to regionalize the ungauged watersheds there are two major approaches to form the regions forming the fixed region and forming the region of influence or hydrological neighborhood the methods based on the cluster analysis often follow the fixed region approach whereas the method region of influence roi burn 1990 and the hydrological neighborhood methods based on canonical correlation analysis cca adopt the region of influence approach e g cavadias 1990 cavadias et al 2001 ouarda et al 2001 the cluster analysis methods are multivariate statistical analysis methods for grouping data points based on their similarities and differences several types and techniques of cluster analysis have been utilized for regionalization of watersheds in rffa studies because of their ability in dealing with multivariate data e g acreman and sinclair 1986 bhaskar and o connor 1989 burn 1989 hall and minns 1999 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 srinivas et al 2008 sadri and burn 2011 basu and srinivas 2014 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 abdi et al 2017 there are several categorizations of clustering methods and algorithms for example clustering algorithms can be divided into two main groups named hierarchical and partitional algorithms which each group may have some advantages and disadvantages for different applications the hierarchica algorithms often do not need initialization such as determination of the initial cluster centers it is not possible to move a data point from one cluster to another in the same level on the other hand for some partitional algorithms it is required to determine the initial cluster centers but they are capable to move the data points between different clusters in sequent iterations to minimize the objective function of clustering ward s algorithm ward 1963 can be mentioned as one of the widely used hierarchical algorithms in the regionalization studies whereas among the partitional algorithms k means hartigan and wong 1979 has been applied in several regionalization studies in another categorization clustering can be implemented as hard and fuzzy while in hard clustering each data point can belong to only one cluster in fuzzy clustering each data point can belong to more than one cluster simultaneously the most important fuzzy clustering used in the regionalization studies is fuzzy c means fcm algorithm bezdek 1981 whereas most of aforementioned clustering algorithms can be categorized as hard clustering algorithms in addition to the mentioned clustering algorithms there are some techniques such as self organizing feature maps sofm that may not be considered as a clustering algorithm but they can be used as a tool for clustering ramachandra rao and srinivas 2008 kohonen s sofm kohonen 1982 has been the most widely used type of sofm in the studies related to regionalization of watersheds and rffa furthermore some hybrid algorithms have been developed and used in the regionalization studies to exploit the capabilities of different clustering algorithms and improve their performances a list of some studies which utilized cluster analysis methods to regionalized watersheds are presented in table 1 since the homogeneity measures are based on the regional flood statistics it is logical to use flood statistics of the watersheds to measure the similarities and differences between the watersheds for forming the regions however when flood estimation for ungauged watersheds is one of the objectives of the rffa the lack of flood data in the ungauged watersheds is an obstacle to assign these sites to the regions therefore in several studies the regionalization of watersheds is implemented only based on the watershed features such as physiographic characteristics meteorological features geological attributes geographical location characteristics soil type and land use descriptors e g acreman and sinclair 1986 nathan and mcmahon 1990 hall and minns 1999 burn and goel 2000 hall et al 2002 jingyi and hall 2004 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 srinivas et al 2008 farsadnia et al 2014 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 the cluster analysis method can be categorized into data driven and model based clustering methods in most data driven clustering methods the regions are identified based on the similarities and differences between the data points which are measured by the distance measures e g euclidean manhattan minkowski chebyshev and mahalanobis distance measures on the other hand in model based clustering methods the data points that belong to a cluster are those that a probability density function is fitted to them appropriately although different clustering methods have been used for regionalization of watersheds in several studies most of the used methods have been data driven methods and the model based methods have not attracted much attention therefore in the current study the application of model based clustering for regionalization of watersheds to implement rffa was examined by focusing on finite mixture models fmm for this purpose a well known family of fmm named gaussian mixture models gmm was applied to regionalize the watersheds of karun e bozorg basin in the south west of iran for implementing rffa the results were evaluated and compared with the results provided by applying a well known and efficient data driven clustering method it should be noted that in the current study fmm and their well known family gmm were not used as flood frequency distributions but they were used as a clustering method for regionalization of watersheds in the present study fmm or gmm was used a statistical clustering method to regionalize the watersheds it was used to cluster watersheds based on two different types of feature vectors the first type of the feature vectors included the watershed features and the second type consisted of the flood related features not flood data record 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and datasets to examine the proposed regionalization method and evaluate its performance the basin karun e bozorg located in the south west of iran fig 1 was chosen as the case study the total area of the basin is about 67257 km 2 karun and dez are two main rivers of the basin which join together in the upstream of the city ahvaz and make the river karun e bozorg the longitude varies between 48 05 dd e and 52 00 dd e and the latitude varies from 29 10 dd n to 34 12 dd n over the basin for applying the regionalization methods 42 gauging stations and their corresponding watersheds were selected over the basin the stream flow in the selected stations was unregulated and the flood record length in each station was equal or greater than 10 years annual peak flow data records were used as the flood data to implement rffa the record length was varying in the range 10 45 with the mean value equal to 27 years 2 2 regionalization of watersheds by the clustering algorithm wakm ward s hierarchical clustering algorithm ward 1963 and the partitional clustering algorithm k means hartigan and wong 1979 are two clustering algorithms widely used for regionalization of watersheds in rffa studies e g hosking and wallis 1997 jingyi and hall 2004 lin and chen 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 kingston et al 2011 satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 kar et al 2012 ssegane et al 2012 ilorme and griffis 2013 farsadnia et al 2014 smith et al 2015 abdi et al 2017 wakm clustering algorithm first used by ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 for regionalization of watersheds of the state of indiana in the u s and provided more suitable results in comparison with three hierarchical algorithms including single linkage complete linkage and ward and the partitional algorithm k means wakm which consists of ward and k means algorithms also provided better results compared to two other hybrid algorithms namely the combinations of single linkage and complete linkage with k means in wakm the initial clusters are identified by ward s algorithm for a desirable number of clusters then the centers of the initial clusters are used as the initial cluster centers of k means for final clustering and identifying the regions in this study wakm was utilized for regionalization of watersheds and its results were compared with the results provided by the finite mixture models fmm to read more details about the algorithms ward k means and wakm see ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 2008 2 3 regionalization of watersheds by finite mixture models the basic assumption in model based clustering by finite mixture models fmm is that a population consists of a number of subpopulations that each of them has a probability density function the mixture of the probability density functions of the subpopulations forms a finite mixture model for the population raftery and dean 2006 when the objective is to cluster the data each subpopulation can be considered as a cluster the subpopulations often are modeled by the members of the same parametric probability density function family the general form of a finite mixture model including c subpopulation or clusters is presented in eq 1 1 f x c 1 c π c f c x ϕ c where x is the multivariate feature vector π c denotes the proportion of the size of the subpopulation c to the population size f c represents the probability density function of the subpopulation c and ϕ c is the parameter vector of the subpopulation c raftery and dean 2006 by using bayes rule the mixture models can be used to assign the data points to the clusters the data point x is assigned to the cluster h if the posterior probability of its assignment to the subpopulation h is greater than all the posterior probabilities related to other clusters i e τ h x τ c x c 1 c where τ h x π h f h x c 1 c π c f c x represents the posterior probability of its assignment to the subpopulation h since the denominator is the same for all the posterior probabilities the bayes rule can be simplified as x is assigned to the cluster h if h argmax c π c f c x the bayes rule can be estimated by substituting the unknown parameters with their estimated values raftery and dean 2006 gaussian mixture models gmm are the most well known and widely used family of finite mixture models in gmm it is supposed that all the subpopulations have gaussian distributions in this study the gaussian mixture models were applied for regionalization of watersheds the method named expectation maximization em dempster et al 1977 was used to fit gmm to the data to read more about gmm and em algorithms see bishop 2006 everitt et al 2011 it should be noted that in the situations like regionalization of watersheds fmms or gmms are used as clustering methods clustering is an unsupervised learning problem and so we don t dealing with predefined and specific groups or classes of data points but we are trying to recognize unknown patterns existed in data set by using clustering methods the gaussianity assumption in gmm is not related to some specified subpopulation in data set but it is an assumption to start solving the clustering problem and searching to find the best solution for the problem that they are consistent with the assumption before solving the clustering problem by gmm through em algorithm the gaussianity assumption cannot be examined because there is no specified subpopulation or cluster the expectation maximization em algorithms are used to provide such solutions clusters in the form of fmm or gmm in fact em algorithm is used as a particular type of maximum likelihood method to estimate parameters of multivariate gaussian distributions for subpopulations clusters and provide the best choice among different possible solutions for the clustering problem also it is worth noting that gmm can be considered as a universal function approximator and so it can be applied without any question about the data distribution if it is gaussian distributed or not it means that regardless of the original distribution of the data set when allowing a significant number of mixture components it is expected that the gmm approaches the true distribution in the current study the r package mclust 5 4 2 was utilized to perform computations related to gmm there are ten options of em algorithms for clustering of multivariate data which all of them were examined for each number of clusters or regions c the option that provided best results in terms of the homogeneity of regions was selected for regionalization of watersheds by gmm for rffa the objective of the regionalization of watersheds is to identify the regions that are homogeneous and a probability density function can be fitted to the data related to each region appropriately since in the model based clustering the clusters are identified based on their probability density functions it is expected that the use of fmm results in forming more homogeneous regions it is reasonable to use the features that represent or describe the probability density function of data of watersheds in order to form the regionalization feature vectors in the present study two types of feature vectors were formed to address this issue the first type included some geographical physiographical and meteorological attributes of the watersheds the first type feature vectors are called watershed feature vectors and are denoted by v w hereafter in this article the watershed features include the features longitude latitude elevation from sea level drainage area main stream length main stream slope and gravelius coefficient the descriptive statistics of the watershed features are presented in table 2 the logarithmic transform was applied to the watershed features data to modify their asymmetry and skewness in addition to neutralize the effects of dimensional and variance differences all the watershed features were standardized by eq 2 in eq 2 y ij and x ij represent the value of the j th feature in the i th watershed and the standardized value of the j th feature in the i th watershed also y j and s j denote the mean value and standard deviation of the j th feature over all the watersheds 2 x ij y ij y j s j the values of first second and third quartiles of the flood data in each watershed are used to form the second type of the regionalization feature vectors which are named flood related feature vectors hereafter in this article the second type feature vectors are represented by v f it is worth noting that the assumption that is referred to as the basic assumption in model based clustering by finite mixture models in this study is related to clustering these two types of feature vectors not flood data records and their frequency distributions both gmm and wakm were applied to both types of feature vectors for regionalization of the watersheds to evaluate the performances of the algorithms and the effects of the use of different feature vectors 2 4 discordancy assessment homogeneity evaluation and flood quantile estimation to identify the sites or watersheds which are inappropriate for rffa hosking and wallis 1993 developed the discordancy measure d based on the l moment ratios for each site or watershed in a group of n watersheds the discordancy measure d is defined as eq 3 3 d 1 3 n u i u t a 1 u i u where a i 1 n u i u u i u t u i t i t 3 i t 4 i and u n 1 i 1 n u i hosking and wallis 1997 for the i th watershed t i t 3 i t 4 i denote the sample l moment ratios l cv l skewness and l kurtosis respectively which are defined as eqs 4 6 4 t l 2 l 1 5 t l 3 l 2 6 t l 4 l 2 where l 1 l 2 l 3 and l 4 represent the first second third and fourth sample l moments to find more details about calculation of l moments see hosking and wallis 1997 the flood data collected from 42 gauging stations were evaluated by the discordancy measure d according to hosking and wallis 1997 for the number of watersheds greater than 14 if d 3 for a watershed the watershed is considered as discordant since the value of d was not greater than 3 for any watershed no watershed was considered as discordant in rffa homogeneity measures or tests are used to evaluate the homogeneity of regions hosking and wallis 1993 proposed the three heterogeneity measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 for the homogeneity assessment of regions the heterogeneity measures are calculated by fitting a three parameter kappa distribution on the regional average l moment ratios of the regions and performing monte carlo simulation experiments in a large number n sim n sim 1000 for the current study the heterogeneity measures h have been used in several studies e g hosking and wallis 1997 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 viglione et al 2007 srinivas et al 2008 sadri and burn 2011 asong et al 2015 ahani and mousavi nadoushani 2016 abdi et al 2017 ahani et al 2018 and more details about their calculation can be found in hosking and wallis 1997 a region is regarded as acceptably homogeneous if h 1 it is considered as possibly heterogeneous if 1 h 2 and it is identified as definitely heterogeneous if h 2 hosking and wallis 1997 in the current study a region is considered as homogeneous if h 1 1 and h 2 1 and h 3 1 simultaneously although the homogeneity of regions can be evaluated by the measures h it cannot be much useful when the objective is to compare some different regionalizations in which the number of regions number of homogeneous regions sizes of homogeneous and heterogeneous regions and assignment of the watersheds to the regions are different from each other so a criterion is required that is able to compare the homogeneity provided by different regionalizations therefore in this study a criterion named homogeneity ratio hr is defined as eq 7 7 hr n hom n where n hom represents the number of watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions and n denotes the total number of the regionalized watersheds it is clear that hr varies in the range 0 1 and when n hom increases and hr tends to1 the homogeneity provided by the regionalization is more desirable if hr 1 all the watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions or in other words all the regions are homogeneous this state is called complete homogeneity hereafter in this article after regionalization a regional frequency distribution must be fitted to each region in this study the goodness of fit measure z suggested by hosking and wallis 1997 was used to determine the regional frequency distributions for each region five three parameter distributions namely generalized normal gno generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized extreme value gev and pearson type iii pe3 were examined to find the appropriate regional frequency distribution the parameter estimation for the mentioned distributions was performed by l moments method hosking and wallis 1997 after that the mean value of flood data in each watershed was calculated as index flood to change the regional distribution into the specific frequency distribution of each watershed the flood quantiles were estimated for to the return periods t 5 10 25 50 100 250 500 years which are the typical return periods to design the open channels flood control facilities transportation infrastructures and hydraulic structures such as urban drainage networks levees highway culverts and bridges however it should be noted that according to the 5 t rule reed et al 1999 if the total number of flood data in a region is equal to 5 t for each watershed of the region the greatest return period for which the reliable flood quantile can be estimated is t so even if all the watersheds in the selected case study belong to one region the maximum reliable return period is equal to t 227 years in fact the return period t 500 years is considered to ensure that there is no considerable change in the performances of different methods in flood estimation for longer return periods in comparison with the shorter ones to evaluate the effects of the different regionalizations on the flood estimation the flood quantile estimates provided by rffa methods were compared with the at site flood quantile estimates for each regionalization three relative error measures including mean relative error mre mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square relative error rmsre were calculated for each return period as eq 5 6 and 7 8 mre i 1 n q i as q i r q i as n 9 mare i 1 n q i as q i r q i as n 10 rmsre i 1 n q i as q i r q i as 2 n where q i as denotes at site flood quantile estimate for the i th watershed q i r represents the flood quantile estimate provided by rffa for the i th watershed and n is the total number of watersheds 3 results and discussion after the discordancy assessment the regionalization of watersheds was implemented by wakm and gmm considering the number of watersheds and the lengths of flood data records the regionalization was implemented for the number of regions c 2 3 8 based on the 5 t rule a rule of thumb can be considered to determine the maximum number of regions assuming that the flood data record length in all the watersheds is the same there must be at least 5 watersheds with the flood data record length equal to t in each region to make it possible to provide reliable flood estimates corresponding to the return period t since there were 42 watersheds in the selected case study the maximum number of regions was determined as c 8 42 5 8 the regionalization was implemented by both wakm and gmm based on both the feature vectors v w and v f the value of homogeneity ration hr was calculated for each regionalization the hr values can be observed in fig 2 in which wakm w and wakm f denote the regionalizations by wakm based on the feature vectors v w and v f respectively and gmm w and gmm f denote the regionalizations by gmm based on the feature vectors v w and v f respectively as seen in fig 2 among the four regionalization options the regionalization by wakm based on the feature vectors v w provided the lowest homogeneity in terms of hr in most cases the lowest value of hr provided by wakm w is equal to 0 for c 2 and the greatest value is equal to 0 64 for c 8 if the regionalization based on v w is implemented by the best gmm option the results of regionalization are improved considerably for all the number of regions c the hr values provided by gmm w are greater than or equal to the hr values provided by wakm w for regionalizations implemented by gmm w hr varies between 0 26 and 0 86 and its maximum value is related to c 6 when the regions were identified based on the feature vectors v f the homogeneity was improved for most values of c in comparison with the regionalizations based on v w according to the results the regionalization by wakm based on v f provides hr values that higher than those provided by wakm w and gmm w the important point is that wakm f reaches hr 1 for c 7 that means providing the complete homogeneity or assigning all the watersheds to the homogeneous regions this is the desirable regionalization condition for rffa in the next step the feature vectors v f were applied for regionalization of watersheds by gmm as evidenced by fig 2 for all the values of c the hr values provided by gmm f are superior to those provided by the three other regionalization options only for c 7 the results provided by wakm f and gmm f are the same in terms of hr satisfying the complete homogeneity hr 1 for c 4 proves the excellent performance of gmm f compared to the three other options in these regionalization states all the watersheds were assigned to the homogeneous regions which is an appropriate condition for rffa in general according to the results presented in fig 2 when v f is for regionalization of watersheds the performances of both method wakm and gmm in assigning the watersheds to the homogeneous regions are improved noticeably in fact the hr values related to wakm f are greater than the values related to wakm w and the hr values related to gmm f are greater than the values related to gmm w in addition in regionalization based on both types of feature vectors v w and v f gmm provides better results in terms of the number of the watersheds assigned to the homogeneous regions in other words the hr values calculated for gmm w are greater than the values calculated for wakm w and the hr values calculated for gmm f are greater than the values calculated for wakm f the sizes of the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f in terms of station years are shown in figs 3 and 4 for the optimal number of regions for each of them the optimal number of regions for each regionalization option is the lowest number of regions for which the complete homogeneity hr 1 can be reached so the optimal number of regions for wakm f and gmm f is equal to 7 and 4 respectively reaching the complete homogeneity by gmm f for c 4 can be considered as an advantage in comparison with wakm f that satisfies the complete homogeneity for c 7 because the lower number of regions roughly means formation of larger regions in terms of station years and when a region size increases it becomes possible to provide the flood estimates corresponding to the larger return periods as shown in figs 3 and 4 the average size of the regions identified by wakm f is equal to 163 station years whereas the average size of the regions identified by gmm f is equal to 285 station years according to the 5 t rule reed et al 1999 to provide reliable flood quantiles related to the return period t for the watersheds belonging to a region the total number of flood data recorded in all the watersheds of the region at least must be equal to 5 t therefore regarding the average sizes of the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f for their optimal number of regions on average the greatest return period for reliable flood estimation based on the regions provided by wakm f is t 33 years and for reliable flood estimation based on the regions identified by gmm f is t 57 years however the variability of the region size for each regionalization option is considerable and so the 5 t rule must be applied to each region separately considering the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f the largest region identified by wakm f contains 392 station years of flood data while the size of the largest region identified by gmm f is equal to 649 station years so based on the 5 t rule the greatest return period for reliable flood estimation for 15 watersheds belonging to the largest region identified by wakm f is about 78 years on the other hand the greatest return period for reliable flood estimation for 24 watersheds belonging to the largest region identified by gmm f is about 130 years since c 4 was the lowest number of regions for which gmm f provided the complete homogeneity hr 1 rffa was implemented for c 4 in the study area in fig 5 the values of the heterogeneity measures h are seen for the four regions identified by each of the four regionalization options among the four regions identified by wakm w the regions 2 and 4 are heterogeneous clearly and also the region 1 is identified as heterogeneous according to the measure h 3 though its heterogeneity is not noticeable only the region 3 satisfies homogeneity conditions completely fig 5 a the three heterogeneous regions include 31 watersheds and 11 watersheds belong to the homogeneous region for c 4 regionalization by wakm w results in hr 0 26 fig 2 wakm f provides three homogeneous regions and one heterogeneous region a small heterogeneity can be identified only based on the measures h 2 and h 3 for the region 4 fig 5 b only 5 watersheds belong to the heterogeneous region and 37 watersheds belong to the three homogeneous regions for c 4 wakm f provides hr 0 88 fig 2 applying gmm w results in identifying two homogenous and two heterogeneous regions fig 5 c the regions 1 and 2 which are homogeneous contain 18 watersheds while the regions 3 and 4 which are heterogeneous include 24 watersheds for c 4 hr 0 42 for the regionalization implemented by gmm w fig 2 use of gmm f to identify four regions results in forming four homogeneous regions fig 5 d all the regions are homogeneous based on the three measures h 1 h 2 and h 3 so all the watersheds 42 watersheds belong to the homogeneous regions and hr 1 according to the results presented in fig 5 gmm f is the only regionalization option that provides complete homogeneity hr 1 for c 4 also the results provided by wakm f can be acceptable in terms of the homogeneity of regions therefore the regions identified by gmm f and wakm f were used in the next step of rffa that is the flood quantile estimation the results of calculation of the error measures for the flood estimates provided by wakm f and gmm f are presented in fig 6 for t 25 50 years the values of mre for the regionalization by wakm f are lower than the values related to the regionalization by gmm f but for t 5 10 100 years the mre values calculated based on the regions provided by gmm f are closer to zero than those calculated based on the regions provided by wakm f fig 6 a according to the values of mare for t 5 10 25 50 100 years the deviation of the flood quantiles estimated based on the regionalization implemented by gmm f from the at site estimates are lower than the estimates related to the regions provided by wakm f fig 6 b in addition the results related to the calculation of rmsre are in complete consistency with the results related to mare and show the better performance of rffa based on the regionalization implemented by gmm f therefore as evidenced by the results shown in fig 6 applying gmm f for regionalization of watersheds results in the flood estimates closer to the at site estimates in comparison with the use of wakm f though the differences are not much considerable it should be mentioned that the increasing trend in the difference between the error measures of the estimates provided based on the use of wakm f and gmm f continues when the return period increases up to t 250 500 years however the results related to t 250 500 years are not presented in fig 6 because according to the 5 t rule and the region sizes it is not possible to provide reliable flood quantile estimates for these return periods 4 conclusions in the current study the finite mixture models fmm were used to regionalize the watersheds for rffa the main assumption in using fmm is that a population consists of some subpopulation that a specific probability density function can be fitted to the data of each of them fmm is a mixture of some probability density functions that can be applied to model the population fmm can be used as a statistical method for clustering of data in this study the gaussian mixture models gmm which are the most widely used family of fmm were utilized for regionalization of watersheds of karun e bozorg basin in the southwest of iran in addition to gmm the regionalization was implemented by the hybrid clustering algorithm wakm ramachandra rao and srinivas 2006 the regionalization was implemented by both gmm and wakm based on two types of feature vectors v w and v f which the first one consists of the watershed features and the second one consists of the flood statistics the evaluation of results based on the heterogeneity measures h and the homogeneity ration hr shows that the regionalization option gmm f which denotes regionalization by gmm based on the feature vectors v f provides the greatest values of hr for all the number of regions c 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 which means assigning the largest number of the watersheds to the homogeneous regions in addition only gmm f provides the complete homogeneity hr 1 for 4 c 8 among the other regionalization option only wakm f which represents regionalization by wakm based on the feature vectors v f provides complete homogeneity for c 7 in general the results indicate that both wakm and gmm provide better results in the regionalization based on v f in comparison with the regionalization based on v w it means that the use of the flood statistics may improve the results of the regionalization in terms of the homogeneity ratio however there is a limitation for using the feature vectors v f for regionalization of ungauged watersheds also according to the results in regionalization based on both types of the feature vectors v w and v f gmm provides more appropriate results in terms of hr in comparison with wakm furthermore the comparison of the flood estimates provided based on the regions identified by wakm f and gmm f shows that for c 4 the flood estimates related to the use of gmm f are closer to the at site estimates in comparison with the flood estimates related to the use of wakm f this means that gmm can be considered as a useful method for regionalization of watersheds for rffa the use of non gaussian mixture models such as dirichlet mixture models which do not have some limitations of gmm e g assumption of symmetry in all the subpopulations or clusters can be followed as a complement of this study also the simultaneous use of fmm in regionalization of watersheds and fitting the regional frequency distribution and the flood estimation can be studied in future researches credit authorship contribution
