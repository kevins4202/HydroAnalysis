12175,groundwater pollution by hexavalent chromium cr vi becomes a very serious and challenging issue owing to its high toxicity so the present work was conducted is to investigate cr vi occurrence and origin for the first time in the groundwater of sohag governorate egypt therefore 18 groundwater samples were collected and chemically analyzed the results indicated that the groundwater chemistry dominated by hco3 and na while ca mg cl so4 and ca mg hco3 were the main water types in the study area the unconfined part of the studied aquifer contains elevated levels of the studied parameters than the semi confined part owing to the hydrogeological condition variation generally the groundwater samples contain unacceptable concentration 50 μg l for drinking purposes of cr total and cr iii while the concentration of cr vi were ranged from 12 μg l to 58 μg l with only one sample 50 μg l contamination of cr vi in the groundwater can be attributed mainly to human activities with a minor contribution of geogentic sources finally it is important to study the accumulation of cr vi in water resources and its possible effects on human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater contamination chromium speciation chromium vi hydrogeochemistry sohag 1 introduction chromium occurrences in groundwater receive special attention and report is the second hazardous inorganic pollutants in groundwater by nascgc 1994 the extraordinary of chromium rose from its species opposite behaviors among the different species of cr the trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi are the most widespread and stable species in water lukina et al 2016 chow et al 2018 there is a great difference between the two species geochemically and biochemically it can be either essential or toxic cr iii is a micronutrient and cr vi is very harmful to human even at very low concentrations markiewicz et al 2015 beukes et al 2017 the chromium vi pollution of groundwater constitutes a serious problem in several regions around the world kazakis et al 2017 and has serious human health impacts the contamination of soil crops and water with cr in california the united states has led to 2 million deaths between 1989 and 1998 fryzek et al 2001 tseng et al 2018 stated that there is an association between water pollution with cr vi and gastric cancer in taiwan the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of this species referred to its high water solubility mobility and toxicity zhao et al 2016 on the other hand cr iii is most thermodynamic stable form of cr and insoluble in water at neutral ph calder 1988 the predominant form of cr in the environment is cr iii is insoluble immobile and of low toxicity at ph 5 in opposite to cr vi which is very mobile and toxic in the alkaline ph 6 oxidizing eh 0 environment atsdr 2000 oze et al 2004 beukes et al 2017 cr vi could be produced by the oxidation of cr iii in the presence of mno2 in the ambient environmental conditions while cr vi will be reduced into cr iii in the presence of fe ii fe 0 as well as many organic compounds and microorganisms beukes et al 2017 the origin of cr in groundwater may be geogenic through water rock interaction and anthropogenic from the different used chromium bearing materials the most enriched rocks in cr are ultramafic rocks with a concentration of about 1800 mg kg zayed and terry 2003 hooda 2010 so sediments derived from this rocks contain a high concentration of cr about 60000 mg kg alloway 2013 elnazer et al 2018 pointed to the role of water rock interaction in the high concentration of cr in the river nile water also the application of cr in many industries steel alloy paper pulp electroplating paints petroleum refining refractory textiles and metallurgy which can be generate and dispose notable concentrations of cr into the environment araujo barbosa et al 2017 mei et al 2017 kumari et al 2017 generally both of the geogenic origin and anthropogenic activities can release cr vi into groundwater with a notable contribution of the anthropogenic activities than the geogenic origin tiwari et al 2019 groundwater represents the second important source of freshwater in egypt after the river nile the quaternary aquifer in the nile valley share with about 6 5 bcm yr for different sectors domestic agriculture and industry the overpopulation urbanization and industrial revaluation in egypt in the last decades affect adversely on water resource quality the uncontrolled urbanization runoff industrial effluents municipal wastewater and wrong agricultural activates had led to the pollution of water biologically and chemically to alarming levels abdalla et al 2014 abdel satar et al 2017 many chronic diseases in egypt were emerged as a result water pollution especially with heavy metals salem et al 2000 melegy et al 2014 abdalla et al 2014 pointed out the adverse impact of agricultural activities uncontrolled agrochemicals and industrial activities the quality of the quaternary aquifer and its pollution with heavy metals abudeif 2015 pointed out the role of wastewater station at sohag on the elevated concentration of no3 50 88 mg l gedamy 2015 pointed out the pollution of the quaternary aquifer in sohag with cr and other harmful trace elements however the extensive research in many countries on the fate of cr vi in groundwater kazakis et al 2017 and the importance of elemental speciation in the environmental studies egypt lacks the studies in this subject therefore the determination of total cr concentration in water samples cannot be giving a good insight about its environmental and health behavior because its mobility and toxicity depend on its specific form therefore this study dealt with the speciation of cr in groundwater of south sohag governorate egypt and its sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrogeology the geology is very essential for hydrogeologic configuration in terms of aquifer characteristics leaching process water potentiality and movement of water through various reservoirs many authors said 1981 mostafa 1979 ahmed 1980 omer 1996 have studied the geology of the studied area figure 1 summarizes the lithostratigraphic succession of tertiary and quaternary rock units in sohag governorate the quaternary aquifer in sohag governorate can be divided into three units the first unit is aquiclude that represents the base of the aquifer and composes of the impermeable pliocene clay muneiha formation the second unit water bearing unit is composed of pleistocene sediments mainly gravel and sands with clay lenses intercalations said 1981 termed these sediments as qena formation and later omer 1996 divided it into three units qena kom ombo and ghawanim formations the water bearing unit in the old cultivated floodplain semi confined part of the aquifer is ghawanim formation while in the desert fringes unconfined part of the aquifer are qena and kom ombo formations qena and kom ombo formations are of local origin generated from the rocks in the eastern desert while ghawanim formation is of mixed origin local rocks plus ethiopian highlands rocks omer 1996 the third unit is the aquitard unit which composed of silty clay sediments that represent the old cultivated land base this unit is of poor permeability with a great thickness at the edges of the nile channel and vanishing gradually into the desert fringes direction so this aquifer considered semi confined in the old land and unconfined in the desert fringes the aquifer thickness is 100 m omer 2003 abd el raheem 2019 table 1 illustrated the chemical content of some elements in these formations the aquifer is recharged mainly by the infiltration of the surplus leaks of irrigation water and surface water network system canals and drains and secondarily by the river nile and connate water during the flash flood in the desert areas abd el raheem 2019 while it is mainly discharged through many domestic and irrigation wells in the valley and to a lesser extent by natural flow to the nile and evapotranspiration ahmed and ali 2011 2 2 sampling and analyses for fulfilling the aim and scope of the current study eighteen 18 groundwater samples were collected during september 2019 fig 2 six 6 samples from the desert fringes unconfined aquifer and twelve 12 samples from the floodplain semi confined aquifer the ph temperature t c electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were determined in situ using combined electrode hanna hi 93300 which was calibrated before taking the readings in the laboratory all samples were filtered and split in different polyethylene bottles for subsequent analyses of cations and anions the samples were analyzed for chemical constituents by using standard procedures of apha 2012 high purity chemicals double distilled water high precision balance adam pw 124 0 0001 g were used in all analyses in addition all chemical analyses were done in triplicate calcium magnesium carbonate bicarbonate and chloride were analyzed by volumetric methods sodium and potassium were determined by flame photometer nitrate and sulphate were determined by using hanna spectrophotometer instrument model hi 83215 the cations fe mn and total cr were determined by inductively coupled plasma icp ultima 2 the hexavalent cr was measured by diphenyl carbohydrazide spectrophotometer method astm 2002 using spectrophotometer hanna hi 83215 instrument the spatial distribution maps were established using arcgis esri 2013 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation is used that validated by many authors shaker and elnazer 2015 salman et al 2019 it was assumed that the cr iii could be calculated by the following equation zhao et al 2016 cr iii total cr cr vi 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics the water bearing sediments of unconfined and semi confined parts of the aquifer in the study area have different sources and accordingly different geochemistry that will control groundwater chemistry omer 2003 abd el raheem 2019 besides the water bearing sediments and the aquiterd sediments will contribute greatly to the chemistry of water because it represents the passway for aquifer recharge from the infiltrated irrigation water table 2 illustrates the analyzed chemical parameters in the collected groundwater samples groundwater samples were generally alkaline ph 7 6 freshwater tds 720 6 mg l the prevailing cation was na with an average concentration of 206 3 mg l and the prevailing anion was hco3 with an average concentration of 281 4 mg l no3 fe and mn were present in considerable concentrations of about 20 9 mg l 371 9 μg l and 182 4 μg l the presence of elevated no3 concentrations in some samples may refer to the agricultural activity salman et al 2019 and use of hand dug wells for wastewater disposal in the study area the elevated concentrations of the studied parameters except hco3 no3 fe and mn in the unconfined part at the desert fringes may be due to the leaching of salts from the eocene carbonate rocks and the plio pleistocene sediments containing salts of cl and so4 goma 2006 the high concentrations of hco3 no3 fe and mn in the semi confined part of the aquifer may be complied by the impact of the intensive human activities in this area part calcium source in groundwater may be due to carbonate and or silicate dissolution dolomite and or silicate minerals dissolution are the sources of mg in groundwater the main sources of na are leaching of na salts halite and ion exchange ahmed and ali 2011 the wide range in cl and so4 content may be due to the variations of its sources which may be due to the leaching of evaporates filling the cracks within the pliocene clays and from agriculture fertilizers redwan and abdel moneim 2016 the elevated hco3 in the semi confined aquifer may refer to the infiltration of irrigation water enriched in carbonic acid drever 1997 3 2 hydrochemical facies piper s diagram the piper 1944 tri linear diagram is widely applied to understand the hydrochemistry dissimilarities and similarities of the water samples based on the dominant cation and anion igibah and tanko 2019 it also can point out rock water interaction solution kinetics geology and pollution of groundwater kaur et al 2019 the plotting of the studied samples fig 3 illustrates that 8 samples are present in the field i ca mg cl so4 type that indicates the increase of alkaline earths ca mg rather than alkalies na k and the increase of strong acidic anions cl so4 rather than weak acidic anions co3 hco3 seven samples present under category iv ca mg hco3 type indicating that also ca mg na k but co3 hco3 cl so4 ravikumar and somashekar 2017 these two classes indicated the dissolution of carbonate minerals and infiltration of soil salts into groundwater with the surplus irrigation water finally three samples belong to field ii na k cl so4 type representing the excess of alkalies na k and strong acidic anions cl so4 over alkaline earths ca mg weak acidic anions co3 hco3 indicating halite weathering kaur et al 2019 the noticed shift of the sampling points to the middle of diamond shape can be attributed to the contamination of this aquifer ikhlil 2009 all of these sampling wells are located between houses and intensive agriculture which mean that fertilizers and sewage contamination 3 3 chromium speciation unfortunately significant concentrations of total cr 260 6 μg l higher than the preferred limit 50 μg l for drinking water set by who 2011 on the other hand the concentration of cr vi ranged from 12 to 58 μg l with the highest concentration in the unconfined part of the aquifer the prevailing species of cr in the study area was cr iii with an average concentration of 229 4 μg l the ph plays a great role in the distribution of cr concentrations of cr vi was predominant in alkaline water fig 4 with a significant positive correlation r 0 63 while the correlation was lower with cr iii r 0 17 it was appeared that water bearing formation of the unconfined aquifer qena formation contained high concentrations of cr the spatial distribution maps fig 5 of cr total cr iii and cr vi showed that there is variation in the distribution in the study area with nearly the same trend for cr total and cr iii these two forms of cr are mainly concentrated in the desert fringes in the southern part of the study area in addition there is another high concentration in the northern part in opposite to gerga wastewater station and nearly online with the wastewater pipeline this may be attributed to the leakage from this line of leaching of filling materials on the other hand the highest concentration of cr vi was recorded in a small area at the southern part this point is close to petrol station the role of mn in the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi has appeared from the negative correlation fig 6 between mn and cr vi because mn adsorbed back to the sediment surface and recrystallized its structure kaprara et al 2015 under natural water conditions cr iii is rapidly oxidized by a large excess of mno2 and slowly oxidized by dissolved oxygen osaki et al 1980 the significant positive correlation between cr vi and no3 indicate the dominance of anthropogenic activities as a source of this species in groundwater especially the application of fertilizers it was noticed that cr vi could be directly released into the environment via phosphate fertilizer application molina et al 2009 salman et al 2017 mentioned that p fertilizers are contributed to 78 6 of cr total load in sohag soil the presence of hexavalent cr as anionic species cro4 2 cr2o7 2and hcro4 in groundwater makes it highly soluble mobile and poorly adsorbed onto aquifer materials kozuh et al 2000 hence the occurrence of cr vi in the study area groundwater is of mixed origin originating from both the rock weathering products in the sediments and the local infiltration of cr vi with the surplus irrigation water loaded with fertilizers and pesticides residuals even though the conditions geochemical mineralogical and anthropogenic are suitable for the generation and liberation of cr vi groundwater pollution with cr vi may strongly depends on the hydrogeological conditions such as flow paths aquifer types and oxidation reduction processes during the transport of cr vi kazakis et al 2015 kaprara et al 2015 flow paths and aquifer type confined or unconfined control the residence time and the possibility of leached cr vi reduction before entering the aquifer therefore the leached cr vi in the study area could not easily enter the groundwater of the semi confined part of the aquifer as indicated from the low concentration than the unconfined aquifer table 2 4 conclusions chromium speciation is considerable important issue owing to the opposite biochemical behavior of its chemical forms and carcinogenic impact of cr vi the current work declared for the first time the distribution of cr iii and cr vi in groundwater south sohag egypt the groundwater in study area was slightly alkaline with the mean concentrations of major ions in the following order hco3 cl so4 na ca mg k the cr iii is the predominant species in groundwater from the studied area the excess of mno2 into cr vi can oxidize cr iii levels of cr vi in the studied samples have always been attributed to anthropogenic activities the chromium concentration is sensitive to the aquifer ph and neutral or alkaline natural waters predominantly containing cr vi in the studied samples declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the geological sciences dept national research centre for facilitates

by domestic and industrial sectors suhag 2016 demographic growth and rapid expansion of urban industrialization is directly proportional to the increasing water demands in turn leads to over extraction and quality deterioration of groundwater the chemical composition of the groundwater influences periodically by the geo genic processes as well as infiltration of the discharging effluents from numerous overlying point and non point anthropogenic sources also exacerbates the pollution levels vasanthavigar et al 2010 ouyang 2012 therefore once the contaminants infiltrate to the aquifers it becomes difficult to preserve the quality that might create ecological imbalances and many socio economic problems will arise milovanovic 2007 singh et al 2014 one such causative effect that has been mainly noticed in domestic and industrial domains is corrosion or scaling effects generally produced in the water appliances and distribution networks the consumption of poor quality of groundwater with inadequate treatment methods augments the corrosion or scaling effects and poses threats to a safe drinking water supply corrosion is an electrochemical interacting mechanism between aggressive water and walls of the pipelines that slowly disintegrates the interior surfaces of metallic pipes it eventually leads to the dissolution of minerals and metals from the corroding pipes khorsandi et al 2015 these corrosion based physicochemical reactions imparts organoleptic effects to the groundwater such as the rusting of the corroding plumbing systems that releases iron in the transporting water utilities rendering its unfit supply for various purposes sarin et al 2004 hu et al 2018 on the contrary to the corrosion process scaling is a gradual deposition of the minerals producing a layer of white crust within the pipes boilers and other water appliances also groundwater supply acquires higher consumption of energy and the efficiencies of various electrical equipment minimizes due to excessive scaling reducing flow within the pipelines clogging and ultimately bearing costly maintenance so prior treatment of the groundwater is a time consuming effort alsaqqar et al 2014 remarkably corrosion and scaling processes counterbalance each other s effects as scaling neutralizes corrosion and vice versa sarin et al 2004 therefore it seems foremost to get an understanding behind the chemical aspects that drive the potential towards corrosion or scaling behaviors of the groundwater the mathematical expressions have been used widely to predict the corrosive and incrustation abilities of the water through water stability indices namely langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi puckorius scaling index psi larson skold index ls and aggressive index ai these indices predict the chemical integrity of the water and incorporate the physicochemical quality indicators such as temperature ph total dissolved solids tds bicarbonate alkalinity hco3 calcium hardness ca2 chloride cl and sulfate so4 2 davil et al 2009 numerous literature have been reported the application of stability indices particularly corrosion and scaling potential of the drinking water in the water distribution system taghipour et al 2012 kalantary et al 2013 alsaqqar et al 2014 alipour et al 2015 khorsandi et al 2015 some of the studies have checked the corrosiveness of drinking water supplies shams et al 2012 yousefi et al 2016 similarly these indices have also analyzed groundwater quality and measured corrosion or scaling rates shankar 2014 biglari et al 2016 bounab et al 2017 abbasnia et al 2018 zazouli et al 2018 kalyani et al 2017 correlated the corrosion rates of different metallic pipes and corrosiveness of the groundwater based on the above indices therefore the crucial aspect is to analyze the precipitation or aggressive conditions relative to the water chemistry antony et al 2011 and these indices would prior substantiate the levels of the chemical instability for the consumed groundwater ghaziabad one of the suburban districts of western uttar pradesh is engaged in different land use practices whose water demands mostly rely on the groundwater supply several past studies have shown that ghaziabad has been facing high rates of contamination of groundwater by the heavy influence of industrial sectors singh et al 2014 2012 kumari et al 2013 chabukdhara et al 2017 tyagi and sarma 2018 moreover the corrosion and scaling abilities of groundwater within the region is still not investigated with the prevailing geochemical conditions that govern chemical stabilities the rationale of this study would not only aid in prior quality check but also ensure safe domestic and industrial groundwater supply that should be monitored certainly for corrosive and scaling integrities specifically the current study aims i qualitative assessment of the groundwater in accordance with physico chemical parameters seasonally ii geochemical characterization to interpret the origin hydrochemical composition classification of the groundwater and ion exchange processes iii estimating corrosion scaling properties of the groundwater through water stability indices with its spatial temporal mapping and iv correlation analysis to evaluate similarities among quality parameters and strong association within the indices 2

longitudes 77 12ʹe to 77 42ʹe and latitudes 28 36ʹn to 28 55ʹn fig 1 and shares its boundaries with national capital territory nct of delhi over the last decade ghaziabad has seen increasing commercial developments and shrinking of agriculture practices several prominent industrial clusters have been located within the district and consist of various small scale and medium to large scale production units out of 145 about 73 of the heavy based industries deals in food rubber plastic petroleum chemicals chemical products metal products machinery tools and electric transport equipment msme 2012 2 2 climate and rainfall climate is sub humid to subtropical with maximum and minimum temperature of 42 c and 4 5 c respectively the average rainfall of the district is attributed to four categories as winter jan feb summer monsoon march may southwest monsoon june sept and northeast monsoon oct dec recorded 20 6 mm 12 1 mm 156 9 mm 15 1 mm respectively over the last 30 years cgwb anon the normal annual rainfall of the district is 750 3 mm also in the year 2017 the annual average rainfall was 392 8 mm where southwest monsoon dominated with average rainfall of 348 8 mm yadav et al 2017 2 3 physiography geology and aquifer settings physiographically the district consists of the older alluvial plain older floodplain and active floodplain the older alluvium occupies an entire upland and interfluve area between the drainage of yamuna hindon and hindon ganga in the middle of the ganga yamuna doab the district is confined with rivers like the ganga upper canal on the east and yamuna on its west and with small tributaries like hindon and kali nadi all flowing in general slope of the area in northwest to southeast direction the irrigation and drinking water load of the district is also fulfilled with the upper ganga canal groundwater flow direction is from nw se which follows major drainage lines with a gentle groundwater gradient in southern part of the district cgwb 2009 the geological settings exhibits lower proterozoic age which comprises of quartzite and phyllite hard and compact quartzites are huge thickly bedded and highly jointed in nature intercalated with thin beds of phyllite and slates the above rock settings are covered with quartneary sediments found exposed in isolated residual and structural hills and pediments the region is a part of indo gangetic alluvium plains that carries beds of sand clay reh and kanker sandy soil is predominant and fertile loamy soil is also found in this region singh et al 2014 the depth of the water table is generally recorded at 10 15 mbgl with seasonal fluctuation of about 5 m in 2017 the fluctuations in the water level in pre monsoon prm and post monsoon pom season is prominent in northern region having 0 10 mbgl and southern part ranges from 15 to 20 mbgl as illustrated in fig 2 upgwd 2017 the exploratory drilling performed in the region explored three tier aquifer systems extended up to a

of granular zones that are thick bedded to a coarser material compared to second third aquifer system which holds thin bedded to finer sediments predominant of silt and clay material cgwb anon 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and collection method based on the initial reconnaissance survey and to ensure spatial uniformity of the groundwater quality twenty six 26 sampling locations were identified in different land use types i e residential 3 5 6 8 9 14 16 18 19 22 23 26 industrial 1 12 15 25 agricultural sites 2 4 7 10 11 17 20 21 and rest of the locations from mixed land use type 13 24 groundwater samples were abstracted from india mark ii and local hand pumps extended to the shallow aquifer of depth ranging from 40 to 60 ft during prm may 2017 and pom october 2017 before the collection samples were flushed out for 5 10 min as to fetch water from shallow aquifer settings and then stored in pre cleaned 1 liter polyethylene bottles and preserved the samples in cold storage for further analysis 3 2 analytical techniques adopted the physicochemical testing was performed in the laboratory by following the standard protocol apha 2005 all the readings of the cationic anionic experiments triplicated as to maintain the accuracy within the results physical parameters like temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and tds were measured onsite using a portable instrument eutech pcstestr35 total hardness th calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were analyzed using ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta titrimetric method buffer solution ph 9 10 of nh4cl nh4oh and eriochrome black t ebt indicator was added to the water samples ebt indicator imparts wine red color forming unstable complexes with ca2 and mg2 ions present in water samples thereafter titration of the samples with standard edta titrant 0 01 m complexes with ca2 and mg2 ions in the solution and revert its wine red color to blue color attaining the end point of the titration and forming stable complex sodium na and potassium k were detected in flame mode with atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas agilent technologies 280 fs aa bicarbonate alkalinity hco3 indicates the acid neutralizing capacity due to the presence of the titratable bases such as bicarbonates hco3 carbonates co3 2 and hydroxide oh ions in the water the samples were titrated against standard acid hcl 0 1n solution using phenolphthalein and methyl orange as the indicators addition of the phenolphthalein indicator neutralized oh ions and co3 2 to hco3 ions and which were further neutralized to water and carbon dioxide co2 using methyl red indicator chloride cl was measured by the argentometric titration using silver nitrate agno3 as the titrant and potassium chromate k2cro4 as an end point indicator the titration from agno3 0 02n precipitates silver chloride as white colored end point of the reaction is attained when all the cl ions precipitated and excess chromate ions cro4 2 of the indicator formed red brown precipitate of silver chromate agcro4 sulfate so4 2 were estimated using turbidimetric method barium chloride bacl2 was used to precipitate so4 2 ions when formed as barium sulfate baso4 the determination of so4 2 ions was measured by absorption using spectrophotometer at λ max 420 nm concentration of so4 2 ions were calculated from standard calibration curve from standard sulfate solution 10 40 mg l 3 3 water stability indices for estimating corrosion scaling potentials description of the water stability indices is presented khorsandi et al 2015 in table 1 langelier 1936 gave lsi that measured the difference between the definite ph of the water and saturated ph for caco3 phs it directs either towards precipitation of caco3 lsi 0 or dissolution of caco3 lsi 0 however lsi is incompetent to estimate the extent to initiate crystallization ryznar 1944 modified the lsi as rsi outlines the potential of the water to precipitate caco3 the index of rsi is expressed in positive values for estimating the scaling or corrosive nature kalyani et al 2017 rsi 6 is supersaturated with caco3 and as the rsi value increases the water tends to have corrosive nature in 1980 paul puckorius and maxey brooke estimated corrosion and scaling potential by considering equilibrium ph pheq in the form of psi alike lsi or rsi which takes measured ph psi 6 shows a scaling ability and psi 7 maintains a corrosive nature of the water table 1 ls index was developed by larson skold which measures the aggressiveness of water toward pitting of the pipes ai is a suitable index and used as a sign of water corrosiveness ai does not consider temperature and dissolved solids due to which it is less precise as an analytical index when compared to lsi khorsandi et al 2015 3 4 spatial interpolation mapping in geographic information system gis the spatial distribution of the point data recorded in the environment was interpolated to create thematic maps that present spatiotemporal dynamics of the corrosion scaling potential within the surface boundaries by using spatial analyst module of arcgis software 10 1 the inverse distance weighing idw interpolation technique has been applied for estimating the values between the measured data points in this technique the computation of the weighted values for the unsampled point is inversely proportional to the squared distance between the observed point data and point of the unsampled location burrough and mcdonnell 1998 however the accuracy of the generated surface interpolation is based upon the density distribution and precision of the input point dataset lo and yeung 2002 3 5 statistical assessment for assessing the physicochemical datasets descriptive statistics such as range mean and standard deviation were applied all the calculations relative to indices were programmed in microsoft excel 2010 the association analysis was analyzed through spearman s correlational method it provides a monotonic relationship between two continuous or ordinal variables and based upon ranked values for each variable rather than raw data it evaluates the relationship involving ordinal values as in the case of indices where ordinal values were obtained and encounters the interrelationships among the quality parameters potential ions complexes and similarities within the indices for corrosion and scaling abilities of the groundwater the statistical analysis was performed by using spss 19 0 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 qualitative seasonal assessment of groundwater quality 4 1 1 general physico chemical parameters the physicochemical attributes of the groundwater were seasonally assayed and quality was checked in compliance with indian drinking water standards bis 2012 as given in table 2 the slight variation in temperature was observed with a mean value of 26 87 c in prm and 26 58 c in pom season ph values ranged from 7 2 to 7 9 prm and 6 9 8 3 pom showed a shift to slightly basic nature of the groundwater in pom which might be due to the addition of dissolved constituents into the groundwater ec average values were 1044 μs cm prm and 964 85 μs cm pom however in both the seasons 15 1 3 25 26 of the total groundwater samples were exceeding the specified limit of 1500 μs cm who 2011 for drinking purposes higher influence in ec suggests that higher enrichment of the dissolved salts is being discharged into the groundwater and allied to the proximity of these locations to densely populated residential and industrial areas tds varied with values of 105 2675 mg l in prm and 205 2420 mg l in pom about 53 1 5 7 12 15 18 19 22 23 25 26 in prm and 34 1 3 7 10 15 18 25 26 of the total samples in pom season were exceeding limit of 500 mg l one of the samples 25 shares its vicinity to major sahibabad industrial unit in ghaziabad district where tds value was found maximum in range in both the seasons table 2 moreover larger mean values of ec and tds were observed in prm when compared to pom season this trend is subjected to higher evaporative processes in drier months that concentrate the salt deposition and eventually increases the presence of dissolved constituents in the groundwater rina et al 2013 along with the dilution effects might be the reason behind the lesser values of ec and tds in pom season hardness is the sum of all the dissolved constituent ions present in the water it is generally occurs in two forms carbonated or temporary hardness caco3 mgco3 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 and non carbonated or permanent hardness cacl2 mgcl2 caso4 mgso4 the rate of scaling formation is an indication of using hard water scaling formation often clogs the hot water heaters in low pressure boilers sprinklers used in drip irrigation and its excessive range in drinking water also promotes kidney ailments vasanthavigar et al 2010 th average values were 309 23 mg l as caco3 in prm when compared to 316 31 mg l as caco3 during pom due to the higher dissolving rates of recharged water in the study area singh et al 2014 according to the classification of hardness soft water has 75 mg l as caco3 slightly hard ranges from 75 to 150 mg as caco3 moderately hard has 150 300 mg l as caco3 and very hard water has values 300 mg l as caco3 sawyer and mccarty 1967 during prm and pom season about 53 and 46 of the samples falls under moderately hard and 42 and 46 of the total samples respectively falls under very hard water category however found in compliance with the permissible limits except for sample 25 where higher range of th is due to the inconsiderate disposal of effluents from nearby industrial site 4 1 2 cation chemistry the existence of divalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 promotes hardness to the groundwater majorly as hco3 forms or present as a cl and so4 2 complexes in lesser quantities krishna kumar et al 2015 the mean concentrations of ca2 were recorded as 68 25 mg l in prm and 52 35 mg l in pom the higher concentration of ca2 induces various health impacts such as abdominal effects and aggravates encrustation of the pipelines and appliances mg2 mean concentrations varied from 33 97 mg l and 45 31 mg l in prm and pom respectively table 2 all the samples were well within the maximum prescribed limits corresponding to ca2 and mg2 bis 2012 the occurrence of na ion corresponds to 53 69 of the total cations as found in the majority of the natural waters silicate weathering salts dissolution major ion exchange processes and domestic agricultural releases majorly regulate higher amounts of na singh et al 2014 krishna kumar et al 2015 the average values were 160 4 mg l in prm and 134 8 mg l in pom season about 23 of the samples 1 3 21 22 25 26 in prm and 15 of the samples 1 3 25 26 in pom were crossing the limit of 200 mg l who 2011 na ion in the studied region accounted for approximately 55 of the total cations in both the seasons and found dominant among the cationic species k naturally occurs as the mineralogical origin and exists in lesser amounts when compared with ca mg and na the mean concentration ranged from 17 91 mg l and 14 96 mg l in prm and pom respectively nearly all samples from both the seasons showed that the presence of k above the permissible limits of 12 mg l who 2011 na k were contributing 63 57 prm and 60 54 pom to the total cations concentrations relative seasonal variations in both the seasons of the major cations were encountered in the order of their dominance as na ca2 mg2 k fig 3 4 1 3 anion chemistry the acid neutralizing capacity due to the presence of bicarbonates hco3 carbonates co3 2 and hydroxide oh ions governs the alkalinity of the water and found in excess amounts in the groundwater aquifer systems the proportion of bicarbonates carbonates in freshwaters is controlled predominantly by the following factors such as ph temperature dissolved co2 cations and other dissolved solids whereas the presence of hco3 in natural waters is characterized by the effects of co3 2 equilibrium krishna kumar et al 2015 the mean value of hco3 during prm and pom were 363 08 and 401 15 mg l as caco3 respectively all the samples were recorded within the permissible range from both the seasons except sample 3 found to exceed the limit in pom bis 2012 indicative of massive discharges from nearby densely populated colonies cl sources include natural weathering and leaching from sedimentary rocks and soils discharges from municipal domestic sewage and industrial percolates in the groundwater sarath et al 2012 cl during prm and pom seasons average value varied from 123 76 mg l to 106 61 mg l respectively table 2 also in both the season std dev was greater than the mean value of cl as only one sample 25 from both the seasons has crossed the maximum permissible limit of 1000 mg l bis 2012 again marking the significant outlier and influences from a nearby industrial location involved in releasing cl based effluents so4 2 in the groundwater generally present as soluble complexes of ca mg and na in the present study so4 2 mean concentration varied from 52 99 mg l and 46 69 mg l during prm and pom season respectively so4 2 in exceeding amounts with a maximum allowable limit 400 mg l can cause a laxative effect in humans kumari et al 2013 although all the samples were recorded within the prescribed limits bis 2012 among the anions hco3 was contributing 67 25 and 72 35 to the total anions in prm and pom respectively in order of their abundance the occurrence of the anion during both the seasons was recorded as hco3 cl so4 2 fig 3 4 2 geochemical characterization governing groundwater chemistry 4 2 1 gibbs diagram it is a graphical illustration that identifies the region where groundwater chemistry primarily takes place gibbs 1970 it constitutes three dominance regions corresponding to atmospheric precipitation rock water interaction and evaporation processes which can be determined based on the ratios of cations and anions concentrations plotted against tds mg l it elucidates a relationship between water characteristics and aquifer lithological settings the equations plotted as gibbs i anionic and gibbs ii cationic where all the concentrations were expressed in meq l as given below g i b b s i c l c l h c o 3 g i b b s i i n a k n a k c a 2 in prm season gibbs plot i ii revealed that 88 of the total samples were falling in the rock water interaction zone and rest of the samples 3 25 26 were in the evaporative dominance fig 4 similarly in pom about 80 of the total samples occurring in the rock water interface wherein 19 of the samples 1 3 18 25 26 pom manifested the evaporative region fig 4 the above plots demonstrate that majority of the samples corresponds to rock water interaction zone and is a major controlling factor that principally attains the geochemistry from the underlying aquifer systems the seasonal effects also contribute to shift of the samples in pom to the evaporative zone which mainly corresponds to samples from industrial and residential land use types 4 2 2 hydrochemical based water type facies tri linear piper plot piper 1994 discovers the genesis of water facies by categorization of major ions complexes that regulate the geochemistry of the groundwater mondal et al 2010 gw chart winston 2000 was used to draw the piper diagram where units of cations and anions concentrations were in meq l as shown in fig 5 the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater constitutes the dominance of ca hco3 type and na k type of water facies further in both the seasons the diamond plot confirmed that alkaline earth ca mg dominates over alkalis na k and weak acids co3 hco3 exceeds over strong acids so4 cl in the groundwater such water corresponds to temporary hardness which can be reduced by boiling the water thakur et al 2016 specifically the dissolution of major ions in groundwater exhibited three major types of water facies in both the seasons as ca mg hco3 na k hco3 na k cl so4 the predominant water facies in both the season was ca mg hco3 having 46 of samples in prm and 65 in pom following na k hco3 were having 38 prm and 19 pom and rest of the na k cl so4 with 15 of the total samples in both the seasons as per the cation plot a majority of the samples were showing mixed type and na k type of dominance found in both the seasons however in pom few samples were having mg type of facies which explains ca mg hco3 based cation anion exchange process evolved from the subsequent dissolution by the effect of recharged water in the anion plot a bulk of the samples from both the seasons clustered into hco3 type of groundwater and prevalence of hco3 in the study area classifies the area as a recharge zone ophori and toth 1989 subba rao 2007 few samples falling within the cl type indicative of the potential anthropogenic pollution particularly from industrial units sample 25 4 2 3 categorization of groundwater chemistry according to the classification given by soltan 1998 the groundwater samples based on the concentrations of cl so4 2 and hco3 expressed as normal chloride 15 meq l normal sulfate 6 meq l and normal bicarbonate 2 7 meq l respectively based on the above classification all the respective groundwater samples in both the season obtained from the studied region constituted normal sulfate type followed by normal chloride type and normal bicarbonate type a base exchange index r 1 is computed by the following expression that further classifies the samples indicating two types of groundwater chemistry soltan 1998 1999 r 1 n a c l s o 4 2 where na cl and so4 2 are expressed in meq l the value of r1 1 depicts that groundwater is of na so4 2 type whereas r1 1classify in na hco3 type the studied region in prm season was comprised of about 77 of the total samples as na hco3 type r 1 and rest of the samples as na so4 2 type r 1 fig 6 a however in pom season almost all the samples 96 were designated as na hco3 type the results confirmed the dominance of bicarbonate ions which promotes temporary hardness within the region meteoric genesis indices r 2 classifies the source of the groundwater as deep meteoric water percolation type r2 1 and shallow meteoric water type r2 1 and numerically calculated by the following equation soltan 1998 1999 r 2 k n a c l s o 4 2 in both the seasons about 85 of the total samples were shallow meteoric water type and rest 15 constituted deep meteoric water percolation types fig 6b confirming the chemistry of the groundwater samples obtained are confined to shallow aquifers settings 4 2 4 index to base exchange schoeller index the major influence in the geochemical composition of the groundwater and within its natural environment is better understood by the ion exchange processes that take place within the flow path of groundwater being circulated schoeller 1977 introduced chloro alkaline indices cai as expressed by the following equations all the ions expressed in meq l c a i i c l n a k c l c a i i i c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 n o 3 based on the above two indices the ion exchange phenomenon is categorized into chloro alkaline equilibrium and disequilibrium condition the positive value of the indices indicates direct base exchange reaction with equilibrium condition where na and k from the groundwater is exchanged with ca2 and mg2 in the rocks similarly the negative value of ion exchange is called cation anion exchange reaction with a chloro alkaline disequilibrium condition the results obtained for cai i and cai ii showed that in prm about 92 3 of the total samples and in pom all the samples showed negative index value suggesting indirect base exchange with exchange of ca2 and mg2 in the water bodies with the na and k of the rocks inferring chloro alkaline imbalance fig 7 a and b in aquifers when alkaline rock minerals are replaced with na ions hco3 ca mg denotes base exchange softened water however when na is exchanged with alkaline rocks ca mg hco3 denotes base exchange hardened water which is prominent in the studied region with the negative ionic ratio of the indices and cation anion exchange process control the chemistry of the area schoeller 1977 thakur et al 2016 4 3 estimation of corrosion and scaling potential based on water stability indices the identification of chemical stability is imperative for assessing groundwater quality in order to predict aggressive stable or incrusting water properties the application of water stability indices in numerous studies from all over the world table 3 has ensured its preference that effortlessly recognizes water s corrosive or scaling potentials as per the applicability of the groundwater usage in the present study water stability indices were calculated during both the seasons table 4 4 3 1 lsi the values of lsi inferred that bulk of the samples during prm and pom seasons showed that lsi 0 however in pom season sample no 9 0 08 11 0 41 and 18 0 12 showed lsi 0 rendering a slight corrosive nature of the groundwater fig 8 a the mean lsi was 0 33 and 0 24 in prm and pom respectively predicting that overall groundwater was partially supersaturated with caco3 and slightly alkaline ph of groundwater confirmed the affinity to form scale table 4 the maximum value of lsi was recorded for sample 25 0 64 in prm and for sample 21 0 77 and 25 0 92 in pom which can be attributed to higher values of ph temperature ca hardness hco3 and tds concentrations found in the vicinity of the respective industrial sites also std dev 0 28 mean 0 24 in pom was observed which explained the maximum value of lsi reported at two sites in pom season as compared to one site in prm season all the samples in prm and 80 of the total samples in the pom seasons was exhibiting scaling tendencies table 5 the spatial distribution of lsi was undulating from light scaling to scaling effects in prm however during pom season few regions had corrosive tendencies particularly in north and southeast regions of the district indicating monsoonal discharges in the direction of the groundwater flow in nw se also availability of shallow depth of water level recorded at 0 5 mbgl which could be a probable reason for stimulating slight corrosion of the groundwater within the region fig 9 a 4 3 2 rsi it is an empirical method as compared to lsi which acts as an indicator to interpret the extent of scaling or corrosion kalyani et al 2017 rsi mean value of 6 83 inferred equilibrium towards scaling and corrosiveness in prm season however as per the mean value of 7 05 showed a tendency close to slight corrosion in pom table 4 interestingly the majority of the samples in prm was observed to have an equilibrium towards scaling and corrosive condition and about 30 7 of the total samples 4 5 6 12 18 19 22 have rsi 7 showing corrosion tendency but latter percentage got increased in pom to 61 5 of the total samples 4 6 8 14 16 19 22 23 showing moderate corrosive tendency with rsi 7 table 5 the intensification in corrosion was attributed to seasonal flow that altered the composition and showing contrasting results when accorded with other indices although chemical variants were not rigorous to cause corrosion except sample 11 having rsi maximum value of 8 31 in pom season due to nearby large scale irrigational practice which is impounding additional discharges leading to corrosive behaviors also comparable with lsi result fig 8b spatially the water conditions found to be stable in prm particularly in the western part of the district and thereby in pom season stable conditions also swing towards eastern sides the corrosiveness was found to be also surging from light to significant corrosion observed in the district in contrary to lsi fig 9b 4 3 3 psi it is dependent upon ph and alkalinity of the water in the present study psi mean values were 6 07 and 6 25 in prm and pom respectively showing a balanced nature 6 7 of the groundwater in the region table 4 in prm 57 7 of the total samples 1 3 7 13 15 16 20 23 24 26 recorded psi value 6 i e tends to supersaturate whereas in pom only 26 9 of the samples 1 3 7 15 16 20 24 showed scaling trend table 5 however in pom 15 4 of the samples 8 10 11 12 exhibited significant corrosion potential with psi value 7 compared to sample 8 in prm season which was attributed to decrease in alkalinity of the samples due to dilution effects in pom season fig 8c psi covered a larger area which was balanced with chemical composition and few in corrosive ranges in both the seasons as in concordance with rsi and deviating from lsi interpretations fig 9c the western part of the district however showed the scaling tendency due to maximum depth of water level at 6 20 mbgl and drainage of yamuna river towards nw direction could be the main reason for such an indication also groundwater abstraction by the numerous marginalized industrial sectors of loni block in western side of ghaziabad district might cause scaling phenomenon more prominently 4 3 4 ls the ls index is characterized by chlorides sulfates carbonates and bicarbonate alkalinity higher chlorides or ions containing chlorine values in neutral to acid solution tend to promote pitting corrosion of stainless alloys fong yuan 2012 the ls mean values in prm and pom were observed as 0 55 and 0 38 respectively indicating that groundwater likely to form a scale ls 0 8 as in table 4 majority of the samples as 84 6 prm and 88 5 pom contribute to scaling tendency table 5 samples 1 25 26 in prm and pom 3 25 26 seasons were showing a pitting corrosion ls 1 2 contrastingly the maximum values of ls were 5 87 prm and 2 88 pom computed for the sample site 25 which concords to the maximum levels of cl for the same site it is a discernible factor as effluents discharged from nearby industrial units within the region increase corrosion rates fig 8d the spatial distribution of ls index also showed that the sites which were having an aggressive tendency towards pitting corrosion were located in the western parts of the district fig 9d where exceeding values of cl have also been observed during both the seasons 4 3 5 ai ai is used to assess the aggressiveness of water based on ph alkalinity and calcium hardness the mean values of ai observed during prm and pom were 12 26 and 12 17 respectively and supports the results of lsi and ls table 4 all the samples within the studied region were having ai 12 during prm subjected to non aggressive and scaling potential however in pom season majority of the samples were recording scaling behavior while few sampling sites 9 11 85 11 11 52 18 11 52 were inferring slight corrosive but very close to scaling tendency table 5 and fig 8e the seasonal water level fluctuations and nearby discharges from residential 9 18 agricultural 11 sites might be the reason but still the values are in stable conditions the spatial results of indices lsi ls and ai were found to be in concordance with the scaling potential fig 9e moreover the seasonal effects were evident as a prime factor in augmentation of scaling and corrosive action due to neighboring land use activities such as loni block s small industrial units in north western parts and major sahibabad industrial area located in south western parts some of the densely populated residential colonies and agricultural practices also contribute to significant discharges altering the chemical composition of the recharged groundwater and thereby encouraging the discrepancies in the chemical stability the exceeding limits of quality parameters like ec tds th cl na and k clearly support the combining effects and potential of scaling development of the groundwater within the region as predicted from the corresponding indices majority of the samples revealed high amounts of hardness and alkalinity which intensifies the scaling conditions whereas the levels of chloride and sulfates at the sampling sites 3 25 particularly promote corrosiveness who 2011 these findings were well supported by the geochemical investigations and negative ionic ratios of the region that signify the hardened nature of the groundwater however scaling and corrosive effects were not severe and can be eluded by the application of cation exchange water softeners or simple boiling methods and stabilization or remineralization respectively who 2011 4 4 statistical relation of quality parameters and indices the results of the physicochemical groundwater quality and indices were put together and analyzed for both the seasons in order to study the relationships among multiple variables through spearman s rank correlation matrix table 6 the strength of the association between two or more variables is explained with weak r 0 500 and strong r 0 500 correlations ec was strong and positively correlated with cl r 0 855 tds r 0 706 na r 0 632 so4 2 r 0 641 and ca2 r 0 570 found to be significant at p 0 01 and weakly related with th hco3 k confirming the presence of dissolved ionic species that drives specific conductivity of the groundwater similarly tds showed a significant strong positive correlation with cl na so4 2 and weakly correlated with th ca2 mg2 and k indicating the contribution of individual variable is existing in the dissolved forms meaningfully the strong positive relationship of th was noticed with ca2 r 0 701 and mg2 r 0 799 significant at p 0 01 and weakly correlated with hco3 cl and so4 2 which supports the occurrence of temporary hardness of the groundwater as bicarbonates forms of ca2 and mg2 as compared to cl and so4 2 which otherwise impart permanent hardness to the groundwater also groundwater confined within the rocks makes various minerals and soluble salts readily available such as caco3 or so4 2 forms that intensify the growth of inorganic scaling antony et al 2011 a strong relationship among cations and anions with correlation coefficient r were as follows so4 2 cl r 0 609 na cl r 0 602 na k r 0 588 na ca r 0 570 indicating the presence of these soluble salts in the groundwater as a dominant complexes forms that initiate scaling and were positive with weak correlation of ca cl r 0 489 ca k r 0 458 and k cl r 0 465 significant at p 0 01 table 6 the water stability indices were correlated with the parameters and among themselves to encounter their applicability for corrosion and scaling potential lsi showed positive correlation with ph r 0 414 p 0 01 due to its reliance on ph and establish a significant association also lsi was strongly related to ai 0 985 p 0 01 which validates the results obtained from the other two indices suggesting a scaling potential ai generally at times used as an alternative to lsi for corrosive signs of waters kalyani et al 2017 contrastingly lsi showed a negative correlation with rsi r 0 784 and psi r 0 366 significant at p 0 01 which proved their contradictory results whereas rsi showed a strong positive relation with psi r 0 781 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with ai r 0 792 p 0 01 and ls r 0 367 p 0 01 psi encountered a strong positive correlation with ph r 0 620 p 0 01 rsi and psi found significantly negatively correlated to ec due to the fact that both the indices are inconstant to ec as both concentrates on ph and alkalinity of the water ls index commences the aggressiveness potential of the groundwater it was found to have a strong positive correlation with ec r 0 779 tds r 0 768 cl r 0 889 so4 2 r 0 772 and na r 0 604 at p 0 01 the strong association of ls with above dissolved constituents clearly showed that cl and so4 2 is the main constituent that are promoting scaling behavior evident from this index also ec is a function of salinity which is accountable by the effect of salts of chloride present in soils underground or as a intruding discharged effluent ls have a weak positive correlation r 0 050 with ai and however a weak negative correlation with rsi and psi was obtained ai was weakly correlated and statistically significant with the majority of the parameters such as ph ec tds th cl so4 2 ca2 and na table 6 5 conclusions and recommendation 1 groundwater seasonal quality assessment showed that majority of the samples found to have parameters in noncompliance with the standards like ec tds th cl na and k both processes natural and anthropogenic practices within some of the identified sites have greatly influenced the constituents seasonal levels the cations and anions followed the abundance in the following order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 respectively in both the seasons 2 categorization of geochemical composition based on gibbs diagram revealed the origin of the groundwater chemistry directed from the rock water interface and evaporative processes however tri linear piper plot revealed the dominance of ca mg hco3 na k hco3 na k cl so4 type of water facies discernible in both the seasons the dissolution from natural rock bearing conditions and flow from the anthropogenic effluents were the main reasons behind the composition base exchange r1 and meteoric genesis indices r2 showed that groundwater principally constituted from na hco3 and shallow meteoric type of groundwater respectively schoeller based indices of base exchange also showed the negative ratio of chloro alkaline cai i cai ii disequilibrium with indirect base exchange hardened water prevalent in both the season 3 the groundwater tendencies were classified for corrosion and scaling formation by incorporating the qualitative parameters in the water stability indices the indices lsi ls and ai confirmed that bulk of the samples exhibited scaling properties as groundwater chemistry upholds hco3 type of processes and constitute very hard water within the region however on the contrary rsi and psi were reasonably comparable that predicted slight corrosiveness in the groundwater and most of the samples were balanced with saturation only a few samples showed excessive corrosion rates due to the exceeding limits of the chloride and sulphates parameters and the heavy influence of pollution from the specific sites 4 spatial temporal variations through interpolation highlighted scaling or equilibrium state for the majority of the region as per lsi ls and ai and corrosion rates in the western part of the district as per rsi and ls indices hence the groundwater can be consumed sustainably after employing proper treatment methods such as water softeners and boiling techniques 5 statistical findings suggested that there is a significant relationship among various parameters that administered the governing phenomenon in groundwater chemistry due to their base exchange processes as well as discharges from specific land use based point non point sources similarity among the indices such as lsi ls and ai was evident with their outcomes based on scaling estimations and rsi psi indicating slight corrosion and subsequently it provides a substitute for other indices 6 regular monitoring and remedial measures are imperative to safeguard the groundwater quality for sustainable management

12176,the sustainable usage of groundwater is facing a rapid decline in quantity and quality due to demographic and industrial expansion in india among several residential industrial hubs ghaziabad is one of the suburban districts and industrial town of uttar pradesh largely dependent upon groundwater for its water needs the present study was carried out to assess the groundwater in terms of qualitative geochemical and to identify corrosion scaling potential during the pre and post monsoon seasons of 2017 majority of the samples showed the exceeding levels of ec tds th cl na and k inferring the seasonal variability geochemical characterization indicated the origin of the groundwater from the rock water interface of the underlying aquifers and hydrochemical types of water facies ca mg hco3 na k hco3 na k cl so4 were found predominant based on the classification of groundwater most of the samples indicated na hco3 and shallow meteoric type of nature schoeller s index of base exchange also showed the chloro alkaline disequilibrium with indirect base exchange hardened water subsequently to predict the corrosive scaling behaviors of the groundwater five water stability indices were applied namely langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi puckorius scaling index psi larson skold index ls and aggressive index ai the results illustrated that the bulk of the samples exhibited scaling trend as per lsi ls and ai alike rsi and psi that registered slight corrosive properties of the groundwater spatial temporal mapping of the indices also reflected the temporary scaling potential statistically the interrelationships among the parameters and indices were evaluated using spearman s correlation which confirmed the scaling effects through strong significant associations among cation anion complexes that promote temporary scaling therefore estimation of quality levels and influences in the chemical integrity helps to underline the causative effects and ensure the sustainable consumption of the groundwater in various purposes through prior quality monitoring and applied preventive measures graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater geochemistry corrosion scaling water stability indices ghaziabad district 1 introduction one of the potential forms of freshwater predominantly accessed in a wide range of purposes in a developing country like india where groundwater caters about 50 of urban and 85 of rural domestic water requirements the annual extraction rate of groundwater in the irrigation practices is recorded 89 and rest by domestic and industrial sectors suhag 2016 demographic growth and rapid expansion of urban industrialization is directly proportional to the increasing water demands in turn leads to over extraction and quality deterioration of groundwater the chemical composition of the groundwater influences periodically by the geo genic processes as well as infiltration of the discharging effluents from numerous overlying point and non point anthropogenic sources also exacerbates the pollution levels vasanthavigar et al 2010 ouyang 2012 therefore once the contaminants infiltrate to the aquifers it becomes difficult to preserve the quality that might create ecological imbalances and many socio economic problems will arise milovanovic 2007 singh et al 2014 one such causative effect that has been mainly noticed in domestic and industrial domains is corrosion or scaling effects generally produced in the water appliances and distribution networks the consumption of poor quality of groundwater with inadequate treatment methods augments the corrosion or scaling effects and poses threats to a safe drinking water supply corrosion is an electrochemical interacting mechanism between aggressive water and walls of the pipelines that slowly disintegrates the interior surfaces of metallic pipes it eventually leads to the dissolution of minerals and metals from the corroding pipes khorsandi et al 2015 these corrosion based physicochemical reactions imparts organoleptic effects to the groundwater such as the rusting of the corroding plumbing systems that releases iron in the transporting water utilities rendering its unfit supply for various purposes sarin et al 2004 hu et al 2018 on the contrary to the corrosion process scaling is a gradual deposition of the minerals producing a layer of white crust within the pipes boilers and other water appliances also groundwater supply acquires higher consumption of energy and the efficiencies of various electrical equipment minimizes due to excessive scaling reducing flow within the pipelines clogging and ultimately bearing costly maintenance so prior treatment of the groundwater is a time consuming effort alsaqqar et al 2014 remarkably corrosion and scaling processes counterbalance each other s effects as scaling neutralizes corrosion and vice versa sarin et al 2004 therefore it seems foremost to get an understanding behind the chemical aspects that drive the potential towards corrosion or scaling behaviors of the groundwater the mathematical expressions have been used widely to predict the corrosive and incrustation abilities of the water through water stability indices namely langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi puckorius scaling index psi larson skold index ls and aggressive index ai these indices predict the chemical integrity of the water and incorporate the physicochemical quality indicators such as temperature ph total dissolved solids tds bicarbonate alkalinity hco3 calcium hardness ca2 chloride cl and sulfate so4 2 davil et al 2009 numerous literature have been reported the application of stability indices particularly corrosion and scaling potential of the drinking water in the water distribution system taghipour et al 2012 kalantary et al 2013 alsaqqar et al 2014 alipour et al 2015 khorsandi et al 2015 some of the studies have checked the corrosiveness of drinking water supplies shams et al 2012 yousefi et al 2016 similarly these indices have also analyzed groundwater quality and measured corrosion or scaling rates shankar 2014 biglari et al 2016 bounab et al 2017 abbasnia et al 2018 zazouli et al 2018 kalyani et al 2017 correlated the corrosion rates of different metallic pipes and corrosiveness of the groundwater based on the above indices therefore the crucial aspect is to analyze the precipitation or aggressive conditions relative to the water chemistry antony et al 2011 and these indices would prior substantiate the levels of the chemical instability for the consumed groundwater ghaziabad one of the suburban districts of western uttar pradesh is engaged in different land use practices whose water demands mostly rely on the groundwater supply several past studies have shown that ghaziabad has been facing high rates of contamination of groundwater by the heavy influence of industrial sectors singh et al 2014 2012 kumari et al 2013 chabukdhara et al 2017 tyagi and sarma 2018 moreover the corrosion and scaling abilities of groundwater within the region is still not investigated with the prevailing geochemical conditions that govern chemical stabilities the rationale of this study would not only aid in prior quality check but also ensure safe domestic and industrial groundwater supply that should be monitored certainly for corrosive and scaling integrities specifically the current study aims i qualitative assessment of the groundwater in accordance with physico chemical parameters seasonally ii geochemical characterization to interpret the origin hydrochemical composition classification of the groundwater and ion exchange processes iii estimating corrosion scaling properties of the groundwater through water stability indices with its spatial temporal mapping and iv correlation analysis to evaluate similarities among quality parameters and strong association within the indices 2

2017 2 3 physiography geology and aquifer settings physiographically the district consists of the older alluvial plain older floodplain and active floodplain the older alluvium occupies an entire upland and interfluve area between the drainage of yamuna hindon and hindon ganga in the middle of the ganga yamuna doab the district is confined with rivers like the ganga upper canal on the east and yamuna on its west and with small tributaries like hindon and kali nadi all flowing in general slope of the area in northwest to southeast direction the irrigation and drinking water load of the district is also fulfilled with the upper ganga canal groundwater flow direction is from nw se which follows major drainage lines with a gentle groundwater gradient in southern part of the district cgwb 2009 the geological settings exhibits lower proterozoic age which comprises of quartzite and phyllite hard and compact quartzites are huge thickly bedded and highly jointed in nature intercalated with thin beds of phyllite and slates the above rock settings are covered with quartneary sediments found exposed in isolated residual and structural hills and pediments the region is a part of indo gangetic alluvium plains that carries beds of sand clay reh and kanker sandy soil is predominant and fertile loamy soil is also found in this region singh et al 2014 the depth of the water table is generally recorded at 10 15 mbgl with seasonal fluctuation of about 5 m in 2017 the fluctuations in the water level in pre monsoon prm and post monsoon pom season is prominent in northern region

materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling and collection method based on the initial reconnaissance survey and to ensure spatial uniformity of the groundwater quality twenty six 26 sampling locations were identified in different land use types i e residential 3 5 6 8 9 14 16 18 19 22 23 26 industrial 1 12 15 25 agricultural sites 2 4 7 10 11 17 20 21 and rest of the locations from mixed land use type 13 24 groundwater samples were abstracted from india mark ii and local hand pumps extended to the shallow aquifer of depth ranging from 40 to 60 ft during prm may 2017 and pom october 2017 before the collection samples were flushed out for 5 10 min as to fetch water from shallow aquifer settings and then stored in pre cleaned 1 liter polyethylene bottles and preserved the samples in cold storage for further analysis 3 2 analytical techniques adopted the physicochemical testing was performed in the laboratory by following the standard protocol apha 2005 all the readings of the cationic anionic experiments triplicated as to maintain the accuracy within the results physical parameters like temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and tds were measured onsite using a portable instrument eutech pcstestr35 total hardness th calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were analyzed using ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta titrimetric method buffer solution ph 9 10 of nh4cl nh4oh and eriochrome black t ebt indicator was added to the water samples ebt indicator imparts wine red color forming unstable complexes with ca2 and mg2 ions present in water samples thereafter titration of the samples with standard edta titrant 0 01 m complexes with ca2 and mg2 ions in the solution and revert its wine red color to blue color attaining the end point of the titration and forming stable complex sodium na and potassium k were detected in flame mode with atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas agilent technologies 280 fs aa bicarbonate alkalinity hco3 indicates the acid neutralizing capacity due to the presence of the titratable bases such as bicarbonates hco3 carbonates co3 2 and hydroxide oh ions in the water the samples were titrated against standard acid hcl 0 1n solution using phenolphthalein and methyl orange as the indicators addition of the phenolphthalein indicator neutralized oh ions and co3 2 to hco3 ions and which were further neutralized to water and carbon dioxide co2 using methyl red indicator chloride cl was measured by the argentometric titration using silver nitrate agno3 as the titrant and potassium chromate k2cro4 as an end point indicator the titration from agno3 0 02n precipitates silver chloride as white colored end point of the reaction is attained when all the cl ions precipitated and excess chromate ions cro4 2 of the indicator formed red brown precipitate of silver chromate agcro4 sulfate so4 2 were estimated using turbidimetric method barium chloride bacl2 was used to precipitate so4 2 ions when formed as barium sulfate baso4 the determination of so4 2 ions was measured by absorption using spectrophotometer at λ max 420 nm concentration of so4 2 ions were calculated from standard calibration curve from standard sulfate solution 10 40 mg l 3 3 water stability indices for estimating corrosion scaling potentials description of the water stability indices is presented khorsandi et al 2015 in table 1 langelier 1936 gave lsi that measured the difference between the definite ph of the water and saturated ph for caco3 phs it directs either towards precipitation of caco3 lsi 0 or dissolution of caco3 lsi 0 however lsi is incompetent to estimate the extent to initiate crystallization ryznar 1944 modified the lsi as rsi outlines the potential of the water to precipitate caco3 the index of rsi is expressed in positive values for estimating the scaling or corrosive nature kalyani et al 2017 rsi 6 is supersaturated with caco3 and as the rsi value increases the water tends to have corrosive nature in 1980 paul puckorius and maxey brooke estimated corrosion and scaling potential by considering equilibrium ph pheq in the form of psi alike lsi or rsi which takes measured ph psi 6 shows a scaling ability and psi 7 maintains a corrosive nature of the water table 1 ls index was developed by larson skold which measures the aggressiveness of water toward pitting of the pipes ai is a suitable index and used as a sign of water corrosiveness ai does not consider temperature and dissolved solids due to which it is less precise as an analytical index when compared to lsi khorsandi et al 2015 3 4 spatial interpolation mapping in geographic information system gis the spatial distribution of the point data recorded in the environment was interpolated to create thematic maps that present spatiotemporal dynamics of the corrosion scaling potential within the surface boundaries by using spatial analyst module of arcgis software 10 1 the inverse distance weighing idw interpolation technique has been applied for estimating the values between the measured data points in this technique the computation of the weighted values for the unsampled point is inversely proportional to the squared distance between the observed point data and point of the unsampled location burrough and mcdonnell 1998 however the accuracy of the generated surface interpolation is based upon the density distribution and precision of the input point dataset lo and yeung 2002 3 5 statistical assessment for assessing the physicochemical datasets descriptive statistics such as range mean and standard deviation were applied all the calculations relative to indices were programmed in microsoft excel 2010 the association analysis was analyzed through spearman s correlational method it provides a monotonic relationship between two continuous or ordinal variables and based upon ranked values for each variable rather than raw data it evaluates the relationship involving ordinal values as in the case of indices where ordinal values were obtained and encounters the interrelationships among the quality parameters potential ions complexes and similarities within the indices for corrosion and scaling abilities of the groundwater the statistical analysis was performed by using spss 19 0 software 4 results and discussion 4 1 qualitative seasonal assessment of groundwater quality 4 1 1 general physico chemical parameters the physicochemical attributes of the groundwater were seasonally assayed and quality was checked in compliance with indian drinking water standards bis 2012 as given in table 2 the slight variation in temperature was observed with a mean value of 26 87 c in prm and 26 58 c in pom season ph values ranged from 7 2 to 7 9 prm and 6 9 8 3 pom showed a shift to slightly basic nature of the groundwater in pom which might be due to the addition of dissolved constituents into the groundwater ec average values were 1044 μs cm prm and 964 85 μs cm pom however in both the seasons 15 1 3 25 26 of the total groundwater samples were exceeding the specified limit of 1500 μs cm who 2011 for drinking purposes higher influence in ec suggests that higher enrichment of the dissolved salts is being discharged into the groundwater and allied to the proximity of these locations to densely populated residential and industrial areas tds varied with values of 105 2675 mg l in prm and 205 2420 mg l in pom about 53 1 5 7 12 15 18 19 22 23 25 26 in prm and 34 1 3 7 10 15 18 25 26 of the total samples in pom season were exceeding limit of 500 mg l one of the samples 25 shares its vicinity to major sahibabad industrial unit in ghaziabad district where tds value was found maximum in range in both the seasons table 2 moreover larger mean values of ec and tds were observed in prm when compared to pom season this trend is subjected to higher evaporative processes in drier months that concentrate the salt deposition and eventually increases the presence of dissolved constituents in the groundwater rina et al 2013 along with the dilution effects might be the reason behind the lesser values of ec and tds in pom season hardness is the sum of all the dissolved constituent ions present in the water it is generally occurs in two forms carbonated or temporary hardness caco3 mgco3 ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 and non carbonated or permanent hardness cacl2 mgcl2 caso4 mgso4 the rate of scaling formation is an indication of using hard water scaling formation often clogs the hot water heaters in low pressure boilers sprinklers used in drip irrigation and its excessive range in drinking water also promotes kidney ailments vasanthavigar et al 2010 th average values were 309 23 mg l as caco3 in prm when compared to 316 31 mg l as caco3 during pom due to the higher dissolving rates of recharged water in the study area singh et al 2014 according to the classification of hardness soft water has 75 mg l as caco3 slightly hard ranges from 75 to 150 mg as caco3 moderately hard has 150 300 mg l as caco3 and very hard water has values 300 mg l as caco3 sawyer and mccarty 1967 during prm and pom season about 53 and 46 of the samples falls under moderately hard and 42 and 46 of the total samples respectively falls under very hard water category however found in compliance with the permissible limits except for sample 25 where higher range of th is due to the inconsiderate disposal of effluents from nearby industrial site 4 1 2 cation chemistry the existence of divalent cations i e ca2 and mg2 promotes hardness to the groundwater majorly as hco3 forms or present as a cl and so4 2 complexes in lesser quantities krishna kumar et al 2015 the mean concentrations of ca2 were recorded as 68 25 mg l in prm and 52 35 mg l in pom the higher concentration of ca2 induces various health impacts such as abdominal effects and aggravates encrustation of the pipelines and appliances mg2 mean concentrations varied from 33 97 mg l and 45 31 mg l in prm and pom respectively table 2 all the samples were well within the maximum prescribed limits corresponding to ca2 and mg2 bis 2012 the occurrence of na ion corresponds to 53 69 of the total cations as found in the majority of the natural waters silicate weathering salts dissolution major ion exchange processes and domestic agricultural releases majorly regulate higher amounts of na singh et al 2014 krishna kumar et al 2015 the average values were 160 4 mg l in prm and 134 8 mg l in pom season about 23 of the samples 1 3 21 22 25 26 in prm and 15 of the samples 1 3 25 26 in pom were crossing the limit of 200 mg l who 2011 na ion in the studied region accounted for approximately 55 of the total cations in both the seasons and found dominant among the cationic species k naturally occurs as the mineralogical origin and exists in lesser amounts when compared with ca mg and na the mean concentration ranged from 17 91 mg l and 14 96 mg l in prm and pom respectively nearly all samples from both the seasons showed that the presence of k above the permissible limits of 12 mg l who 2011 na k were contributing 63 57 prm and 60 54 pom to the total cations concentrations relative seasonal variations in both the seasons of the major cations were encountered in the order of their dominance as na ca2 mg2 k fig 3 4 1 3 anion chemistry the acid neutralizing capacity due to the presence of bicarbonates hco3 carbonates co3 2 and hydroxide oh ions governs the alkalinity of the water and found in excess amounts in the groundwater aquifer systems the proportion of bicarbonates carbonates in freshwaters is controlled predominantly by the following factors such as ph temperature dissolved co2 cations and other dissolved solids whereas the presence of hco3 in natural waters is characterized by the effects of co3 2 equilibrium krishna kumar et al 2015 the mean value of hco3 during prm and pom were 363 08 and 401 15 mg l as caco3 respectively all the samples were recorded within the permissible range from both the seasons except sample 3 found to exceed the limit in pom bis 2012 indicative of massive discharges from nearby densely populated colonies cl sources include natural weathering and leaching from sedimentary rocks and soils discharges from municipal domestic sewage and industrial percolates in the groundwater sarath et al 2012 cl during prm and pom seasons average value varied from 123 76 mg l to 106 61 mg l respectively table 2 also in both the season std dev was greater than the mean value of cl as only one sample 25 from both the seasons has crossed the maximum permissible limit of 1000 mg l bis 2012 again marking the significant outlier and influences from a nearby industrial location involved in releasing cl based effluents so4 2 in the groundwater generally present as soluble complexes of ca mg and na in the present study so4 2 mean concentration varied from 52 99 mg l and 46 69 mg l during prm and pom season respectively so4 2 in exceeding amounts with a maximum allowable limit 400 mg l can cause a laxative effect in humans kumari et al 2013 although all the samples were recorded within the prescribed limits bis 2012 among the anions hco3 was contributing 67 25 and 72 35 to the total anions in prm and pom respectively in order of their abundance the occurrence of the anion during both the seasons was recorded as hco3 cl so4

gibbs 1970 it constitutes three dominance regions corresponding to atmospheric precipitation rock water interaction and evaporation processes which can be determined based on the ratios of cations and anions concentrations plotted against tds mg l it elucidates a relationship between water characteristics and aquifer lithological settings the equations plotted as gibbs i anionic and gibbs ii cationic where all the concentrations were expressed in meq l as given below g i b b s i c l c l h c o 3 g i b b s i i n a k n a k c a 2 in prm season gibbs plot i ii revealed that 88 of the total samples were falling in the rock water interaction zone and rest of the samples 3 25 26 were in the evaporative dominance fig 4 similarly in pom about 80 of the total samples occurring in the rock water interface wherein 19 of the samples 1 3 18 25 26 pom manifested the evaporative region fig 4 the above plots demonstrate that majority of the samples corresponds to rock water interaction zone and is a major controlling factor that principally attains the geochemistry from the underlying aquifer systems the seasonal effects also contribute to shift of the samples in pom to the evaporative zone which mainly corresponds to samples from industrial and residential land use types 4 2 2 hydrochemical based water type facies tri linear piper plot piper 1994 discovers the genesis of water facies by categorization of major ions complexes that regulate the geochemistry of the groundwater mondal et al 2010 gw chart winston 2000 was used to draw the piper diagram where units of cations and anions concentrations were in meq l as shown in fig 5 the hydrochemical composition of the groundwater constitutes the dominance of ca hco3 type and na k type of water facies further in both the seasons the diamond plot confirmed that alkaline earth ca mg dominates over alkalis na k and weak acids co3 hco3 exceeds over strong acids so4 cl in the groundwater such water corresponds to temporary hardness which can be reduced by boiling the water thakur et al 2016 specifically the dissolution of major ions in groundwater exhibited three major types of water facies in both the seasons as ca mg hco3 na k hco3 na k cl so4 the predominant water facies in both the season was ca mg hco3 having 46 of samples in prm and 65 in pom following na k hco3 were having 38 prm and 19 pom and rest of the na k cl so4 with 15 of the total samples in both the seasons as per the cation plot a majority of the samples were showing mixed type and na k type of dominance found in both the seasons however in pom few samples were having mg type of facies which explains ca mg hco3 based cation anion exchange process evolved from the subsequent dissolution by the effect of recharged water in the anion plot a bulk of the samples from both the seasons clustered into hco3 type of groundwater and prevalence of hco3 in the study area classifies the area as a recharge zone ophori and toth 1989 subba rao 2007 few samples falling within the cl type indicative of the potential anthropogenic pollution particularly from industrial units sample 25 4 2 3 categorization of groundwater chemistry according to the classification given by soltan 1998 the groundwater samples based on the concentrations of cl so4 2 and hco3 expressed as normal chloride 15 meq l normal sulfate 6 meq l and normal bicarbonate 2 7 meq l respectively based on the above classification all the respective groundwater samples in both the season obtained from the studied region constituted normal sulfate type followed by normal chloride type and normal bicarbonate type a base exchange index r 1 is computed by the following expression that further classifies the samples indicating two types of groundwater chemistry soltan 1998 1999 r 1 n a c l s o 4 2 where na cl and so4 2 are expressed in meq l the value of r1 1 depicts that groundwater is of na so4 2 type whereas r1 1classify in na hco3 type the studied region in prm season was comprised of about 77 of the total samples as na hco3 type r 1 and rest of the samples as na so4 2 type r 1 fig 6 a however in pom season almost all the samples 96 were designated as na hco3 type the results confirmed the dominance of bicarbonate ions which promotes temporary hardness within the region meteoric genesis indices r 2 classifies the source of the groundwater as deep meteoric water percolation type r2 1 and shallow meteoric water type r2 1 and numerically calculated by the following equation soltan 1998 1999 r 2 k n a c l s o 4 2 in both the seasons about 85 of the total samples were shallow meteoric water type and rest 15 constituted deep meteoric water percolation types fig 6b confirming the chemistry of the groundwater samples obtained are confined to shallow aquifers settings 4 2 4 index to base exchange schoeller index the major influence in the geochemical composition of the groundwater and within its natural environment is better understood by the ion exchange processes that take place within the flow path of groundwater being circulated schoeller 1977 introduced chloro alkaline indices cai as expressed by the following equations all the ions expressed in meq l c a i i c l n a k c l c a i i i c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 n o 3 based on the above two indices the ion exchange phenomenon is categorized into chloro alkaline equilibrium and disequilibrium condition the positive value of the indices indicates direct base exchange reaction with equilibrium condition where na and k from the groundwater is exchanged with ca2 and mg2 in the rocks similarly the negative value of ion exchange is called cation anion exchange reaction with a chloro alkaline disequilibrium condition the results obtained for cai i and cai ii showed that in prm about 92 3 of the total samples and in pom all the samples showed negative index value suggesting indirect base exchange with exchange of ca2 and mg2 in the water bodies with the na and k of the rocks inferring chloro alkaline imbalance fig 7 a and b in aquifers when alkaline rock minerals are replaced with na ions hco3 ca mg denotes base exchange softened water however when na is exchanged with alkaline rocks ca mg hco3 denotes base exchange hardened water which is prominent in the studied region with the negative ionic ratio of the indices and cation anion exchange process control the chemistry of the area schoeller 1977 thakur et al 2016 4 3 estimation of corrosion and scaling potential based on water stability indices the identification of chemical stability is imperative for assessing groundwater quality in order to predict aggressive stable or incrusting water properties the application of water stability indices in numerous studies from all over the world table 3 has ensured its preference that effortlessly recognizes water s corrosive or scaling potentials as per the applicability of the groundwater usage in the present study water stability indices were calculated during both the seasons table 4 4 3 1 lsi the values of lsi inferred that bulk of the samples during prm and pom seasons showed that lsi 0 however in pom season sample no 9 0 08 11 0 41 and 18 0 12 showed lsi 0 rendering a slight corrosive nature of the groundwater fig 8 a the mean lsi was 0 33 and 0 24 in prm and pom respectively predicting that overall groundwater was partially supersaturated with caco3 and slightly alkaline ph of groundwater confirmed the affinity to form scale table 4 the maximum value of lsi was recorded for sample 25 0 64 in prm and for sample 21 0 77 and 25 0 92 in pom which can be attributed to higher values of ph temperature ca hardness hco3 and tds concentrations found in the vicinity of the respective industrial sites also std dev 0 28 mean 0 24 in pom was observed which explained the maximum value of lsi reported at two sites in pom season as compared to one site in prm season all the samples in prm and 80 of the total samples in the pom seasons was exhibiting scaling tendencies table 5 the spatial distribution of lsi was undulating from light scaling to scaling effects in prm however during pom season few regions had corrosive tendencies particularly in north and southeast regions of the district indicating monsoonal discharges in the direction of the groundwater flow in nw se also availability of shallow depth of water level recorded at 0 5 mbgl which could be a probable reason for stimulating slight corrosion of the groundwater within the region fig 9 a 4 3 2 rsi it is an empirical method as compared to lsi which acts as an indicator to interpret the extent of scaling or corrosion kalyani et al 2017 rsi mean value of 6 83 inferred equilibrium towards scaling and corrosiveness in prm season however as per the mean value of 7 05 showed a tendency close to slight corrosion in pom table 4 interestingly the majority of the samples in prm was observed to have an equilibrium towards scaling and corrosive condition and about 30 7 of the total samples 4 5 6 12 18 19 22 have rsi 7 showing corrosion tendency but latter percentage got increased in pom to 61 5 of the total samples 4 6 8 14 16 19 22 23 showing moderate corrosive tendency with rsi 7 table 5 the intensification in corrosion was attributed to seasonal flow that altered the composition and showing contrasting results when accorded with other indices although chemical variants were not rigorous to cause corrosion except sample 11 having rsi maximum value of 8 31 in pom season due to nearby large scale irrigational practice which is impounding additional discharges leading to corrosive behaviors also comparable with lsi result fig 8b spatially the water conditions found to be stable in prm particularly in the western part of the district and thereby in pom season stable conditions also swing towards eastern sides the corrosiveness was found to be also surging from light to significant corrosion observed in the district in contrary to lsi fig 9b 4 3 3 psi it is dependent upon ph and alkalinity of the water in the present study psi mean values were 6 07 and 6 25 in prm and pom respectively showing a balanced nature 6 7 of the groundwater in the region table 4 in prm 57 7 of the total samples 1 3 7 13 15 16 20 23 24 26 recorded psi value 6 i e tends to supersaturate whereas in pom only 26 9 of the samples 1 3 7 15 16 20 24 showed scaling trend table 5 however in pom 15 4 of the samples 8 10 11 12 exhibited significant corrosion potential with psi value 7 compared to sample 8 in prm season which was attributed to decrease in alkalinity of the samples due to dilution effects in pom season fig 8c psi covered a larger area which was balanced with chemical composition and few in corrosive ranges in both the seasons as in concordance with rsi and deviating from lsi interpretations fig 9c the western part of the district however showed the scaling tendency due to maximum depth of water level at 6 20 mbgl and drainage of yamuna river towards nw direction could be the main reason for such an indication also groundwater abstraction by the numerous marginalized industrial sectors of loni block in western side of ghaziabad district might cause scaling phenomenon more prominently 4 3 4 ls the ls index is characterized by chlorides sulfates carbonates and bicarbonate alkalinity higher chlorides or ions containing chlorine values in neutral to acid solution tend to promote pitting corrosion of stainless alloys fong yuan 2012 the ls mean values in prm and pom were observed as 0 55 and 0 38 respectively indicating that groundwater likely to form a scale ls 0 8 as in table 4 majority of the samples as 84 6 prm and 88 5 pom contribute to scaling tendency table 5 samples 1 25 26 in prm and pom 3 25 26 seasons were showing a pitting corrosion ls 1 2 contrastingly the maximum values of ls were 5 87 prm and 2 88 pom computed for the sample site 25 which concords to the maximum levels of cl for the same site it is a discernible factor as effluents discharged from nearby industrial units within the region increase corrosion rates fig 8d the spatial distribution of ls index also showed that the sites which were having an aggressive tendency towards pitting corrosion were located in the western parts of the district fig 9d where exceeding values of cl have also been observed during both the seasons 4 3 5 ai ai is used to assess the aggressiveness of water based on ph alkalinity and calcium hardness the mean values of ai observed during prm and pom were 12 26 and 12 17 respectively and supports the results of lsi and ls table 4 all the samples within the studied region were having ai 12 during prm subjected to non aggressive and scaling potential however in pom season majority of the samples were recording scaling behavior while few sampling sites 9 11 85 11 11 52 18 11 52 were inferring slight corrosive but very close to scaling tendency table 5 and fig 8e the seasonal water level fluctuations and nearby discharges from residential 9 18 agricultural 11 sites might be the reason but still the values are in stable conditions the spatial results of indices lsi ls and ai were found to be in concordance with the scaling potential fig 9e moreover the seasonal effects were evident as a prime factor in augmentation of scaling and corrosive action due to neighboring land use activities such as loni block s small industrial units in north western parts and major sahibabad industrial area located in south western parts some of the densely populated residential colonies and agricultural practices also contribute to significant discharges altering the chemical composition of the recharged groundwater and thereby encouraging the discrepancies in the chemical stability the exceeding limits of quality parameters like ec tds th cl na and k clearly support the combining effects and potential of scaling development of the groundwater within the region as predicted from the corresponding indices majority of the samples revealed high amounts of hardness and alkalinity which intensifies the scaling conditions whereas the levels of chloride and sulfates at the sampling sites 3 25 particularly promote corrosiveness who 2011 these findings were well supported by the geochemical investigations and negative ionic ratios of the region that signify the hardened nature of the groundwater however scaling and corrosive effects were not severe and can be eluded by the application of cation exchange water softeners or simple boiling methods and stabilization or remineralization respectively who 2011 4 4 statistical relation of quality parameters and indices the results of the physicochemical groundwater quality and indices were put together and analyzed for both the seasons in order to study the relationships among multiple variables through spearman s rank correlation matrix table 6 the strength of the association between two or more variables is explained with weak r 0 500 and strong r 0 500 correlations ec was strong and positively correlated with cl r 0 855 tds r 0 706 na r 0 632 so4 2 r 0 641 and ca2 r 0 570 found to be significant at p 0 01 and weakly related with th hco3 k confirming the presence of dissolved ionic species that drives specific conductivity of the groundwater similarly tds showed a significant strong positive correlation with cl na so4 2 and weakly correlated with th ca2 mg2 and k indicating the contribution of individual variable is existing in the dissolved forms meaningfully the strong positive relationship of th was noticed with ca2 r 0 701 and mg2 r 0 799 significant at p 0 01 and weakly correlated with hco3 cl and so4 2 which supports the occurrence of temporary hardness of the groundwater as bicarbonates forms of ca2 and mg2 as compared to cl and so4 2 which otherwise impart permanent hardness to the groundwater also groundwater confined within the rocks makes various minerals and soluble salts readily available such as caco3 or so4 2 forms that intensify the growth of inorganic scaling antony et al 2011 a strong relationship among cations and anions with correlation coefficient r were as follows so4 2 cl r 0 609 na cl r 0 602 na k r 0 588 na ca r 0 570 indicating the presence of these soluble salts in the groundwater as a dominant complexes forms that initiate scaling and were positive with weak correlation of ca cl r 0 489 ca k r 0 458 and k cl r 0 465 significant at p 0 01 table 6 the water stability indices were correlated with the parameters and among themselves to encounter their applicability for corrosion and scaling potential lsi showed positive correlation with ph r 0 414 p 0 01 due to its reliance on ph and establish a significant association also lsi was strongly related to ai 0 985 p 0 01 which validates the results obtained from the other two indices suggesting a scaling potential ai generally at times used as an alternative to lsi for corrosive signs of waters kalyani et al 2017 contrastingly lsi showed a negative correlation with rsi r 0 784 and psi r 0 366 significant at p 0 01 which proved their contradictory results whereas rsi showed a strong positive relation with psi r 0 781 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with ai r 0 792 p 0 01 and ls r 0 367 p 0 01 psi encountered a strong positive correlation with ph r 0 620 p 0 01 rsi and psi found significantly negatively correlated to ec due to the fact that both the indices are inconstant to ec as both concentrates on ph and alkalinity of the water ls index commences the aggressiveness potential of the groundwater it was found to have a strong positive correlation with ec r 0 779 tds r 0 768 cl r 0 889 so4 2 r 0 772 and na r 0 604 at p 0 01 the strong association of ls with above dissolved constituents clearly showed that cl and so4 2 is the main constituent that are promoting scaling behavior evident from this index also ec is a function of salinity which is accountable by the effect of salts of chloride present in soils underground or as a intruding discharged effluent ls have a weak positive correlation r 0 050 with ai and however a weak negative correlation with rsi and psi was obtained ai was weakly correlated and statistically significant with the majority of the parameters such as ph ec tds th cl so4 2 ca2 and na table 6 5 conclusions and recommendation 1 groundwater seasonal quality assessment showed that majority of the samples found to have parameters in noncompliance with the standards like ec tds th cl na and k both processes natural and anthropogenic practices within some of the identified sites have greatly influenced the constituents seasonal levels the cations and anions followed the abundance in the following order na ca2 mg2 k and hco3 cl so4 2 respectively in both the seasons 2 categorization of geochemical composition based on gibbs diagram revealed the origin of the groundwater chemistry directed from the rock water interface and evaporative processes however tri linear piper plot revealed the dominance of ca mg hco3 na k hco3 na k cl so4 type of water facies discernible in both the seasons the dissolution from natural rock bearing conditions and flow from the anthropogenic effluents were the main reasons behind the composition base exchange r1 and meteoric genesis indices r2 showed that groundwater principally constituted from na hco3 and shallow meteoric type of groundwater respectively schoeller based indices of base exchange also showed the negative ratio of chloro alkaline cai i cai ii disequilibrium with indirect base exchange hardened water prevalent in both the season 3 the groundwater tendencies were classified for corrosion and scaling formation by incorporating the qualitative parameters in the water stability indices the indices lsi ls and ai confirmed that bulk of the samples exhibited scaling properties as groundwater chemistry upholds hco3 type of processes and constitute very hard water within the region however on the contrary rsi and psi were reasonably comparable that predicted slight corrosiveness in the groundwater and most of the samples were balanced with saturation only a few samples showed excessive corrosion rates due to the exceeding limits of the chloride and sulphates parameters and the heavy influence of pollution from the specific sites 4 spatial temporal variations through interpolation highlighted scaling or equilibrium state for the majority of the region as per lsi ls and ai and corrosion rates in the western part of the district as per rsi and ls indices hence the groundwater can be consumed sustainably after employing proper treatment methods such as water softeners and boiling techniques 5 statistical findings suggested that there is a significant relationship among various parameters that administered the governing phenomenon in groundwater chemistry due to their base exchange processes as well as discharges from specific land use based point non point sources similarity among the indices such as lsi ls and ai was evident with their outcomes based on scaling estimations and rsi psi indicating slight corrosion and subsequently it provides a substitute for other indices 6 regular monitoring and remedial measures are imperative to safeguard the groundwater quality for sustainable management of the resources in a myriad of purposes and further causative after effects that arise due to significant pollution of the groundwater should be prevented declaration of competing interest the

12177,this research aims to determine the characteristics of sediment and aquifer layers beneath the surface based on borehole data and the vertical electrical sounding ves method as well as to map the groundwater protection zone for future generations thirty boreholes were analysed to determine sediment grain size and its structure at every depth up to 200 m beneath the surface six locations of ves were performed to confirm the presence of groundwater at every depth of lithology the spatial analysis was used to scrutinize sand to clay ratio distribution of the boreholes data from which map of the groundwater protection zone of the study area was developed the results reveal that the characters of sedimentation in the krueng aceh basin are influenced by terrestrial and coastal processes at a depth of 200 m below modern mean sea level msl historically the sedimentation process beneath 160 m is highly related to the last glacial maximum lgm event and sea level fluctuation in southeast asia the ves findings denote the clayey sands sands and gravel strata discovered in borehole functioning as aquifer layers and they are indicated by low resistivity value the sand to clay ratio distribution mapping indicates that the centre part of the basin is the water resources zone and it should be protected for future generations graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentation groundwater borehole ves aceh 1 introduction water is an essential resource for human life to support social activities in both private and public sectors a tremendous amount of fresh water which comes from sub surface whether from shallow or deep wells is called groundwater and its characteristics rely on geological and physical aspects of sediments which play an essential role in assessing the quantity and quality of groundwater research on the history of sedimentation from the borehole geological analysis geophysical and spatial analysis generates complete and reliable results that are strongly related to the groundwater potential in the krueng aceh basin in recent years there are no adequate studies related to the history of sedimentation beginning from 200 m up to the surface of the krueng aceh basin and its relationship with groundwater resources accordingly it becomes the main reason why this study conducted on this basin numerous researchers around the world have conducted studies on sedimentation and groundwater characteristics using integrated approaches either geophysical or geological data christensen and sørensen 1998 thomsen et al 2004 hamzah et al 2006 uhlemann et al 2017 the spatial analysis combined with geophysical data for exploring groundwater has been conducted by kalaivanan et al 2019 in kodavanar sub basin southern india meanwhile several studies in krueng aceh basin with regard to lithology characteristics and groundwater have been performed by culshaw et al 1979 ploethner and siemon 2006 siemon and steuer 2011 tohari et al 2015 and sugiyanto et al 2018 those studies presented the shallow sediment units and groundwater in the krueng aceh basin however this research covers deeper lithology and groundwater as well as all locations of the basin accordingly this study fills the gap of sedimentation research in krueng aceh basin and deep groundwater resources asrillah et al 2019 surveyed eight points of microtremor in krueng aceh basin and revealed the sediment deposit up to 800 m however their results only focus on the stiffness of sediments and have to be improved with dense borehole data to analyse the history of sedimentation krueng aceh basin is situated on the tip of sumatra island indonesia where recent alluvial and marine sediments fill this basin as a result the basin potentially produces a high capacity of groundwater in numerous aquifer layers as it is located in a tropical country the krueng aceh basin laid by a quaternary alluvial deposit consisting of gravel sand silt and clay bennet et al 1981 culshaw et al 1979 furthermore the capital city of aceh province city of banda aceh also stands on this basin sugiyanto et al 2018 recognised that the aquifer layers groundwater layer in banda aceh were formed by sand and silt deposits and it becomes the groundwater resource for people living in this city culshaw et al 1979 and tohari et al 2015 conducted a shallow investigation on sediment units in this basin they found gravel sand silt and interbedding clay strata on the other hand moechtar et al 2009 used hand auger boring to evaluate the sand bars sediment characteristic in north east of krueng aceh basin until the depth of 3 m and they found the sedimentation in this basin was influenced by sea level fluctuation the integration of geophysical and geological methods as well as spatial analysis approaches in studying sedimentation and groundwater will yield satisfactory results and it becomes the primary purpose of this research this research will produce a beneficial outcome especially in groundwater zoning to the local government in order to build a regulation on the development plan maintain and protect groundwater resources in the krueng aceh basin for the future generation this regulation is mandatory due to the rapid growth of the population in banda aceh as the capital city of aceh province and its vicinity districts 2 geology of krueng aceh basin according to bennet et al 1981 krueng aceh basin was formed by the quaternary and pre quaternary rock recognised as alluvium deposited along krueng river aceh sediment bennet et al 1981 and culshaw et al 1979 stated that the downstream of the krueng aceh basin was formed by alluvium which consists of gravel sand silt and clay the krueng aceh basin is filled by recent alluvium and marine sediment more than 200 m in depth and it is close to the coastline bennet et al 1981 meilianda 2009 argues that the sedimentation process in this basin involved by the lowering sea level in the last glacial maximum lgm event about 20 000 years ago and sea level fluctuation in holocene epoch in the upper part of the basin or in south east the pre quaternary rocks cover by up to 500 m thick from pliocene to pleistocene which consists of calcareous and tuffaceous sandstones siemon and steuer 2011 krueng aceh basin is flanked by aceh fault in the south west and seulimuem fault in the north east muksin et al 2018 rusydy et al 2018 the former fault is the boundary between krueng aceh basin and limestone formed from jurassic to cretaceous period as an oceanic accretion rock and it is part of woyla group barber and crow 2005 rusydy et al 2017 in addition the seulimuem fault was formed within volcanic quaternary in the northwest of krueng aceh basin bennet et al 1981 culshaw et al 1979 siemon and steuer 2011 due to this fact culshaw et al 1979 categorized this basin as the graben type structure culshaw et al 1979 divided this basin into three areas and made a detail description of these quaternary deposits on north and east of darussalam see fig 1 a sequence of sand bars were formed in sub parallel to the coast these sand bars consist of sand size particles from medium to fine grain sometimes the silty sands are found in these sand bars the sands at those sand bars are similar to the modern beach sand in between the sand bars grey to brownish sandy silts and clays are deposited in western of darussalam a present sandy beach ridge is deposited and it is followed by the lagoons where were formed on the left and right side of the krueng aceh channel the sand bodies continuously build from the coastal zone to landward and have no specific pattern as shown in fig 1 culshaw et al 1979 did the dating for the sand bars and found that it just recently formed as ancient coastal lines the results show that the sand bars sequence was formed from land to sea ward were in 7831 40 6876 40 6340 55 and 5819 45 years bp before present respectively on the west of the basin two thirds of the basin is a flattish zone composed of silty clays and clayey silts with occasional sands and horizon of clayey peat and peaty clays culshaw et al 1979 close to woyla group of limestone fragments of limestone were found in fines sediment this fine sediment is indicated as the lacustrine swamps and lagoon environment and probably near the coastline when it deposited in the eastern of the krueng aceh channel several terraces were formed by erosion these terraces composed of sands sandy silts and clays with rare sandy gravels and gravelly sands two to three levels of terraces which consist of sandy gravels and gravelly sands were found near indrapuri culshaw et al 1979 and these terraces become the source of water for the upper part of krueng aceh basin ploethner and siemon 2006 siemon and steuer 2011 furthermore the terraces are part of indrapuri and seulimuem formations bennet et al 1981 around banda aceh city tohari et al 2015 found interbedding alluvium layers composed of sand to silty sand with silty clay to clay at a depth of 20 m ploethner and siemon 2006 reported that the alluvium deposit from pleistocene to holocene was still found at a depth of 206 m at cot paya village located near the coastline up to landward ploethner and siemon 2006 found sandy clays and clayey sand until the depth of 70 m these findings indicate that the groundwater prospect in krueng aceh basin is more than 206 m beneath the surface siemon and steuer 2011 noted that the top 20 m of shallow aquifer are composed of gravels sands and sandy clays directly recharged by rainfall it is still the primary traditional water source even though alluvium deposit fills almost all the basin the different zone has different rain recharged rates permeability rusdi et al 2015 recognised the northern part of banda aceh city has high permeability in the range of 16 26 cm h compared to southern and other parts previous research on sedimentation and groundwater relied on the small number and shallow boreholes the limitation was solved in the study by developing thirty boreholes and six ves vertical electrical sounding points in banda aceh city and its vicinity 3 method this research deployed an integrated approach to analyse the groundwater characteristics by combining geological method which relies on borehole data geophysical methods implementing geo electrical survey ves and spatial analysis to see the groundwater distribution and aquifer potential zones from sands to clays ratio data these combination produced a reliable results a more detailed elaboration of the methodologies as presented in this section 3 1 geological method thirty boreholes were built in the krueng aceh basin to study the sub surface strata sediment structure and its relationship to groundwater resources previously culshaw et al 1979 performed shallow drilling hand augering technique and dutch cone penetrometer in this basin yet they only penetrated up to 29 m and between 12 and 13 m in average in advance this study performed the deepest borehole which penetrated up to 200 m depth and covered almost all areas of the krueng aceh basin the boreholes data were used to analyse the characteristic of sediment and correlate it with ves data to determine the prospect strata for groundwater the 30 boreholes developed in krueng aceh basin were taken into account in the analysis of the lithology units in subsurface based on sediment grain size analysis at the specified depth of the boreholes and correlate it to the history of sea level developed by tjia and fujii 1989 heaney 1991 tjia 1996 the deepest boreholes built in this study is 200 m while the lowest is 76 m it is situated in the downstream and upper stream of the basin the details of the location altitude and depth of the boreholes are presented in fig 1 and table 1 3 2 geophysical method numerous methods have been used by geophysicists to study subsurface nonetheless the geo electrical method is the appropriate approach for studying groundwater and it has been conducted by numerous researchers such as uhlemann et al 2017 benabdelouahab et al 2018 gopinath et al 2018 joel et al 2019 murmu et al 2019 and yusuf and abiye 2019 a geo electrical method is a geophysics technique to determine sub surface lithology based on electrical properties of the material beneath the surface and commonly used for groundwater investigation which has been applied by sugiyanto et al 2018 in several sub districts in banda aceh the geo electrical technique works by penetrating an electrical current along various paths through the subsurface the 1d resistivity imaging method was one of the geo electric techniques to determine the subsurface condition based on the resistivity property of the earth materials telford et al 1990 ernstson and kirsch 2006 called this method vertical electrical sounding ves applied to determine the flat or approximately horizontally layered of the earth the process was carried out using a system of four electrodes placed on the surface of the earth two current electrodes were used to pass the current into the subsurface which will be affected the potential difference values δv measured with the other two wires this configuration will allow this study to calculate the apparent resistivity value ρ a using ohm s law telford et al 1990 ernstson and kirsch 2006 1 r δ v i 2 ρ a k r where k is the geometrical factor depending on the type of electrode array and r is the resistance of the ground from ohm s law eq 1 the apparent resistivity ρ a has a relationship with the true sub surface resistivity telford et al 1990 robinson and coruh 1988 ernstson and kirsch 2006 mentioned that in the ves survey the symmetrical schlumberger configuration is commonly used which the current electrodes moved outward and the voltage electrodes were closely spaced and fixed to the centre of the array the longer current electrode of the ves line in this research is 600 m or the distance ab 2 is 300 m and the lower is 110 m a super sting resistivity meter and geo source resistivity meter are used in apparent resistivity data acquisition at each ves point the sounding point is located in the middle of electrode array for every measurement and the ab electrodes which are recognised as current electrodes move outward sounding point while mn electrodes as potential electrodes keep contact until the voltage too low to measure then the distance potential electrodes to sounding point increase accordingly the res1dinv and curve matching computer software were utilized in determining the resistivity value each layer beneath the surface interpretation the sediment lithology based on resistivity value is hard in alluvial aquifer due to the values vary slightly and or intercalations of layers with intermediate resistivity are frequent and it needs to correlate with geological data borehole data which situate within ves points benabdelouahab et al 2018 six points of ves were performed in the krueng aceh basin to determine the aquifer layers and the interpretation refers to the borehole data within the ves points 3 3 sand to clay ratio mapping sediment analysis was applied to all boreholes to determine the sediment characteristics of each stratum beneath the surface sand to clay ratio of krueng aceh basin layers are calculated based on the 30 boreholes data due to the geological complexity the sand to clay ratio based on lithology was used to calculate the potential aquifer in different depth levels 0 50 m 50 100 m and 100 150 m in each borehole this study calculated the thickness of sand layer and compared to clay thickness and it was conducted at every depth arcgis software was employed to manipulate analyse and manage the sand to clay ratio data in each borehole and interpolate it to produce the sand to clay ratio distribution in every stage of depths the sand to clay ratio analysis using arcgis has been conducted by cao et al 2018 previously when they studied the paleo channel and groundwater prospect in hetao basin china the sand to clay ratio is direct evidence of sedimentation and model of particle transportation flemming 2000 cao et al 2018 hence this study used the sand to clay ratio to represent the sedimentary texture and it is highly related to potential or no potential of groundwater zone in this study the gravel sand clayey sand and silt merged into the sands group while clays sandy clays and silty clays were classified in the clay group sedimentary texture records the environmental aspect of sedimentation climatic and other information of strata during deposition cao et al 2018 and also becomes one of nine factors contributing to groundwater potential zonation das 2019 the large value of sand to clay ratio indicates the massive number of sands and it discloses the potential groundwater zone aquifer zone this research categorises the groundwater from the surface to 50 m as the shallow groundwater 50 100 m as the medium groundwater and more than 100 m as deep groundwater 4 results and discussion 4 1 sedimentation of krueng aceh basin thirty boreholes data were developed in this study the locations of each borehole is presented in table 1 five cross sections were created to build a correlation between boreholes and to illustrate 2d perspective beneath the surface of the krueng aceh basin three cross sections begin from downstream northwest to upstream southeast and two cross sections from the left side southwest to the right side northeast as shown in fig 1 most of the borehole s data are connected in cross sections except for boreholes bh30 bh32 and bh41 accordingly those boreholes will be explained independently as individual data without any correlation approach all boreholes plotted in scale and the altitude of each borehole followed the modern mean sea level msl 4 1 1 cross section a a cross section a a is located at the downstream zone of the basin and it starts from southwest bh22 to north east bh40 fig 2 a shows the correlation among boreholes in cross section a a the composition of boreholes was mostly formed by coastal deposits until 50 m following by combination process terrestrial and coastal from 50 m to 200 m the clay deposit dominates this cross section followed by coarse sand deposits shell sandy clays and gravels and peats from the surface until 50 m interbedding layers between sand sandy clays clays and peat were found in bh22 to bh2 which is located in south west of darussalam whilst sands deposit dominated north east of darussalam until 100 m beneath the surface see bh28 and bh40 at a depth of 100 to 200 m on both sides clay deposits were commonly found yet the gravel deposit was found at a depth of 130 to 140 m from msl this gravel deposit was rounded and contained chert magnetite mineral and shells these deposits indicate that the river sediment was formed by the fluvial process but it is related to a coastal deposit this fluvial process still works until today and it can be found as the river channel split krueng aceh basin into two parts in this cross section the deeper gravels sediment was found at a depth of 130 to 160 m just above sandy clay deposit these gravel strata developed by river channel even though it down 160 m below msl this fact can be explained by studying historical sea level in southeast asia and uplift subsidence due to tectonic activities in aceh province heaney 1991 noted the sea level dropped to 160 m below modern msl in middle pleistocene 160 000 bp epoch in southeast asia and 120 m below msl during the lgm 20 000 bp on the other hand meltzner et al 2010 found the uplift and subsidence evidence from microatoll coral reef and they noted the uplift and subsidence from 1500 bp to present fluctuated in the range of 2 m based on meltzner et al 2010 projected to the early pleistocene epoch it would not be much different regarding uplift and subsidence it is more or less 2 m in average referring to this fact the sea level in the middle of the pleistocene epoch still dropped 160 m below modern msl as a result the deeper gravel deposit which interpred as paleo rivel channel found at a depth of 160 m and it predicted formed in the middle of pleistocene when the sea level dropped up 160 m below the present msl followed by clay sediment on top gravels the gravel at a depth of 90 to 100 m was probably formed in the late pleistocene when the sea level began to rise and gradually fill the clay until the holocene epoch in the holocene epoch interbedding strata between sands and clays were found mainly in bh28 and sand deposits were dominated near surface according to the engineering geological map see fig 1 the bh28 is situated at a sand bars unit dated by culshaw et al 1979 they concluded that these sand bars were formed around 6340 55 bp and more details are shown in fig 2a 4 1 2 cross section b b cross section b b is located on the left side of the basin parallel to fault line starting from the coastal zone to the upstream of the basin in the distance of 15 km see fig 2b similar to cross section a a clay sediment dominance were found in all boreholes at various depths borehole bh12 located in the coastal zone has a high proportion of sand strata from surface until 25 m from msl nevertheless clay layers still dominate from 25 m to 140 m and some portion of sandy clays the same pattern to bh12 was found in bh13 bh11 and bh5 yet the thick peat layer was discovered in bh 29 and a very thick sand layer was discovered in borehole bh37 at a depth of 20 m msl the cross section b b was near to cretaceous limestone accordingly the limestone detritus layers may be discovered beneath the surface in the form of rounding to angular gravel those layers were found at depth 100 m as the lens deposit and alluvial fan which perpendicularly to cross section line it was predicted to be formed in the middle to late pleistocene schist chert and magnetite mineral were found as gravel at these layers it indicates that the sediment in the southwest is influenced by sediment from the upstream of the krueng aceh basin the middle and late pleistocene gravels were still found in this section and it formed a gentle decrease slope from upstream to downstream sand sediment at a depth of 150 160 m in bh11 indicates that the sand beach was deposited in the middle pleistocene epoch 4 1 3 cross section c c cross section c c is a more extended section compared to others it consists of 6 boreholes and starts from the coastal area up to upstream of the basin it is located in the middle of the basin see figs 1 and 2c the clay sediment was mostly found at this cross section hence at some depth the interbedded layer between sand and sandy clays was revealed similar to previous cross sections the gravel layer was discovered at the depth 80 74 120 100 110 40 m for bh18 bh16 bh17 bh1 bh42 and bh44 respectively however bh42 was dominated by sand from 4 to 120 m those gravel and sand layers potentially produce a high quantity of groundwater as shown by ves data illustrated in fig 3 and table 2 more details related to ves interpretation are elaborated in the ves section as longer and detailed cross section compared to others and situated at the centre of the basin it is important to elaborate and examine its correlation with other boreholes at a depth of 50 m till 200 m msl near the present coastline rounded gravel deposit which consists of chert magnetite mineral and shell fragments were found as the indication of fluvial to coastal process chert rock and magnetite mineral insite volcanic rock can found in the upstream of the krueng aceh basin three gravels strata lie in cross section c c where the upper layer is located at a depth of 50 m from msl and estimated to be formed in late pleistocene to the holocene epoch meilianda 2009 mentioned that in this period the sea level is lower at this basin up to 60 m below the present day level in the krueng aceh basin the river channel possibly developed at 50 m below the present sea level as the current sea level is 60 m below sea level the gravels sediment was found on bh16 at 50 m transported by a high current flow process and it is highly related to the fluvial process this research concludes that this stratum was formed in the late pleistocene because it is similar to the time of sea level decline in the shoreline the peat and clay deposits were found at a depth of 60 m from msl it is interpreted as the swamp or lagoon landform in the late pleistocene furthermore a very thick peat layer was revealed in bh29 where it is located around 10 km from the coastal line this thick peat layer in bh29 is interpreted as a swamp or oxbow landform that is relatively younger that the previous peat strata in bh13 at 60 m in the centre of the basin the sediment mostly consists of clays interbedded with sandy clays sands and gravel this circumstance can be seen in cross section c c from coastline until 17 km to the upstream bh44 accordingly it is interpreted as the coastal deposit process combined with the fluvial process the sand deposit was revealed from the surface to sub surface on cross section c c at bh42 at the depth of 4 20 m from the surface this sand deposit is interpreted as the indrapuri formation qpin formed in the pleistocene epoch bennet et al 1981 another sand deposit in bh17 was previously discovered by culshaw et al 1979 they recognised the older sand bars in the eastern of darussalam deposited in 7831 40 years bp these sand bars are located approximately 6 6 km from the coastline in the northern part of the basin however the bh17 is situated at centre part of the basin in a distance of 7 km from the shoreline at 3 m from msl this sand bars deposit is associated with a coastal deposit when the sea level fluctuated moechtar et al 2009 at holocene epoch and began to rise from 7000 years bp in southeast asia as studied by tjia and fujii 1989 tjia 1996 4 1 4 cross section d d cross section d d is located on the right side of the krueng aceh basin along 14 km and relatively close to the artificial river channel in darussalam near coastal zone the clay to sandy deposit are dominated those layers interbedded with sands layer it can be seen in bh10 and bh2 12 km from coastal to the southeast clay domination was still found until 50 m from msl however from 50 m to the bottom gravel strata are mostly recovered as found in bh33 bh26 and bh43 see fig 2d the thick gravel layers are associated with breccia unit from seulawah agam volcano in hillside near this area bennet et al 1981 found the pyroclastic unit recognised as qtvl unit boreholes bh33 and bh26 characterized by thick layer of gravel which can store large amounts of groundwater this layer is shrink to a seaward until the depth of 160 m which shown from bh2 and bh10 this layer is recognised as the middle pleistocene deposit two thin strata sand deposit was found at a depth of 22 and 2 m from msl from the coastline up to 8 km inland it becomes a shallow groundwater source for ordinary people in the krueng aceh basin the 22 m sand strata were formed in the period of sea level increase after lgm and the shallow 2 m was formed after 7000 bp in the period of sea level rise in southeast asia the sand strata found in bh33 is older than the sand layer in bh2 4 1 5 cross section e e the shorter cross section is e e which is parallel to cross section a but it is located in the upstream of the basin as illustrated in fig 2e other than that uncorrelated boreholes are shown in fig 2e different from other cross sections which are dominated by clays deposit at this cross section sand layers are frequently found at a depth of below 50 m except for bh1 thick clay layers were still found in bh1 with thin sand layers the boreholes in fig 2e were not correlated in this cross section line but it delivers aditional data measured in krueng aceh basin it also noted that bh 30 bh32 and bh41 are close to cross section b b accordingly the similar reveal from these boreholes where clay sediments are mostly found in these boreholes 4 2 potential groundwater in krueng aceh basin 4 2 1 ves vertical electrical sounding models six locations of ves measurements are conducted inside krueng aceh basin and the results of those measurements are correlated to borehole data to ensure an appropriate interpretation of its lithologies correlation to boreholes is necessary to overcome the difficulty of sub surface interpretation from the resistivity value of layers four of ves points situate inside banda aceh city whilst two points in the rural area nonetheless they still locate within krueng aceh basin and for more details please see table 2 1d forward modelling for ves1 reveals five layers of resistivity value down to 141 m beneath the surface and this point within 660 m to borehole bh5 which can be utilized as the baseline in ves interpretation on the surface the silty clay layer is found in ves1 until 1 5 m followed by sand layer beneath it up to 5 7 m which is interpreted as a shallow aquifer layer from 5 6 to 76 m the clay layers composed of sand and gravel sandy clay and gravelly clay interpreted the aquitard layer which just above the aquifer layer clayey sand from 76 to 141 m the second ves point ves2 is situated in the centre of krueng aceh basin within approximately 6 km from coastal line and within 750 m to bh16 which is employed in interpretation the resistivity value of ves 25 result interbedding layers between clays and clayey sands are found at this ves and it identic to lithology finding in bh16 on the surface sandy silt is found till 1 5 m followed by clayey sand layer from 1 5 to 3 1 m interpreted as a shallow aquifer layer the clay layer is found beneath this aquifer layer from 3 1 to 7 3 m leading the clayey sand layer below it as the confined aquifer from 7 3 to 18 2 m and this clayey sand layer associated with sand bar lithology formed in 7831 40 bp as dated by culshaw et al 1979 as is denoted in fig 2c the clay holocene is found beneath this confined aquifer layer by 46 m of thickness before another confined aquifer is revealed from 64 to 140 m associate to paleo river when it composed of gravels ves3 situates around 3 7 km to south east from coastal line and within 120 m to bh2 on the surface the clayey sand is found as an unsaturated layer till 1 5 m followed by sand layer from 1 5 to 8 6 m as shallow aquifer which has 24 73 ωm of resistivity this sand layer is revealed in bh 2 besides it has a high correlation to sand bar which formed in 6340 55 bp as denoted in fig 2a low resistivity value of sand layer as the indication this layer as the water contains layer or aquifer layer beneath sand layer the clay layers are found by 58 m of thickness which up to 66 9 m from surface and it forms as impermeable layer leading sandy clay sand and gravel layers beneath this layer as confined aquifer layers from 66 9 to 147 7 m from the surface ves4 situates in the sand bar deposit which mapped previously by culshaw et al 1979 as the result 20 m thick of sand layers are discovered at this location as revealed in bh28 see fig 2a located within 300 m to ves4 clayey sand is interpreted from surface to 4 m beneath surface and silty clay as the aquitard layer just below clayey sand strata from 4 to 6 m the thickness clayey sand layers are interpreted from 6 to 20 47 m and they are recognised as aquifer layers which also found in bh28 as sand layers at this ves point clay layer as an impermeable layer reveals and it leads the clayey sand layer below the impermeable layer as a confined aquifer ves5 takes place in upstream of the krueng aceh basin approximately 17 km from coastline and within 1 6 km to bh42 clayey silt is formed on the surface on this area up to 1 5 m beneath surface followed by silty clay layer acting as an aquitard layer from 1 5 to 8 9 m this aquitard layer contains the groundwater nevertheless the aquitard layer has low transmissivity and permeability beneath the aquitard layer the enormous thickness of sand layers are found and it indicates as the aquifer layers followed by gravel strata the evidence of thick sand and gravel layers are also reveal in bh42 as can be seen in fig 2c in cross section c c the low resistivity value of sands and gravel indicated these layers as a high potential groundwater layer see fig 3 ves6 situates in far upstream it approximately 1 34 km to the south east of bh44 where it as the end of cross section c c see fig 2c due to this fact this ves point is not illustrated in the cross section nonetheless there is still a possibility to develop a correlation between ves6 and bh44 clayey silt layer is discovered on the surface to 1 5 m depth followed by silty clay layers recognised as an aquitard layer by 26 m of thickness this aquitard contains a small amount groundwater however it can fulfill the community needs like drinking water and other purposes beneath the aquitard layer the aquifer layers are located from 27 3 to 144 6 m composing of gravels which also evidenced in bh44 in fact according to bh44 from around 30 to 100 m interbedding layers between clays and gravels are notices yet the resistivity considers those layers as one homogenous layer and it acceptable due to the homogenous principle in ves measurement ves measurements reveal low resistivity values in the range of 1 4 74 ωm expressing all those layers clays silts sands and gravels potentially contain groundwater however every layer has different transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity in transporting groundwater furthermore the study area is located in tropical countries with a high amount precipitation almost every year based on this fact it can conclude that sand and gravel layer which revealed in the subsurface from borehole data signal to groundwater layers 4 2 2 sand to clay ratio sand to clay ratio represents the sediment composition beneath the surface as a result it is related to the depositional environment of these sediments in the past and the potential zone of groundwater in each borehole this study examines the thickness of the sands layer and compares it to the clay layer at the depth 0 to 50 m 50 to 100 m and below 100 m the arcgis software utilizes to generate interpolation analysis as a result the sand to clay distribution possible to map as shown in fig 4 a and b and c a distribution sands to clays ratio from surface to 50 m b sands to clays ratio from 50 to 100 m c sands to clays ratio from 100 to 150 m beneath surface the location of the fault line referred to bennet et al 1981 and digital elevation model dataset from nasa 2007 the sand to clay ratio for surface until 50 m shows that at some locations the ratio reaches 0 7 0 8 at the centre part of the basin this zone is interpreted as the rich shallow groundwater zone see fig 4a the shallow groundwater is profoundly influenced by climate and rainy season the existing thick sand deposit strata and thin clay in the surface in bh42 as well as the gravel sand and silt deposit in bh43 make this zone a rich shallow groundwater zone the thick sand deposit beneath bh42 and bh43 was predicted to be formed in the late pleistocene epoch it is associated with indrapuri formation known as the old terrace in krueng aceh basin in darussalam city the sands to clays ratio are in the range of 0 5 0 7 and continue to north east in some portions of the basin the sand to clay was 0 3 0 5 however the 0 1 0 3 ratio mostly dominated in the krueng aceh basin the small number of sand to clay ratio on shallow groundwater does not mean this basin groundwater is sufficient there are thin sand strata found in every cross section see fig 2 it is related to shallow groundwater and commonly consumed by the community living around the basin from a very shallow dug well and it depends on the rainy season the medium groundwater prospect begins from 50 to 100 m beneath msl as illustrated in fig 4b in the centre part of the basin this research found a large area of 0 5 0 9 sand to clay ratio this zone becomes the source of groundwater in the basin and it has to be protected from contaminant and over extraction the potential groundwater zone is situated far away from the coastline accordingly this groundwater may produce freshwater which is suitable for consumption and support for future generation nevertheless the lower sand to clay ratio in the range of 0 0 3 still found at this particular depth and it was mostly located near the shoreline and western part of the basin where clays dominated the lithology in the subsurface the deep groundwater which begins below 100 m as illustrated in fig 4c showed a high ratio in the centre of basin compared to the western part this type of aquifer has a high sand to clay ratio in the range of 0 3 0 5 and potential for support future generation people who live in the krueng aceh basin consumed the shallow groundwater from dug wells due to the increasing number of the population people begin to extract medium and deep groundwater in the krueng aceh basin accordingly this resource of water should be protected by a sustainable development plan recently many medium to deep wells has been built in the krueng aceh basin to extract groundwater for personal communities and daily business purposes in order to protect the water supply for the future generation the centre part of the basin should be free from industrial activities industrial activities might contaminate groundwater also this upstream zone also becomes a recharge zone for groundwater in the krueng aceh basin 5 conclusions thirty borehole data indicate a substantial information regarding lithology of sediment beneath the krueng aceh basin which were consist of gravels sands silt clays peats and a combination between those materials this research reveals that the older sediment in this basin formed in the early pleistocene epoch at the similar time with lgm event which played an essential role in the sedimentation process in the krueng aceh basin by increasing sea level from early pleistocene to middle and late pleistocene various interbedding strata between gravel sand and clays developed respectively in this basin thus the historical sea level fluctuation has a high correlation with sedimentation process in krueng aceh basin which shown by the deeper sediment at 160 m in subsurface that can be concluded to be formed in middle pleistocene epoch the gravels sands and silt strata in the krueng aceh basin contain groundwater and become the water resources for communities who live around the basin these groundwater layers have been proved by six ves data which denote the lower resistivity strata 1 4 74 ωm interpreted as aquifer layers see table 2 those aquifer layers have different physical characteristics regarding transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity because they have different grain sizes besides the krueng aceh basin is situated in a tropical region where the amount of precipitation is high and it occurs almost every year hence all gravels sand and silt layers found from boreholes are potentially become aquifer layer in krueng aceh basin the spatial analysis of sand to clay ratio reveals that the area with 0 7 0 9 ratios are interpreted as the groundwater zone was situated in the upstream part of basin accordingly this zone should be protected by the local government groundwater protection for the future generation is an important task to be completed by the local government in the krueng aceh basin these maps will be distributed to local governments to assist them in the development plan of the krueng aceh basin particularly for protecting the groundwater resources in the future a dense boreholes data analysis should be performed to produces more detailed sediment lithology acknowledgment the authors would like to express their gratitude to the mining and energy resources agency of aceh government for providing boreholes data in the krueng aceh basin this research will not be completed without administration support from the department of geological engineering engineering faculty universitas syiah kuala appendix a

12177,this research aims to determine the characteristics of sediment and aquifer layers beneath the surface based on borehole data and the vertical electrical sounding ves method as well as to map the groundwater protection zone for future generations thirty boreholes were analysed to determine sediment grain size and its structure at every depth up to 200 m beneath the surface six locations of ves were performed to confirm the presence of groundwater at every depth of lithology the spatial analysis was used to scrutinize sand to clay ratio distribution of the boreholes data from which map of the groundwater protection zone of the study area was developed the results reveal that the characters of sedimentation in the krueng aceh basin are influenced by terrestrial and coastal processes at a depth of 200 m below modern mean sea level msl historically the sedimentation process beneath 160 m is highly related to the last glacial maximum lgm event and sea level fluctuation in southeast asia the ves findings denote the clayey sands sands and gravel strata discovered in borehole functioning as aquifer layers and they are indicated by low resistivity value the sand to clay ratio distribution mapping indicates that the centre part of the basin is the water resources zone and it should be protected for future generations graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentation groundwater borehole ves aceh 1 introduction water is an essential resource for human life to support social activities in both private and public sectors a tremendous amount of fresh water which comes from sub surface whether from shallow or deep wells is called groundwater and its characteristics rely on geological and physical aspects of sediments which play an essential role in assessing the quantity and quality of groundwater research on the history of sedimentation from the borehole geological analysis geophysical and spatial analysis generates complete and reliable results that are strongly related to the groundwater potential in the krueng aceh basin in recent years there are no adequate studies related to the history of sedimentation beginning from 200 m up to the surface of the krueng aceh basin and its relationship with groundwater resources accordingly it becomes the main reason why this study conducted on this basin numerous researchers around the world have conducted studies on sedimentation and groundwater characteristics using integrated approaches either geophysical or geological data christensen and sørensen 1998 thomsen et al 2004 hamzah et al 2006 uhlemann et al 2017 the spatial analysis combined with geophysical data for exploring groundwater has been conducted by kalaivanan et al 2019 in kodavanar sub basin southern india meanwhile several studies in krueng aceh basin with regard to lithology characteristics and groundwater have been performed by culshaw et al 1979 ploethner and siemon 2006 siemon and steuer 2011 tohari et al 2015 and sugiyanto et al 2018 those studies presented the shallow sediment units and groundwater in the krueng aceh basin however this research covers deeper lithology and groundwater as well as all locations of the basin accordingly this study fills the gap of sedimentation research in krueng aceh basin and deep groundwater resources asrillah et al 2019 surveyed eight points of microtremor in krueng aceh basin and revealed the sediment deposit up to 800 m however their results only focus on the stiffness of sediments and have to be improved with dense borehole data to analyse the history of sedimentation krueng aceh basin is situated on the tip of sumatra island indonesia where recent alluvial and marine sediments fill this basin as a result the basin potentially produces a high capacity of groundwater in numerous aquifer layers as it is located in a tropical country the krueng aceh basin laid by a quaternary alluvial deposit consisting of gravel sand silt and clay bennet et al 1981 culshaw et al 1979 furthermore the capital city of aceh province city of banda aceh also stands on this basin sugiyanto et al 2018 recognised that the aquifer layers groundwater layer in banda aceh were formed by sand and silt deposits and it becomes the groundwater resource for people living in this city culshaw et al 1979 and tohari et al 2015 conducted a shallow investigation on sediment units in this basin they found gravel sand silt and interbedding clay strata on the other hand moechtar et al 2009 used hand auger boring to evaluate the sand bars sediment characteristic in north east of krueng aceh basin until the depth of 3 m and they found the sedimentation in this basin was influenced by sea level fluctuation the integration of geophysical and geological methods as well as spatial analysis approaches in studying sedimentation and groundwater will yield satisfactory results and it becomes the primary purpose of this research this research will produce a beneficial outcome especially in groundwater zoning to the local government in order to build a regulation on the development plan maintain and protect groundwater resources in the krueng aceh basin for the future generation this regulation is mandatory due to the rapid growth of the population in banda aceh as the capital city of aceh province and its vicinity districts 2 geology of krueng aceh basin according to bennet et al 1981 krueng aceh basin was formed by the quaternary and pre quaternary rock recognised as alluvium deposited along krueng river aceh sediment bennet et al 1981 and culshaw et al 1979 stated that the downstream of the krueng aceh basin was formed by alluvium which consists of gravel sand silt and clay the krueng aceh basin is filled by recent alluvium and marine sediment more than 200 m in depth and it is close to the coastline bennet et al 1981 meilianda 2009 argues that the sedimentation process in this basin involved by the lowering sea level in the last glacial maximum lgm event about 20 000 years ago and sea level fluctuation in holocene epoch in the upper part of the basin or in south east the pre quaternary rocks cover by up to 500 m thick from pliocene to pleistocene which consists of calcareous and tuffaceous sandstones siemon and steuer 2011 krueng aceh basin is flanked by aceh fault in the south west and seulimuem fault in the north east muksin et al 2018 rusydy et al 2018 the former fault is the boundary between krueng aceh basin and limestone formed from jurassic to cretaceous period as an oceanic accretion rock and it is part of woyla group barber and crow 2005 rusydy et al 2017 in addition the seulimuem fault was formed within volcanic quaternary in the northwest of krueng aceh basin bennet et al 1981 culshaw et al 1979 siemon and steuer 2011 due to this fact culshaw et al 1979 categorized this basin as the graben type structure culshaw et al 1979 divided this basin into three areas and made a detail description of these quaternary deposits on north and east of darussalam see fig 1 a sequence of sand bars were formed in sub parallel to the coast these sand bars consist of sand size particles from medium to fine grain sometimes the silty sands are found in these sand bars the sands at those sand bars are similar to the modern beach sand in between the sand bars grey to brownish sandy silts and clays are deposited in western of darussalam a present sandy beach ridge is deposited and it is followed by the lagoons where were formed on the left and right side of the krueng aceh channel the sand bodies continuously build from the coastal zone to landward and have no specific pattern as shown in fig 1 culshaw et al 1979 did the dating for the sand bars and found that it just recently formed as ancient coastal lines the results show that the sand bars sequence was formed from land to sea ward were in 7831 40 6876 40 6340 55 and 5819 45 years bp before present respectively on the west of the basin two thirds of the basin is a flattish zone composed of silty clays and clayey silts with occasional sands and horizon of clayey peat and peaty clays culshaw et al 1979 close to woyla group of limestone fragments of limestone were found in fines sediment this fine sediment is indicated as the lacustrine swamps and lagoon environment and probably near the coastline when it deposited in the eastern of the krueng aceh channel several terraces were formed by erosion these terraces composed of sands sandy silts and clays with rare sandy gravels and gravelly sands two to three levels of terraces which consist of sandy gravels and gravelly sands were found near indrapuri culshaw et al 1979 and these terraces become the source of water for the upper part of krueng aceh basin ploethner and siemon 2006 siemon and steuer 2011 furthermore the terraces are part of indrapuri and seulimuem formations bennet et al 1981 around banda aceh city tohari et al 2015 found interbedding alluvium layers composed of sand to silty sand with silty clay to clay at a depth of 20 m ploethner and siemon 2006 reported that the alluvium deposit from pleistocene to holocene was still found at a depth of 206 m at cot paya village located near the coastline up to landward ploethner and siemon 2006 found sandy clays and clayey sand until the depth of 70 m these findings indicate that the groundwater prospect in krueng aceh basin is more than 206 m beneath the surface siemon and steuer 2011 noted that the top 20 m of shallow aquifer are composed of gravels sands and sandy clays directly recharged by rainfall it is still the primary traditional water source even though alluvium deposit fills almost all the basin the different zone has different rain recharged rates permeability rusdi et al 2015 recognised the northern part of banda aceh city has high permeability in the range of 16 26 cm h compared to southern and other parts previous research on sedimentation and groundwater relied on the small number and shallow boreholes the limitation was solved in the study by developing thirty boreholes and six ves vertical electrical sounding points in banda aceh city and its vicinity 3 method this research deployed an integrated approach to analyse the groundwater characteristics by combining geological method which relies on borehole data geophysical methods implementing geo electrical survey ves and spatial analysis to see the groundwater distribution and aquifer potential zones from sands to clays ratio data these combination produced a reliable results a more detailed elaboration of the methodologies as presented in this section 3 1 geological method thirty boreholes were built in the krueng aceh basin to study the sub surface strata sediment structure and its relationship to groundwater resources previously culshaw et al 1979 performed shallow drilling hand augering technique and dutch cone penetrometer in this basin yet they only penetrated up to 29 m and between 12 and 13 m in average in advance this study performed the deepest borehole which penetrated up to 200 m depth and covered almost all areas of the krueng aceh basin the boreholes data were used to analyse the characteristic of sediment and correlate it with ves data to determine the prospect strata for groundwater the 30 boreholes developed in krueng aceh basin were taken into account in the analysis of the lithology units in subsurface based on sediment grain size analysis at the specified depth of the boreholes and correlate it to the history of sea level developed by tjia and fujii 1989 heaney 1991 tjia 1996 the deepest boreholes built in this study is 200 m while the lowest is 76 m it is situated in the downstream and upper stream of the basin the details of the location altitude and depth of the boreholes are presented in fig 1 and table 1 3 2 geophysical method numerous methods have been used by geophysicists to study subsurface nonetheless the geo electrical method is the appropriate approach for studying groundwater and it has been conducted by numerous researchers such as uhlemann et al 2017 benabdelouahab et al 2018 gopinath et al 2018 joel et al 2019 murmu et al 2019 and yusuf and abiye 2019 a geo electrical method is a geophysics technique to determine sub surface lithology based on electrical properties of the material beneath the surface and commonly used for groundwater investigation which has been applied by sugiyanto et al 2018 in several sub districts in banda aceh the geo electrical technique works by penetrating an electrical current along various paths through the subsurface the 1d resistivity imaging method was one of the geo electric techniques to determine the subsurface condition based on the resistivity property of the earth materials telford et al 1990 ernstson and kirsch 2006 called this method vertical electrical sounding ves applied to determine the flat or approximately horizontally layered of the earth the process was carried out using a system of four electrodes placed on the surface of the earth two current electrodes were used to pass the current into the subsurface which will be affected the potential difference values δv measured with the other two wires this configuration will allow this study to calculate the apparent resistivity value ρ a using ohm s law telford et al 1990 ernstson and kirsch 2006 1 r δ v i 2 ρ a k r where k is the geometrical factor depending on the type of electrode array and r is the resistance of the ground from ohm s law eq 1 the apparent resistivity ρ a has a relationship with the true sub surface resistivity telford et al 1990 robinson and coruh 1988 ernstson and kirsch 2006 mentioned that in the ves survey the symmetrical schlumberger configuration is commonly used which the current electrodes moved outward and the voltage electrodes were closely spaced and fixed to the centre of the array the longer current electrode of the ves line in this research is 600 m or the distance ab 2 is 300 m and the lower is 110 m a super sting resistivity meter and geo source resistivity meter are used in apparent resistivity data acquisition at each ves point the sounding point is located in the middle of electrode array for every measurement and the ab electrodes which are recognised as current electrodes move outward sounding point while mn electrodes as potential electrodes keep contact until the voltage too low to measure then the distance potential electrodes to sounding point increase accordingly the res1dinv and curve matching computer software were utilized in determining the resistivity value each layer beneath the surface interpretation the sediment lithology based on resistivity value is hard in alluvial aquifer due to the values vary slightly and or intercalations of layers with intermediate resistivity are frequent and it needs to correlate with geological data borehole data which situate within ves points benabdelouahab et al 2018 six points of ves were performed in the krueng aceh basin to determine the aquifer layers and the interpretation refers to the borehole data within the ves points 3 3 sand to clay ratio mapping sediment analysis was applied to all boreholes to determine the sediment characteristics of each stratum beneath the surface sand to clay ratio of krueng aceh basin layers are calculated based on the 30 boreholes data due to the geological complexity the sand to clay ratio based on lithology was used to calculate the potential aquifer in different depth levels 0 50 m 50 100 m and 100 150 m in each borehole this study calculated the thickness of sand layer and compared to clay thickness and it was conducted at every depth arcgis software was employed to manipulate analyse and manage the sand to clay ratio data in each borehole and interpolate it to produce the sand to clay ratio distribution in every stage of depths the sand to clay ratio analysis using arcgis has been conducted by cao et al 2018 previously when they studied the paleo channel and groundwater prospect in hetao basin china the sand to clay ratio is direct evidence of sedimentation and model of particle transportation flemming 2000 cao et al 2018 hence this study used the sand to clay ratio to represent the sedimentary texture and it is highly related to potential or no potential of groundwater zone in this study the gravel sand clayey sand and silt merged into the sands group while clays sandy clays and silty clays were classified in the clay group sedimentary texture records the environmental aspect of sedimentation climatic and other information of strata during deposition cao et al 2018 and also becomes one of nine factors contributing to groundwater potential zonation das 2019 the large value of sand to clay ratio indicates the massive number of sands and it discloses the potential groundwater zone aquifer zone this research categorises the groundwater from the surface to 50 m as the shallow groundwater 50 100 m as the medium groundwater and more than 100 m as deep groundwater 4 results and discussion 4 1 sedimentation of krueng aceh basin thirty boreholes data were developed in this study the locations of each borehole is presented in table 1 five cross sections were created to build a correlation between boreholes and to illustrate 2d perspective beneath the surface of the krueng aceh basin three cross sections begin from downstream northwest to upstream southeast and two cross sections from the left side southwest to the right side northeast as shown in fig 1 most of the borehole s data are connected in cross sections except for boreholes bh30 bh32 and bh41 accordingly those boreholes will be explained independently as individual data without any correlation approach all boreholes plotted in scale and the altitude of each borehole followed the modern mean sea level msl 4 1 1 cross section a a cross section a a is located at the downstream zone of the basin and it starts from southwest bh22 to north east bh40 fig 2 a shows the correlation among boreholes in cross section a a the composition of boreholes was mostly formed by coastal deposits until 50 m following by combination process terrestrial and coastal from 50 m to 200 m the clay deposit dominates this cross section followed by coarse sand deposits shell sandy clays and gravels and peats from the surface until 50 m interbedding layers between sand sandy clays clays and peat were found in bh22 to bh2 which is located in south west of darussalam whilst sands deposit dominated north east of darussalam until 100 m beneath the surface see bh28 and bh40 at a depth of 100 to 200 m on both sides clay deposits were commonly found yet the gravel deposit was found at a depth of 130 to 140 m from msl this gravel deposit was rounded and contained chert magnetite mineral and shells these deposits indicate that the river sediment was formed by the fluvial process but it is related to a coastal deposit this fluvial process still works until today and it can be found as the river channel split krueng aceh basin into two parts in this cross section the deeper gravels sediment was found at a depth of 130 to 160 m just above sandy clay deposit these gravel strata developed by river channel even though it down 160 m below msl this fact can be explained by studying historical sea level in southeast asia and uplift subsidence due to tectonic activities in aceh province heaney 1991 noted the sea level dropped to 160 m below modern msl in middle pleistocene 160 000 bp epoch in southeast asia and 120 m below msl during the lgm 20 000 bp on the other hand meltzner et al 2010 found the uplift and subsidence evidence from microatoll coral reef and they noted the uplift and subsidence from 1500 bp to present fluctuated in the range of 2 m based on meltzner et al 2010 projected to the early pleistocene epoch it would not be much different regarding uplift and subsidence it is more or less 2 m in average referring to this fact the sea level in the middle of the pleistocene epoch still dropped 160 m below modern msl as a result the deeper gravel deposit which interpred as paleo rivel channel found at a depth of 160 m and it predicted formed in the middle of pleistocene when the sea level dropped up 160 m below the present msl followed by clay sediment on top gravels the gravel at a depth of 90 to 100 m was probably formed in the late pleistocene when the sea level began to rise and gradually fill the clay until the holocene epoch in the holocene epoch interbedding strata between sands and clays were found mainly in bh28 and sand deposits were dominated near surface according to the engineering geological map see fig 1 the bh28 is situated at a sand bars unit dated by culshaw et al 1979 they concluded that these sand bars were formed around 6340 55 bp and more details are shown in fig 2a 4 1 2 cross section b b cross section b b is located on the left side of the basin parallel to fault line starting from the coastal zone to the upstream of the basin in the distance of 15 km see fig 2b similar to cross section a a clay sediment dominance were found in all boreholes at various depths borehole bh12 located in the coastal zone has a high proportion of sand strata from surface until 25 m from msl nevertheless clay layers still dominate from 25 m to 140 m and some portion of sandy clays the same pattern to bh12 was found in bh13 bh11 and bh5 yet the thick peat layer was discovered in bh 29 and a very thick sand layer was discovered in borehole bh37 at a depth of 20 m msl the cross section b b was near to cretaceous limestone accordingly the limestone detritus layers may be discovered beneath the surface in the form of rounding to angular gravel those layers were found at depth 100 m as the lens deposit and alluvial fan which perpendicularly to cross section line it was predicted to be formed in the middle to late pleistocene schist chert and magnetite mineral were found as gravel at these layers it indicates that the sediment in the southwest is influenced by sediment from the upstream of the krueng aceh basin the middle and late pleistocene gravels were still found in this section and it formed a gentle decrease slope from upstream to downstream sand sediment at a depth of 150 160 m in bh11 indicates that the sand beach was deposited in the middle pleistocene epoch 4 1 3 cross section c c cross section c c is a more extended section compared to others it consists of 6 boreholes and starts from the coastal area up to upstream of the basin it is located in the middle of the basin see figs 1 and 2c the clay sediment was mostly found at this cross section hence at some depth the interbedded layer between sand and sandy clays was revealed similar to previous cross sections the gravel layer was discovered at the depth 80 74 120 100 110 40 m for bh18 bh16 bh17 bh1 bh42 and bh44 respectively however bh42 was dominated by sand from 4 to 120 m those gravel and sand layers potentially produce a high quantity of groundwater as shown by ves data illustrated in fig 3 and table 2 more details related to ves interpretation are elaborated in the ves section as longer and detailed cross section compared to others and situated at the centre of the basin it is important to elaborate and examine its correlation with other boreholes at a depth of 50 m till 200 m msl near the present coastline rounded gravel deposit which consists of chert magnetite mineral and shell fragments were found as the indication of fluvial to coastal process chert rock and magnetite mineral insite volcanic rock can found in the upstream of the krueng aceh basin three gravels strata lie in cross section c c where the upper layer is located at a depth of 50 m from msl and estimated to be formed in late pleistocene to the holocene epoch meilianda 2009 mentioned that in this period the sea level is lower at this basin up to 60 m below the present day level in the krueng aceh basin the river channel possibly developed at 50 m below the present sea level as the current sea level is 60 m below sea level the gravels sediment was found on bh16 at 50 m transported by a high current flow process and it is highly related to the fluvial process this research concludes that this stratum was formed in the late pleistocene because it is similar to the time of sea level decline in the shoreline the peat and clay deposits were found at a depth of 60 m from msl it is interpreted as the swamp or lagoon landform in the late pleistocene furthermore a very thick peat layer was revealed in bh29 where it is located around 10 km from the coastal line this thick peat layer in bh29 is interpreted as a swamp or oxbow landform that is relatively younger that the previous peat strata in bh13 at 60 m in the centre of the basin the sediment mostly consists of clays interbedded with sandy clays sands and gravel this circumstance can be seen in cross section c c from coastline until 17 km to the upstream bh44 accordingly it is interpreted as the coastal deposit process combined with the fluvial process the sand deposit was revealed from the surface to sub surface on cross section c c at bh42 at the depth of 4 20 m from the surface this sand deposit is interpreted as the indrapuri formation qpin formed in the pleistocene epoch bennet et al 1981 another sand deposit in bh17 was previously discovered by culshaw et al 1979 they recognised the older sand bars in the eastern of darussalam deposited in 7831 40 years bp these sand bars are located approximately 6 6 km from the coastline in the northern part of the basin however the bh17 is situated at centre part of the basin in a distance of 7 km from the shoreline at 3 m from msl this sand bars deposit is associated with a coastal deposit when the sea level fluctuated moechtar et al 2009 at holocene epoch and began to rise from 7000 years bp in southeast asia as studied by tjia and fujii 1989 tjia 1996 4 1 4 cross section d d cross section d d is located on the right side of the krueng aceh basin along 14 km and relatively close to the artificial river channel in darussalam near coastal zone the clay to sandy deposit are dominated those layers interbedded with sands layer it can be seen in bh10 and bh2 12 km from coastal to the southeast clay domination was still found until 50 m from msl however from 50 m to the bottom gravel strata are mostly recovered as found in bh33 bh26 and bh43 see fig 2d the thick gravel layers are associated with breccia unit from seulawah agam volcano in hillside near this area bennet et al 1981 found the pyroclastic unit recognised as qtvl unit boreholes bh33 and bh26 characterized by thick layer of gravel which can store large amounts of groundwater this layer is shrink to a seaward until the depth of 160 m which shown from bh2 and bh10 this layer is recognised as the middle pleistocene deposit two thin strata sand deposit was found at a depth of 22 and 2 m from msl from the coastline up to 8 km inland it becomes a shallow groundwater source for ordinary people in the krueng aceh basin the 22 m sand strata were formed in the period of sea level increase after lgm and the shallow 2 m was formed after 7000 bp in the period of sea level rise in southeast asia the sand strata found in bh33 is older than the sand layer in bh2 4 1 5 cross section e e the shorter cross section is e e which is parallel to cross section a but it is located in the upstream of the basin as illustrated in fig 2e other than that uncorrelated boreholes are shown in fig 2e different from other cross sections which are dominated by clays deposit at this cross section sand layers are frequently found at a depth of below 50 m except for bh1 thick clay layers were still found in bh1 with thin sand layers the boreholes in fig 2e were not correlated in this cross section line but it delivers aditional data measured in krueng aceh basin it also noted that bh 30 bh32 and bh41 are close to cross section b b accordingly the similar reveal from these boreholes where clay sediments are mostly found in these boreholes 4 2 potential groundwater in krueng aceh basin 4 2 1 ves vertical electrical sounding models six locations of ves measurements are conducted inside krueng aceh basin and the results of those measurements are correlated to borehole data to ensure an appropriate interpretation of its lithologies correlation to boreholes is necessary to overcome the difficulty of sub surface interpretation from the resistivity value of layers four of ves points situate inside banda aceh city whilst two points in the rural area nonetheless they still locate within krueng aceh basin and for more details please see table 2 1d forward modelling for ves1 reveals five layers of resistivity value down to 141 m beneath the surface and this point within 660 m to borehole bh5 which can be utilized as the baseline in ves interpretation on the surface the silty clay layer is found in ves1 until 1 5 m followed by sand layer beneath it up to 5 7 m which is interpreted as a shallow aquifer layer from 5 6 to 76 m the clay layers composed of sand and gravel sandy clay and gravelly clay interpreted the aquitard layer which just above the aquifer layer clayey sand from 76 to 141 m the second ves point ves2 is situated in the centre of krueng aceh basin within approximately 6 km from coastal line and within 750 m to bh16 which is employed in interpretation the resistivity value of ves 25 result interbedding layers between clays and clayey sands are found at this ves and it identic to lithology finding in bh16 on the surface sandy silt is found till 1 5 m followed by clayey sand layer from 1 5 to 3 1 m interpreted as a shallow aquifer layer the clay layer is found beneath this aquifer layer from 3 1 to 7 3 m leading the clayey sand layer below it as the confined aquifer from 7 3 to 18 2 m and this clayey sand layer associated with sand bar lithology formed in 7831 40 bp as dated by culshaw et al 1979 as is denoted in fig 2c the clay holocene is found beneath this confined aquifer layer by 46 m of thickness before another confined aquifer is revealed from 64 to 140 m associate to paleo river when it composed of gravels ves3 situates around 3 7 km to south east from coastal line and within 120 m to bh2 on the surface the clayey sand is found as an unsaturated layer till 1 5 m followed by sand layer from 1 5 to 8 6 m as shallow aquifer which has 24 73 ωm of resistivity this sand layer is revealed in bh 2 besides it has a high correlation to sand bar which formed in 6340 55 bp as denoted in fig 2a low resistivity value of sand layer as the indication this layer as the water contains layer or aquifer layer beneath sand layer the clay layers are found by 58 m of thickness which up to 66 9 m from surface and it forms as impermeable layer leading sandy clay sand and gravel layers beneath this layer as confined aquifer layers from 66 9 to 147 7 m from the surface ves4 situates in the sand bar deposit which mapped previously by culshaw et al 1979 as the result 20 m thick of sand layers are discovered at this location as revealed in bh28 see fig 2a located within 300 m to ves4 clayey sand is interpreted from surface to 4 m beneath surface and silty clay as the aquitard layer just below clayey sand strata from 4 to 6 m the thickness clayey sand layers are interpreted from 6 to 20 47 m and they are recognised as aquifer layers which also found in bh28 as sand layers at this ves point clay layer as an impermeable layer reveals and it leads the clayey sand layer below the impermeable layer as a confined aquifer ves5 takes place in upstream of the krueng aceh basin approximately 17 km from coastline and within 1 6 km to bh42 clayey silt is formed on the surface on this area up to 1 5 m beneath surface followed by silty clay layer acting as an aquitard layer from 1 5 to 8 9 m this aquitard layer contains the groundwater nevertheless the aquitard layer has low transmissivity and permeability beneath the aquitard layer the enormous thickness of sand layers are found and it indicates as the aquifer layers followed by gravel strata the evidence of thick sand and gravel layers are also reveal in bh42 as can be seen in fig 2c in cross section c c the low resistivity value of sands and gravel indicated these layers as a high potential groundwater layer see fig 3 ves6 situates in far upstream it approximately 1 34 km to the south east of bh44 where it as the end of cross section c c see fig 2c due to this fact this ves point is not illustrated in the cross section nonetheless there is still a possibility to develop a correlation between ves6 and bh44 clayey silt layer is discovered on the surface to 1 5 m depth followed by silty clay layers recognised as an aquitard layer by 26 m of thickness this aquitard contains a small amount groundwater however it can fulfill the community needs like drinking water and other purposes beneath the aquitard layer the aquifer layers are located from 27 3 to 144 6 m composing of gravels which also evidenced in bh44 in fact according to bh44 from around 30 to 100 m interbedding layers between clays and gravels are notices yet the resistivity considers those layers as one homogenous layer and it acceptable due to the homogenous principle in ves measurement ves measurements reveal low resistivity values in the range of 1 4 74 ωm expressing all those layers clays silts sands and gravels potentially contain groundwater however every layer has different transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity in transporting groundwater furthermore the study area is located in tropical countries with a high amount precipitation almost every year based on this fact it can conclude that sand and gravel layer which revealed in the subsurface from borehole data signal to groundwater layers 4 2 2 sand to clay ratio sand to clay ratio represents the sediment composition beneath the surface as a result it is related to the depositional environment of these sediments in the past and the potential zone of groundwater in each borehole this study examines the thickness of the sands layer and compares it to the clay layer at the depth 0 to 50 m 50 to 100 m and below 100 m the arcgis software utilizes to generate interpolation analysis as a result the sand to clay distribution possible to map as shown in fig 4 a and b and c a distribution sands to clays ratio from surface to 50 m b sands to clays ratio from 50 to 100 m c sands to clays ratio from 100 to 150 m beneath surface the location of the fault line referred to bennet et al 1981 and digital elevation model dataset from nasa 2007 the sand to clay ratio for surface until 50 m shows that at some locations the ratio reaches 0 7 0 8 at the centre part of the basin this zone is interpreted as the rich shallow groundwater zone see fig 4a the shallow groundwater is profoundly influenced by climate and rainy season the existing thick sand deposit strata and thin clay in the surface in bh42 as well as the gravel sand and silt deposit in bh43 make this zone a rich shallow groundwater zone the thick sand deposit beneath bh42 and bh43 was predicted to be formed in the late pleistocene epoch it is associated with indrapuri formation known as the old terrace in krueng aceh basin in darussalam city the sands to clays ratio are in the range of 0 5 0 7 and continue to north east in some portions of the basin the sand to clay was 0 3 0 5 however the 0 1 0 3 ratio mostly dominated in the krueng aceh basin the small number of sand to clay ratio on shallow groundwater does not mean this basin groundwater is sufficient there are thin sand strata found in every cross section see fig 2 it is related to shallow groundwater and commonly consumed by the community living around the basin from a very shallow dug well and it depends on the rainy season the medium groundwater prospect begins from 50 to 100 m beneath msl as illustrated in fig 4b in the centre part of the basin this research found a large area of 0 5 0 9 sand to clay ratio this zone becomes the source of groundwater in the basin and it has to be protected from contaminant and over extraction the potential groundwater zone is situated far away from the coastline accordingly this groundwater may produce freshwater which is suitable for consumption and support for future generation nevertheless the lower sand to clay ratio in the range of 0 0 3 still found at this particular depth and it was mostly located near the shoreline and western part of the basin where clays dominated the lithology in the subsurface the deep groundwater which begins below 100 m as illustrated in fig 4c showed a high ratio in the centre of basin compared to the western part this type of aquifer has a high sand to clay ratio in the range of 0 3 0 5 and potential for support future generation people who live in the krueng aceh basin consumed the shallow groundwater from dug wells due to the increasing number of the population people begin to extract medium and deep groundwater in the krueng aceh basin accordingly this resource of water should be protected by a sustainable development plan recently many medium to deep wells has been built in the krueng aceh basin to extract groundwater for personal communities and daily business purposes in order to protect the water supply for the future generation the centre part of the basin should be free from industrial activities industrial activities might contaminate groundwater also this upstream zone also becomes a recharge zone for groundwater in the krueng aceh basin 5 conclusions thirty borehole data indicate a substantial information regarding lithology of sediment beneath the krueng aceh basin which were consist of gravels sands silt clays peats and a combination between those materials this research reveals that the older sediment in this basin formed in the early pleistocene epoch at the similar time with lgm event which played an essential role in the sedimentation process in the krueng aceh basin by increasing sea level from early pleistocene to middle and late pleistocene various interbedding strata between gravel sand and clays developed respectively in this basin thus the historical sea level fluctuation has a high correlation with sedimentation process in krueng aceh basin which shown by the deeper sediment at 160 m in subsurface that can be concluded to be formed in middle pleistocene epoch the gravels sands and silt strata in the krueng aceh basin contain groundwater and become the water resources for communities who live around the basin these groundwater layers have been proved by six ves data which denote the lower resistivity strata 1 4 74 ωm interpreted as aquifer layers see table 2 those aquifer layers have different physical characteristics regarding transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity because they have different grain sizes besides the krueng aceh basin is situated in a tropical region where the amount of precipitation is high and it occurs almost every year hence all gravels sand and silt layers found from boreholes are potentially become aquifer layer in krueng aceh basin the spatial analysis of sand to clay ratio reveals that the area with 0 7 0 9 ratios are interpreted as the groundwater zone was situated in the upstream part of basin accordingly this zone should be protected by the local government groundwater protection for the future generation is an important task to be completed by the local government in the krueng aceh basin these maps will be distributed to local governments to assist them in the development plan of the krueng aceh basin particularly for protecting the groundwater resources in the future a dense boreholes data analysis should be performed to produces more detailed sediment lithology acknowledgment the authors would like to express their gratitude to the mining and energy resources agency of aceh government for providing boreholes data in the krueng aceh basin this research will not be completed without administration support from the department of geological engineering engineering faculty universitas syiah kuala appendix a

dry season december to february the long term mean annual rainfall is over 2000 mm and nearly 80 90 occurs during monsoon period banglapedia 2018 mean monthly rainfall during this period is between 300 and 450 mm monthly average temperatures range between 25 and 31 c while average humidity and evaporation range between 80 and 90 and 80 130 mm respectively bmd 2016 from quite long time the city faces problems related to water logging drainage congestions untreated waste disposal pollution and change in the hydrogeological system rahman et al 2013 islam and azam 2015 islam et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019a b 2 2 hydrogeology and groundwater recharge dhaka city area is characterized by quaternary alluvial sequences of the madhupur tract which is an elevated pleistocene terrace that surrounds floodplains of the jamuna ganges and meghna rivers hoque 2004 rahman et al 2013 the primary aquifer of dhaka city consists of unconsolidated sediments of the dupi tila formation which are overlain by the modhupur clay an approximately 48 m thick aquitard ahmed et al 1999 the dupi tila formation is mainly composed of fine to coarse grained micaceous quartzofeldspathic sands burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 bodrudd doza et al 2019a although the aquifer is relatively homogenous but hydro structurally complex as it is bounded by active tectonic structures and number of faults that affect the aquifer river systems hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 historically groundwater flow of this area was controlled by these boundary faults and flow was directed towards the south and southeast of the city ahmed et al 1999 dwasa 2006 burgess et al 2011 locally the groundwater obtained form underlying fluvio deltaic sands of the highly productive dupi tila aquifers which reported to be around 140 m thick morris et al 2003 bodrud doza et al 2019a intensive groundwater extraction from this aquifer resulted the changes of groundwater flow direction and creates a wide cone of depression hoque et al 2007 burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 the depth of groundwater level is comparatively higher in south western part of the city due to massive extraction meanwhile comparatively less extraction occurred from northern part of the city fig 2 the exact recharge mechanism of the aquifers at this area is yet to be explored and difficult to quantify morris et al 2003 burgess et al 2011 generally recharge rate of the aquifers depends on the runoff characteristics and vertical percolation of water from low lying areas and surface water bodies ahmed et al 1999 bodrud doza et al 2019a but due to urbanization water retention areas and natural drainage paths are reduced and it was estimated that in the period of 1966 1997 about 20 recharge rate is decreased in dupi tila aquifer burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 however geospatial techniques with landscape metrics were applied to identify the land use pattern of the city area where land use metrics was calculated by pixel by pixel basis based on the landset 8 oli satellite image march 2015 of dhaka city five distinct land use cover i e water bodies built up bare soil landfill vegetation and lowlands wetland cultivated land were identified and present in fig 1 it was found that almost 50 95 area is used for built up area where only 8 49 area covers water bodies in study area which may have influence on groundwater level moreover natural recharge leakage from water supply network and storm drainage system contributes to vertical recharge in this area van wonderen 2003 burgess et al 2011 it is also predicted that around 25 30 recharge of dhaka city area are contributed from leakage of sewage system which pose a serious threat for aquifer contamination hoque 2004 bodrud doza et al 2019b 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analysis a total of 23 groundwater samples were collected from the pre selected sampling points fig 1 of dhaka city area since april 2016 the depths of the wells were varied from 57 91 to 320 04 m these 23 representative sampling sites were selected by fishnet method combination with zonal and block statistic to identify the locations of similar sampling areas caliński and kageyama 2000 raghavarao and padgett 2005 geographical location of the selected wells was determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well was pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained us geological survey 2006 groundwater samples were collected using different methods based on purpose of analysis i e a filtered through pre combusted 470 c for 4 h 0 45 μm whatman gf c glass ﬁber ﬁlters for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon maie et al 2005 b filtered and acidified with supra pure 0 7 n hno3 to reach a ph 2 for the analyses of trace elements and c filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter for the analysis of anions followed by bhattacharya et al 2002 the samples were collected in high density polypropylene bottles rinsed with 1 hno3 and washed with distilled water the ph meter model sensiontm1 hach international usa was used to measure ph total dissolved solids tds and electric conductivity ec were measured using portable devices hanna hi8734 romania for tds and hanna hi8033 romania for ec for trace metal determination water samples were digested with concentrated hno3 acid as described by apha 2005 in this study the air acetylene flame was utilized with atomic absorption spectrophotometer spectraa 55 b varian for the detection of fe mn and zn the instrument was linearly calibrated with standards before use triplicate analysis of 10 of all samples and analysis of check standards for every 10 samples were performed to assess measurement error and to check for accuracy and precision of measurement technique the minimum detection limits mlds in μg l of metals in the analysed samples were 15 fe 5 mn and 8 zn the concentrations of anions f and no3 were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 usa using ionpac gard columns ag 11 hc and ionpac as11 hc analytical columns in filtered groundwater samples the instrument was calibrated with seven anion ii standard the accuracy and precision of analyses were tested through running duplicate analyses on selected samples samples were diluted several times and the relative standard deviation of measured major anions was found to be within 3 the limit of detection lod in mg ml of anions in the analysed groundwater samples were 0 055 f and 0 317 no3 3 2 statistical analysis multivariate statistical techniques i e principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were used in this study to determine the relationship among variables to categorize the important factors and sources responsible for groundwater quality by using spss version 22 0 software pca transforms the original variables of a data set into new uncorrelated variables or axes known as the principal components pcs which are linear combinations of the original variables shrestha and kazama 2007 bhuiyan et al 2011 this technique is widely used to reduce data and to extract a small number of latent factors for analysing relationships among the observed variables bodrud doza et al 2016 islam et al 2018 the principal components pcs can be expressed as singh et al 2005 1 z i j a i 1 x 1 j a i 2 x 2 j a i m x m j where z stands for the component score a i j m and x are the component loading component number sample number total number of variables and the measured values of variables respectively pca was performed to extract principal components pcs from the sampling points and to evaluate spatial variations and possible source of pollution in groundwater ca is applied for further classify the elements of different sources on the basis of similarities within a class and dissimilarities between different classes lattin et al 2003 bhuiyan et al 2016 hierarchical agglomerative clustering is the most popular approach which provides intuitive similarity relationships between any one sample and the entire data set and can be illustrated by a dendrogram mckenna 2003 the dendrogram provides a visual summary of the clustering processes presenting a picture of the groups and their proximity with a dramatic reduction in dimensionality of the original data bodrud doza et al 2016 in this study ward s method lattin et al 2003 with squared euclidean distances are used which can be expressed by following 2 d i j 2 k 1 n z i k z j k 2 3 z i k x i k u k σ k where d i j 2 donates the squared euclidean distance between object i and object j and z i k and z j k are the normalized values for variable k for k 1 n which reduces the effects of differences in measurement units and renders the data dimensionless also x i k is the measured value u k is the average value and σk is standard deviation of the variable k 3 3 human health risk assessment health risk assessment is the estimation of probability of any given magnitude of adverse health effects within a specific time period bortey sam et al 2015 this assessment is usually based on the risk level determination and expressed by carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risk usepa 2009 both oral and dermal exposure pathway were considered for the assessment and the chronic daily intake cdi of elements were calculated by the followings models usepa 1989 wu et al 2009 karim 2011 4 c d i o r a l c w i r e f e d b w a t 5 c d i d e r m a l c w s a

evaluate the non carcinogenic health risk for exposure to contaminants hazard quotient hq were also calculated for both oral and dermal pathway according to usepa 1989 if the value of hq exceeds 1 there is an unacceptable risk of adverse non carcinogenic effects on health while if the hq is less than 1 it was considered an acceptable level usepa 2001 giri and singh 2015 6 h q c d i r f d where rfd is the reference dose of a specific contaminant μg kg day considered from risk based concentration table usepa 1999 to assess the overall potential for non carcinogenic effects posed by more than one chemical the hqs calculated for each chemical are summed and expressed as hazard index hi usepa 1989 are following 7 h i h q 1 h q 2 h q n if hi does not exceed unity hi 1 no chronic risks were assumed to occur at the site and if hi 1 it implies that the non carcinogenic health risk usepa 1989 yang et al 2012 3 4 spatial analysis inverse distance weighted idw method of arcgis version 10 1 was applied in this study for spatial analysis the idw method estimates the values of an attribute at un sampled points using a linear combination of values at sampled points weighted by an inverse function of the distance from the point of interest to the sampled points the assumption is that sampled points closer to the un sampled point are more similar to it than those further away in their values the weights can be expressed as following 8 λ i 1 d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where d i is the distance between x 0 and x i p is a power parameter and n represents the number of sampled points used for the estimation the main factor affecting the accuracy of idw is the value of the power parameter the choice of power parameter and neighborhood size is arbitrary webster and oliver 2001 islam et al 2017b the most popular choice of p is 2 and the resulting method is often called inverse square distance or inverse distance squared ids 4 results and discussions 4 1 general characteristics of groundwater the summary of the measured parameters of groundwater samples and comparison with others studies and standard permissible limits are presents in table 2 according to the results ph of the groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline in nature ranging from 6 66 to 8 19 with a mean value of 7 32 generally ph indicates the strength of the water to react with the acidic or alkaline material presents in water islam et al 2017c ahmed et al 2019 ec is considered as one of the important parameters to classify the drinking water quality subramani et al 2005 the ec of the water samples ranges from 55 to 353 μs cm with a mean of 120 64 μs cm this mean values lies within the permissible limit recommended by us geological survey 2006 and who 2011 for drinking purpose table 2 subsequently tds has an average value of 72 22 mg l that ranges from 32 9 to 211 0 mg l according to who 2011 recommendation tds up to 500 mg l is the highest desirable limit and up to 1000 mg l is maximum permissible suggested by doe 1997 bangladesh standard all the samples of the study area fall within the range of permissible limit the mean value of fe is 208 37 μg l with the highest value of 737 00 μg l generally the concentration of fe in water gives aesthetic problems to water consumers mondal et al 2010 however fe concentration of groundwater samples falls beyond the bangladesh standard 300 1000 μg l doe 1997 and nearly 26 samples exceed the who 2011 us geological survey 2006 and indian standard 2012 while almost 39 exceed the eu european community 1998 standard except narayanganj and sylhet city the concentration of fe is much lower than others city presented in table 2 again the highest concentration of mn in groundwater was found 193 4 μg l with an average value of 57 57 μg l table 2 though most of the samples shows the concentration level below doe 1997 who 2011 and indian standard 2012 but 43 samples exceed the permissible limit of eu european community 1998 and us geological survey 2006 standard for drinking water but the mn concentrations of dhaka city is lower than the other cities of bangladesh i e rangpur rajshahi lakshmipur and gupalganj but higher than narayanganj and faridpur table 2 the concentrations of zn in groundwater samples are very low the maximum concentration is 166 4 μg l with an average value of 21 007 μg l which fall within the global standard limit table 2 except narayanganj and rajshahi the concentrations of zn are lower than the others city presented in table 2 the maximum allowable limit of f by doe 1997 in groundwater is 1000 μg l and all the samples fall within the permissible limit the maximum concentration of no3 is 29645 40 μg l 29 65 mg l with an average value and standard deviation of 3582 33 μg l 3 58 mg l and 6335 89 table 2 maximum allowable limit of no3 concentration in groundwater is 10000 μg l as per the doe 1997 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit except one sample s5 4 2 pollution source and factors controlling groundwater quality principal component analysis pca was performed on the groundwater quality data using varimax rotation with kaiser normalization varimax rotation is used to maximize the sum of variance of the factor coefficients which better explains the possible sources that influence water systems gotelli and ellison 2004 and previously used by many researcher e g bhuiyan et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 islam et al 2017a and bodrud doza et al 2019a however pca was used to elucidate the observed relationship of cluster variables in simple ways expressed in the patterns of variance and covariance between the variable and similarities between observations three factors were extracted for groundwater data sets based on eigenvalues more than 1 which represented 73 58 of total variance in study area the scree plot is used to identify the number of pcs to be retained to understand the underlying parameters structure fig 3 a the calculated factor loadings together with cumulative percentage and percentages of variance are explained by each factor are presented in table 3 the positive and negative scores in pca indicate that most of the water samples are either essentially affected or unaffected by the presence of extracted loads on a specific factor component respectively bhuiyan et al 2016 about 73 58 of the total variance is represented in the three loading factors in groundwater samples fig 3b in this study the pc1 pc2 and pc3 for groundwater quality data were elucidated the total variance of 37 79 19 41 and 16 37 respectively table 3 study also revealed that pc1 in the data sets explained 37 79 of total variance and it was positively loaded with ec tds f and ph which mostly distributed in s5 s15 s16 and s21 indicates geogenic hydro geochemical evolution of groundwater by rock water interaction with ions exchange bodrud doza et al 2016 bhutiani et al 2016 the pc2 in the data sets explained 19 41 of total variance and positively loaded with fe mn zn which significantly distributed in the samples of s1 s4 s8 s9 and s10 table 3 pc2 explains leaching of materials from soil horizon to the aquifer which are basically trace elements and are regarded as nonpoint pollutant sources along with partial natural weathering processes bhuiyan et al 2016 fe is one of the metals having abundant crustal presence it was concluded that this factor was geogenic in nature omo irabor et al 2008 bhutiani et al 2016 ahmed et al 2019 generally mn occurs naturally as a mineral from sedimentary rocks or from mining and industrial wastes bhuiyan et al 2011 2016 where zn is from geogenic processes augmented through human induced activities such as industrial wastes fertilizers and agrochemicals bhuiyan et al 2011 bodrud doza et al 2016 barzegar et al 2019 several industries i e textiles pharmaceuticals tannery paper mills steel re rolling mills and oil refineries are located surrounding the dhaka city which might be responsible for such pollutants islam and azam 2015 islam and huda 2016 pc3 accounting for 16 37 of total variance is loaded with no3 which widely distributed in samples s5 s7 s15 and s16 table 3 and assumed that may generate from domestic and agricultural wastes in the peripheral areas bleifuss et al 2002 barzegar et al 2019 in this study ca results strongly matched with the pca results generally parameters belonging to the same cluster were likely to have originated from same source bhuiyan et al 2016 the r mode ca retains three main clusters for analysed parameters fig 4 a and cluster 1 includes ec tds f and ph cluster 2 consists of no3 and cluster 3 includes fe mn and zn reflecting the influence of domestic and industrial pollution omo irabor et al 2008 q mode ca has been applied to detect the spatial similarities and site grouping among the sampling points particular group shows similar characteristics with respect to the analysed parameters and the 23 sampling sites categorized in three clusters fig 4b cluster 1 consists of 11 sampling points are s1 s2 s3 s5 s7 s15 s16 s17 s19 s20 and s23 cluster 2 includes only 5 sampling sites are s11 s12 s13 s18 s21 and cluster 3 consists of 7 sampling sites are s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 and s22 fig 4b it was found that r mode cluster 3 consist of fe mn and zn which highly distributed at the sampling sites s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 and s22 all of these sampling points lies in the south western part of the city fig 1 4 3 human health risk human health risk of groundwater through the exposure of oral and dermal routes for adults and children are summarised in table 4 the calculated average cdi values for oral ingestion and dermal absorption for adult and children were found in the following order no3 f fe mn zn non carcinogenic health effects of different trace metals fe mn and zn and anions f and no3 were determined by calculating the hazard quotient hq hq 1 suggested the probability of adverse health effects leung and jiao 2006 giri and singh 2015 however the average value of hq indicated that the concentration of these trace metals and anions might pose little health effects to the inhabitants both adult and children of dhaka city via oral ingestion and dermal absorption of groundwater wu et al 2009 and karim 2011 also reported that hqs of trace metals in drinking water were lower than the unity which suggesting that these pollutants could pose minimum hazard to local residents hq dermal were found lower than the hq oral value in both cases indicates groundwater consumption via oral route create more harm than dermal exposure highest hq oral values of fe mn zn f and no3 was found in s1 s15 s8 s21 and s5 sampling sites respectively for both adult and children hq oral for children greater than 1 in the s5 and s21 sampling sites for f and no3 raising concern about the non carcinogenic adverse health effects of drinking water the highest hq dermal values of fe mn zn and no3 were also found in s1 s15 s8 and s5 sampling sites respectively and hq dermal 1 in all sampling sites for adult and children hazard index hi was also calculated considering the additive effect of trace metals and anions hi oral 1 value was found in the sampling sites s5 s15 and s21 with an average value of 0 708 raised concern about the non carcinogenic health risk of children due to consumption of groundwater for long times children are especially vulnerable to acute sub acute and chronic effects of ingestion of chemical pollutants since children consume more per unit of body weight than adults enhis european environment and health information system 2007 the highest hi oral value was found at s21 sampling site whereas s15 sampling site representing the height hi dermal value for both adult and children the hi oral value of children was greater than 1 at the s5 s15 and s21 sampling sites indicating potential health risk to the child due to consumption of the groundwater and these locations either have unusual geological enrichment or are under heavy anthropogenic influence similar studies were done by many researchers all over the world although the findings are quite different which depend on the characteristics of groundwater and consumption behaviour yang et al 2012 wongsasuluk et al 2014 giri and singh 2015 bhutiani et al 2016 nkpaa et al 2018 barzegar et al 2019 4 4 risk control measures for sustainable water supply the goal of risk control is to reduce the health risks posed by potable water that is attainable with various effective and feasible techniques to take control measures for safe and sustainable water supply it is very essential to identify the hazardous components and contaminated areas for the better understanding of oral ingestion and dermal absorption hazard index hi in study sites for adult and children were interpolated using inverse distance weighting idw technique these analyses showed that the highest hi oral values had been marked at the eastern part of the study area especially at s21 sampling site for both adult and children fig 5 a and b whereas moderate hi oral values was found at the central western part for adults fig 5a most of the study area was recognized as moderate hi oral values for children fig 5b the interpolation map of hi dermal demonstrated a similar pattern for both adult and children fig 5c and d the south western part of the study area is identified as the vulnerable zone for public health issue which may be contaminated due to the recharge from buriganga river buriganga is one of the most contaminated river in dhaka city due to dumping of industrial and sewerage waste bhuiyan et al 2015 islam and azam 2015 rahman and islam 2016 ahammed et al 2016 groundwater in the vicinity of the buriganga is influenced by the leakage of contaminated surface water darling et al 2002 ahmed et al 2010 besides others peripheral rivers and water bodies also contaminated by industrial and sewerage wastes which may also enhance the contamination of aquifers moreover hoque 2004 found groundwater of dhaka city area is also contaminated by recharge from leakage of sewage line though the groundwater quality of dupi tila aquifers is till good but it is now contaminated in distribution system and by recharge due to excess withdrawal and rapid urbanization changes of drainage pattern reduces groundwater recharge which might create the threat for groundwater contamination burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 hossain et al 2018 ahmed et al 2010 found that due to limited monitoring the concentration of electrical conductivity chloride and nitrate has increased in groundwater of dhaka city over time again sultana 2009 identified the groundwater chemistry of this area has been altered by anthropogenic processes considering these facts and based on the structural features of the groundwater system risk control measures for high vulnerable areas should take alternative method to develop groundwater resources in dhaka city in this regards managed aquifer recharge mar proposed by rahman et al 2013 would be the perfect one which was successfully implemented in many countries i e usa australia israel and germany dillon et al 2009 actually controlling groundwater health risks is a complex phenomenon not only does it require the adoption and adjustment of technologies to local conditions but it also demands strict management of the implementation of these measures to protect the balance of the groundwater system zhu et al 2019 in this regards institutional capacity building related to water institute of dhaka city i e department of environment doe dhaka city corporation north and south rajdhani unnayan kartipakha rajuk dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa bangladesh water development board bwdb department of public health engineering dphe bangladesh inland water transport authority biwta ministry of industry ministry of land and the ministry of water resources must adopted trace pollutants in the groundwater which introduced by human activities should carefully controlled and legal enforcement should implement another important thing is as children are more vulnerable due to oral and dermal exposure so proper care i e filtration or others suitable treatment option should adopt moreover it is necessary to strengthen public awareness of these health risks and improve prevention methods to control risk 5 conclusions groundwater of the dhaka city the capital of bangladesh was investigated to analyze the health risk due to oral and dermal exposure results evident the slight quality deterioration of groundwater including acidic to alkaline ph and high fe and mn concentration exceeding standard permissible limits from pca and ca it was found that different anthropogenic activities along with rock water interaction and ion exchange play a significant role on groundwater quality however chronic health effects of trace metals fe mn zn and anions f no3 via both oral and dermal exposure revealed that children are comparatively in high health risk via oral consumption than adult and even dermal exposure spatial analysis of the risk indices showed that highest hi oral values for adult and children were found in south western margin while moderate hi oral value was found in central western part for adult most of the study area possessed moderate hi oral value for children hi dermal values also exhibited the similar distribution pattern for both adult and children so proper monitoring system should implement to control the pollution moreover identify alternative source of drinking water introduce proper treatment system and groundwater management policy is now time demanding needs for dhaka city to reduce the health risk of city dwellers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

recognize md morshedul haque from department of environmental sciences jahangirnagar university for his diligent effort during the sampling period 
12178,accessing safe drinking water is an essential and primary human needs this study conducted to investigate the suitability of groundwater use in dhaka city dwellers factors affecting groundwater quality and human health risk to initiate the control measures in this regards groundwater samples were collected and analysed for ph ec tds fe mn zn f and no3 the results revealed that groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline and in some samples fe and mn concentrations exceed the standard permissible limits principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were performed to identify the pollution source and controlling factors which revealed quality of the groundwater mainly controlled by geological and several anthropogenic actions however chronic health risk of metals and anions exposure via oral and dermal routes were further determined by calculating the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi for both adult and children results suggest that children of the study area are under health risk due to consumption of groundwater for long times without further treatment however from the interpolated maps of hi south western part of the study area is identified as the vulnerable zone for public health issue it is expected that outcomes of this study will provide useful insights for safe water supply for the city dwellers and sustainable management of groundwater resources to reduce the human hazards graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater trace elements chronic health risk multivariate statistics dhaka city 1 introduction groundwater is one of the important resources that plays a vital role for lives and livelihood as well as in economic growth of a country like bangladesh generally quality of groundwater depends on the existence and concentrations of various chemical components which influenced by the recharge and geological characteristics of the aquifer selvakumar et al 2017 parameswari and padmini 2018 due to industrial influence and rapid urbanization groundwater is now in threatened conditions kumar et al 2017 vetrimurugan et al 2017 moreover groundwater also contaminated by various trace elements derived from erosion and weathering of rocks wastewater discharges mines agricultural activities leakage into the groundwater supplies from heavily contaminated areas and geothermal waters giri and singh 2015 selvam et al 2017 ahmed et al 2019 these contaminants pose serious health risk due to their toxicity persistence and carcinogenic nature krishna and mohan 2014 naz et al 2016 many scientists

rasool et al 2016 tabassum et al 2019 south africa elumalai et al 2017 and turkey çelebi et al 2014 although some trace elements are essential for human body but high intakes of these elements may result in adverse health effects like shortness of breath cancer hypertension vascular disease lung disease gastrointestinal bleeding neurological disorder and reproductive effects zhang et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 islam et al 2017c nkpaa et al 2018 consumption of excessive amount of fe could lead to hemachromatosis a severe disease that can destroy the different body organs who 2003 other symptoms i e fatigue loss of weight and joint pain also could occur due to excessive presence of fe in drinking water karen 2017 ahmed et al 2019 moreover high concentration of mn consumption through drinking water for long times may create neurological disorder who 2011 mn is also unlikely responsible for cancer or reproductive damage usepa 2004 again large amount of zn exposure via drinking pathway may lead to stomach cramps nausea or vomiting ingestion of high level of zn for few months may also cause anemia damage to the pancreas and reduction of high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol who 2003 consumption of f from groundwater has both positive and negative effects on human health which mainly derived from fluoride bearing minerals thivya et al 2017 mohanta et al 2020 high amount of f intake can lead to dental fluorosis as well as damage to the skeletal tissues called skeletal fluorosis who 2004 no3 is another most common contaminants in groundwater and excessive

300 and 450 mm monthly average temperatures range between 25 and 31 c while average humidity and evaporation range between 80 and 90 and 80 130 mm respectively bmd 2016 from quite long time the city faces problems related to water logging drainage congestions untreated waste disposal pollution and change in the hydrogeological system rahman et al 2013 islam and azam 2015 islam et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019a b 2 2 hydrogeology and groundwater recharge dhaka city area is characterized by quaternary alluvial sequences of the madhupur tract which is an elevated pleistocene terrace that surrounds floodplains of the jamuna ganges and meghna rivers hoque 2004 rahman et al 2013 the primary aquifer of dhaka city consists of unconsolidated sediments of the dupi tila formation which are overlain by the modhupur clay an approximately 48 m thick aquitard ahmed et al 1999 the dupi tila formation is mainly composed of fine to coarse grained micaceous quartzofeldspathic sands burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 bodrudd doza et al 2019a although the aquifer is relatively homogenous but hydro structurally complex as it is bounded by active tectonic structures and number of faults that affect the aquifer river systems hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 historically groundwater flow of this area was controlled by these boundary faults and flow was directed towards the south and southeast of the city ahmed et al 1999 dwasa 2006 burgess et al 2011 locally the groundwater obtained form underlying fluvio deltaic sands of the highly productive dupi tila aquifers which reported to be around 140 m thick morris et al 2003 bodrud doza et al 2019a intensive groundwater extraction from this aquifer resulted the changes of groundwater flow direction and creates a wide cone of depression hoque et al 2007 burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 the depth of groundwater level is comparatively higher in south western part of the city due to massive extraction meanwhile comparatively less extraction occurred from northern part of the city fig 2 the exact recharge mechanism of the aquifers at this area is yet to be explored and difficult to quantify morris et al 2003 burgess et al 2011 generally recharge rate of the aquifers depends on the runoff characteristics and vertical percolation of water from low lying areas and surface water bodies ahmed et al 1999 bodrud doza et al 2019a but due to urbanization water retention areas and natural drainage paths are reduced and it was estimated that in the period of 1966 1997 about 20 recharge rate is decreased in dupi tila aquifer burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 however geospatial techniques with landscape metrics were applied to identify the land use pattern of the city area where land use metrics was calculated by pixel by pixel basis based on the landset 8 oli satellite image march 2015 of dhaka city five distinct land use cover i e water bodies built up bare soil landfill vegetation and lowlands wetland cultivated land were identified and present in fig 1 it was found that almost 50 95 area is used for built up area where only 8 49 area covers water bodies in study area which may have influence on groundwater level moreover natural recharge leakage from water supply network and storm drainage system contributes to vertical recharge in this area van wonderen 2003 burgess et al 2011 it is also predicted that around 25 30 recharge of dhaka city area are contributed from leakage of sewage system which pose a serious threat for aquifer contamination hoque 2004 bodrud doza et al 2019b 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analysis a total of 23 groundwater samples were collected from the pre selected sampling points fig 1 of dhaka city area since april 2016 the depths of the wells were varied from 57 91 to 320 04 m these 23 representative sampling sites were selected by fishnet method combination with zonal and block statistic to identify the locations of similar sampling areas caliński and kageyama 2000 raghavarao and padgett 2005 geographical location of the selected wells was determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well was pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained us geological survey 2006 groundwater samples were collected using different methods based on purpose of analysis i e a filtered through pre combusted 470 c for 4 h 0 45 μm whatman gf c glass ﬁber ﬁlters for the analysis of dissolved organic carbon maie et al 2005 b filtered and acidified with supra pure 0 7 n hno3 to reach a ph 2 for the analyses of trace elements and c filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter for the analysis of anions followed by bhattacharya et al 2002 the samples were collected in high density polypropylene bottles rinsed with 1 hno3 and washed with distilled water the ph meter model sensiontm1 hach international usa was used to measure ph total dissolved solids tds and electric conductivity ec were measured using portable devices hanna hi8734 romania for tds and hanna hi8033 romania for ec for trace metal determination water samples were digested with concentrated hno3 acid as described by apha 2005 in this study the air acetylene flame was utilized with atomic absorption spectrophotometer spectraa 55 b varian for the detection of fe mn and zn the instrument was linearly calibrated with standards before use triplicate analysis of 10 of all samples and analysis of check standards for every 10 samples were performed to assess measurement error and to check for accuracy and precision of measurement technique the minimum detection limits mlds in μg l of metals in the analysed samples were 15 fe 5 mn and 8 zn the concentrations of anions f and no3 were measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 usa using ionpac gard columns ag 11 hc and ionpac as11 hc analytical columns in filtered groundwater samples the instrument was calibrated with seven anion ii standard the accuracy and precision of analyses were tested through running duplicate analyses on selected samples samples were diluted several times and the relative standard deviation of measured major anions was found to be within 3 the limit of detection lod in mg ml of anions in the analysed groundwater samples were 0 055 f and 0 317 no3 3 2 statistical analysis multivariate statistical techniques i e principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were used in this study to determine the relationship among variables to categorize the important factors and sources responsible for groundwater quality by using spss version 22 0 software pca transforms the original variables of a data set into new uncorrelated variables or axes known as the principal components pcs which are linear combinations of the original variables shrestha and kazama 2007 bhuiyan et al 2011 this technique is widely used to reduce data and to extract a small number of latent factors for analysing relationships among the observed variables bodrud doza et al 2016 islam et al 2018 the principal components pcs can be expressed as singh et al 2005 1 z i j a i 1 x 1 j a i 2 x 2 j a i m x m j where z stands for the component score a i j m and x are the component loading component number sample number total number of variables and the measured values of variables respectively pca was performed to extract principal components pcs from the sampling points and to evaluate spatial variations and possible source of pollution in groundwater ca is applied for further classify the elements of different sources on the basis of similarities within a class and dissimilarities between different classes lattin et al 2003 bhuiyan et al 2016 hierarchical agglomerative clustering is the most popular approach which provides intuitive similarity relationships between any one sample and the entire data set and can be illustrated by a dendrogram mckenna 2003 the dendrogram provides a visual summary of the clustering processes presenting a picture of the groups and their proximity with a dramatic reduction in dimensionality of the original data bodrud doza et al 2016 in this study ward s method lattin et al 2003 with squared euclidean distances are used which can be expressed by following 2 d i j 2 k 1 n z i k z j k 2 3 z i k x i k u k σ k where d i j 2 donates the squared euclidean distance between object i and object j and z i k and z j k are the normalized values for variable k for k 1 n which reduces the effects of differences in measurement units and renders the data dimensionless also x i k is the measured value u k is the average value and σk is standard deviation of the variable k 3 3 human health risk assessment health risk assessment is the estimation of probability of any given magnitude of adverse health effects within a specific time period bortey sam et al 2015 this assessment is usually based on the risk level determination and expressed by carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risk usepa 2009 both oral and dermal exposure pathway were considered for the assessment and the chronic daily intake cdi of elements were calculated by the followings models usepa 1989 wu et al 2009 karim 2011 4 c d i o r a l c w i r e f e d b w a t 5 c d i d e r m a l c w s a

evaluate the non carcinogenic health risk for exposure to contaminants hazard quotient hq were also calculated for both oral and dermal pathway according to usepa 1989 if the value of hq exceeds 1 there is an unacceptable risk of adverse non carcinogenic effects on health while if the hq is less than 1 it was considered an acceptable level usepa 2001 giri and singh 2015 6 h q c d i r f d where rfd is the reference dose of a specific contaminant μg kg day considered from risk based concentration table usepa 1999 to assess the overall potential for non carcinogenic effects posed by more than one chemical the hqs calculated for each chemical are summed and expressed as hazard index hi usepa 1989 are following 7 h i h q 1 h q 2 h q n if hi does not exceed unity hi 1 no chronic risks were assumed to occur at the site and if hi 1 it implies that the non carcinogenic health risk usepa 1989 yang et al 2012 3 4 spatial analysis inverse distance weighted idw method of arcgis version 10 1 was applied in this study for spatial analysis the idw method estimates the values of an attribute at un sampled points using a linear combination of values at sampled points weighted by an inverse function of the distance from the point of interest to the sampled points the assumption is that sampled points closer to the un sampled point are more similar to it than those further away in their values the weights can be expressed as following 8 λ i 1 d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where d i is the distance between x 0 and x i p is a power parameter and n represents the number of sampled points used for the estimation the main factor affecting the accuracy of idw is the value of the power parameter the choice of power parameter and neighborhood size is arbitrary webster and oliver 2001 islam et al 2017b the most popular choice of p is 2 and the resulting method is often called inverse square distance or inverse distance squared ids 4 results and discussions 4 1 general characteristics of groundwater the summary of the measured parameters of groundwater samples and comparison with others studies and standard permissible limits are presents in table 2 according to the results ph of the groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline in nature ranging from 6 66 to 8 19 with a mean value of 7 32 generally ph indicates the strength of the water to react with the acidic or alkaline material presents in water islam et al 2017c ahmed et al 2019 ec is considered as one of the important parameters to classify the drinking water quality subramani et al 2005 the ec of the water samples ranges from 55 to 353 μs cm with a mean of 120 64 μs cm this mean values lies within the permissible limit recommended by us geological survey 2006 and who 2011 for drinking purpose table 2 subsequently tds has an average value of 72 22 mg l that ranges from 32 9 to 211 0 mg l according to who 2011 recommendation tds up to 500 mg l is the highest desirable limit and up to 1000 mg l is maximum permissible suggested by doe 1997 bangladesh standard all the samples of the study area fall within the range of permissible limit the mean value of fe is 208 37 μg l with the highest value of 737 00 μg l generally the concentration of fe in water gives aesthetic problems to water consumers mondal et al 2010 however fe concentration of groundwater samples falls beyond the bangladesh standard 300 1000 μg l doe 1997 and nearly 26 samples exceed the who 2011 us geological survey 2006 and indian standard 2012 while almost 39 exceed the eu european community 1998 standard except narayanganj and sylhet city the concentration of fe is much lower than others city presented in table 2 again the highest concentration of mn in groundwater was found 193 4 μg l with an average value of 57 57 μg l table 2 though most of the samples shows the concentration level below doe 1997 who 2011 and indian standard 2012 but 43 samples exceed the permissible limit of eu european community 1998 and us geological survey 2006 standard for drinking water but the mn concentrations of dhaka city is lower than the other cities of bangladesh i e rangpur rajshahi lakshmipur and gupalganj but higher than narayanganj and faridpur table 2 the concentrations of zn in groundwater samples are very low the maximum concentration is 166 4 μg l with an average value of 21 007 μg l which fall within the global standard limit table 2 except narayanganj and rajshahi the concentrations of zn are lower than the others city presented in table 2 the maximum allowable limit of f by doe 1997 in groundwater is 1000 μg l and all the samples fall within the permissible limit the maximum concentration of no3 is 29645 40 μg l 29 65 mg l with an average value and standard deviation of 3582 33 μg l 3 58 mg l and 6335 89 table 2 maximum allowable limit of no3 concentration in groundwater is 10000 μg l as per the doe 1997 and all the samples fall within the permissible limit except one sample s5 4 2 pollution source and factors controlling groundwater quality principal component analysis pca was performed on the groundwater quality data using varimax rotation with kaiser normalization varimax rotation is used to maximize the sum of variance of the factor coefficients which better explains the possible sources that influence water systems gotelli and ellison 2004 and previously used by many researcher e g bhuiyan et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 islam et al 2017a and bodrud doza et al 2019a however pca was used to elucidate the observed relationship of cluster variables in simple ways expressed in the patterns of variance and covariance between the variable and similarities between observations three factors were extracted for groundwater data sets based on eigenvalues more than 1 which represented 73 58 of total variance in study area the scree plot is used to identify the number of pcs to be retained to understand the underlying parameters structure fig 3 a the calculated factor loadings together with cumulative percentage and percentages of variance are explained by each factor are presented in table 3 the positive and negative scores in pca indicate that most of the water samples are either essentially affected or unaffected by the presence of extracted loads on a specific factor component respectively bhuiyan et al 2016 about 73 58 of the total variance is represented in the three loading factors in groundwater samples fig 3b in this study the pc1 pc2 and pc3 for groundwater quality data were elucidated the total variance of 37 79 19 41 and 16 37 respectively table 3 study also revealed that pc1 in the data sets explained 37 79 of total variance and it was positively loaded with ec tds f and ph which mostly distributed in s5 s15 s16 and s21 indicates geogenic hydro geochemical evolution of groundwater by rock water interaction with ions exchange bodrud doza et al 2016 bhutiani et al 2016 the pc2 in the data sets explained 19 41 of total variance and positively loaded with fe mn zn which significantly distributed in the samples of s1 s4 s8 s9 and s10 table 3 pc2 explains leaching of materials from soil horizon to the aquifer which are basically trace elements and are regarded as nonpoint pollutant sources along with partial natural weathering processes bhuiyan et al 2016 fe is one of the metals having abundant crustal presence it was concluded that this factor was geogenic in nature omo irabor et al 2008 bhutiani et al 2016 ahmed et al 2019 generally mn occurs naturally as a mineral from sedimentary rocks or from mining and industrial wastes bhuiyan et al 2011 2016 where zn is from geogenic processes augmented through human induced activities such as industrial wastes fertilizers and agrochemicals bhuiyan et al 2011 bodrud doza et al 2016 barzegar et al 2019 several industries i e textiles pharmaceuticals tannery paper mills steel re rolling mills and oil refineries are located surrounding the dhaka city which might be responsible for such pollutants islam and azam 2015 islam and huda 2016 pc3 accounting for 16 37 of total variance is loaded with no3 which widely distributed in samples s5 s7 s15 and s16 table 3 and assumed that may generate from domestic and agricultural wastes in the peripheral areas bleifuss et al 2002 barzegar et al 2019 in this study ca results strongly matched with the pca results generally parameters belonging to the same cluster were likely to have originated from same source bhuiyan et al 2016 the r mode ca retains three main clusters for analysed parameters fig 4 a and cluster 1 includes ec tds f and ph cluster 2 consists of no3 and cluster 3 includes fe mn and zn reflecting the influence of domestic and industrial pollution omo irabor et al 2008 q mode ca has been applied to detect the spatial similarities and site grouping among the sampling points particular group shows similar characteristics with respect to the analysed parameters and the 23 sampling sites categorized in three clusters fig 4b cluster 1 consists of 11 sampling points are s1 s2 s3 s5 s7 s15 s16 s17 s19 s20 and s23 cluster 2 includes only 5 sampling sites are s11 s12 s13 s18 s21 and cluster 3 consists of 7 sampling sites are s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 and s22 fig 4b it was found that r mode cluster 3 consist of fe mn and zn which highly distributed at the sampling sites s4 s6 s8 s9 s10 s14 and s22 all of these sampling points lies in the south western part of the city fig 1 4 3 human health risk human health risk of groundwater through the exposure of oral and dermal routes for adults and children are summarised in table 4 the calculated average cdi values for oral ingestion and dermal absorption for adult and children were found in the following order no3 f fe mn zn non carcinogenic health effects of different trace metals fe mn and zn and anions f and no3 were determined by calculating the hazard quotient hq hq 1 suggested the probability of adverse health effects leung and jiao 2006 giri and singh 2015 however the average value of hq indicated that the concentration of these trace metals and anions might pose little health effects to the inhabitants both adult and children of dhaka city via oral ingestion and dermal absorption of groundwater wu et al 2009 and karim 2011 also reported that hqs of trace metals in drinking water were lower than the unity which suggesting that these pollutants could pose minimum hazard to local residents hq dermal were found lower than the hq oral value in both cases indicates groundwater consumption via oral route create more harm than dermal exposure highest hq oral values of fe mn zn f and no3 was found in s1 s15 s8 s21 and s5 sampling sites respectively for both adult and children hq oral for children greater than 1 in the s5 and s21 sampling sites for f and no3 raising concern about the non carcinogenic adverse health effects of drinking water the highest hq dermal values of fe mn zn and no3 were also found in s1 s15 s8 and s5 sampling sites respectively and hq dermal 1 in all sampling sites for adult and children hazard index hi was also calculated considering the additive effect of trace metals and anions hi oral 1 value was found in the sampling sites s5 s15 and s21 with an average value of 0 708 raised concern about the non carcinogenic health risk of children due to consumption of groundwater for long times children are especially vulnerable to acute sub acute and chronic effects of ingestion of chemical pollutants since children consume more per unit of body weight than adults enhis european environment and health information system 2007 the highest hi oral value was found at s21 sampling site whereas s15 sampling site representing the height hi dermal value for both adult and children the hi oral value of children was greater than 1 at the s5 s15 and s21 sampling sites indicating potential health risk to the child due to consumption of the groundwater and these locations either have unusual geological enrichment or are under heavy anthropogenic influence similar studies were done by many researchers all over the world although the findings are quite different which depend on the characteristics of groundwater and consumption behaviour yang et al 2012 wongsasuluk et al 2014 giri and singh 2015 bhutiani et al 2016 nkpaa et al 2018 barzegar et al 2019 4 4 risk control measures for sustainable water supply the goal of risk control is to reduce the health risks posed by potable water that is attainable with various effective and feasible techniques to take control measures for safe and sustainable water supply it is very essential to identify the hazardous components and contaminated areas for the better understanding of oral ingestion and dermal absorption hazard index hi in study sites for adult and children were interpolated using inverse distance weighting idw technique these analyses showed that the highest hi oral values had been marked at the eastern part of the study area especially at s21 sampling site for both adult and children fig 5 a and b whereas moderate hi oral values was found at the central western part for adults fig 5a most of the study area was recognized as moderate hi oral values for children fig 5b the interpolation map of hi dermal demonstrated a similar pattern for both adult and children fig 5c and d the south western part of the study area is identified as the vulnerable zone for public health issue which may be contaminated due to the recharge from buriganga river buriganga is one of the most contaminated river in dhaka city due to dumping of industrial and sewerage waste bhuiyan et al 2015 islam and azam 2015 rahman and islam 2016 ahammed et al 2016 groundwater in the vicinity of the buriganga is influenced by the leakage of contaminated surface water darling et al 2002 ahmed et al 2010 besides others peripheral rivers and water bodies also contaminated by industrial and sewerage wastes which may also enhance the contamination of aquifers moreover hoque 2004 found groundwater of dhaka city area is also contaminated by recharge from leakage of sewage line though the groundwater quality of dupi tila aquifers is till good but it is now contaminated in distribution system and by recharge due to excess withdrawal and rapid urbanization changes of drainage pattern reduces groundwater recharge which might create the threat for groundwater contamination burgess et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 hossain et al 2018 ahmed et al 2010 found that due to limited monitoring the concentration of electrical conductivity chloride and nitrate has increased in groundwater of dhaka city over time again sultana 2009 identified the groundwater chemistry of this area has been altered by anthropogenic processes considering these facts and based on the structural features of the groundwater system risk control measures for high vulnerable areas should take alternative method to develop groundwater resources in dhaka city in this regards managed aquifer recharge mar proposed by rahman et al 2013 would be the perfect one which was successfully implemented in many countries i e usa australia israel and germany dillon et al 2009 actually controlling groundwater health risks is a complex phenomenon not only does it require the adoption and adjustment of technologies to local conditions but it also demands strict management of the implementation of these measures to protect the balance of the groundwater system zhu et al 2019 in this regards institutional capacity building related to water institute of dhaka city i e department of environment doe dhaka city corporation north and south rajdhani unnayan kartipakha rajuk dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa bangladesh water development board bwdb department of public health engineering dphe bangladesh inland water transport authority biwta ministry of industry ministry of land and the ministry of water resources must adopted trace pollutants in the groundwater which introduced by human activities should carefully controlled and legal enforcement should implement another important thing is as children are more vulnerable due to oral and dermal exposure so proper care i e filtration or others suitable treatment option should adopt moreover it is necessary to strengthen public awareness of these health risks and improve prevention methods to control risk 5 conclusions groundwater of the dhaka city the capital of bangladesh was investigated to analyze the health risk due to oral and dermal exposure results evident the slight quality deterioration of groundwater including acidic to alkaline ph and high fe and mn concentration exceeding standard permissible limits from pca and ca it was found that different anthropogenic activities along with rock water interaction and ion exchange play a significant role on groundwater quality however chronic health effects of trace metals fe mn zn and anions f no3 via both oral and dermal exposure revealed that children are comparatively in high health risk via oral consumption than adult and even dermal exposure spatial analysis of the risk indices showed that highest hi oral values for adult and children were found in south western margin while moderate hi oral value was found in central western part for adult most of the study area possessed moderate hi oral value for children hi dermal values also exhibited the similar distribution pattern for both adult and children so proper monitoring system should implement to control the pollution moreover identify alternative source of drinking water introduce proper treatment system and groundwater management policy is now time demanding needs for dhaka city to reduce the health risk of city

12179,the present study emphasizes the effectiveness of the integration of remote sensing gis and analytical hierarchy process ahp techniques in groundwater management specifically in the delineation of the groundwater potential zones gwpzs in this study various geoenvironmental factors such as lithology geomorphology land use land cover the density of lineaments and stream network slope and soil texture are used to identify the gwpzs and to classify the spatially distributed groundwater potential of the manimala river basin mrb a tropical river basin of the southern western ghats kerala state india a multi criteria decision analysis mcda is performed in arcgis using the weights of different themes generated by the ahp technique for the delineation of the gwpzs of the basin the results indicate that nearly 50 of the basin area mostly across the highlands and the midlands physiographic zones of the basin is characterized by moderate to poor groundwater potential whereas the very good potential zones extend across 20 of the basin area among the different geoenvironmental factors lithology lineament density and geomorphology have decisive roles in the occurrence of groundwater of the basin validation of the delineation of the gwpzs of the basin using the groundwater yield data of a limited number of dug wells underscores the efficiency of the integrated approach as well as the

bhanja et al 2017 using long term in situ monitoring 19 000 observation wells 1996 2014 and decadal 2003 2014 satellite based measurements observed a regional scale groundwater storage replenishment in the western and southern parts of india which is contrasting to the general consensus on groundwater depletion occurring across the country according to the estimates of cgwb 2017 the main source of replenishable groundwater resources of the country is recharge through rainfall where about 67 of the annual groundwater resources is being replenished through rainfall however owing to the spatial variability of the annual rainfall and the rate of groundwater extraction the groundwater development of the country also shows remarkable spatial variations although kerala state india is enriched with surface water resources such as rivers lakes reservoirs and ponds groundwater has a vital role in meeting the water demands of 80 of the rural population and 50 of the urban population www kerenvis nic in however the recent decades witnessed increased groundwater utilization across the state and the unscientific unplanned and indiscriminate use of the groundwater to the meet the drinking agricultural and industrial needs of the state has resulted in the declining groundwater levels and deterioration of water quality the ever increasing water demands for the domestic agricultural and industrial sectors accelerated urbanization shaji et al 2009 as well as the changes in the regional climate i e erratic monthly rainfall pattern the decreasing trend of rainfall during southwest monsoon and occurrence of frequent and prolonged drought events thomas and prasannakumar 2016 aggravated the stress on the groundwater resources of the state this is manifested in the recent assessment of the stage of development of the groundwater resources of the state which classified 15 of the total blocks of kerala state under over exploited critical and semi critical categories cgwb 2017 besides the groundwater potential of the state is limited due to the rugged and undulating topography and the predominance of crystalline rocks i e 88 of the total geographical

geoenvironmental factors the results of the investigation will be valuable in developing the long term action plan for sustainable groundwater management of the region 2 study area the manimala river basin mrb draining an area of 847 km2 is located on the western slopes of the southern western ghats kerala india fig 1 the basin elevation varies from 1395 m to less than 1 m above mean sea level msl the mean annual rainfall of the basin is more than 3000 mm and the mean monthly temperature varies from 30 to 35 c source indian meteorological department data record 1985 2014 geologically the river basin is underlain by the rocks of the precambrian southern granulite terrain of southern india and the major rock types of the basin include charnockite charnokite gneiss cordierite gneiss gabbro granite laterite and syeno granite along with quartzite and dolerite intrusives the lower areas of the basin are characterized by the dominance of tertiary and quaternary sediments unconformably overlay on the precambrian crystallines soman 2002 the important aquifer systems of the region are the weathered fissured and fractured crystalline formations the semi consolidated tertiary formations laterite and the alluvial formations the weathered mantle coupled with partially weathered and fractured zones in the crystalline rocks forms the potential phreatic shallow aquifer of the basin the thickness of the weathered zone in the basin ranges from less than 1 m to more than 10 m the depth of the dug wells in the areas underlain by the crystalline rocks varies from 2 to 12 m below ground level bgl with general depth to water levels ranging from 1 6 to 9 4 m bgl the yield of the dug wells in the crystallines ranges from 5 to 10 m3 day 1 laterite forms the potential aquifers along the valleys and topographic lows and is characterized by thick saturated zones the depth of the wells in the laterite formation shows a range between 5 0 and 13 5 m bgl and the depth to water level varies from 3 4 to 11 4 m bgl during pre monsoon season i e march may the dug wells in the laterite formation yield between 5 and 30 m3 day 1 the depth of dug wells in the sedimentary formations ranges from

dug wells in the sedimentary aquifers are characterized by considerably higher yields 10 30 m3 day 1 compared to the crystalline aquifers cgwb 2013a b 3 data and methodology the geoenvironmental data used for the delineation of gwpzs in the mrb were land use land cover geomorphology lithology soil slope lineament density and drainage density the land use land cover types landforms and photo lineaments were mapped from the landsat 8 oli data landsat scene identifier lc81440532017034lgn00 date of acquisition 03 02 2017 the scene was corrected for geometric distortions and atmospheric noises and pre processed to enhance the quality of the image using erdas imagine 9 3 the land use land cover types of the basin were extracted using unsupervised classification followed by a ground truth verification the geomorphological diversity of the basin was mapped from the landsat image and survey of india topographic maps 1 50 000 scale the district geological resources maps of kottayam and pathanamthitta districts kerala state of the scale 1 250 000 of the geological survey of india were used to derive the lithological map of the basin the soil series data were collected from the soil survey organization government of kerala the slope map of the river basin was generated from the aster gdem v 2 the photo lineaments were mapped from the landsat image and the hillshade map derived from the dem the drainage anomalies noticed in the topographic maps were also considered for mapping the lineaments of the basin the drainage density of the basin was estimated from the drainage lines delineated from the survey of india topographic maps the mcda methodology for the delineation of the gwpzs of the mrb was implemented by the integration of various gis tools and the ahp technique the ahp is a structured method for analysing and solving complex decision problems by decomposition comparative judgments and synthesis of priorities saaty 1980 the decomposition of a problem captures the basic elements of the problem and a hierarchical structure is developed by organizing the goal objectives attributes and alternatives the pairwise comparison reduces the conceptual complexity of the problem by considering two components simultaneously and the relative importance of the elements in a level is estimated with respect to the elements in the immediate high level hierarchy by developing a comparison matrix which is expressed as follows 1 1 a 1 a 12 a 13 a 1 n a 21 1 a 23 a 2 n a 31 a 32 a n 1 a n 2 1 where a i j w e i g h t f o r a t t r i b u t e i w e i g h t f o r a t t r i b u t e j the relative importance of each element is computed by normalizing the eigenvector associated with the maximum eigenvalue of the pairwise comparison matrix for this a comparative weightage was given to each factor with respect to their influence on the occurrence of groundwater based on the expert opinions and review of pertinent literature e g machiwal et al 2011 pinto et al 2015 rahmati et al 2015 jasrotia et al 2016 maheswaran et al 2016 finally the consistency associated with the pairwise comparison matrix is estimated using the consistency ratio cr as eq 2 2 c r c i r i where ci is the consistency index which is calculated as eq 3 and ri is the consistency index of a random square matrix of the same order 3 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ max is the largest eigenvalue of a and n is the order of the square matrix if a is perfectly consistent then λ max will be equal to n giving a ci of zero as inconsistency increases λ max also increases saaty 1980 commission and omission of any given variable solely depend on the value of cr where variables with a cr value greater than 0 1 need to be excluded from the analysis the ahp technique in this study was implemented using r and the geoenvironmental factors were analysed in arcgis to delineate the gwpzs of the mrb on a cell by cell basis using the following equation eq 4 4 g r o u n d w a t e r p o t e n t i a l i 1 n f i w i where fi is the ranking of various geoenvironmental factors used for the estimation of groundwater potential and wi is the corresponding relative ratings 4 results and discussion the geoenvironmental factors used for the analysis of the gwpzs of the mrb viz land use land cover geomorphology lithology soil slope lineament density and drainage density figs 2 8 are discussed in the following sections 4 1 land use land cover among the numerous factors determining the occurrence and recharge of groundwater land use land cover has an unequivocal role lerner and harris 2009 martin et al 2017 the major land use land cover types of the mrb include commercial agricultural plantations e g rubber coffee tea cashew cardamom and banana seasonal cropland scrubland grassland fallow forest built up barren rock sand bars mostly associated with channels and floodplains waterlogged areas and waterbody fig 2 however the rubber plantation is the dominant type of land use land cover of the basin covering 67 of the basin area followed by coffee plantation 8 the rubber plantations are spatially distributed across the basin irrespective of the physiographic zones whereas the tea and forest plantations dominate across the rugged highland physiographic tracts of the basin 4 2 geomorphology analysis of landforms provides significant evidence of regional groundwater conditions especially in the hard rock terrains donselaar et al 2017 geomorphologically the mrb is characterized by rugged hills and undulating surfaces in the upstream region and gently sloping terrains in the downstream parts geomorphic diversity of the basin includes denudational structural hills denudational hills residual hills pediment zones lower plateau linear ridges rocky exposures valley fills alluvial and coastal plains mud flats and waterbody fig 3 the highland segment of the basin is dominated by the denudational structural hill as well as denudational hill upstream region of the basin is also characterized by linear ridges trending roughly nw se and having relatively lower groundwater potential residual hill occurs as isolated patches in the basin mostly between the rugged highlands and the gentle alluvial plains pediments are gently sloping surfaces of low relief between the hills and plains and are considered as moderate to good potential zones majority of the basin is covered by the lower plateau 45 which is susceptible to weathering and erosion and hence is considered as poor to moderate potential zones valley fills chiefly identified in the less rugged terrain of the basin have considerable groundwater potential however the extent of valley fills significantly varies between the physiographic domains across the basin alluvial plains and coastal plains are distributed across the downstream portions of the mrb and are considered to be of recent origin soman 2002 4 3 lithology the occurrence movement and storage of groundwater are controlled by geology one of the most important factors influencing groundwater availability in igneous and metamorphic rocks is lithology the rock type controls the depth and degree of weathering the porosity and permeability as well as the types of water bearing discontinuities that may be formed in the bedrock similarly geologic structure influences the distribution nature and yield of water bearing zones by providing the fabric along which weathering and possibly stress relief can occur moore 2005 williams et al 2005 in the mrb a major portion is underlain by charnockite charnockite gneiss rocks 90 fig 4 whereas the areal extent of other rock types except laterite and quartzite is insignificant the tertiary and quaternary sediments occur across the downstream parts of the basin the water bearing capacity differs significantly among the rocks where the warkalli beds upper miocene to pliocene comprising of sandstone and clays with lignite intercalations and the quaternary deposits of sand and silt admixture flood plain deposits have excellent groundwater potential 4 4 soil soil is a key variable determining the groundwater occurrence as soil texture controls the rate of infiltration in an area the soils of the basin belong to six regional soil series viz the adoor series the ayroor series the kumaranperoor series the nellapara series the venmony series and the anamudy series and show significant differences in the soil properties table 1 sso 2007 in general soils of gravelly loam loam and clay textures dominate the upstream parts of the basin 47 97 whereas the central and downstream portions are covered by soils of gravelly clay texture fig 5 4 5 slope the topography is a crucial factor governing the surface runoff as well as infiltration and hence the slope of the terrain has a significant effect on the groundwater recharge and development detty and mcguire 2010 in the mrb the slope of the terrain varies from 0 to 64 fig 6 the upstream parts specifically the slopes of the denudational structural hills of the basin are characterized by steep slopes whereas the lower parts are dominated by gently undulating and flat areas the spatially distributed slope of the mrb was reclassified into five categories viz very gentle slope 5 covering 26 of basin area gentle slope 6 10 34 moderate slope 11 25 32 steep slope 26 35 6 and very steep slope 35 2 where the very gentle slope and the gentle slope areas have very good groundwater potential 4 6 lineament density in hard rock terrains storage and movement of groundwater are governed by lineaments and therefore lineaments are reliable indicators of groundwater storage and movement henriksen and braathen 2006 the mrb is interlaced by several major and minor lineaments whose length varies from a few hundreds of meters to a few kilometres majority of the lineaments of the basin 40 trends in the nw se direction whereas lineaments of n s and ne sw direction also co occur the lineament density of the basin varies from 0 to 1 26 km km 2 fig 7 and the lineament density was regrouped into three classes viz high 1 km km 2 moderate 0 6 1 km km 2 and low 0 5 km km 2 fig 7 indicates that the majority of the basin area is characterized by a low density of lineaments the regions with high lineament density extend dominantly across the charnockitic terrain with quartzite intrusives the areas having a relatively higher density of lineaments imply significantly higher groundwater potential compared to the areas with moderate and low lineament density 4 7 drainage density the drainage density is estimated as the total length of streams of all orders in the unit area in the mrb drainage density ranges from 0 to 4 02 km km 2 fig 8 further the drainage density map was reclassified into three distinct classes such as high 3 km km 2 moderate 1 6 3 km km 2 and low 1 5 km km 2 and indicates that the majority of the basin area 67 belongs to moderate drainage density class in general the low drainage density regions possess relatively higher groundwater potential compared to areas having dense stream networks 4 8 relative importance of the dominant factors the pairwise comparison matrix of the geoenvironmental data used for delineating the gwpzs of the mrb is given as appendix 1 among the seven factors lithology shows the maximum rating of 0 2571 followed by lineament density 0 2286 and geomorphology 0 2000 whereas land use land cover 0 0286 has the minimum weightage appendix 1 the weights of different feature classes of each geoenvironmental factor also show considerable variability based on their significance on the occurrence of groundwater among the different land use land cover types waterlogged areas 0 111 and forest areas 0 0988 are characterized by relatively higher weightages whereas rocky areas have the lowest 0 0123 appendix 1 the agricultural plantations such as banana and mixed plantations 0 0864 as well as rubber and coffee 0 0617 also have relatively higher ranks among the various geomorphological types alluvial plain and mud flats have relatively higher weightages 0 1139 while residual hill and denudational structural hill show relatively lower ratings the tertiary sediments of the warkalli formation and the quaternary deposits have the maximum weightages 0 2368 among the different lithological types of the basin whereas the lowest rank was registered to charnockite charnockite gneiss lithology 0 0263 the soils with sandy texture have a relatively higher rating of 0 4286 while the lowest weightage was manifested by the soils of clayey texture 0 0476 since the groundwater potential is highly influenced by slope highest weightage 0 559 was given to the areas having very gentle slope 5 whereas the lowest ranking 0 0622 was attributed to very steep slope areas 35 relatively higher weightage was observed across the regions having high lineament density i e 1 0 km km 2 i e 0 556 whereas lower ranking for the low density areas i e 0 5 km km 2 0 111 among the various drainage density classes of the basin the areas of low drainage density 1 5 km km 2 have a relatively higher rating 0 652 compared to moderate 0 217 and high density areas 0 1304 4 9 groundwater potential zones gwpzs the weightages derived using the ahp technique were used to delineate the gwpzs of the mrb the spatially distributed gwpzs of the basin fig 9 were estimated using eq 4 and reclassified into different zones of varying groundwater potential i e very good good moderate and poor in the mrb about 212 km2 area was classified as poor potential zones which accounts for roughly 26 of the total area of the basin the moderate potential zone occupies 204 km2 area 25 while the good potential zone covers 29 of the basin area 232 km2 the very good potential zone extends only 20 of the basin area and occurs as large spatial clusters within the basin among the seven geoenvironmental factors lithology landforms and lineament density are the significant factors controlling the occurrence of groundwater in the mrb while considering the various hydrogeomorphic units alluvial plains and piedmont zones are the potential zones for groundwater exploration valley fills associated with lineaments are also reliable for groundwater development while denudational structural hills denudational hills residual hills and linear ridges have poor groundwater potential the different existing combinations of lithology geomorphology and land use land cover types of the basin and their predicted groundwater potential are given in table 2 the regions characterized by the landforms such as alluvial plain lower plateau piedmont zone and valley fill developed on the rock types viz charnockites laterite and granite as well as the sedimentaries with commercial agricultural plantations have very good groundwater potential compared to the areas with denudational structural hill and linear ridge landforms with charnockitic lithology and commercial agricultural plantations this observation implies the significance of the geomorphologic controls on the occurrence of groundwater of the basin hence the topographic modifications and alterations to the landscape structure for agricultural and infrastructure development may pose serious challenges on sustainable groundwater management the results of the present study have been compared with previous studies from other parts of the world as well as from the regional perspective comparison of the geoenvironmental data used for the delineation of the gwpzs of the mrb with other studies in different environmental settings suggests that the variables considered in the study are adequate for the delineation of the gwpzs the geological controls on the occurrence and recharge of groundwater are well established by various researchers e g agarwal and garg 2016 jasrotia et al 2016 abuzied and alrefaee 2017 however dadgar et al 2017 and ghorbani nejad et al 2017 observed that topography altitude slope angle drainage density and land use land cover are also significant in identifying the regional groundwater potential the previous studies pertaining to the southern western ghats region e g dinesh kumar et al 2007 preeja et al 2011 swetha et al 2017 also concluded that the dominant factors controlling the occurrence of groundwater of the region are lithology geomorphology slope and lineament density however the weightages of the dominant factors vary among the different studies for example lithology has the highest rank 0 257 in the present study followed by lineament density 0 2286 and geomorphology 0 2000 contrastingly dinesh kumar et al 2007 preeja et al 2011 and swetha et al 2017 attributed the highest weightage to geomorphology followed by slope and lineament density such differences indicate that the relative dominance of the dominant geoenvironmental factors might also have considerable spatial variability across the region 4 9 1 validation the accuracy of the delineation of the gwpzs of the basin was estimated by analysing the bivariate relationship fig 10 between the groundwater potential index and the dug well yield data published by the central ground water board cgwb 2013a b the mean groundwater yield per observation well in the different gwpzs delineated by the present study is given in table 3 the wells in the poor potential zones have a mean yield of 6 lpm while in the moderate potential zones the dug wells have a comparatively higher yield of 24 lpm the good potential zones of the basin have a mean well yield of 108 lpm while the very good potential zones showed a mean yield of 195 lpm the estimated relationship between groundwater potential and well yield implies the coherence between the groundwater potential index and the actual groundwater conditions of the basin the delineation of the gwpzs of the mrb is highly constructive as the mapping may be used for the formulation of comprehensive groundwater management programmes moreover the classification of the gwpzs enables the authorities to implement suitable management strategies to develop the groundwater resources of each zone however the mapping using the geoenvironmental data at finer spatial scales may provide better results the present study has some potential limitations first the selection of the factors controlling the occurrence of groundwater was subjected to expert opinion as well as through literature review and the study did not consider the human interferences in the form of water conservation strategies artificial groundwater recharge mechanisms etc second the study did not assess the spatial accuracy of the extent of the gwpzs with field observations which is primarily due to the lack of observed data this study used data from 12 observation wells only to validate the results however in the case of limited data the present approach may be considered as a vital tool for regional groundwater management 5 summary and conclusion the groundwater potential zones gwpzs of a tropical river basin viz the manimala river basin mrb were demarcated by an integrated approach using remote sensing gis and the ahp technique various geoenvironmental factors of the basin such as land use land cover geomorphology lithology soil slope lineament density and drainage density were used for the delineation of the gwpzs a multi criteria decision analysis mcda was performed in arcgis using the weights generated through the ahp technique among the seven factors lithology geomorphology and lineament density have significant roles in the occurrence of groundwater of the basin the groundwater potential of the mrb was reclassified into four classes viz very good good moderate and poor and approximately 50 of the basin area is characterized by good to very good groundwater potential the areas characterized by the landforms such as alluvial plain lower plateau piedmont zone and valley fill developed on the rock types viz charnockites laterite and granite as well as the sedimentaries with commercial agricultural plantations have very good groundwater potential the groundwater potential index and the groundwater yield show a positive linear relationship suggesting the effectiveness of the delineation of the gwpzs as well as the suitability of the geoenvironmental factors used in the investigation in determining the groundwater potential of the region the study underscores that the integration of remote sensing and geospatial

of the groundwater potential zones gwpzs in this study various geoenvironmental factors such as lithology geomorphology land use land cover the density of lineaments and stream network slope and soil

bhanja et al 2017 using long term in situ monitoring 19 000 observation wells 1996 2014 and decadal 2003 2014 satellite based measurements observed a regional scale groundwater storage replenishment in the western and southern parts of india which is contrasting to the general consensus on groundwater depletion occurring across the country according to the estimates of cgwb 2017 the main source of replenishable groundwater resources of the country is recharge through rainfall where about 67 of the annual groundwater resources is being replenished through rainfall however owing to the spatial variability of the annual rainfall and the rate of groundwater extraction the groundwater development of the country also shows remarkable spatial variations although kerala state india is enriched with surface water resources such as rivers lakes reservoirs and ponds groundwater has a vital role in meeting the water demands of 80 of the rural population and 50 of the urban population www

agricultural and industrial sectors accelerated urbanization shaji et al 2009 as well as the changes in the regional climate i e erratic monthly rainfall pattern the decreasing trend of rainfall during southwest monsoon and occurrence of frequent and prolonged drought events thomas and prasannakumar 2016 aggravated the stress on the groundwater resources of the state this is manifested in the recent assessment of the stage of development of the groundwater resources of the state which classified 15 of the total blocks of kerala state under over exploited critical and semi critical

2 c r c i r i where ci is the consistency index which is calculated as eq 3 and ri is the consistency index of a random square matrix of the same order 3 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ max is the largest eigenvalue of a and n is the order of the square matrix if a is perfectly consistent then λ max will be equal to n giving a ci of zero as inconsistency increases λ max also increases saaty 1980 commission and omission of any given variable solely depend on the value of cr where variables with a cr value greater than 0 1 need to be excluded from the analysis the ahp technique in this study was implemented using r and the geoenvironmental factors were analysed in arcgis to delineate the gwpzs of the mrb on a cell by cell basis using the following equation eq 4 4 g r o u n d w a t e r p o

discussion the geoenvironmental factors used for the analysis of the gwpzs of the mrb viz land use land cover geomorphology lithology soil slope lineament density and drainage density figs 2 8 are discussed in the following sections 4 1 land use land cover among the numerous factors determining the occurrence and recharge of groundwater land use land cover has an unequivocal role lerner and harris 2009 martin et al 2017 the major land use land cover types of the mrb include commercial agricultural plantations e g rubber coffee tea cashew cardamom and banana seasonal cropland scrubland grassland fallow forest built up barren rock sand bars mostly associated with channels and floodplains waterlogged areas and waterbody fig 2 however the rubber plantation is the dominant type of land use land cover of the basin covering 67 of the basin area followed by coffee plantation 8 the rubber plantations are spatially distributed across the basin irrespective of the physiographic zones whereas the tea and forest plantations dominate across the rugged highland physiographic tracts of the basin 4 2 geomorphology analysis of landforms provides significant evidence of regional groundwater conditions especially in the hard rock terrains donselaar et al 2017 geomorphologically the mrb is characterized by rugged hills and undulating surfaces in the upstream region and gently sloping terrains in the downstream parts geomorphic diversity of the basin includes denudational structural hills denudational hills residual hills pediment zones lower plateau linear ridges rocky exposures valley fills alluvial and coastal plains mud flats and waterbody fig 3 the highland segment of the basin is dominated by the denudational structural hill as well as denudational hill upstream region of the basin is also characterized by linear ridges trending roughly nw se and having relatively lower groundwater potential residual hill occurs as isolated patches in the basin mostly between the rugged highlands and the gentle alluvial plains pediments are gently sloping surfaces of low relief between the hills and plains and are considered as moderate to good potential zones majority of the basin is covered by the lower plateau 45 which is susceptible to weathering and erosion and hence is considered as poor to moderate potential zones valley fills chiefly identified in the less rugged terrain of the basin have considerable groundwater potential however the extent of valley fills significantly varies between the physiographic domains across the basin alluvial plains and coastal plains are distributed across the downstream portions of the mrb and are considered to be of recent origin soman 2002 4 3 lithology the occurrence movement and storage of groundwater are controlled by geology one of the most important factors influencing groundwater availability in igneous and metamorphic rocks is lithology the rock type controls the depth and degree of weathering the porosity and permeability as well as the types of water bearing discontinuities that may be formed in the bedrock similarly geologic structure influences the distribution nature and yield of water bearing zones by providing the fabric along which weathering and possibly stress relief can occur moore 2005 williams et al 2005 in the mrb a major portion is underlain by charnockite charnockite gneiss rocks 90 fig 4 whereas the areal extent of other rock types except laterite and quartzite is insignificant the tertiary and quaternary sediments occur across the downstream parts of the basin the water bearing capacity differs significantly among the rocks where the warkalli beds upper miocene to pliocene comprising of sandstone and clays with lignite intercalations and the quaternary deposits of sand and silt admixture flood plain deposits have excellent groundwater potential 4 4 soil soil is a key variable determining the groundwater occurrence as soil texture controls the rate of infiltration in an area the soils of the basin belong to six regional soil series viz the adoor series the ayroor series the kumaranperoor series the nellapara series the venmony series and the anamudy series and show significant differences in the soil properties table 1 sso 2007 in general soils of gravelly loam loam and clay textures dominate the upstream parts of the basin 47 97 whereas the central and downstream portions are covered by soils of gravelly clay texture fig 5 4 5 slope the topography is a crucial factor governing the surface runoff as well as infiltration and hence the slope of the terrain has a significant effect on the groundwater recharge and development detty and mcguire 2010 in the mrb the slope of the terrain varies from 0 to 64 fig 6 the upstream parts specifically the slopes of the denudational structural hills of the basin are characterized by steep slopes whereas the lower parts are dominated by gently undulating and flat areas the spatially distributed slope of the mrb was reclassified into five categories viz very gentle slope 5 covering 26 of basin area gentle slope 6 10 34 moderate slope 11 25 32 steep slope 26 35 6 and very steep slope 35 2 where the very gentle slope and the gentle slope areas have very good groundwater potential 4 6 lineament density in hard rock terrains storage and movement of groundwater are governed by lineaments and therefore lineaments are reliable indicators of groundwater storage and movement henriksen and braathen 2006 the mrb is interlaced by several major and minor lineaments whose length varies from a few hundreds of meters to a few kilometres majority of the lineaments of the basin 40 trends in the nw se direction whereas lineaments of n s and ne sw direction also co occur the lineament density of the basin varies from 0 to 1 26 km km 2 fig 7 and the lineament density was regrouped into three classes viz high 1 km km 2 moderate 0 6 1 km km 2 and low 0 5 km km 2 fig 7 indicates that the majority of the basin area is characterized by a low density of lineaments the regions with high lineament density extend dominantly across the charnockitic terrain with quartzite intrusives the areas having a relatively higher density of lineaments imply significantly higher groundwater potential compared to the areas with moderate and low lineament density 4 7 drainage density the drainage density is estimated as the total length of streams of all orders in the unit area in the mrb drainage density ranges from 0 to 4 02 km km 2 fig 8 further the drainage density map was reclassified into three distinct classes such as high 3 km km 2 moderate 1 6 3 km km 2 and low 1 5 km km 2 and indicates that the majority of the basin area 67 belongs to moderate drainage density class in general the low drainage density regions possess relatively higher groundwater potential compared to areas having dense stream networks 4 8 relative importance of the dominant factors the pairwise comparison matrix of the geoenvironmental data used for delineating the gwpzs of the mrb is given as appendix 1 among the seven factors lithology shows the maximum rating of 0 2571 followed by lineament density 0 2286 and geomorphology 0 2000 whereas land use land cover 0 0286 has the minimum weightage appendix 1 the weights of different feature classes of each geoenvironmental factor also show considerable variability based on their significance on the occurrence of groundwater among the different land use land cover types waterlogged areas 0 111 and forest areas 0 0988 are characterized by relatively higher weightages whereas rocky areas have the lowest 0 0123 appendix 1 the agricultural plantations such as banana and mixed plantations 0 0864 as well as rubber and coffee 0 0617 also have relatively higher ranks among the various geomorphological types alluvial plain and mud flats have relatively higher weightages 0 1139 while residual hill and denudational structural hill show relatively lower ratings the tertiary sediments of the warkalli formation and the quaternary deposits have the maximum weightages 0 2368 among the different lithological types of the basin whereas the lowest rank was registered to charnockite charnockite gneiss lithology 0 0263 the soils with sandy texture have a relatively higher rating of 0 4286 while the lowest weightage was manifested by the soils of clayey texture 0 0476 since the groundwater potential is highly influenced by slope highest weightage 0 559 was given to the areas having very gentle slope 5 whereas the lowest ranking 0 0622 was attributed to very steep slope areas 35 relatively higher weightage was observed across the regions having high lineament density i e 1 0 km km 2 i e 0 556 whereas lower ranking for the low density areas i e 0 5 km km 2 0 111 among the various drainage density classes of the basin the areas of low drainage density 1 5 km km 2 have a relatively higher rating 0 652 compared to moderate 0 217 and high density areas 0 1304 4 9 groundwater potential zones gwpzs the weightages derived using the ahp technique were used to delineate the gwpzs of the mrb the spatially distributed gwpzs of the basin fig 9 were estimated using eq 4 and reclassified into different zones of varying groundwater potential i e very good good moderate and poor in the mrb about 212 km2 area was classified as poor potential zones which accounts for roughly 26 of the total area of the basin the moderate potential zone occupies 204 km2 area 25 while the good potential zone covers 29 of the basin area 232 km2 the very good potential zone extends only 20 of the basin area and occurs as large spatial clusters within the basin among the seven geoenvironmental factors lithology landforms and lineament density are the significant factors controlling the occurrence of groundwater in the mrb while considering the various hydrogeomorphic units alluvial plains and piedmont zones are the potential zones for groundwater exploration valley fills associated with lineaments are also reliable for groundwater development while denudational structural hills denudational hills residual hills and linear ridges have poor groundwater potential the different existing combinations of lithology geomorphology and land use land cover types of the basin and their predicted groundwater potential are given in table 2 the regions characterized by the landforms such as alluvial plain lower plateau piedmont zone and valley fill developed on the rock types viz charnockites laterite and granite as well as the sedimentaries with commercial agricultural plantations have very good groundwater potential compared to the areas with denudational structural hill and linear ridge landforms with charnockitic lithology and commercial agricultural plantations this observation implies the significance of the geomorphologic controls on the occurrence of groundwater of the basin hence the topographic modifications and alterations to the landscape structure for agricultural and infrastructure development may pose serious challenges on sustainable groundwater management the results of the present study have been compared with previous studies from other parts of the world as well as from the regional perspective comparison of the geoenvironmental data used for the delineation of the gwpzs of the mrb with other studies in different environmental settings suggests that the variables considered in the study are adequate for the delineation of the gwpzs the geological controls on the occurrence and recharge of groundwater are well established by various researchers e g agarwal and garg 2016 jasrotia et al 2016 abuzied and alrefaee 2017 however dadgar et al 2017 and ghorbani nejad et al 2017 observed that topography altitude slope angle drainage density and land use land cover are also significant in identifying the regional groundwater potential the previous studies pertaining to the southern western ghats region e g dinesh kumar et al 2007 preeja et al 2011 swetha et al 2017 also concluded that the dominant factors controlling the occurrence of groundwater of the region are lithology geomorphology slope and lineament density however the weightages of the dominant factors vary among the different studies for example lithology has the highest rank 0 257 in the present study followed by lineament density 0 2286 and geomorphology 0 2000 contrastingly dinesh kumar et al 2007 preeja et al 2011 and swetha et al 2017 attributed the highest weightage to geomorphology followed by slope and lineament density such differences indicate that the relative dominance of the dominant geoenvironmental factors might also have considerable spatial variability across the region 4 9 1 validation the accuracy of the delineation of the gwpzs of the basin was estimated by analysing the bivariate relationship fig 10 between the groundwater potential index and the dug well yield data published by the central ground water board cgwb 2013a b the mean groundwater yield per observation well in the different gwpzs delineated by the present study is given in table 3 the wells in the poor potential zones have a mean yield of 6 lpm while in the moderate potential zones the dug wells have a comparatively higher yield of 24 lpm the good potential zones of the basin have a mean well yield of 108 lpm while the very good potential zones showed a mean yield of 195 lpm the estimated relationship between groundwater potential and well yield implies the coherence between the groundwater potential index and the actual groundwater conditions of the basin the delineation of the gwpzs of the mrb is highly constructive as the mapping may be used for the formulation of comprehensive groundwater management programmes moreover the classification of the gwpzs enables the authorities to implement suitable management strategies to develop the groundwater resources of each zone however the mapping using the geoenvironmental data at finer spatial scales may provide better results the present study has some potential limitations first the selection of the factors controlling the occurrence of groundwater was subjected to expert opinion as well as through literature review and the study did not consider the human interferences in the form of water conservation strategies artificial groundwater recharge mechanisms etc second the study did not assess the spatial accuracy of the extent of the gwpzs with field observations which is primarily due to the lack of observed data this study used data from 12 observation wells only to validate the results however in the case of limited data the present approach may be considered as a vital tool for regional groundwater management 5 summary and conclusion the groundwater potential zones gwpzs of a tropical river basin viz the manimala river basin mrb were demarcated by an integrated approach using remote sensing gis and the ahp technique various geoenvironmental factors of the basin such as land use land cover geomorphology lithology soil slope lineament density and drainage density were used for the delineation of the gwpzs a multi criteria decision analysis mcda was performed in arcgis using the weights generated through the ahp technique among the seven factors lithology geomorphology and lineament density have significant roles in the occurrence of groundwater of the basin the groundwater potential of the mrb was reclassified into four classes viz very good good moderate and poor and approximately 50 of the basin area is characterized by good to very good groundwater potential the areas characterized by the landforms such as alluvial plain lower plateau piedmont zone and valley fill developed on the rock types viz charnockites laterite and granite as well as the sedimentaries with commercial agricultural plantations have very good groundwater potential the groundwater potential index and the groundwater yield show a positive linear relationship suggesting the effectiveness of the delineation of the gwpzs as well as the suitability of the geoenvironmental factors used in the investigation in determining the groundwater potential of the region the study underscores that the integration of remote sensing and geospatial
