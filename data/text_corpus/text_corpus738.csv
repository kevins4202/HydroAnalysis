3690,wetland ecosystems have experienced dramatic challenges in the past few decades due to global climate change and human activities wetland maps are essential tools for conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems the objective of this study was to obtain an accurate wetland map using a parcel level ensemble method based on sentinel 1 sar time series and segmentations generated from gf 6 mps images the dongting lake wetlands in china which has a heterogeneous landscape was deliberately chosen as a challenging case study first both vv and vh polarization backscatters σ0 vv σ0 vh were generated from time series sentinel 1 sar speckle noise inherent in sar data can affect the performance on image segmentation by resulting in over segmentation or under segmentation and that will degrade the accuracies of wetland classification subsequently optical data gaofen 6 which is effectively capable of delineating meaningful parcels were applied to get the segmentations in this study finally the ensemble method was utilized to extract the wetland information at parcel level the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the object based ensemble method are 90 58 and 0 88 which are 4 25 and 0 04 higher than that of the pixel based method respectively moreover the object based ensemble method for classification in high heterogeneity areas is superior and can greatly improve the performance compared with single classifiers keywords wetland gaofen 6 sentinel 1 sar parcel level ensemble method 1 introduction wetland as the biggest carbon pool in the world has important ecological service functions such as water conservation regulation and maintenance of species diversity and it is also a crucial living environment for human beings dalezios et al 2018 ye et al 2019 deventer et al 2019 despite the small coverage wetlands store higher carbon content relative to other terrestrial ecosystems around the world cai et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however global climate change and human activities continue to threaten the coverage ecology and biodiversity of wetlands in the global chen et al 2018 debanshi and pal 2020 therefore accurate monitoring the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of wetland at a regional scale is of crucial significance to improve our understanding of carbon dynamics and sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems remote sensing techniques can investigate large wetland systems and monitor their change over time guo et al 2019 hou et al 2018 especially time series optical satellite images are able to periodically capture the information of the same phenology stage of the wetland aslan et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 the optical sensors have been widely and successfully used for monitoring the composition of wetlands detecting the presence and the extent of flooding in past few years mao et al 2018 taddeo et al 2019 hess et al 2003 however optical images meet inevitable challenge caused by cloud contamination in tropical and subtropical regions fu et al 2017 brisco 2015 henderson and lewis 2008 it is difficult to acquire adequate and clear remote sensing images for large scale during the vegetation growing season of wetland due to frequent occurrence of rain and clouds kasischke et al 2003 lang et al 2008 being immune to weather conditions voluminous studies have employed synthetic aperture radar sar data for flood detection and wetland system classification recording various backscatter responses to the biophysical structure of the vegetation canopy jahncke et al 2018 plank et

previous literature grimaldi et al 2020 liang and liu 2019 despite these advantages inherent noise in sar will lead to low classification accuracies when using pixel based classification method moreover combination of optical and sar images at pixel level also cannot avoid this issue niu and ban 2012 qi et al 2012 recently object based image analysis obia which considers landscapes as aggregations of meaningful objects according to the spectral textual and geometric information has been used to reduce radar speckle hossain and chen 2019 nevertheless speckle noise inherent in sar data still affect the performance on image segmentation by resulting in over segmentation or under segmentation and that will degrade the accuracies of wetland classification fortunately this issue can be solved by segmentation on optical data especially for high resolution images which is effectively capable of delineating meaningful objects mahdavi et al 2019 shuai et al 2018 based on obia technique numbers of classifier algorithms random forest rf decision tree dt k nearest neighbor knn and support vector machine svm have been comprehensively used to produce wetland maps evans et al 2010 luo and mornya 2019 these algorithms have different pros and cons and none of them is the best for all datasets moreover wetland classification is still challenging if use object based method with a single classifier because the wetland landscape is featured by the high heterogenicity and complicated compositions according to the no free lunch theorems if a method performs well in one type of problems if a method performs well on one type of problem it will naturally be less accurate on the remaining problems healey et al 2018 ensemble method such as bagging boosting and stacking algorithms which ensemble various algorithms can improve global accuracy wolpert 1991 compared with the bagging and boosting based ensemble algorithm the stacking algorithm proposed by wolpert call upon features from a learning dataset to facilitate weighting of outputs on the basis of model performance which has stronger nonlinear representation and the ability to reduce generalization errors wolpert and macready 1997 it is instructive to study how to extract wetland information with high heterogeneity based on object oriented stacking algorithm this study aims at developing new method for precise wetland mapping in a subtropical zone using object oriented ensemble method based on time series sar dataset and high resolution optical imagery sentinel 1 sar dataset provides the backscatters to describe the vegetation growth characteristics and the gaofen 6 optical multispectral image used for segmentation provides the basic units for mapping wetland then the stacking algorithm was applied for wetland classification based on the basic units we expect that ensemble algorithm based on the incorporation multi temporal sar with optical imagery will yield a highly precise wetland classification and to be superior in identifying wetland vegetation types than current available methods 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study site the dongting lake wetland latitude longitude 28 47 n 29 35 n 112 38 e 113 07 e is located in the middle reaches of yangtze river china fig 1 and covers an area of approximately 1 0 105 ha the dongting lake is a national wetland park located in the sub tropical monsoon climate zone with an annual average precipitation of 1650 mm and an annual average temperature of 16 c the annual average evapotranspiration in the study area is 650 mm the area has a relatively flat terrain with the elevation ranging from 20 to 207 m cai et al 2019 poplar sedge reed paddy are the most common wetland vegetation types surrounding the dongting lake the planted poplar forests are the main deciduous broad leaved forests covering an area of about 3400 ha in 2016 sedge and reed are herbaceous vegetation types growing around the dongting lake and the dense river network the paddy rice is cultivated around the whole lake where water resource is plentiful for irrigation in recent years the government implemented the policies of returning farmland to forest and returning farmland to wetland which made great changes in dongting lake wetland therefore it is of great significance for wetland resource management to monitor the distribution and area of wetland in time 2 2 data and processing optical remote sensing images can provide rich spectrum information and the sar data contains the dielectric characteristics of surface objects such as shape roughness and moisture additionally the combination of optical and sar data has been proved to have great potential in vegetation mapping and monitoring in this study the gaofen 6 imagery and sentinel 1 time series were used in this study to capture the inner year specific physiological characteristic changes of wetland vegetation gaofen 6 gf 6 is a low orbit optical remote sensing satellite and the first high resolution satellite for precision agriculture observation in china with a design life of 8 years as an important part of chinese satellite program the gf 6 mounted with pms and wfv sensors is mainly used in industries such as precision agricultural observation and forestry resource survey moreover the red edge band that can effectively reflect the unique spectral characteristics of crops has been added in gf 6 imagery which has greatly improved the monitoring capabilities of resources in agriculture forestry and grasslands the images captured from the pms sensor has a high quality setting of 8 m spatial resolution and four spectral bands and we obtained two pms images may 24 september 23 in 2018 for segmentation since these images can effectively distinguish different types of wetland vegetation we used the panchromatic band of landsat 8 may 15 2018 as a reference image for gf 6 registration using group control points a total of 30 sentinel 1 grd images in the iw mode 10 m resolution with vv vertical transmit vertical receive and vh vertical transmit horizontal receive polarizations were downloaded sentinel 1 images were preprocessed by sentinel application platform snap http step esa int main download through the following steps 1 orbit correction 2 thermal noise removal 3 border noise removal 4 radiometric calibration to obtain sigma0 σ0 5 multi looking with a 2 2 window 6 converting linear data to db 7 range doppler terrain correction against the geometric distortions layover foreshortening and shadow 8 speckle filtering using the refined lee filter and finally got the backscattering coefficient in db scale cai et al 2020 all the sentinel 1 sar images were resampled to 8 m the same as gf 6 pms imagery ground control points also selected to perform co registration for each sar image and rectified gf 6 imagery with rmss less than 0 1 pixels the field survey was carried out following the principle of stratified sampling between april 1st and july 31st 2018 when wetland vegetation types were in growing season the locations of field sites are recorded by gps and the land cover type of each field site is relatively pure and their cover area are larger than the size of field sites 20 20 m2 the field sites include sedge reed poplar paddy rice forest and dryland no field survey conducted for other land cover types e g water built up and bare land because these cover types can be clearly identified based on optical multispectral images the field site numbers for sedge reed poplar paddy rice forest and dryland are 32 25 19 22 20 24 fig 1 respectively google earth images and the 1 10000 land use land cover lulc map of hunan province in 2018 hunan provincial department of natural resources 2018 were used to identify the cover types and collect samples for training and testing models and assessing accuracy 3 method in this study we developed an object based ensemble method for wetland mapping supported by time series sentinel 1 sar and segmentations from gf 6 imagery fig 2 the proposed method mainly consists of three steps 1 segmentation based on gf 6 mps multispectral images 2 classification feature data collection mainly including the time series sar backscatters σ0 vv σ0 vh data obtained from sentinel 1 datasets 3 mapping wetland using stacking algorithm based on average polarimetric features with parcels 3 1 segmentation based on gf 6 images recently researches have demonstrated that the performance of optical images on segmentation was superior to sar or combination of sar and optical data due to the speckle noise in sar data shuai et al 2018 therefore we only applied segmentation on gf 6 multispectral images in this study the multi resolution image segmentation algorithm was employed to create the image objects from gf 6 multispectral images which allows to construct primitive objects with different sizes using heterogeneity threshold and enhance the objects generation response to landscape patch structure the attributes of the generated image objects are determined by 3 parameters segmentation scale shape and compactness segmentation scale determines the size of objects and the compactness contributes to the fragmentation of landscape patches in the segmentation the dependence of image spectrum will decrease with the increase of shapes resulting in more objects the optimal segmentation scale 12 pixels shape 0 1 and compactness 0 5 were determined by the esp plug in of ecognition developer 9 0 hossain and chen 2019 the esp tool uses the rate of changes of lv roc lv local variance lv to represent the standard deviation in the segmentation result and the local variance is used to represent the homogeneity within the segmentation object theoretically the local variance will increase with the segmentation scale however the local variance alone is insufficient to select the optimal segmentation scale therefore the rate of changes of lv roc lv is introduced to determine the optimal segmentation scale when roc reaches the peak the corresponding segmentation scale can be regarded as the optimal segmentation scale 1 roc l v l i l i 1 l i 1 100 where li and li 1 represent the ith and i 1th segmented target layer pixels respectively 3 2 polarimetric features extraction polarimetric features such as backscatter coefficients stocks vector the degree of polarization and linear polarization ratio have been widely utilized to help identifying land cover types previous studies found that the backscatter coefficients in sentinel 1 sar time series always have the greatest utility and obtain the highest accuracy in classification grimaldi et al 2020 therefore backscatters σ0 vv σ0 vh from all within year observations were employed to discriminate wetland types 2 σ 0 d n 2 a σ 2 where σ0 is the backscatter coefficients dn is pixel value of radar image and a2 σ is the calibration parameter based on the segmentation objects derived from gf 6 images then the segmentation result of segmentation was overlaid on the sar time series to obtain the backscatters in each object according to the field data we select relative pure object and the backscatter coefficient curves of different land cover types are shown in fig 3 sedge first has a sharp rise and it falls sharply after may in vv curve and has a gradual downward trend in vh curve the vh curve of reed has no big changes in but the vv curve has an obvious trough in in june the backscattering coefficient curves of other vegetation types have different and complicated changes throughout the year the curves of vh polarization are similar to that of vv 3 3 parcel level stacking classification stacking is a typical algorithm for ensemble learning wolpert 1991 which is a two level classifier fig 4 in stacking method learners at the first level were called base learners bl and learners at the second level were called meta learners ml wolpert and macready 1997 in general the bl is expected to be diverse and good enough in order to achieve a satisfactory prediction performance however this algorithm usually leads to an over fitting in stacking method to overcome this shortcoming we modified the fusion rule specifically we separated the base training dataset into k parts and used k fold cross validation to train each individual bl after training the bls we obtained a new feature by combining k prediction results if there are t bls in the stacked system the training dataset of the secondary learner consists of t new features the more diverse and varied the specialization of the individual learner are the better performance will be achieved in this study both regression and classification models e g rf svm knn logistic regression and naïve bayes model were chosen as bls for acquiring diverse secondary training dataset additionally research found that using an ensemble learner like rf to combine individual bl will improve the prediction performance over the original single learner and the regression learner healey et al 2018 thus the rf model was selected as secondary learner to fuse bls which could improve the mcs performance as mentioned earlier rf is an ensemble model integrating decision trees by the bagging algorithm pareeth et al 2019 rf utilizes decision trees to learn from dataset and then makes prediction by the voting approach the svm algorithm finds a hyperplane to maximize the distance between sample points of each class and the kernel function in svm is to map indistinguishable classes to a higher dimensional plane for finding out the hyperplane vishwanathan and murty 2002 the core idea of the knn algorithm is that if most of the k nearest samples in the feature space belong to a certain category then the sample belongs to this category and has the corresponding characteristics zouhal and denoeux 1998 in the naïve bayes nb model the membership probability of a given object can be calculated using the bayes theorem the sample would be considered as the category with the maximum probability patil and sherekar 2013 the logistic regression lr model was proposed to handle the linearly separable problem which uses the logit function to fit the samples and apply the activation function e g sigmoid function for probability prediction and classification dreiseitl and ohno machado 2002 all parameters of those machine algorithms are automatically adjusted according to the classification on the basis of the natural environment and main vegetation types of the dongting lake wetland we classified the land cover into eight types water sedge reed poplar paddy rice dryland forest and others building bare land etc training samples were selected randomly from google earth images and the lulc map of the region in 2018 more than 50 samples were selected for each cover type 3 4 classification accuracy assessments the accuracies of wetland map using proposed methods was validated using the testing samples by the 5 fold cross validation with a confusion matrix the accuracies are assessed by the overall accuracy oa producer accuracy pa and user accuracy ua as well as kappa coefficient k the testing and validation samples of the object based ensemble method are produced by combining the field and reference data based on multi resolution segmentation firstly the objects of the segmented image are considered to be pure and the testing samples are generated by assigning the label of the validation sample points using gps visual interpretation and lulc map to the corresponding segmented objects 4 results and discussion 4 1 wetland map using object based stacking method the classification result of the object based stacking method using the sentinel 1 time series and gf 6 images is shown in fig 5 for comparison the pixel based stacking method was also used to classify the land covers using the test samples and the result is illustrated in fig 6 the wetland map using the object based stacking method have meaningful geoinformation and much less salt and pepper phenomenon than that using the pixel based method which is clearly presented in the subregion a b and c additionally the classification results based on object based stacking method has clearer cover type borders and higher accuracy than the pixel based one fig 7 the classification accuracies of object based and pixel based stacking methods were calculated and compared according to table 1 the oa and k of the object based stacking method are 90 58 and 0 88 which are 4 25 and 0 04 higher than that of the pixel based method respectively both the pa and ua of each cover type get different degree improvements by the object based stacking method especially the accuracy of dryland except the sedge and dryland the accuracies of other cover types are higher than 90 although the classification results of the pixel based method have an acceptable oa 86 33 the pa and ua of some vegetation types are lower than that of proposed method for example the sedge and reed have a pa of 83 45 and 84 26 and a ua of 83 48 and 84 93 respectively obviously using object based stacked generalization method has a higher classification accuracy and better generalized performance for land cover classification especially for the wetland ecosystem with high heterogeneity in order to further demonstrate the advantages of obtaining wetland maps based on the method proposed in this paper the results of this paper are compared with the previous investigations including cgls lc100 product and esa worldcover product the copernicus global land service cgls provides land cover maps at 100 m resolution with an accuracy of 80 esa worldcover is the latest esa 2021 release of global 10 m resolution land cover data processed from sentinel data with an overall accuracy of 74 from the three mapping results the classification of cgls 100 and esa worldcover are both relatively coarse with all wetlands grouped into one category while the classification of wetland maps obtained based on the method of this paper is more refined meanwhile comparing with the real remote sensing images the previous two mapping results also have some misclassification 4 2 classification performance utilizing single classifier and ensemble algorithm in this paper svm rf as well as k nearest neighbor k nn algorithms were used to map wetland respectively and their accuracies were compared with that using object based stacking generalization method furthermore three typical subregions as well as their corresponding classification results by three single classifiers and stacking generalization method are shown in fig 8 obviously we obtained a better classification result by stacking generalization method when compared by single classifier specifically the rf classifier tend to misidentify poplar as forest in addition the dryland and others often to be blended seriously when used rf and k nn algorithms fig 8a in subregion b using single classifier is difficult to classify both sedge and reed correctly but it is more accurate in the stacked generalization method which also can be demonstrated in subregion c in some cases forest is mistaken for the paddy rice e g subregion c by rf and k nn the stacked generalization uses meta learners for further classification in secondary structure which can benefit from the contribution of the classification result of svm and then obtains a correct identification between forest and paddy that is even if there is a misclassification of bls in stacking as long as an algorithm only does one thing is a unique contribution then it may be a key progress jahncke et al 2018 the classification accuracies using obia with three single classifiers are shown in fig 9 single classifiers get low classification accuracy pa and ua for sedge and reed while the stacking generalization method achieves higher result in these three single classifiers rf performs better the knn algorithm has the lowest accuracy for poplar identification 86 26 for pa 85 38 for ua but the highest classification accuracy for sedge 87 36 for pa 91 52 for ua in high heterogeneity areas single classifier usually suffers from the generalization error the object based stacking generalization algorithm is applicable for the classification in high heterogeneity areas and have better performance than single classifiers 4 3 stability of the proposed method the performance and generalization ability of the stacking algorithm can be affected by the configuration different bl combinations and different mls varying in stacking algorithm will have an impact on the classification results thus three scenarios are developed in this study to explore the specific impact when using stacking generalization method with different bls and mate learners for first scenario the lr and nb algorithm which achieve relative low accuracies when using object based classification method lr oa 82 35 kappa 0 78 nb oa 81 24 kappa 0 79 in this study are removed from the stacking generalization mothed successively to check the classification result accuracy change in the second scenario additional two classifiers including gradient boosting decision tree gbdt oa 86 47 and kappa 0 84 and neural network nn oa 83 78 and kappa 0 80 are selected as the extra bls to put in the stacking generalization mothed finally all algorithms used in the bls are selected as mate learner of stacking generalization mothed and their performances are assessed by 5 fold cross validation in the result of the first scenario fig 10 some differences between producer accuracy and user accuracy were achieved when the nb or nb lr algorithms are took out from the bls respectively the oa and kappa have reduced to 90 35 0 86 and 88 56 0 82 not all the pa and ua of each cover type have no obvious decreases even the pa or ua of some classes increases reed and dryland although there is no significant change in accuracy removing nb and lr algorithm both lead to the decrease of accuracy that is the stability and generalization of the ensemble system meets at a challenging after removing the algorithms with a relative low classification accuracy to verify the cause of this phenomenon the second scenario is carried out when using an object based stacking generalization with the bls including the extra gbdt and nn algorithms these two algorithms with higher oa and kappa than nb and lr algorithms their oa and kappa 90 62 0 88 when add gbdt and 90 65 0 88 when add both gdbt and nn have not been improved and but maintained at a certain level at the same time ua and pa did not increase significantly combined with the results of the first scenario the accuracy changes caused by different configuration of bls are uncertain in stacking generalization algorithm the output result is produced by the mate learner with the predictions of bls therefore the correlation of different algorithm in bls may be the main reason to impact the classification accuracy additionally different mate learners are selected their classification results are validated among these five results with five different mate learners there can be indicated that the classification result when using a non linear algorithm is better than using a linear algorithm lr oa 88 69 kappa 0 86 nb 86 37 kappa 0 84 especially rf oa 90 58 kappa 0 88 has the highest classification accuracy among three different mate learners k nn oa 89 16 kappa 0 86 and svm oa 90 12 kappa 0 88 fig 11 in general the accuracy changes caused by different configuration different algorithms and combinations of bls and different mate learners of object based stacking generalization are uncertain thus to achieve a stable and generalized an adaptive object based stacking generalization algorithm which can automatically search the best combination of parameters among different classification scenes should be proposed and will be the focus of future research 5 conclusion and future work in this study an object oriented ensemble method was proposed for wetland classification using multi temporal sar data and optical multispectral images the results demonstrate the superiority of the strategy that integrates multi temporal sar and optical data and the potential of using object based stacking for wetland classification at regional or a large scale in spite the advantages there are some limitations in the practical application for the proposed method fundamentally the performance and generalization ability of stacking algorithm are impacted by the configuration for example different combinations of bls and different mls are variables in stacked generalization which have impacts on the classification results the accuracy changes caused by different configurations different algorithms and combinations of bls and different mls of object based stacking generalization are no discussed in this study further work is needed to determine the best configuration in stacked generalization method an adaptive object based stacked generalization algorithm that can automatically search the best combination of parameters among different classification scenes should be developed in order to achieve a stable and generalized performance additionally deep learning enables computer to automatically extract features in the complex remote sensing scene and some remote sensing applications with deep learning as the core have achieved better recognition or classification performance than other algorithms in some cases therefore integrating deep learning algorithms into ensemble algorithm will be an interesting topic credit authorship contribution statement meng zhang

using the refined lee filter and finally got the backscattering coefficient in db scale cai et al 2020 all the sentinel 1 sar images were resampled to 8 m the same as gf 6 pms imagery ground control points also selected to perform co registration for each sar image and rectified gf 6 imagery with rmss less than 0 1 pixels the field survey was carried out following the principle of stratified sampling between april 1st and july 31st 2018 when wetland vegetation types were in growing season the locations of field sites are recorded by gps and the land cover type of each field site is relatively pure and their cover area are larger than the size of field sites 20 20 m2 the field sites include sedge reed poplar paddy rice forest and dryland no field survey conducted for other land cover types e g water built up and bare land because these cover types can be clearly identified based on optical multispectral images the field site numbers for sedge reed poplar paddy rice forest and dryland are 32 25 19 22 20 24 fig 1 respectively google earth images and the 1 10000 land use land cover lulc map of hunan province in 2018 hunan provincial department of natural resources 2018 were used to identify the cover types and collect samples for training and testing models and assessing accuracy 3 method in this study we developed an object based ensemble method for wetland mapping supported by time series sentinel 1 sar and segmentations from gf 6 imagery fig 2 the proposed method mainly consists of three steps 1 segmentation based on gf 6 mps multispectral images 2 classification feature data collection mainly including the time series sar backscatters σ0 vv σ0 vh data obtained from sentinel 1 datasets 3 mapping wetland using stacking algorithm based on average polarimetric features with parcels 3 1 segmentation based on gf 6 images recently researches have demonstrated that the performance of optical images on segmentation was superior to sar or combination of sar and optical data due to the speckle noise in sar data shuai et al 2018 therefore we only applied segmentation on gf 6 multispectral images in this study the multi resolution image segmentation algorithm was employed to create the image objects from gf 6 multispectral images which allows to construct primitive objects with different sizes using heterogeneity threshold and enhance the objects generation response to landscape patch structure the attributes of the generated image objects are determined by 3 parameters segmentation scale shape and compactness segmentation scale determines the size of objects and the compactness contributes to the fragmentation of landscape patches in the segmentation the dependence of image spectrum will decrease with the increase of shapes resulting in more objects the optimal segmentation scale 12 pixels shape 0 1 and compactness 0 5 were determined by the esp plug in of ecognition developer 9 0 hossain and chen 2019 the esp tool uses the rate of changes of lv roc lv local variance lv to represent the standard deviation in the segmentation result and the local variance is used to represent the homogeneity within the segmentation object theoretically the local variance will increase with the segmentation scale however the local variance alone is insufficient to select the optimal segmentation scale therefore the rate of changes of lv roc lv is introduced to determine the optimal segmentation scale when roc reaches the peak the corresponding segmentation scale can be regarded as the optimal segmentation scale 1 roc l v l i l i 1 l i 1 100 where li and li 1 represent the ith and i 1th segmented target layer pixels respectively 3 2 polarimetric features extraction polarimetric features such as backscatter coefficients stocks vector the degree of polarization and linear polarization ratio have been widely utilized to help identifying land cover types previous studies found that the backscatter coefficients in sentinel 1 sar time series always have the greatest utility and obtain the highest accuracy in classification grimaldi et al 2020 therefore backscatters σ0 vv σ0 vh from all within year observations were employed to discriminate wetland types 2 σ 0 d n 2 a σ 2 where σ0 is the backscatter coefficients dn is pixel value of radar image and a2 σ is the calibration parameter based on the segmentation objects derived from gf 6 images then the segmentation result of segmentation was overlaid on the sar time series to obtain the backscatters in each object according to the field data we select relative pure object and the backscatter coefficient curves of different land cover types are shown in fig 3 sedge first has a sharp rise and it falls sharply after may in vv curve and has a gradual downward trend in vh curve the vh curve of reed has no big changes in but the vv curve has an obvious trough in in june the backscattering coefficient curves of other vegetation types have different and complicated changes throughout the year the curves of vh polarization are similar to that of vv 3 3 parcel level stacking classification stacking is a typical algorithm for ensemble learning wolpert 1991 which is a two level classifier fig 4 in stacking method learners at the first level were called base learners bl and learners at the second level were called meta learners ml wolpert and macready 1997 in general the bl is expected to be diverse and good enough in order to achieve a satisfactory prediction performance however this algorithm usually leads to an over fitting in stacking method to overcome this shortcoming we modified the fusion rule specifically we separated the base training dataset into k parts and used k fold cross validation to train each individual bl after training the bls we obtained a new feature by combining k prediction results if there are t bls in the stacked system the training dataset of the secondary learner consists of t new features the more diverse and varied the specialization of the individual learner are the better performance will be achieved in this study both regression and classification models e g rf svm knn logistic regression and naïve bayes model were chosen as bls for acquiring diverse secondary training dataset additionally research found that using an ensemble learner like rf to combine individual bl will improve the prediction performance over the original single learner and the regression learner healey et al 2018 thus the rf model was selected as secondary learner to fuse bls which could improve the mcs performance as mentioned earlier rf is an ensemble model integrating decision trees by the bagging algorithm pareeth et al 2019 rf utilizes decision trees to learn from dataset and then makes prediction by the voting approach the svm algorithm finds a hyperplane to maximize the distance between sample points of each class and the kernel function in svm is to map indistinguishable classes to a higher dimensional plane for finding out the hyperplane vishwanathan and murty 2002 the core idea of the knn algorithm is that if most of the k nearest samples in the feature space belong to a certain category then the sample belongs to this category and has the corresponding characteristics zouhal and denoeux 1998 in the naïve bayes nb model the membership probability of a given object can be calculated using the bayes theorem the sample would be considered as the category with the maximum probability patil and sherekar 2013 the logistic regression lr model was proposed to handle the linearly separable problem which uses the logit function to fit the samples and apply the activation function e g sigmoid function for probability prediction and classification dreiseitl and ohno machado 2002 all parameters of those machine algorithms are automatically adjusted according to the classification on the basis of the natural environment and main vegetation types of the dongting lake wetland we classified the land cover into eight types water sedge reed poplar paddy rice dryland forest and others building bare land etc training samples were selected randomly from google earth images and the lulc map of the region in 2018 more than 50 samples were selected for each cover type 3 4 classification accuracy assessments the accuracies of wetland map using proposed methods was validated using the testing samples by the 5 fold cross validation with a confusion matrix the accuracies are assessed by the overall accuracy oa producer accuracy pa and user accuracy ua as well as kappa coefficient k the testing and validation samples of the object based ensemble method are produced by combining the field and reference data based on multi resolution segmentation firstly the objects of the segmented image are considered to be pure and the testing samples are generated by assigning the label of the validation sample points using gps visual interpretation and lulc map to the corresponding segmented objects 4 results and discussion 4 1 wetland map using object based stacking method the classification result of the object based stacking method using the sentinel 1 time series and gf 6 images is shown in fig 5 for comparison the pixel based stacking method was also used to classify the land covers using the test samples and the result is illustrated in fig 6 the wetland map using the object based stacking method have meaningful geoinformation and much less salt and pepper phenomenon than that using the pixel based method which is clearly presented in the subregion a b and c additionally the classification results based on object based stacking method has clearer cover type borders and higher accuracy than the pixel based one fig 7 the classification accuracies of object based and pixel based stacking methods were calculated and compared according to table 1 the oa and k of the object based stacking method are 90 58 and 0 88 which are 4 25 and 0 04 higher than that of the pixel based method respectively both the pa and ua of each cover type get different degree improvements by the object based stacking method especially the accuracy of dryland except the sedge and dryland the accuracies of other cover types are higher than 90 although the classification results of the pixel based method have an acceptable oa 86 33 the pa and ua of some vegetation types are lower than that of proposed method for example the sedge and reed have a pa of 83 45 and 84 26 and a ua of 83 48 and 84 93 respectively obviously using object based stacked generalization method has a higher classification accuracy and better generalized performance for land cover classification especially for the wetland ecosystem with high heterogeneity in order to further demonstrate the advantages of obtaining wetland maps based on the method proposed in this paper the results of this paper are compared with the previous investigations including cgls lc100 product and esa worldcover product the copernicus global land service cgls provides land cover maps at 100 m resolution with an accuracy of 80 esa worldcover is the latest esa 2021 release of global 10 m resolution land cover data processed from sentinel data with an overall accuracy of 74 from the three mapping results the classification of cgls 100 and esa worldcover are both relatively coarse with all wetlands grouped into one category while the classification of wetland maps obtained based on the method of this paper is more refined meanwhile comparing with the real remote sensing images the previous two mapping results also have some misclassification 4 2 classification performance utilizing single classifier and ensemble algorithm in this paper svm rf as well as k nearest neighbor k nn algorithms were used to map wetland respectively and their accuracies were compared with that using object based stacking generalization method furthermore three typical subregions as well as their corresponding classification results by three single classifiers and stacking generalization method are shown in fig 8 obviously we obtained a better classification result by stacking generalization method when compared by single classifier specifically the rf classifier tend to misidentify poplar as forest in addition the dryland and others often to be blended seriously when used rf and k nn algorithms fig 8a in subregion b using single classifier is difficult to classify both sedge and reed correctly but it is more accurate in the stacked generalization method which also can be demonstrated in subregion c in some cases forest is mistaken for the paddy rice e g subregion c by rf and k nn the stacked generalization uses meta learners for further classification in secondary structure which can benefit from the contribution of the classification result of svm and then obtains a correct identification between forest and paddy that is even if there is a misclassification of bls in stacking as long as an algorithm only does one thing is a unique contribution then it may be a key progress jahncke et al 2018 the classification accuracies using obia with three single classifiers are shown in fig 9 single classifiers get low classification accuracy pa and ua for sedge and reed while the stacking generalization method achieves higher result in these three single classifiers rf performs better the knn algorithm has the lowest accuracy for poplar identification 86 26 for pa 85 38 for ua but the highest classification accuracy for sedge 87 36 for pa 91 52 for ua in high heterogeneity areas single classifier usually suffers from the generalization error the object based stacking generalization algorithm is applicable for the classification in high heterogeneity areas and have better performance than single classifiers 4 3 stability of the proposed method the performance and generalization ability of the stacking algorithm can be affected by the configuration different bl combinations and different mls varying in stacking algorithm will have an impact on the classification results thus three scenarios are developed in this study to explore the specific impact when using stacking generalization method with different bls and mate learners for first scenario the lr and nb algorithm which achieve relative low accuracies when using object based classification method lr oa 82 35 kappa 0 78 nb oa 81 24 kappa 0 79 in this study are removed from the stacking generalization mothed successively to check the classification result accuracy change in the second scenario additional two classifiers including gradient boosting decision tree gbdt oa 86 47 and kappa 0 84 and neural network nn oa 83 78 and kappa 0 80 are selected as the extra bls to put in the stacking generalization mothed finally all algorithms used in the bls are selected as mate learner of stacking generalization mothed and their performances are assessed by 5 fold cross validation in the result of the first scenario fig 10 some differences between producer accuracy and user accuracy were achieved when the nb or nb lr algorithms are took out from the bls respectively the oa and kappa have reduced to 90 35 0 86 and 88 56 0 82 not all the pa and ua of each cover type have no obvious decreases even the pa or ua of some classes increases reed and dryland although there is no significant change in accuracy removing nb and lr algorithm both lead to the decrease of accuracy that is the stability and generalization of the ensemble system meets at a challenging after removing the algorithms with a relative low classification accuracy to verify the cause of this phenomenon the second scenario is carried out when using an object based stacking generalization with the bls including the extra gbdt and nn algorithms these two algorithms with higher oa and kappa than nb and lr algorithms their oa and kappa 90 62 0 88 when add gbdt and 90 65 0 88 when add both gdbt and nn have not been improved and but maintained at a certain level at the same time ua and pa did not increase significantly combined with the results of the first scenario the accuracy changes caused by different configuration of bls are uncertain in stacking generalization algorithm the output result is produced by the mate learner with the predictions of bls therefore the correlation of different algorithm in bls may be the main reason to impact the classification accuracy additionally different mate learners are selected their classification results are validated among these five results with five different mate learners there can be indicated that the classification result when using a non linear algorithm is better than using a linear algorithm lr oa 88 69 kappa 0 86 nb 86 37 kappa 0 84 especially rf oa 90 58 kappa 0 88 has the highest classification accuracy among three different mate learners k nn oa 89 16 kappa 0 86 and svm oa 90 12 kappa 0 88 fig 11 in general the accuracy changes caused by different configuration different algorithms and combinations of bls and different mate learners of object based stacking generalization are uncertain thus to achieve a stable and generalized an adaptive object based stacking generalization algorithm which can automatically search the best combination of parameters among different classification scenes should be proposed and will be the focus of future research 5 conclusion and future work in this study an object oriented ensemble method was proposed for wetland classification using multi temporal sar data and optical multispectral images the results demonstrate the superiority of the strategy that integrates multi temporal sar and optical data and the potential of using object based stacking for wetland classification at regional or a large scale in spite the advantages there are some limitations in the practical application for the proposed method fundamentally the performance and generalization ability of stacking algorithm are impacted by the configuration for example different combinations of bls and different mls are variables in stacked generalization which have impacts on the classification results the accuracy changes caused by different configurations different algorithms and combinations of bls and different mls of object based stacking generalization are no discussed in this study further work is needed to determine the best configuration in stacked generalization method an adaptive object based stacked generalization algorithm that can automatically search the best combination of parameters among different classification scenes should be developed in order to achieve a stable and generalized performance additionally deep learning enables computer to automatically extract features in the complex remote sensing scene and some remote sensing applications with deep learning as the core have achieved better recognition or classification performance than other algorithms in some cases therefore integrating deep learning algorithms into ensemble algorithm will be an interesting topic credit authorship contribution statement meng zhang

3691,water resources management in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is challenging in face of the complex trans national geopolitical context the acceleration of hydropower dam expansion and the growing demands for energy food and riverine ecosystem preservation across the basin centralised management through coordinated operation of all the basin water infrastructures hard cooperation across the river basin is ideal but hard to achieve given the existing geopolitical context of the region to overcome these barriers and facilitate a more adaptive and reliable operation of the lmrb s water system this paper focuses on the concept of soft cooperation i e the idea of indirectly fostering cooperation by sharing data across countries to inform the non cooperative or independent operation of their systems here we first quantify existing riparian conflicts and synergies for the non cooperative scenario where upstream and downstream act independently without any form of cooperation and for the hard cooperation configuration where an ideal centralised operator jointly operates all the infrastructures then a soft cooperation scheme assuming data sharing across riparian countries is evaluated the most effective and informative data is selected via machine learning and used to inform the design of the river reservoir system operation via evolutionary multiobjective direct policy search results show that the riparian conflicts around water mainly exist between the sectors i e hydropower production vs ecosystem conservation rather than among countries for reservoirs with various capacities and locations the value of information varies generally sharing data about the water currently available in the different river storages results in a large improvement in hydropower production this study highlights the value of appropriate data sharing and selection in water system operation as an indirect way of promoting cooperation in transboundary river management keywords lancang mekong river data sharing information selection cascade multi objective reservoir operation 1 introduction transboundary river basins are simultaneously significant engines of regional economic development crucial sources of local livelihood and critical sites of biodiversity conservations by riparian countries uprety and salman 2011 demand for water energy and food in transboundary river basins has increased significantly over the past decades driven by population growth and economic development mohtar and daher 2019 basheer et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in contrast to domestic water problems which in principle can be solved and controlled within national jurisdictions and their policy making structures approaches for managing transboundary river basins are more complex and more likely to fail bernauer and böhmelt 2020 often resulting in conflicts and aggravated tensions zawahri et al 2016 crossing six riparian countries i e china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is one of the largest international basins in the world and is characterised by the most controversial international resource management lmrb has an annual discharge of 475 km3 and covers an area of about 795 000 km2 providing livelihood resources to approximately 64 8 million people mirumachi 2020 the hydropower potential of the lmrb is around 268 000 gwh year of which around half is already being exploited schmitt et al 2019 the river supports the largest freshwater fishery on earth it is second only to the amazon river in fish species richness serving as an essential source of protein and income for riparian people especially those in the floodplain of cambodia and the mekong delta mrc 2019 winemiller et al 2016 irrigation is the largest water user in the lmrb where the area under irrigation has expanded to over 4 million hectares in 2013 mrc 2019 however preserving the streamflow conditions and riverine ecosystem functioning attracts increasing attention in downstream countries and china in the last decade as a result of increasing energy and economic demands the damming process has been accelerated fig 1 a raising concerns about the resulting impact on riverine ecosystems and food security and worries for potential conflicts barbarossa et al 2020 schmitt et al 2019 orr et al 2012 china has built upstream cascades of reservoirs on the mainstem of lancang which have a capacity of 15 6 gw yu et al 2019a intending to become the battery of south east asia laos proposes a massive expansion of hydropower projects both on the mainstem and on tributaries laos has committed to supplying thailand with 9 gw hydropower by 2025 geheb and suhardiman 2019 cambodia also plans to construct some huge dams along the mekong s mainstem to obtain a significant hydropower production potential wild et al 2016 meanwhile other infrastructure development is ongoing to secure crop production fishery and other sectors and mitigate the adverse effects of expected hydropower developments vietnam has invested in constructing higher dykes to increase crop production in the delta chapman et al 2016 orr et al 2012 suggest that maintaining regional food security in the face of projected fishery losses arising from the 88 new dams planned for the basin by 2030 would require 19 to 63 expansion of agricultural land prior studies have highlighted the importance of coordinated water infrastructure operations in transboundary river basins where water resources are shared and limited vinca et al 2020 sadoff and grey 2005 moreover cooperation among riparian countries is a prerequisite for basin wide coordinated operation riparian countries and international forces are indeed making every attempt to lead this region into peace and prosperity it is now home to eight institutional frameworks among which the most prominent three institutions are the mekong river commission mrc the greater mekong subregion gms and lancang mekong cooperative mechanism lmc williams 2020 these institutional mechanisms can facilitate policy dialogue and coordination thus possibly favouring the harnessing of full beneficial potentials of water infrastructures and improving all riparian countries well being existing scientific literature on transboundary river basins mainly reports centralised approaches based on the assumption of full cooperation among the involved decision makers do et al 2020 yu et al 2019b kahil et al 2018 this perspective leads to ideal performance outlining the upper bound of improvement giuliani and castelletti 2013 however this cooperation is hard hard to realize considering the geopolitical settings with self interested stakeholders and power asymmetry and hard to implement considering the anticipated social and economic investments gleick 2003 therefore it is more of an academic value than a practical significance in reality riparian countries can adopt some soft cooperation measures coordinating and negotiating with each other at different levels between the two extremes of hard cooperation and individualistic strategies daher et al 2019 the soft cooperation path utilizes existing decentralised facilities embraces participatory approaches and delivers diverse services matched to the user s water demands pahl wostl 2007 gleick 2003 for example treaties for joint monitoring and data collection and sharing may be signed by riparian countries bernauer and böhmelt 2020 though seemingly simple and basic data sharing has intrinsic feasibility for functioning as a soft cooperation scheme and creating incremental benefits as each agent s independent and locally optimal strategy is guaranteed giuliani and castelletti 2013 in the lmrb mounting attention has been drawn to soft cooperation data sharing mcpherson and ropicki 2021 mukuyu et al 2020 for example in 2020 china pledged to share year round hydrological data with the mrc after sharing flood season observations for 17 years mrc 2020 mrc members themselves also embrace a set of procedural rules on multilateral data sharing known as the procedures for data and information exchange and sharing mrc 2001 yet in the face of the large availability of data in such a large river system data sharing comes with a cost collecting organising and exchanging the massive amount of information is quite expensive requiring human resources assignments as well as infrastructural and technological investments offerdal 2019 thu and wehn 2016 plengsaeng et al 2014 therefore further research is required to help to determine which information should be exchanged in this soft cooperation not only between china and the mrc but also between the mrc members themselves that might help to resolve or attenuate existing and projected conflicts among riparian nations and or across sectors by bringing the overall system performance closer to the hard cooperation case through the identification of solutions that are geopolitically more feasible in this paper we focus on three cooperation scenarios non cooperation individualism the ideal hard cooperation and the in between soft cooperation that takes advantage of data sharing we present a decision analytic framework 1 to compare the non cooperative and the hard cooperation scenarios thus investigating the potential value of hard cooperation and exploring how trade offs and corresponding conflicts shape among countries and across sectors 2 to retrieve the most effective data sharing selecting strategies in the soft cooperation among riparian countries in terms of moving the performance of the system toward the hard cooperation 3 to refine the policies based on the selected shared data in the soft cooperation scenario and demonstrate how the selected shared information facilitates the system s resource management we establish an optimisation based policy identification approach taking advantage of evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps giuliani et al 2016 and multi master borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2015 to retrieve operation strategies of the lmrb water system in the three scenarios visual analytics are conducted to explore the objective spaces and associated trade offs are analysed we obtain the most effective information subsets to refine policies accordingly through the information selection and assessment isa framework giuliani et al 2015 by comparing the performance of the original and the refined operations we demonstrate how the selected information facilitates the system s resource management the remaining paper is organised as follows the next section introduces the case study and section 3 illustrates the methodology results are reported in section 4 and discussions in section 5 final remarks with further research directions are presented in the last section 2 the lancang mekong river basin with a drainage area of about 795 000 km2 fig 1a the lancang mekong river is the longest in south asia mrc 2010 it originates from the qinghai tibet plateau of china flowing through six countries i e china chn laos lao myanmar mmr thailand tha cambodia khm and vietnam vnm the lmrb can be divided into two sub basins the upper mekong basin also known as the lancang river basin in china and the lower mekong basin covering 24 and 76 of the total drainage area respectively li et al 2017 the annual hydrological cycle is mainly driven by the monsoonal climate and strongly affected by the operation of more than 70 dams lauri et al 2012 li et al 2017 in addition to the six hydropower dams that china has built on the mainstem of the lancang river since 1992 han et al 2019 the construction of dams in downstream countries has developed rapidly increasing the total basin installed capacity to 6400 mw an important hydropower area is the so called 3s i e sesan srepok and sekong river basins where nine dams are currently operated and eleven dams are under construction with a total installed capacity of 3643 mw 60 of 6400 mw piman et al 2013 mrc 2010 besides energy generation food production is another crucial water depending sector consuming approximately 80 90 of the water withdrawn in the basin do et al 2020 mrc 2010 and is used chiefly for rice based traditional irrigation in downstream countries the average annual agricultural water demand in the lower mekong basin is 32 3 13 5 14 7 and 139 1 km3 in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam respectively mrc 2018 the monthly distribution of each country s demand is reported in table s1 finally the lancang mekong river is the second most biodiverse river globally and provides habitats for 877 fish species ziv et al 2012 the preservation of the streamflow conditions and riverine ecosystem functioning is attracting increasing attention in downstream countries and china especially for the critical areas accordingly five spots i e the exit port on the chinese border the main tributaries in laos nam ngum nam ou river and thailand mun chi river the 3s basin and the tonle sap region are selected to represent the consideration of ecosystem conservation they are denoted as the eco node in fig 1b since myanmar s contributions to streamflow and basin area are meagre they are not considered in this study ringler et al 2004 only the river systems of the remaining five countries were thus modelled china laos thailand cambodia and vietnam with the latter four countries hereafter referred to as the mrc countries since the mrc members are working together and seeking to cooperate with china we mainly focus on possible cooperation strategies between these two partial coalitions 3 methodology our multiobjective assessment procedure is composed of four main building blocks i model the multi objective system and design the pareto optimal operating policies in the non cooperative scenario refer to as nc scenario ii design the pareto optimal operating policies in the hard cooperation scenario hc scenario and explore the space for performance improvement between hc and nc scenarios iii select the effective information to be shared for improving the system performance and iv refine the nc operating policies obtained at point ii using the selected information obtained at point iii to demonstrate the soft cooperation scenario sc scenario 3 1 basin model and objectives fig 1 b shows the topology of the model structure used in this study we reproduce the lmrb by a node link network representation the basin model includes the three largest dams on the mainstem of the lancang river in china xiaowan nuozhadu and jinghong reservoirs these dams are also the closest dams to china s border following li et al 2019 eight conceptual dams on the mainstem and tributaries of the mekong river are also considered in this model through the integration of existing and planned dams in downstream countries resulting in 11 reservoirs in the model in total we set active storage values and installed capacities of these conceptual dams equal to the sum of the values of all involved dams in the lower mekong river basin this simplification allows representing the overall effects of these dams on streamflow regulation and hydropower production while maintaining the computational efficiency of the model li et al 2019 the topology also includes the dams that were supposed to be completed in 2020 the storage capacities of all reservoirs in our model are presented in table s2 while installed capacities and active storages are provided in table s3 the model runs on a daily time resolution and includes three types of constraints first the nonnegative agricultural water withdrawal constraints equations set 1 here

we measure the hydro energy sector with respect to hydropower production instead of revenue because the electricity market in the lmrb currently is primarily controlled by the countries governments and electricity is sold at a fixed rate thus maximising hydropower production equals maximising hydropower revenue quinn et al 2017 to compute this objective in each year y of the optimisation horizon y we calculate the annual total hydropower production of reservoir i in country n as φ hydro n i t 1 365 η t i n where η t i n is the production of reservoir i on day t of year y this results in the following objective of j hydro n where i n is the set of reservoirs in country n 6 j hydro n 1 y y 1 y i 1 i n φ hydro n i the second objective j deficit seeks to minimise the average annual squared irrigation deficit over the optimisation horizon defined as eq 7 7 j deficit n 1 y y 1 y 1 12 m 1 12 max w m n ru m y n w m n 0 2 where ru m y n is the irrigation withdrawal of country n in month m of year y and w m n is the irrigation demand of country n in month m we square the monthly irrigation deficit to favour more frequent small shortages over large deficits hashimoto et al 1982 finally the ecological index j ei is an integrated indicator of environment conservation calculated for the eco nodes shown in fig 1 b li et al 2018 j ei l at eco node l is expressed by eqs 8 9 8 j ei l e y 1 2 11 p 1 p ω p a rate p l 9 a rate p l a r p l a n p l a n p l where p is the number of parameters chosen from the indicators of hydrological alteration iha by principal component analysis pca ω p and a rate p l are the weight and the alteration of the pth parameter respectively a r p l and a n p l are the pth parameter s values of the regulated streamflow and the natural streamflow respectively the selected iha parameters are the 90 day maximum low pulse duration high pulse duration number of fluctuations and date of maximum with weight coefficients of 0 76 0 084 0 062 0 049 and 0 045 respectively the selected parameters and weights are chosen according to the kaiser guttman criterion and together they can explain 87 69 of the streamflow s variation li et al 2018 li et al 2019 the available historical streamflow data obtained from the mrc are from gauge stations located on the mainstem of the rivers while streamflow records along the tributaries are unavailable thus we employ the coupled routing and excess storage crest model wang et al 2011 to simulate a natural streamflow time series in the mainstem and tributaries of the lmrb this hydrological model is built and validated upon 35 years of historical daily flows from 1980 to 2014 and verification of its performance is provided in gao et al 2021 considering data availability and reducing computational burden the time horizon in this study is january 2000 to december 2010 both for optimisation and evaluation according to the japan meteorological agency https www coaps fsu edu jma the period 2000 2010 includes contrasting dry and wet years partially caused by the el niño southern oscillation specifically three el niño events and two la niña events took place this decade therefore the representativeness of the current climate state with respect to large scale climate drivers and associated extremes is ensured furthermore a decadal period also guarantees that the average performance of the derived policies in the current system is assessed we use a synthetically generated streamflow ensemble to validate all optimised pareto approximate solutions obtained in the nc scenario to validate our simulation optimisation framework the validation set of correlated streamflows on the mainstem and tributaries of mekong are generated synthetically through the following steps first the modified fractional gaussian noise mfgn method kirsch et al 2013 is adopted to create a 1000 member ensemble of 11 year correlated monthly streamflows this method uses cholesky decomposition to preserve autocorrelation and a simultaneous resampling of historical flows at each site to preserve spatial correlation then monthly streamflow is disaggregated to daily flows following the technique proposed by nowak et al 2010 which proportionally scales historical daily flows at each site from a probabilistically selected month of the historical record such that the synthetic monthly total is preserved finally we randomly selected a 10 member ensemble of 11 year daily streamflow out of all the generated stochastic streamflow time series as the validation set if the solutions achieve similar objective values in the validation and optimisation then the solutions and the simulation optimisation framework are stable and worth trusty in the hc scenario the multiobjective problem is defined at the basin level consisting of three main objectives i e maximising the total hydropower production j hydro total n 1 n j hydro n being n the number of reservoirs minimising average irrigation deficit in the mrc j deficit 1 k k k j deficit k k k l a o t h a k h m v n m and minimising average ei j ei mean 1 l l 1 l j ei l being l the number of eco nodes considered in the basin model full cooperation is not achieved in both nc and sc scenarios thus the objectives are presented separately on the chinese side the objectives include hydropower production j hydro chn n 1 3 j hydro n and ei at jinghong j ei chn on the mrc side the objectives include hydropower production j hydro mrc n 1 k 3 j hydro n average irrigation deficit in the mrc j deficit and average ei j ei mrc 1 l 1 l 1 l 1 j ei l 3 2 operating policy design in different cooperation scenarios 3 2 1 operating policy design in non cooperative nc and soft cooperation sc scenarios the optimal operations release withdrawal decision from the 11 reservoirs and 10 water users of the lmrb in non cooperative nc and soft cooperation sc scenarios are designed through a simulation optimisation framework i e evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps giuliani et al 2016 where the basin model is coupled with a multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2015 to optimise the parameters characterising the operating policies the gaussian radial basis functions rbfs which can represent functions for a large class of problems mhaskar and micchelli 1992 and are demonstrated to be effective in approximating operation policies in water systems quinn et al 2019 are used to parameterise the operating policies the release decisions from the k th reservoirs r t k normalised on 0 1 can be described as eq 10 1 and the water withdrawal decisions of the l th water users near the kth reservoir ru t lk normalised on 0 1 is formulated in eq 10 2 respectively 10 1 r t k i 1 n w i k f i x t k 10 2 ru t lk i 1 n w i lk f i x t k in these equations n number of rbfs f i x t w i k and w i lk the weight of the i th rbf associated with the k th reservoir and l th water user if r t k and ru t lk prescribed by the policy do not meet the physical constraints in the simulation model such as the maximum available water the model would only release withdraw what is physically possible the single rbf is defined as eq 11 11 f i x t k e x p j 1 m x t k j c i j b i j 2 where m is the number of input variables x t k for k th reservoir and x t k j is the j th out of m input variables at time t in nc the input sets for each reservoir water user are denoted as the basic inputs including the day of the year and the reservoir s storage the input sets are enlarged to basic inputs in sc plus the selected information subset i i t from additional information set ξ t the information selection procedure is described in section 3 3 b i j and c i j are the radii and centres of the i th rbf associated with the j th input the parameter vector θ is therefore defined as θ c i j b i j w i l i 1 n j 1 m l 1 21 the optimal values of the policy parameters θ are determined by solving the following optimisation problem 12 θ arg min θ j θ where the decision variables are the policy parameters θ θ the objective functions are the operating objectives j e g j p j hydro chn j ei chn j hydro mrc j deficit j ei mrc defined in nc and sc scenarios and the problem is constrained by the dynamics of the system presented in eq 1 5 we adopt a multiobjective optimisation approach to optimise the policy parameters using the multi master borg moea hadka and reed 2015 which is a hierarchical parallelisation of the borg moea hadka and reed 2013 the multi master version has implemented multiple master workers of the borg moea parallelly it uses a global controller node to maintain the global archive of the best solutions and provide guidance for restarting the pre converged masters hadka and reed 2015 previous studies have shown that the multi master borg moea enhances the reliability of attaining high quality approximations to the pareto optimal set for challenging real world problems while also largely improving the computational efficiency quinn et al 2017 giuliani et al 2015 we use multi master borg with 4 islands and run 15 random algorithm trails of 40 000 000 function evaluations per island to improve solution diversity and reduce the impact of randomness the final pareto front is computed merging the fronts obtained for each optimisation seed considering only the extracted non dominated solutions 3 2 2 operating policy design in hard cooperation hc in the hard cooperation scenario instead of using rbfs to describe the operating policies of the lmrb the vector describing the release withdrawal sequence vector from the 11 reservoirs and 10 water users i e r r t k ru t m t 1 h k 1 11 m 1 10 are directly designed through the simulation optimisation framework the optimal operating policy in hc i e the value of the release withdrawal sequence vector r is determined by solving the following optimisation problem 13 r arg min r j r arg min r j hydro total j ei mean j deficit because j ei mean is not time separable and considering the computing efficiency as the release withdrawal sequence is optimised directly this optimisation is achieved using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 through simulating the system constrained by the dynamics of the system presented in eq 1 5 3 3 information selection in this study we identify a set of candidate information i t ξ t known at time t when operational decisions are made which can be effective in improving the operation of the systems the i t includes the data shared between the countries including daily rainfall observations in china s gauges and reservoir storages see table 1 and the date of the year following the guidelines and framework provided in giuliani et al 2015 galelli et al 2014 the iterative input selection iis algorithm galelli and castelletti 2013b combined with extremely randomised trees galelli and castelletti 2013a is applied to select the subset i t i containing the most informative variables which can be applied in the sc scenarios 3 4 metrics of assessing the value of information and cooperation following giuliani et al 2015 and zitzler et al 2000 three indicators are adopted to assess the value of information and cooperation in sc and hc compared to nc the hypervolume indicator hv the minimum distance from the target solution and the average distance from the target solution the hv measures the volume of object space dominated by an approximation set with hv calculated as the difference between the best known pareto optimal front in our case the hc sets and the considered approximation sets sc and nc zitzler et al 2003 the latter two distance indicators are used to account for the specific advance toward a pre specified target hc solution see giuliani et al 2015 for details 3 5 data based on the actual negotiations in the lmrb we consider the following candidate variables potentially valuable for sharing and improving the system performance the storage of all the reservoirs in the basin model and the daily precipitation observations in china the daily streamflow data of the lancang mekong river from 1980 to 2014 the used irrigation water demand and the reservoir data were obtained from mrc http portal mrcmekong org index mrc 2018 and lancang river hydropower inc the daily precipitation observations in 34 rain gauges from 1980 to 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the dam construction scenario is that to be completed in 2020 4 results the set of ncs is obtained via two separate optimisations one for china j 1 j hydro chn j ei chn and one for the mrc j 2 j hydro mrc j deficit j ei mrc from upstream to downstream as mentioned earlier these policies are conditioned only upon the day of the year and the reservoir s storage and are designed via emodps the hcs set is obtained via nsga ii in a single run of optimisation j j hydro total j ei mean j deficit assuming a perfect foresight of the 11 year management horizon and full cooperation across the basin the sc j j hydro chn j ei chn j hydro mrc j deficit j ei mrc set is obtained via emodps in one single optimisation apart from the basic information used in the nc scenario the selected shared information is directly used to condition the operations the settings of the experiments are summarised in table 2 4 1 conflicts and synergies in the lmrb fig 2 presents the pareto fronts in upstream china in the nc and hc scenarios the optimisation objectives in hc scenarios are formulated at the basin scale here we extract the pareto fronts of china s two objective values the two scenarios show a clear trade off between china s hydropower production and ecological preservation see the orange dots and blue dots respectively thus in line with previous studies giuliani and castelletti 2013 li et al 2018 li and zhao 2016 the visual comparison between the two pareto fronts also shows the potential space for improved hydropower production and ecological preservation generated by the perfect knowledge of future inflow conditions hc scenario we select the two extreme solutions maximising j hydro chn and minimising j ei chn to illustrate the impacts of china s operations on the mrc s water system performance the release sequences in these two solutions are used as inflows to the mrc the corresponding results are presented in fig 3 using parallel axes plots each coloured line in these plots corresponds to different trade offs in the operating policy which intersects each vertical axis at the value it achieves for the objective that the axis represents solutions from the case when china maximises j hydro chn are shown in blue lines from when china minimises j ei chn in green lines the difference in the mrc s hydropower production potential for the two cases is relatively significant when china aims to maximise hydropower production the mrc can also obtain a higher hydropower production implying a synergetic effect between the upstream and downstream hydropower sectors this offers space for hydropower cooperation between upstream and downstream hydropower and ecological preservation also present conflicts in the mrc a weak yet nonlinear trade off is observed between irrigation and hydropower as streamflow regulation for producing hydropower offers the possibility for meeting irrigation demands in dry seasons the control policy solutions of china and mrc in the nc scenarios are validated using the synthetic validation set with 10 times as many ensemble members of the optimisation set of historical simulated natural streamflow the results are shown in fig s1 where each plot represents a different objective overall the objectives present stability as the points cluster around the 1 1 line indicating that the performance of the optimised control policies is stable and the simulation optimisation framework is reliable fig 4 compares the nc and hc solutions at the basin and nation coalition levels i e china and the mrc the hc solutions can achieve a very low irrigation deficit and a higher hydropower generation at the basin level at the cost of sacrificing the ecological objective both upstream and downstream the gap between the pareto fronts of the hc and nc solutions suggests that considerable improvement can be achieved through basin wide cooperation and knowledge of the future inflow accordingly in the following sections we focus the analysis on a single target hc solution shown as the bold red lines in fig 4 representing a potentially good compromise between the three main objectives at the basin level this solution has the minimum euclidean distance to the ideal point in the normalised objective space and thus represents a balanced solution 4 2 most informative policy inputs to analyse the value of information we first use the iis algorithm to select the most important variables for explaining the release decisions of the mrc s reservoirs in the target hc solution from the candidate dataset shared between the countries including daily storage of all the reservoirs in the basin model daily rainfall observations in china and the day of the year see table 1 fig 5 reports the selection results for three typical reservoirs in the model i e laos reservoirs located on the mainstem vietnam s reservoir in the 3s basin and cambodia s reservoir on the mainstem these results are obtained via 40 runs of the iis algorithm to filter the randomness associated with the extremely randomised tree algorithm galelli and castelletti 2013b the selection results for other reservoirs are presented in supporting information fig s2 as shown in fig 5 the selection process is tentatively stopped after selecting the first six variables as they already explain a rather high percentage of the output variance above 75 for the mrc s reservoirs located relatively upstream the operation of china s large reservoirs has a significant impact for example for laos reservoirs on the mainstem the release sequence can be explained by nuozadu s storage s t nuozadu date of the year t storage of laos reservoir on the tributary s t l a o t the storage of the lao s reservoir on the mainstem s t l a o m and the daily rainfall observations from a nearby gauge in china although jinghong s storage s t jinghong is selected and ranks right after s t nuozadu its contribution is almost zero this is due to the high correlation between s t jinghong and s t nuozadu it is worth noting that s t nuozadu ranks first even higher than s t l a o m suggesting that for mrc s reservoir located in the upper mainstem storage information of china s big reservoirs is important but a different pattern appears for the downstream 3s basin which is the largest tributary of the mekong river taking vietnam s reservoir in the 3s basin as an example the first five selected variables are the date of the year its storage s t v n m 3 s the reservoir storage of cambodia and laos in the 3s basin s t k h m 3 s and s t l a o 3 s and the storage of cambodia s reservoir downstream s t k h m t the results for other reservoirs in the 3s basin are similar see fig s2 this suggests that the release decisions in the 3s basin are affected mainly by local information such as the reservoirs nearby since the capacity is rather small for the two most downstream cambodian reservoirs their operations are primarily explained by the day of the year and their own storage i e r2 greater than 90 indicating that any upstream information is not very valuable for these reservoirs in conclusion china s information is beneficial for the upstream mrc countries such as laos but has less impact on the downstream mrc countries 4 3 quantifying the value of shared information in this section we use the first five selected variables from the shared information and the basic inputs which allows explaining cumulatively 73 95 of the target releases as the set of policy inputs i e the sc scenario to analyse the effects of shared information in terms of the considered objectives i e j hydro chn j ei chn j hydro mrc j ei mrc and j deficit mrc results show that the system s performance improves under sc compared to the nc this improvement is quantified using three metrics reported in fig 6 b d the hypervolume increases from 0 15 to 0 33 i e 120 the minimum distance and average distance decrease from 0 22 to 0 10 i e 55 and from 0 74 to 0 47 i e 36 when moving from the nc to the sc yet the incremented benefits do not distribute uniformly across the five objectives since china and the mrc act independently china s maximum hydropower production and minimum ecological alteration do not change in sc compared to the nc scenario see fig 6 a sharing data between china and the mrc and among the mrc members allows a notable improvement on the mrc s objectives especially for the hydropower production the maximum value of j hydro mrc increases from 20 04 twh to 33 21 twh fig 7 a and 7 b report the specific hydropower production of each country in sc in terms of the extreme cases in which china s and mrc s hydropower production are maximised respectively mrc experience increases in hydropower to a different degree in these two cases i e 5 39 twh and 7 37 twh respectively among the four mrc members laos produces the most considerable portion of hydropower followed by cambodia in terms of both absolute and incremental value the hydropower production of thailand and vietnam remain almost unchanged across the scenarios such results suggest that the data sharing procedure can be highly beneficial for the hydropower sector this can be attributed to three factors 1 from the iis algorithm selection results the information about the big upstream reservoirs and rainfall data are recognised as informative for the operations of reservoirs in laos which holds the main potential in hydropower production 2 sharing data between china and laos can facilitate the reaction of downstream operators i e laos to upstream operations i e china and 3 for the small downstream reservoirs the aforementioned data is less valuable thus sharing data does not seem necessary since the capacity of these reservoirs is somewhat limited in fig 7 b when j hydro mrc is maximised laos and cambodia obtain considerable hydropower production increments 6 19 twh and 1 12 twh respectively while china s hydropower only decreases slightly i e 0 83 twh this indicates that the mrc can gain more hydropower increase if china cooperates 5 discussion 5 1 political benefits and obstacles of data sharing although the focus of our study is the value of soft cooperation via data sharing in improving water management we should bear in mind that such value reaches far beyond this scope the exchange of water resources data among the basin could lay firm foundations for broader cooperation and agreement formation in transboundary contexts for instance in the rhine river basin before in depth cooperation through a legally instituted regional body was established in 1986 the riparian countries spent more than a dozen years simply sharing information gerlak et al 2011 moreover information exchange can constitute a basis of mutual trust and transparency among the riparian countries assuring joint compliance without mutual trust among nations the degradation of the transboundary river basin s cooperation stage is likely to take place for example in the nile river basin conflicts were triggered again in 2014 due to lost trust among the states yu et al 2019a transparent information acquisition and interpretation are beneficial for developing a sense of reciprocity among countries and help them form more solid and frequent communication while sharing data is promising many other obstacles prevent this policy to be implemented efficiently in a complex geopolitical context data can sometimes serve as a weapon whipping up public opinions to blame other countries for causing adverse effects in a transboundary river basin setting timmerman and langaas 2004 for example accusing thailand of dragging her feet and postponing the establishment of flow regime regulations plengsaeng et al 2014 moreover the institutional context of the lmrb where eight institutional and legal frameworks coexist is complex and crowding williams 2020 in terms of data sharing and the development of infrastructures and technologies these institutions coupled effects remain unclear sharing data is just the first step towards more efficient management and other supporting measures need to be in place for example the yunnan province in china where the lancang river flows through curtails its hydroelectricity in recent years because of the inconsistency between hydropower development and grid planning and construction liu et al 2018 chowdhury et al 2020 demonstrates that the limited transmission capacity between thailand and laos leads to congestion problems and curbs hydropower benefits a coordinated transmission network expansion is essential to assure the power dispatch and consumption and support the planned hydropower capacity expansion in the lmrb moreover coordinating hydropower with other power sources would be beneficial for assuring the stability of the power supply the reformation of the countries electricity mechanism to allow flexible electricity markets to function may also fertilise the utilisation of enhanced electricity generation 5 2 the value of streamflow forecasts since we assumed perfect knowledge of future streamflow in the hc scenario to explore the upper bound of the system s performance and the improvement of china s pareto front is noted due to the perfect foresight of future streamflow see fig 2 it is inferred that the streamflow forecasts could be beneficial but the value of this information is problem specific and usually depends upon the dynamics and the objectives considered here we analyse a candidate set of local streamflow forecasts with lead times ranging from one week to two months to illustrate which lead time would be beneficial in the context of lmrb details of the data and methods are presented in supplementary text s1 long term forecasts are given high priority for reservoirs with large storage capacities see fig s3 this is in line with previous studies anghileri et al 2016 turner et al 2020 the first five selected variables from the local streamflow forecasts with different lead times and the basic input were then used together in each set of the policy input to derive the improved operating policies referred to as sf scenario by conditioning the operations on the selected forecasts china s reservoirs can produce more hydropower the maximum j hydro chn being 63 23 twh and 64 88 twh in nc and sf respectively see fig s4 mrc s maximum hydropower production also increases while the extent is not as large as in sc the maximum j hydro mrc being 28 43 twh and 31 17 twh in sf and sc scenarios respectively however the minimum average squared irrigation deficit decreases considerably from 0 16 to 0 10 i e 37 5 the reason can be seen in fig s5 which presents the trajectories of each country s irrigation withdrawal and demand irrigation deficit mainly occurs during the dry season from december to april and is severe in cambodia and vietnam the upstream countries even tend to over withdraw water sometimes leaving less water available for downstream countries for example thailand withdraws more water than needed in april and may leaving cambodia and vietnam suffering from irrigation deficits after introducing the local streamflow forecasts into the policy inputs the irrigation withdrawal trajectories of laos thailand and cambodia become closer to the hc trajectories more water can be used for irrigation in the dry seasons especially for the two downstream countries i e cambodia and vietnam with large demand this indicates that the irrigation situation is more balanced across the basin using local streamflow forecasts based on the illustrated results it is inferred that local streamflow forecast is of promising value for agriculture this also implies that different kinds of information could be valuable in improving the system s performance in different aspects and should be investigated case by case 6 conclusions starting from the ongoing cooperation process in the lmrb we focus on the potential for using shared data to improve the operations of this transboundary multi purpose water system through designing the operating policies in the hard cooperation scenario in which both full cooperation and perfect knowledge of future inflow conditions are assumed and in the non cooperative scenario in which only basic local information is known and no cooperation between upstream and downstream is enforced we identified a large gap between the basic non cooperative operations and the perfect scenario thus providing evidence for potential improvements especially in terms of hydropower production and irrigation withdrawal at the basin level targeted at a balanced hc solution we selected valuable variables for better informing the operators decisions these consist of shared data from other countries and vary for reservoirs with different capacities and locations for the mrc s reservoirs located relatively upstream such as laos reservoir on the mainstem the information about big upstream reservoirs i e information about china s reservoirs is very important moving downstream the information that matters more is that of nearby reservoirs rather than of the big reservoirs but this importance gradually impairs with the distance results show that sharing data from other sources is not very informative for the not very large and downstream cambodia s reservoirs these shared data can considerably improve mrc s hydropower production because the main hydropower contributor in the mrc laos has more information from upstream china and can thus react more efficiently to explore additional space for the system s performance improvement we also consider local streamflow forecast as an additional piece of information we found that consideration and selection of streamflow forecasts not only create an increase in hydropower production at the basin level but more importantly help to facilitate the reduction of irrigation deficit in summary our results suggest that the operation of the lmrb water system and other similar river basins would benefit from using shared data in determining the most efficient allocation across sectors and countries although the political background is complex and the representation of the water management issue is more complicated than it could be mimicked by the model description our study highlights a possible path towards a more cooperative and efficient selection of management options credit

3691,water resources management in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is challenging in face of the complex trans national geopolitical context the acceleration of hydropower dam expansion and the growing demands for energy food and riverine ecosystem preservation across the basin centralised management through coordinated operation of all the basin water infrastructures hard cooperation across the river basin is ideal but hard to achieve given the existing geopolitical context of the region to overcome these barriers and facilitate a more adaptive and reliable operation of the lmrb s water system this paper focuses on the concept of soft cooperation i e the idea of indirectly fostering cooperation by sharing data across countries to inform the non cooperative or independent operation of their systems here we first quantify existing riparian conflicts and synergies for the non cooperative scenario where upstream and downstream act independently without any form of cooperation and for the hard cooperation configuration where an ideal centralised operator jointly operates all the infrastructures then a soft cooperation scheme assuming data sharing across riparian countries is evaluated the most effective and informative data is selected via machine learning and used to inform the design of the river reservoir system operation via evolutionary multiobjective direct policy search results show that the riparian conflicts around water mainly exist between the sectors i e hydropower production vs ecosystem conservation rather than among countries for reservoirs with various capacities and locations the value of information varies generally sharing data about the water currently available in the different river storages results in a large improvement in hydropower production this study highlights the value of appropriate data sharing and selection in water system operation as an indirect way of promoting cooperation in transboundary river management keywords

economic development crucial sources of local livelihood and critical sites of biodiversity conservations by riparian countries uprety and salman 2011 demand for water energy and food in transboundary river basins has increased significantly over the past decades driven by population growth and economic development mohtar and daher 2019 basheer et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in contrast to domestic water problems which in principle can be solved and controlled within national jurisdictions and their policy making structures approaches for managing transboundary river basins are more complex and more likely to fail bernauer and böhmelt 2020 often resulting in conflicts and aggravated tensions zawahri et al 2016 crossing six riparian countries i e china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is one of the largest international basins in the world and is characterised by the most controversial international resource management lmrb has an annual discharge of 475 km3 and covers an area of about 795 000 km2 providing livelihood resources to approximately 64 8 million people mirumachi 2020 the hydropower potential of the lmrb is around 268 000 gwh year of which around half is already being exploited schmitt et al 2019 the river supports the largest freshwater fishery on earth it is second only to the amazon river in fish species richness serving as an essential source of protein and income for riparian people especially those in the floodplain of cambodia and the mekong delta mrc 2019 winemiller et al 2016 irrigation is the largest water user in the lmrb where the area under irrigation has expanded to over 4 million hectares in 2013 mrc 2019 however preserving the streamflow conditions and riverine ecosystem functioning attracts increasing attention in downstream countries and china in the last decade as a result of increasing energy and economic demands the damming process has been accelerated fig 1 a raising concerns about the resulting impact on riverine ecosystems and food security and worries for potential conflicts barbarossa et al 2020 schmitt et al 2019 orr et al 2012 china has built upstream cascades of reservoirs on the mainstem of lancang which have a capacity of 15 6 gw yu et al 2019a intending to become the battery of south east asia laos proposes a massive expansion of hydropower projects both on the mainstem and on tributaries laos has committed to supplying thailand with 9 gw hydropower by 2025 geheb and suhardiman 2019 cambodia also plans to construct some huge dams along the mekong s mainstem to obtain a significant hydropower production potential wild et al 2016 meanwhile other infrastructure development is ongoing to secure crop production fishery and other sectors and mitigate the adverse effects of expected hydropower developments vietnam has invested in constructing higher dykes to increase crop production in the delta chapman et al 2016 orr et al 2012 suggest that maintaining regional food security in the face of projected fishery losses arising from the 88 new dams planned for the basin by 2030 would require 19 to 63 expansion of agricultural land prior studies have highlighted the importance of coordinated water infrastructure operations in transboundary river basins where water resources are shared and limited vinca et al 2020 sadoff and grey 2005 moreover cooperation among riparian countries is a prerequisite for basin wide coordinated operation riparian countries and international forces are indeed making every attempt to lead this region into peace and prosperity it is now home to eight institutional frameworks among which the most prominent three institutions are the mekong river commission mrc the greater mekong subregion gms and lancang mekong cooperative mechanism lmc williams 2020 these institutional mechanisms can facilitate policy dialogue and coordination thus possibly favouring the harnessing of full beneficial potentials of water infrastructures and improving all riparian countries well being existing scientific literature on transboundary river basins mainly reports centralised approaches based on the assumption of full cooperation among the involved decision makers do et al 2020 yu et al 2019b kahil et al 2018 this perspective leads to ideal performance outlining the upper bound of improvement giuliani and castelletti 2013 however this cooperation is hard hard to realize considering the geopolitical settings with self interested stakeholders and power asymmetry and hard to implement considering the anticipated social and economic investments gleick 2003 therefore it is more of an academic value than a practical significance in reality riparian countries can adopt some soft cooperation measures coordinating and negotiating with each other at different levels between the two extremes of hard cooperation and individualistic strategies daher et al 2019 the soft cooperation path utilizes existing decentralised facilities embraces participatory approaches and delivers diverse services matched to the user s water demands pahl wostl 2007 gleick 2003 for example treaties for joint monitoring and data collection and sharing may be signed by riparian countries bernauer and böhmelt 2020 though seemingly simple and basic data sharing has intrinsic feasibility for functioning as a soft cooperation scheme and creating incremental benefits as each agent s independent and locally optimal strategy is guaranteed giuliani and castelletti 2013 in the lmrb mounting attention has been drawn to soft cooperation data sharing mcpherson and ropicki 2021 mukuyu et al 2020 for example in 2020 china pledged to share year round hydrological data with the mrc after sharing flood season observations for 17 years mrc 2020 mrc members themselves also embrace a set of procedural rules on multilateral data sharing known as the procedures for data and information exchange and sharing mrc 2001 yet in the face of the large availability of data in such a large river system data sharing comes with a cost collecting organising and exchanging the massive amount of information is quite expensive requiring human resources assignments as well as infrastructural and technological investments offerdal 2019 thu and wehn 2016 plengsaeng et al 2014 therefore further research is required to help to determine which information should be exchanged in this soft cooperation not only between china and the mrc but also between the mrc members themselves that might help to resolve or attenuate existing and projected conflicts among riparian nations and or across sectors by bringing the overall system performance closer to the hard cooperation case through the identification of solutions that are geopolitically more feasible in this paper we focus on three cooperation scenarios non cooperation individualism the ideal hard cooperation and the in between soft cooperation that takes advantage of data sharing we present a decision analytic framework 1 to compare the non cooperative and the hard cooperation scenarios thus investigating the potential value of hard cooperation and exploring how trade offs and corresponding conflicts shape among countries and across sectors 2 to retrieve the most effective data sharing selecting strategies in the soft cooperation among riparian countries in terms of moving the performance of the system toward the hard cooperation 3 to refine the policies based on the selected shared data in the soft cooperation scenario and demonstrate how the selected shared information facilitates the system s resource management we establish an optimisation based policy identification approach taking advantage of evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps giuliani et al 2016 and multi master borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2015 to retrieve operation strategies of the lmrb water system in the three scenarios visual analytics are conducted to explore the objective spaces and associated trade offs are analysed we obtain the most effective information subsets to refine policies accordingly through the information selection and assessment isa framework giuliani et al 2015 by comparing the performance of the original and the refined operations we demonstrate how the selected information facilitates the system s resource management the remaining paper is organised as follows the next section introduces the case study and section 3 illustrates the methodology results are reported in section 4 and discussions in section 5 final remarks with further research directions are presented in the last section 2 the lancang mekong river basin with a drainage area of about 795 000 km2 fig 1a the lancang mekong river is the longest in south asia mrc 2010 it originates from the qinghai tibet plateau of china flowing through six countries i e china chn laos lao myanmar mmr thailand tha cambodia khm and vietnam vnm the lmrb can be divided into two sub basins the upper mekong basin also known as the lancang river basin in china and the lower mekong basin covering 24 and 76 of the total drainage area respectively li et al 2017 the annual hydrological cycle is mainly driven by the monsoonal climate and strongly affected by the operation of more than 70 dams lauri et al 2012 li et al 2017 in addition to the six hydropower dams that china has built on the mainstem of the lancang river since 1992 han et al 2019 the construction of dams in downstream countries has developed rapidly increasing the total basin installed capacity to 6400 mw an important hydropower area is the so called 3s i e sesan srepok and sekong river basins where nine dams are currently operated and eleven dams are under construction with a total installed capacity of 3643 mw 60 of 6400 mw piman et al 2013 mrc 2010 besides energy generation food production is another crucial water depending sector consuming approximately 80 90 of the water withdrawn in the basin do et al 2020 mrc 2010 and is used chiefly for rice based traditional irrigation in downstream countries the average annual agricultural water demand in the lower mekong basin is 32 3 13 5 14 7 and 139 1 km3 in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam respectively mrc 2018 the monthly distribution of each country s demand is reported in table s1 finally the lancang mekong river is the second most biodiverse river globally and provides habitats for 877 fish species ziv et al 2012 the preservation of the streamflow conditions and riverine ecosystem functioning is attracting increasing attention in downstream countries and china especially for the critical areas accordingly five spots i e the exit port on the chinese border the main tributaries in laos nam ngum nam ou river and thailand mun chi river the 3s basin and the tonle sap region are selected to represent the consideration of ecosystem conservation they are denoted as the eco node in fig 1b since myanmar s contributions to streamflow and basin area are meagre they are not considered in this study ringler et al 2004 only the river systems of the remaining five countries were thus modelled china laos thailand cambodia and vietnam with the latter four countries hereafter referred to as the mrc countries since the mrc members are working together and seeking to cooperate with china we mainly focus on possible cooperation strategies between these two partial coalitions 3 methodology our multiobjective assessment procedure is composed of four main building blocks i model the multi objective system and design the pareto optimal operating policies in the non cooperative scenario refer to as nc scenario ii design the pareto optimal operating policies in the hard cooperation scenario hc scenario and explore the space for performance improvement between hc and nc scenarios iii select the effective information to be shared for improving the system performance and iv refine the nc operating policies obtained at point ii using the selected information obtained at point iii to demonstrate the soft cooperation scenario sc scenario 3 1 basin model and objectives fig 1 b shows the topology of the model structure used in this study we reproduce the lmrb by a node link network representation the basin model includes the three largest dams on the mainstem of the lancang river in china xiaowan nuozhadu and jinghong reservoirs these dams are also the closest dams to china s border following li et al 2019 eight conceptual dams on the mainstem and tributaries of the mekong river are also considered in this model through the integration of existing and planned dams in downstream countries resulting in 11 reservoirs in the model in total we set active storage values and installed capacities of these conceptual dams equal to the sum of the values of all involved dams in the lower mekong river basin this simplification allows representing the overall effects of these dams on streamflow regulation and hydropower production while maintaining the computational efficiency of the model li et al 2019 the topology also includes the dams that were supposed to be completed in 2020 the storage capacities of all reservoirs in our model are presented in table s2 while installed capacities and active storages are provided in table s3 the model runs on a daily time resolution and includes three types of constraints first the nonnegative agricultural water withdrawal constraints equations set 1 here

notations for reservoirs and water users please refer to fig 1 b as anticipated in section 2 and following li et al 2019 we consider three objectives maximising hydropower production j hydro minimising irrigation deficit j deficit and minimising ecological index j ei the first objective j hydro seeks to maximise the reservoir s hydropower production over the simulated streamflow sequences we measure the hydro energy sector with respect to hydropower production instead of revenue because the electricity market in the lmrb currently is primarily controlled by the countries governments and electricity is sold at a fixed rate thus maximising hydropower production equals maximising hydropower revenue quinn et al 2017 to compute this objective in each year y of the optimisation horizon y we calculate the annual total hydropower production of reservoir i in country n as φ hydro n i t 1 365 η t i n where η t i n is the production of reservoir i on day t of year y this results in the following objective of j hydro n where i n is the set of reservoirs in country n 6 j hydro n 1 y y 1 y i 1 i n φ hydro n i the second objective j deficit seeks to minimise the average annual squared irrigation deficit over the optimisation horizon defined as eq 7 7 j deficit n 1 y y 1 y 1 12 m 1 12 max w m n ru m y n w m n 0 2 where ru m y n is the irrigation withdrawal of country n in month m of year y and w m n is the irrigation demand of country n in month m we square the monthly irrigation deficit to favour more frequent small shortages over large deficits hashimoto et al 1982 finally the ecological index j ei is an integrated indicator of environment conservation calculated for the eco nodes shown in fig 1 b li et al 2018 j ei l at eco node l is expressed by eqs 8 9 8 j ei l e y 1 2 11 p 1 p ω p a rate p l 9 a rate p l a r p l a n p l a n p l where p is the number of parameters chosen from the indicators of hydrological alteration iha by principal component analysis pca ω p and a rate p l are the weight and the alteration of the pth parameter respectively a r p l and a n p l are the pth parameter s values of the regulated streamflow and the natural streamflow respectively the selected iha parameters are the 90 day maximum low pulse duration high pulse duration number of fluctuations and date of maximum with weight coefficients of 0 76 0 084 0 062 0 049 and 0 045 respectively the selected parameters and weights are chosen according to the kaiser guttman criterion and together they can explain 87 69 of the streamflow s variation li et al 2018 li et al 2019 the available historical streamflow data obtained from the mrc are from gauge stations located on the mainstem of the rivers while streamflow records along the tributaries are unavailable thus we employ the coupled routing and excess storage crest model wang et al 2011 to simulate a natural streamflow time series in the mainstem and tributaries of the lmrb this hydrological model is built and validated upon 35 years of historical daily flows from 1980 to 2014 and verification of its performance is provided in gao et al 2021 considering data availability and reducing computational burden the time horizon in this study is january 2000 to december 2010 both for optimisation and evaluation according to the japan meteorological agency https www coaps fsu edu jma the period 2000 2010 includes contrasting dry and wet years partially caused by the el niño southern oscillation specifically three el niño events and two la niña events took place this decade therefore the representativeness of the current climate state with respect to large scale climate drivers and associated extremes is ensured furthermore a decadal period also guarantees that the average performance of the derived policies in the current system is assessed we use a synthetically generated streamflow ensemble to validate all optimised pareto approximate solutions obtained in the nc scenario to validate our simulation optimisation framework the validation set of correlated streamflows on the mainstem and tributaries of mekong are generated synthetically through the following steps first the modified fractional gaussian noise mfgn method kirsch et al 2013 is adopted to create a 1000 member ensemble of 11 year correlated monthly streamflows this method uses cholesky decomposition to preserve autocorrelation and a simultaneous resampling of historical flows at each site to preserve spatial correlation then monthly streamflow is disaggregated to daily flows following the technique proposed by nowak et al 2010 which proportionally scales historical daily flows at each site from a probabilistically selected month of the historical record such that the synthetic monthly total is preserved finally we randomly selected a 10 member ensemble of 11 year daily streamflow out of all the generated stochastic streamflow time series as the validation set if the solutions achieve similar objective values in the validation and optimisation then the solutions and the simulation optimisation framework are stable and worth trusty in the hc scenario the multiobjective problem is defined at the basin level consisting of three main objectives i e maximising the total hydropower production j hydro total n 1 n j hydro n being n the number of reservoirs minimising average irrigation deficit in the mrc j deficit 1 k k k j deficit k k k l a o t h a k h m v n m and minimising average ei j ei mean 1 l l 1 l j ei l being l the number of eco nodes considered in the basin model full cooperation is not achieved in both nc and sc scenarios thus the objectives are presented separately on the chinese side the objectives include hydropower production j hydro chn n 1 3 j hydro n and ei at jinghong j ei chn on the mrc side the objectives include hydropower production j hydro mrc n 1 k 3 j hydro n average irrigation deficit in the mrc j deficit and average ei j ei mrc 1 l 1 l 1 l 1 j ei l 3 2 operating policy design in different cooperation scenarios 3 2 1 operating policy design in non cooperative nc and soft cooperation sc scenarios the optimal operations release withdrawal decision from the 11 reservoirs and 10 water users of the lmrb in non cooperative nc and soft cooperation sc scenarios are designed through a simulation optimisation framework i e evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps giuliani et al 2016 where the basin model is coupled with a multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea hadka and reed 2015 to optimise the parameters characterising the operating policies the gaussian radial basis functions rbfs which can represent functions for a large class of problems mhaskar and micchelli 1992 and are demonstrated to be effective in approximating operation policies in water systems quinn et al 2019 are used to parameterise the operating policies the release decisions from the k th reservoirs r t k normalised on 0 1 can be described as eq 10 1 and the water withdrawal decisions of the l th water users near the kth reservoir ru t lk normalised on 0 1 is formulated in eq 10 2 respectively 10 1 r t k i 1 n w i k f i x t k 10 2 ru t lk i 1 n w i lk f i x t k in these equations n number of rbfs f i x t w i k and w i lk the weight of the i th rbf associated with the k th reservoir and l th water user if r t k and ru t lk prescribed by the policy do not meet the physical constraints in the simulation model such as the maximum available water the model would only release withdraw what is physically possible the single rbf is defined as eq 11 11 f i x t k e x p j 1 m x t k j c i j b i j 2 where m is the number of input variables x t k for k th reservoir and x t k j is the j th out of m input variables at time t in nc the input sets for each reservoir water user are denoted as the basic inputs including the day of the year and the reservoir s storage the input sets are enlarged to basic inputs in sc plus the selected information subset i i t from additional information set ξ t the information selection procedure is described in section 3 3 b i j and c i j are the radii and centres of the i th rbf associated with the j th input the parameter vector θ is therefore defined as θ c i j b i j w i l i 1 n j 1 m l 1 21 the optimal values of the policy parameters θ are determined by solving the following optimisation problem 12 θ arg min θ j θ where the decision variables are the policy parameters θ θ the objective functions are the operating objectives j e g j p j hydro chn j ei chn j hydro mrc j deficit j ei mrc defined in nc and sc scenarios and the problem is constrained by the dynamics of the system presented in eq 1 5 we adopt a multiobjective optimisation approach to optimise the policy parameters using the multi master borg moea hadka and reed 2015 which is a hierarchical parallelisation of the borg moea hadka and reed 2013 the multi master version has implemented multiple master workers of the borg moea parallelly it uses a global controller node to maintain the global archive of the best solutions and provide guidance for restarting the pre converged masters hadka and reed 2015 previous studies have shown that the multi master borg moea enhances the reliability of attaining high quality approximations to the pareto optimal set for challenging real world problems while also largely improving the computational efficiency quinn et al 2017 giuliani et al 2015 we use multi master borg with 4 islands and run 15 random algorithm trails of 40 000 000 function evaluations per island to improve solution diversity and reduce the impact of randomness the final pareto front is computed merging the fronts obtained for each optimisation seed considering only the extracted non dominated solutions 3 2 2 operating policy design in hard cooperation hc in the hard cooperation scenario instead of using rbfs to describe the operating policies of the lmrb the vector describing the release withdrawal sequence vector from the 11 reservoirs and 10 water users i e r r t k ru t m t 1 h k 1 11 m 1 10 are directly designed through the simulation optimisation framework the optimal operating policy in hc i e the value of the release withdrawal sequence vector r is determined by solving the following optimisation problem 13 r arg min r j r arg min r j hydro total j ei mean j deficit because j ei mean is not time separable and considering the computing efficiency as the release withdrawal sequence is optimised directly this optimisation is achieved using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 through simulating the system constrained by the dynamics of the system presented in eq 1 5 3 3 information selection in this study we identify a set of candidate information i t ξ t known at time t when operational decisions are made which can be effective in improving the operation of the systems the i t includes the data shared between the countries including daily rainfall observations in china s gauges and reservoir storages see table 1 and the date of the year following the guidelines and framework provided in giuliani et al 2015 galelli et al 2014 the iterative input selection iis algorithm galelli and castelletti 2013b combined with extremely randomised trees galelli and castelletti 2013a is applied to select the subset i t i containing the most informative variables which can be applied in the sc scenarios 3 4 metrics of assessing the value of information and cooperation following giuliani et al 2015 and zitzler et al 2000 three indicators are adopted to assess the value of information and cooperation in sc and hc compared to nc the hypervolume indicator hv the minimum distance from the target solution and the average distance from the target solution the hv measures the volume of object space dominated by an approximation set with hv calculated as the difference between the best known pareto optimal front in our case the hc sets and the considered approximation sets sc and nc zitzler et al 2003 the latter two distance indicators are used to account for the specific advance toward a pre specified target hc solution see giuliani et al 2015 for details 3 5 data based on the actual negotiations in the lmrb we consider the following candidate variables potentially valuable for sharing and improving the system performance the storage of all the reservoirs in the basin model and the daily precipitation observations in china the daily streamflow data of the lancang mekong river from 1980 to 2014 the used irrigation water demand and the reservoir data were obtained from mrc http portal mrcmekong org index mrc 2018 and lancang river hydropower inc the daily precipitation observations in 34 rain gauges from 1980 to 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the dam construction scenario is that to be completed in 2020 4 results the set of ncs is obtained via two separate optimisations one for china j 1 j hydro chn j ei chn and one for the mrc j 2 j hydro mrc j deficit j ei mrc from upstream to downstream as mentioned earlier these policies are conditioned only upon the day of the year and the reservoir s storage and are designed via emodps the hcs set is obtained via nsga ii in a single run of optimisation j j hydro total j ei mean j deficit assuming a perfect foresight of the 11 year management horizon and full cooperation across the basin the sc j j hydro chn j ei chn j hydro mrc j deficit j ei mrc set is obtained via emodps in one single optimisation apart from the basic information used in the nc scenario the selected shared information is directly used to condition the operations the settings of the experiments are summarised in table 2 4 1 conflicts and synergies in the lmrb fig 2 presents the pareto fronts in upstream china in the nc and hc scenarios the optimisation objectives in hc scenarios are formulated at the basin scale here we extract the pareto fronts of china s two objective values the two scenarios show a clear trade off between china s hydropower production and ecological preservation see the orange dots and blue dots respectively thus in line with previous studies giuliani and castelletti 2013 li et al 2018 li and zhao 2016 the visual comparison between the two pareto fronts also shows the potential space for improved hydropower production and ecological preservation generated by the perfect knowledge of future inflow conditions hc scenario we select the two extreme solutions maximising j hydro chn and minimising j ei chn to illustrate the impacts of china s operations on the mrc s water system performance the release sequences in these two solutions are used as inflows to the mrc the corresponding results are presented in fig 3 using parallel axes plots each coloured line in these plots corresponds to different trade offs in the operating policy which intersects each vertical axis at the value it achieves for the objective that the axis represents solutions from the case when china maximises j hydro chn are shown in blue lines from when china minimises j ei chn in green lines the difference in the mrc s hydropower production potential for the two cases is relatively significant when china aims to maximise hydropower production the mrc can also obtain a higher hydropower production implying a synergetic effect between the upstream and downstream hydropower sectors this offers space for hydropower cooperation between upstream and downstream hydropower and ecological preservation also present conflicts in the mrc a weak yet nonlinear trade off is observed between irrigation and hydropower as streamflow regulation for producing hydropower offers the possibility for meeting irrigation demands in dry seasons the control policy solutions of china and mrc in the nc scenarios are validated using the synthetic validation set with 10 times as many ensemble members of the optimisation set of historical simulated natural streamflow the results are shown in fig s1 where each plot represents a different objective overall the objectives present stability as the points cluster around the 1 1 line indicating that the performance of the optimised control policies is stable and the simulation optimisation framework is reliable fig 4 compares the nc and hc solutions at the basin and nation coalition levels i e china and the mrc the hc solutions can achieve a very low irrigation deficit and a higher hydropower generation at the basin level at the cost of sacrificing the ecological objective both upstream and downstream the gap between the pareto fronts of the hc and nc solutions suggests that considerable improvement can be achieved through basin wide cooperation and knowledge of the future inflow accordingly in the following sections we focus the analysis on a single target hc solution shown as the bold red lines in fig 4 representing a potentially good compromise between the three main objectives at the basin level this solution has the minimum euclidean distance to the ideal point in the normalised objective space and thus represents a balanced solution 4 2 most informative policy inputs to analyse the value of information we first use the iis algorithm to select the most important variables for explaining the release decisions of the mrc s reservoirs in the target hc solution from the candidate dataset shared between the countries including daily storage of all the reservoirs in the basin model daily rainfall observations in china and the day of the year see table 1 fig 5 reports the selection results for three typical reservoirs in the model i e laos reservoirs located on the mainstem vietnam s reservoir in the 3s basin and cambodia s reservoir on the mainstem these results are obtained via 40 runs of the iis algorithm to filter the randomness associated with the extremely randomised tree algorithm galelli and castelletti 2013b the selection results for other reservoirs are presented in supporting information fig s2 as shown in fig 5 the selection process is tentatively stopped after selecting the first six variables as they already explain a rather high percentage of the output variance above 75 for the mrc s reservoirs located relatively upstream the operation of china s large reservoirs has a significant impact for example for laos reservoirs on the mainstem the release sequence can be explained by nuozadu s storage s t nuozadu date of the year t storage of laos reservoir on the tributary s t l a o t the storage of the lao s reservoir on the mainstem s t l a o m and the daily rainfall observations from a nearby gauge in china although jinghong s storage s t jinghong is selected and ranks right after s t nuozadu its contribution is almost zero this is due to the high correlation between s t jinghong and s t nuozadu it is worth noting that s t nuozadu ranks first even higher than s t l a o m suggesting that for mrc s reservoir located in the upper mainstem storage information of china s big reservoirs is important but a different pattern appears for the downstream 3s basin which is the largest tributary of the mekong river taking vietnam s reservoir in the 3s basin as an example the first five selected variables are the date of the year its storage s t v n m 3 s the reservoir storage of cambodia and laos in the 3s basin s t k h m 3 s and s t l a o 3 s and the storage of cambodia s reservoir downstream s t k h m t the results for other reservoirs in the 3s basin are similar see fig s2 this suggests that the release decisions in the 3s basin are affected mainly by local information such as the reservoirs nearby since the capacity is rather small for the two most downstream cambodian reservoirs their operations are primarily explained by the day of the year and their own storage i e r2 greater than 90 indicating that any upstream information is not very valuable for these reservoirs in conclusion china s information is beneficial for the upstream mrc countries such as laos but has less impact on the downstream mrc countries 4 3 quantifying the value of shared information in this section we use the first five selected variables from the shared information and the basic inputs which allows explaining cumulatively 73 95 of the target releases as the set of policy inputs i e the sc scenario to analyse the effects of shared information in terms of the considered objectives i e j hydro chn j ei chn j hydro mrc j ei mrc and j deficit mrc results show that the system s performance improves under sc compared to the nc this improvement is quantified using three metrics reported in fig 6 b d the hypervolume increases from 0 15 to 0 33 i e 120 the minimum distance and average distance decrease from 0 22 to 0 10 i e 55 and from 0 74 to 0 47 i e 36 when moving from the nc to the sc yet the incremented benefits do not distribute uniformly across the five objectives since china and the mrc act independently china s maximum hydropower production and minimum ecological alteration do not change in sc compared to the nc scenario see fig 6 a sharing data between china and the mrc and among the mrc members allows a notable improvement on the mrc s objectives especially for the hydropower production the maximum value of j hydro mrc increases from 20 04 twh to 33 21 twh fig 7 a and 7 b report the specific hydropower production of each country in sc in terms of the extreme cases in which china s and mrc s hydropower production are maximised respectively mrc experience increases in hydropower to a different degree in these two cases i e 5 39 twh and 7 37 twh respectively among the four mrc members laos produces the most considerable portion of hydropower followed by cambodia in terms of both absolute and incremental value the hydropower production of thailand and vietnam remain almost unchanged across the scenarios such results suggest that the data sharing procedure can be highly beneficial for the hydropower sector this can be attributed to three factors 1 from the iis algorithm selection results the information about the big upstream reservoirs and rainfall data are recognised as informative for the operations of reservoirs in laos which holds the main potential in hydropower production 2 sharing data between china and laos can facilitate the reaction of downstream operators i e laos to upstream operations i e china and 3 for the small downstream reservoirs the aforementioned data is less valuable thus sharing data does not seem necessary since the capacity of these reservoirs is somewhat limited in fig 7 b when j hydro mrc is maximised laos and cambodia obtain considerable hydropower production increments 6 19 twh and 1 12 twh respectively while china s hydropower only decreases slightly i e 0 83 twh this indicates that the mrc can gain more hydropower increase if china cooperates 5 discussion 5 1 political benefits and obstacles of data sharing although the focus of our study is the value of soft cooperation via data sharing in improving water management we should bear in mind that such value reaches far beyond this scope the exchange of water resources data among the basin could lay firm foundations for broader cooperation and agreement formation in transboundary contexts for instance in the rhine river basin before in depth cooperation through a legally instituted regional body was established in 1986 the riparian countries spent more than a dozen years simply sharing information gerlak et al 2011 moreover information exchange can constitute a basis of mutual trust and transparency among the riparian countries assuring joint compliance without mutual trust among nations the degradation of the transboundary river basin s cooperation stage is likely to take place for example in the nile river basin conflicts were triggered again in 2014 due to lost trust among the states yu et al 2019a transparent information acquisition and interpretation are beneficial for developing a sense of reciprocity among countries and help them form more solid and frequent communication while sharing data is promising many other obstacles prevent this policy to be implemented efficiently in a complex geopolitical context data can sometimes serve as a weapon whipping up public opinions to blame other countries for causing adverse effects in a transboundary river basin setting timmerman and langaas 2004 for example accusing thailand of dragging her feet and postponing the establishment of flow regime regulations plengsaeng et al 2014 moreover the institutional context of the lmrb where eight institutional and legal frameworks coexist is complex and crowding williams 2020 in terms of data sharing and the development of infrastructures and technologies these institutions coupled effects remain unclear sharing data is just the first step towards more efficient management and other supporting measures need to be in place for example the yunnan province in china where the lancang river flows through curtails its hydroelectricity in recent years because of the inconsistency between hydropower development and grid planning and construction liu et al 2018 chowdhury et al 2020 demonstrates that the limited transmission capacity between thailand and laos leads to congestion problems and curbs hydropower benefits a coordinated transmission network expansion is essential to assure the power dispatch and consumption and support the planned hydropower capacity expansion in the lmrb moreover coordinating hydropower with other power sources would be beneficial for assuring the stability of the power supply the reformation of the countries electricity mechanism to allow flexible electricity markets to function may also fertilise the utilisation of enhanced electricity generation 5 2 the value of streamflow forecasts since we assumed perfect knowledge of future streamflow in the hc scenario to explore the upper bound of the system s performance and the improvement of china s pareto front is noted due to the perfect foresight of future streamflow see fig 2 it is inferred that the streamflow forecasts could be beneficial but the value of this information is problem specific and usually depends upon the dynamics and the objectives considered here we analyse a candidate set of local streamflow forecasts with lead times ranging from one week to two months to illustrate which lead time would be beneficial in the context of lmrb details of the data and methods are presented in supplementary text s1 long term forecasts are given high priority for reservoirs with large storage capacities see fig s3 this is in line with previous studies anghileri et al 2016 turner et al 2020 the first five selected variables from the local streamflow forecasts with different lead times and the basic input were then used together in each set of the policy input to derive the improved operating policies referred to as sf scenario by conditioning the operations on the selected forecasts china s reservoirs can produce more hydropower the maximum j hydro chn being 63 23 twh and 64 88 twh in nc and sf respectively see fig s4 mrc s maximum hydropower production also increases while the extent is not as large as in sc the maximum j hydro mrc being 28 43 twh and 31 17 twh in sf and sc scenarios respectively however the minimum average squared irrigation deficit decreases considerably from 0 16 to 0 10 i e 37 5 the reason can be seen in fig s5 which presents the trajectories of each country s irrigation withdrawal and demand irrigation deficit mainly occurs during the dry season from december to april and is severe in cambodia and vietnam the upstream countries even tend to over withdraw water sometimes leaving less water available for downstream countries for example thailand withdraws more water than needed in april and may leaving cambodia and vietnam suffering from irrigation deficits after introducing the local streamflow forecasts into the policy inputs the irrigation withdrawal trajectories of laos thailand and cambodia become closer to the hc trajectories more water can be used for irrigation in the dry seasons especially for the two downstream countries i e cambodia and vietnam with large demand this indicates that the irrigation situation is more balanced across the basin using local streamflow forecasts based on the illustrated results it is inferred that local streamflow forecast is of promising value for agriculture this also implies that different kinds of information could be valuable in improving the system s performance in different aspects and should be investigated case by case 6 conclusions starting from the ongoing cooperation process in the lmrb we focus on the potential for using shared data to improve the operations of this transboundary multi purpose water system through designing the operating policies in the hard cooperation scenario in which both full cooperation and perfect knowledge of future inflow conditions are assumed and in the non cooperative scenario in which only basic local information is known and no cooperation between upstream and downstream is enforced we identified a large gap between the basic non cooperative operations and the perfect scenario thus providing evidence for potential improvements especially in terms of hydropower production and irrigation withdrawal at the basin level targeted at a balanced hc solution we selected valuable variables for better informing the operators decisions these consist of shared data from other countries and vary for reservoirs with different capacities and locations for the mrc s reservoirs located relatively upstream such as laos reservoir on the mainstem the information about big upstream reservoirs i e information about china s reservoirs is very important moving downstream the information that matters more is that of nearby reservoirs rather than of the big reservoirs but this importance gradually impairs with the distance results show that sharing data from other sources is not very informative for the not very large and downstream cambodia s reservoirs these shared data can considerably improve mrc s hydropower production because the main hydropower contributor in the mrc laos has more information from upstream china and can thus react more efficiently to explore additional space for the system s performance improvement we also consider local streamflow forecast as an additional piece of information we found that consideration and selection of streamflow forecasts not only create an increase in hydropower production at the basin level but more importantly help to facilitate the reduction of irrigation deficit in summary our results suggest that the operation of the lmrb water system and other similar river basins would benefit from using shared data in determining the most efficient allocation across sectors and countries although the political background is complex and the representation of the water management issue is more complicated than it could be mimicked by the model description our study highlights a possible path towards a more cooperative and efficient selection of management options credit

3692,croplands can significantly influence the hydrologic response of catchments to climate change in a region but such influence has not been well investigated and quantified in this study we firstly use the conceptual hydrological model to investigate the annual water balance for croplands altered catchments and the natural state without croplands of the catchment can be traced back by setting a zero area of croplands in the calibrated model the model results are then applied to a hydrologic sensitivity framework with the budyko type relationship between hydrologic ratios i e evapotranspiration ratio and water storage change ratio and the aridity index e p p to yield the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients for the croplands altered and natural catchments the method is applied to investigate three catchments that are rarely affected by inter basin groundwater flow in illinois the results show that croplands significantly increase the actual evapotranspiration e and decrease the runoff q while changes in water storage c are rarely affected by croplands at the annual time scale the actual evapotranspiration at the annual timescale is much more sensitive to potential evapotranspiration when the croplands exist croplands in illinois significantly increase the sensitivity of streamflow on the climate change to at least twice of the sensitivity in the natural state the effectiveness of inter annual hydrologic sensitivity framework is also demonstrated by hydrological model this study provides a new simple insight to quantify the inter annual stability with varying climate and land use at the catchment scale keywords hydrological model hydrologic sensitivity budyko framework croplands climate change 1 introduction in the past few decades climate change dominated by global warming is seriously affecting the hydrological cycle and ecosystems at the global and catchment scales resulting in an increase in extreme weather events and frequent natural disasters stott 2016 milly et al 2005 yao et al 2021 streamflow as one of the most important elements of the hydrological cycle is directly affected by climate change and is easy to be observed how the streamflow would change if the precipitation increased by 10 in a catchment such a simple question has attracted a lot of attention of hydrologist and hydrogeologist since the last century dooge 1992 roderick and farquhar 2011 zhang et al 2017 yao et al 2020 thus there is a need and meaningful to assess the hydrologic sensitivity to climate change at the catchment scale schaake 1990 wang et al 2011 mishra and lilhare 2016 thackeray et al 2018 berghuijs et al 2017 in addition human activities have altered the state of the catchment to a large extent in different forms such as irrigation cultivation reservoir construction and afforestation at present which also greatly impacts the change in streamflow and evapotranspiration in a catchment brown et al 2005 han et al 2021 li et al 2017 it is more necessary and difficult to quantitatively evaluate the impact of human activities on hydrological sensitivity of catchments with climate change most previous studies have studied hydrological sensitivity with climate change at mean annual timescale sankarasubramanian et al 2001 berghuijs and woods 2016 roderick and farquhar 2011 while in recent years researchers have begun to pay attention to inter annual timescale with the deepening of research wu et al 2019 mianabadi et al 2020 han et al 2021 the hydrological variables in annual water balance at the catchment scale are highly dependent on several underlying surface factors such as the topography soils and plants which may be changed by human activities croplands and agricultural activities have greatly alter the natural geomorphic conditions in a large number of catchments water resources in many places over the world have been suffering from huge fluctuations because of climate change such as the illinois united states smith and richman 1993 the global warming trend may increase the hydrologic and agricultural drought risks in the future donohue et al 2010 mishra et al 2010 droughts have motivated rapid growth of irrigated areas in illinois for example during the 1952 1955 period more than a three fold increase in irrigated croplands was seen black 1957 in the illinois river catchment niemann and eltahir 2004 2005 developed a physical based model to investigate the change of hydrological elements with the varying climate and they draw a conclusion that when precipitation increase 1 the actual evapotranspiration would increase 0 4 and surface and groundwater runoff would increase approximately 2 however the effect of croplands on hydrological sensitivity has not been investigated the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied by wang et al 2011 to investigate the potential stress of droughts in central illinois the salt creek watershed where croplands were incorporated in the model they also assessed the changes in crop yield under some climatic scenarios while with uncertainties in parameterizing the swat model according to develop a conceptual hydrological model incorporating the impact of croplands han et al 2021 found the croplands would greatly change the hydrological processes in the catchments in illinois in general although previous studies recognized that croplands seriously changed the hydrological processes and would affect the hydrological sensitivity of the catchments the quantitative relationship between croplands and the hydrologic sensitivity of catchments at inter annual timescale has not been sufficiently investigated budyko framework model budyko 1974 is popular in investigating the hydrological variables in a catchment with varying climate in the last decades fu 1981 wang and alimohammadi 2012 wang and zhou 2016 han et al 2018 zhang et al 2001 it is first proposed to depict the nonlinear relation between the aridity index e p p and the evapotranspiration ratio e p without any parameter at mean annual timescale budyko 1958 1974 further research shows that a specific catchment parameter is needed in the framework which comprehensively represents the attributes of land surface such as topography vegetation and soil type yang et al 2014 the budyko framework is further expanded to the inter annual timescale and has also been applied to hydrological sensitivity analysis roderick and farquhar 2011 proposed a theoretical formula of hydrologic sensitivity on the basis of budyko framework at mean annual timescale that took into account both change in climate and underlying surface they further applied it to the murrary darling basin and found that a 10 change in p would result in a 26 change in runoff q han et al 2021 also developed a new inter annual hydrologic sensitivity method based on the budyko framework and an annual water balance model with the impact of croplands they applied the theoretically unsteady state sensitivity formula and bcd αk model to the 12 catchments in illinois and found the steady state analysis underestimated the unsteady hydrologic sensitivity of catchments however the role of croplands on hydrological sensitivity was not well studied and quantified in the budyko framework and the hydrologic sensitivity approach has not been validated in this study we used the inter annual sensitivity framework developed by han et al 2021 to further investigate and quantify the impacts of croplands the annual water balance is analyzed with the conceptual hydrological model bcd αk model proposed by han et al 2021 incorporating the effect of croplands due to its simplicity of operation section 2 the annual actual evapotranspiration e runoff q and change in storage c of the three catchments in illinois are estimated with the model from annual p and e p section 3 results are exhibited as plots of e p c p and q p versus the aridity index the natural state of the catchment can be traced back by setting a zero area of croplands in the calibrated bcd αk model thus the comparison between the current state and the natural state models provides an assessment on the contribution of croplands to the hydrologic sensitivity of catchments section 4 in addition the effectiveness of the inter annual hydrologic sensitivity is further discussed in section 5 2 method 2 1 inter annual hydrologic sensitivity framework hydrologic sensitivity of catchments can be assessed to know how the hydrological variables response to the change in climate represented by precipitation and potential evaporation in this study we introduce the inter annual sensitivity coefficients developed by han et al 2021 to investigate the catchment scale hydrological response to the climate change the annual precipitation in the closed catchment can be calculated by 1 p q e c as the evapotranspiration ratio e p is controlled by the aridity index ϕ e p p han et al 2021 proposed the change in storage c p is also the function of ϕ they define 2 e p f e p p f ϕ a n d c p g e p p g ϕ where f ϕ and g ϕ are curves representing the shift paths in the spaces of evapotranspiration ratio versus aridity index and storage change ratio versus aridity index in a catchment respectively they can be expressed by empirical functions estimated from observed or modeled data based on annual water balance the runoff ratio q p can be described by 3 q p h e p p h ϕ 1 c p e p 1 g ϕ f ϕ where h ϕ represents the function relating runoff ratio to the aridity index han et al 2021 proposed to use the slopes of correlation lines in the budyko space instead of the derivatives thus the derivatives of df dϕ and dg dϕ can be estimated as 4 df d ϕ δ e i p i δ ϕ i 5 dg d ϕ δ c i p i δ ϕ i where i denotes the index of years in a long period then according to use the slopes of f ϕ and g ϕ curves in a catchment han et al 2021 can calculate the change in runoff as shown below 6 dq q p d p p δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i e p p 2 d p 1 p d e p then they yielded the relative change in runoff as follows 7 dq q 1 e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i dp p e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i d e p e p eq 7 is rewritten by han et al 2021 as 8 dq q β qp dp p β q e p d e p e p where βqp and βqe p are sensitivity coefficients of runoff to the climate changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively which is proposed by han et al 2021 and can be expressed as 9 β qp 1 e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i β q e p e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i the relative change in actual evapotranspiration can also be derived similarly and expressed as 10 de β ep e p d p β e e p e e p d e p where βep and βee p are sensitivity coefficients developed by han et al 2021 of actual evapotranspiration to the climate changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as following 11 β ep 1 e p e δ e i p i δ ϕ i β e e p e p e δ e i p i δ ϕ i the time series of ei ci and qi at a site in a long period can be obtained from observation or using a calibrated hydrological model in this study the bcd αk hydrological model proposed by han et al 2021 is introduced to investigate the inter annual water balance and obtain the annual data of e and c using the observed annual data of p e p and q 2 2 the bcd αk model in the bcd αk model fig 1 the whole catchment is separated into two parts in the unsaturated zone a natural soil plant atmosphere continuum spac zone and a farming zone while they are connected to a same groundwater system in the saturated zone both the natural spac zone and farming zone can develop the surface runoff surface runoff and groundwater discharge together constitute the total runoff in a catchment in the natural zone the annual evapotranspiration eui and spac storage s i is calculated by han et al 2021 as 12 e ui e p i p i s i 1 e p i p i s i 1 13 s i p i s i 1 e ui 1 b where si denotes the effective spac storage parameter b represents the reservoir constant in the spac zone ri consists of direct surface runoff q s1 i and net groundwater recharge r g1 i which is calculated by 14 r i q s 1 i r g i b s i p i s i 1 e ui b 1 b the surface runoff and net groundwater recharge can be estimated by 1 c r and cr in the spac system respectively where c is a parameter representing the contribution ratio of r to net groundwater recharge in the farming zone with croplands han et al 2021 assumed that the annual actual evapotranspiration efi linearly and proportionally depends on the potential evapotranspiration as follows 15 e fi k c e p i where kc is the average crop coefficient the difference between pi and efi controls the distribution of the surface runoff and net groundwater recharge in the farming zone if pi efi the net groundwater recharge r g2 i and the surface runoff qs 2 are estimated by c pi efi and 1 c pi efi under the condition of pi efi the difference between efi and pi efi pi represents the net contribution of groundwater for irrigation and surface runoff is zero at this time take the catchment with the natural and farming zones as a whole the annual actual evapotranspiration e i is determined as 16 e i 1 α e p i p i s i 1 e p i p i s i 1 α k c e p i where α denotes the proportion of the farming area in the whole catchment the change in groundwater storage δg i is calculated by 17 δ g i g i g i 1 1 α c p i s i 1 e ui b 1 b α c p i e fi q bi p i e fi 18 δ g i g i g i 1 1 α c p i s i 1 e ui b 1 b α e fi p i q bi p i e fi where qbi dg i and parameter d denotes a reservoir

section 3 we use the bcd αk model to investigate the annual water balance in three catchments that are rarely affected by inter basin groundwater flow in illinois 3 study area data and model calibration criterion 3 1 study area and data the illinois state with sub humid climate is located in the midwest in the united state the mean annual precipitation is generally larger than 900 mm which mainly occurs in the months when the croplands grow thus the croplands can grow normally as the precipitation is enough to feed in the humid years while in the dry years groundwater extraction is needed for irrigating croplands scott et al 1986 bowman and collins 1987 han et al 2021 wang 2012 previous studies also have shown that the influence of the inter catchment groundwater flow fig 2 is not obvious in the three catchments schaller and fan 2009 the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and streamflow data at the daily timescale during the period of 1948 2000 and the cropland area data of the study three basins are downloaded from the international model parameter estimation experiment mopex dataset duan et al 2006 ftp hydrology nws noaa gov pub gcip mopex us data the basic information of the study basins is shown in table 1 which indicates that these basins have the relatively large differences in the drainage area 1700 km2 4300 km2 and the area proportion of croplands 52 69 but have the relatively small differences in the average precipitation 902 mm 920 mm potential evapotranspiration 991 mm 1009 mm runoff 230 mm 248 mm and aridity index 1 08 1 12 the soil water content data with 0 25 0 25 resolution for the period of 1982 2000 are collected from the noah land surface model l4 data rodell and beaudoing 2015 in the global land data assimilation systems gldas 2 dataset https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas gldasdownload php for comparing with modeling results of the bcd αk model soil water storage data are extracted from the grid cells associated with the catchment the area weighted average value of the data points is used to represent the catchment scale soil water storage 3 2 model calibration the bcd αk model is applied in this investigation with calibrated parameters for the three basins we use the period from 1948 to 1957 to warm up the model at first then apply the period from 1958 to 1974 to calibrate the model with best fitting parameters and finally the model is verified during the period from 1975 to 2000 the parameter α cropland area proportion is a constant in a catchment and can be obtained from the mopex landuse data thus only four parameters of b c d and k c are needed to be identified in the bcd αk model the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and deterministic coefficient r2 are selected to examine the model performance based on the generalized reduced gradient non linear algorithm lasdon et al 1978 we make the value of rmse as the objection and the optimal parameters can be then determined automatically for calibration 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation and model performance parameters are identified using the method in section 3 2 and shown in table 2 using the identified parameters and initial values of si and gi in 1948 the modeling results for the whole 1948 2000 period are obtained in particular in order to test the rationality of the assumption that the cropland area proportion is a constant from 1948 2000 we try to consider the potential variation of croplands with time and assume that the α value retrieved from the mopex landuse data represents the mean cropland area proportion after 1975 rather than 1948 the period of 1948 1957 is also applied for model spin up whereas the model parameters are calibrated in the period of 1958 2000 then b c d and k c are identified using data in the period of 1975 2000 and fixed for simulating streamflow before 1975 a different α value will be further identified using data in the period of 1958 1974 after this test the α values in the period of 1958 1974 in three catchments are the same with those retrieved from the mopex landuse data therefore it is rational that cropland area proportion is assumed to be a constant from 1948 to 2000 performance of the model for the three study catchments can be assessed with the nse and r2 values table 2 in general the model realistically predicts the variability of annual runoff consistent with observations as r2 values range in 0 80 0 85 and nse values are higher than 0 78 which indicates that the model performs well and it can be used for further analysis for annual hydrological processes moriasi et al 2007 in addition we further compare the modeled inter annual change in spac storage in the three catchments for the period of 1983 2020 with the soil water change data at the top 100 cm depth suggested by han et al 2021 from gldas 2 dataset as indicated in fig 3 although a bit difference between the annual δs estimated by the calibrated bcd αk model and obtained from gldas data exists in the fluctuation amplitude they display a similar variation patterns in the three catchments it further implies that the calibrated bcd αk model is valid 4 2 reconstructed natural state for comparison to assess how croplands alter the annual water balance in the catchments we reconstruct the natural annual fluxes and storages in the three study catchments by setting a zero area of croplands α 0 with other parameters that previously identified in the calibrated bcd αk model the natural state does not exactly represents the real natural state but reduce the impact of croplands runoff actual evapotranspiration and water storage change at the annual timescale in the natural state are estimated and compared to the results obtained in section 4 1 typical comparable results are shown in fig 4 as shown in figs 4a 4d and 4g the streamflow in the natural state is higher than that in the croplands altered condition and slightly shows weaker inter annual fluctuations as indicated in figs 4b 4e and 4h evapotranspiration was significantly increased by croplands increments of the mean annual evapotranspiration are 143 mm 177 mm and 175 mm in the catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively more than 13 of the mean annual precipitation figs 4c 4f and 4i show that croplands have little effect on change in water storage 4 3 annual hydrological ratios versus aridity index the modeling results are illustrated as plots of the annual evapotranspiration ratio storage change ratio and runoff ratio versus the annual aridity index these plots figs 5 7 are used to yield the slopes of correlation lines of the functions of f ϕ g ϕ and h ϕ and show how croplands altered the hydrological variables of catchments on the changing dryness the annual e p exhibits a strong and positively linear relationship with e p p fig 5 in both the states of nature and croplands the correlation coefficient of e p and e p p is higher than 0 95 croplands significantly increase the actual evapotranspiration and result in a larger slope 0 59 of e p versus e p p indicating an increased sensitivity to climate compared to natural vegetation conditions 0 25 0 30 moreover e p 1 cases due to the contribution of the annual changes in water storage occur only when the croplands exist indicating that the e p 1 cases are mostly caused by croplands the results in fig 6 also show a negatively linear relationship between the annual c p and e p p with more discrete distribution it seems that croplands will not significantly change the slope between 0 17 and 0 33 of the annual c p versus e p p even they would slightly increase the slope i e weaken the sensitivity the comparable results of the modeled q p in the budyko space are shown in fig 7 data points of q p versus e p p also display a linear relationship the croplands reduce the annual q p value so their data points fall below that in the natural state the annual q p in the natural state decreases linearly in the catchments 2 and 3 while increases linearly in the catchments 1 with e p p this positive relationship between q p and e p p is an unexpected result for the traditional budyko curves also shown in fig 7 that yield a negative relationship however may be a result of the delayed release of water storage in drier than average years even the catchments 2 and 3 show a negative correlation in the natural state the slopes of q p curves are close to zero and different from the traditional budyko curves nevertheless the cropland altered q p significantly decreases with e p p in all of the studied catchments in the catchment 1 where the proportion of cropland area reaches to the maximum the slope of the q p curve drops from 0 04 in the natural state to 0 29 in the croplands altered condition fig 7a showing a maximum change in comparison the catchment 3 show a minimum change in the slope of the q p curve fig 7d where the proportion of cropland area is minimum it indicates that more croplands in a catchment would cause larger change in runoff 4 4 hydrologic sensitivity coefficients the sensitivity coefficients for the study three basins in the croplands altered and natural states can be calculated by eqs 8 11 using the slopes in figs 5 and 6 instead of δ e i pi δ ϕi and δ c i pi δ ϕi we can calculate the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients with eqs 9 and 11 the results of the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients of the three study basins are displayed in table 3 in the natural state most of the absolute values of sensitivity coefficients are less than 1 indicating that a change in p or e p would cause a smaller change in e or q the streamflow is more sensitive in the natural state to the change in p than to the change in e p because β qp is much higher than β qep croplands significantly increase β eep and β qp but decrease β qep and β ep as a result the runoff show a negative response to the increase in e p but its sensitivity β qep is less than the sensitivity to the change in p β qp according to eq 9 we can know why the croplands increase the sensitivity of runoff to climate change the reason is that croplands will increase the actual evapotranspiration e resulting in an increase in the slope of e p versus ϕ represented by δ e i p i δ ϕ i while the slope of c p versus ϕ i e δ c i p i δ ϕ i is almost unchanged 5 discussions 5 1 estimation of runoff change in typical climate change scenarios and comparison the change in streamflow following the climate change is combined runoff responses on both changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as indicated by niemann and eltahir 2005 the simultaneous 1 increases in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the illinois river basin would cause 1 2 increase in the surface runoff due to different sensitivities in this study the combination of the responses can be investigated with eq 8 typical inter annual change scenarios δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p are used to calculate the typical percent changes in streamflow a typical positive change for streamflow is a result of δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p 22 δ q q β qp β qe typical positive change a typical negative change is a result of δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p 23 δ q q β qp β qe typical negative change it is clearly that 24 δ q q δ q q 2 β qp 1 in eq 24 2β qp 1 is a consequence of eq 9 by which we know β qp β qep 1 the results of eq 24 for the studied catchments are shown in fig 8 the typical positive change in q is between 3 and 5 with croplands whereas it is generally less than 1 4 in the natural state a typical offset climatic change can be denoted as δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p or δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p which leads to 25 δ q q β qp β q e p 1 typical offset change where the 1 change in streamflow is a theoretical result of β qp β qep 1 according to eq 9 it is a consequence of the budyko framework in which the annual q p is a function of the annual e p p results of the probabilistic model in niemann and eltahir 2005 lead to a 1 2 typical offset change in surface runoff and a 0 4 typical offset change in groundwater runoff for the illinois river basin accordingly a 0 8 typical offset change in streamflow can be estimated because almost half of the runoff in the illinois river basin comes from the contribution of groundwater runoff niemann and eltahir 2005 such a modeled result of the typical offset change is close to the theoretical prediction in this study indicating that the extended budyko framework is basically available for the illinois river basin 5 2 comparison of the runoff sensitivity between different methods it is a common practice to predict runoff change and analyze runoff sensitivity in typical climate change scenarios based on a calibrated hydrological model niemann and eltahir 2004 2005 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang et al 2011 the bcd αk model in this study is directly used to investigate hydrologic response to climate change and further to validate the hydrologic sensitivity framework proposed by han et al 2021 typical inter annual climate change scenarios δp 10 p or δe p 10 e p in the calibrated bcd αk model are used to calculate the percent changes in runoff and the parameter values are the same as in the calibrated bcd αk model under the cropland altered condition when annual p increases by 10 the mean annual q will increase by 32 33 calculated by the bcd αk model which is slightly larger than the result 23 29 estimated by the sensitivity framework table 4 accordingly the changes in mean annual q 23 21 is also relatively larger than those 19 13 calculated by the sensitivity framework proposed by han et al 2021 in the scenario that annual e p increases by 10 table 4 the changes in q calculated by the two methods in the two climate change scenarios are generally consistent especially in the catchments 2 and 3 which further proves the effectiveness of the inter annual hydrologic sensitivity framework developed by han et al 2021 it is noted that the runoff sensitivities to climate change estimated by the bcd αk model in the three catchments are all larger than the results calculated by the sensitivity framework the reason may be that annual evapotranspiration ratio is assumed to be controlled by the aridity index instead of water storage change and aridity index which deserves further investigation 5 3 sensitivity analysis of cropland area proportion to runoff and runoff sensitivity the variations of the runoff and runoff sensitivity with changing area proportion of croplands from 0 to 1 in three catchments are further investigated according to set different values of parameter α in the calibrated bcd αk model and then substitute the modeling results into the hydrologic sensitivity framework the result shown in fig 9 a indicates that the mean annual runoff decreases linearly with the increase of croplands 10 increases in the area proportion of croplands will result in 20 mm 25 mm and 30 mm decrease in mean annual runoff in the catchments of 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 9b shows that as the area proportion of croplands increases β qp increases exponentially with β qp 0 90e1 32 α in catchment 1 β qp 1 22e1 13 α in catchment 2 and β qp 1 13e1 43 α in catchment 3 respectively accordingly the values of β qep also increase nonlinearly with the increase in α value the greater the runoff sensitivity coefficients the more unstable the runoff is to climate change catchments of 2 and 3 in the cropland altered state can be further used to compare the impact of croplands on runoff hydrologic sensitivity due to the similar climatic conditions and different area proportion of croplands it is indicated that the values of β qp and β qep in catchment 2 α 0 66 are larger than those in catchment 3 α 0 52 shown in table 3 which implies the actual situation is consistent with the results of theoretical sensitivity analysis and demonstrates that croplands decrease stability of runoff with changing climate 6 conclusions in this study we highlight and quantify the impact of croplands on the hydrologic sensitivity with varying climate in a catchment the bcd αk model incorporating the effect of croplands is applied to simulate the basin scale hydrological variables at the annual timescale the natural state of the basin can be traced back by setting a zero area of croplands the modeled data are applied to obtain an empirical curve in the budyko type space of a hydrologic ratio versus e p p then the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients proposed by han et al 2021 are estimated from curve slopes of the actual evapotranspiration ratio e p and storage change ratio c p the sensitivity framework and the hydrological model are applied in three catchments that are rarely affected by inter basin groundwater flow in the illinois usa to investigate the inter annual hydrological variations to climate change in the cropland altered state the model performs well and is further used to reconstruct the natural state water balance the result indicates that the croplands will increase the slope of the evapotranspiration ratio versus the aridity index curves and decrease the slope of the runoff ratio versus the aridity index curves the annual c p is negatively correlated to e p p and the curve slope is not significantly influenced by the croplands the estimated hydrologic sensitivity coefficients indicate that the runoff in both natural and cropland altered states are much more sensitive to the change in p than to the change in e p in illinois croplands significantly increase the sensitivity of streamflow to climate change for all of the catchments to at least twice of the sensitivity of the natural state in addition the effectiveness of the inter annual hydrologic sensitivity is further demonstrated by hydrological model although the results have a lot of uncertainties with limited data they demonstrate that croplands indeed have significantly influenced the catchment scale water balance and changed the hydrological response to climate change in illinois credit authorship

3692,croplands can significantly influence the hydrologic response of catchments to climate change in a region but such influence has not been well investigated and quantified in this study we firstly use the conceptual hydrological model to investigate the annual water balance for croplands altered catchments and the natural state without croplands of the catchment can be traced back by setting a zero area of croplands in the calibrated model the model results are then applied to a hydrologic sensitivity framework with the budyko type relationship between hydrologic ratios i e evapotranspiration ratio and water storage change ratio and the aridity index e p p to yield the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients for the croplands altered and natural catchments the method is applied to investigate three catchments that are rarely affected by inter basin groundwater flow in illinois the results show that croplands significantly increase the actual evapotranspiration e and decrease the runoff q while changes in water storage c are rarely affected by croplands at the annual time scale the actual evapotranspiration at the annual timescale is much more sensitive to potential evapotranspiration when the croplands exist croplands in illinois significantly increase the sensitivity of streamflow on the climate change to at least twice of the sensitivity in the natural state the effectiveness of inter annual hydrologic sensitivity framework is also demonstrated by hydrological model this study provides a new simple insight to quantify the inter annual stability with varying climate and land use at the catchment scale keywords hydrological model hydrologic sensitivity budyko framework croplands climate change 1 introduction in the past few decades climate change dominated by global warming is seriously affecting the hydrological cycle and ecosystems at the global and catchment scales resulting in an increase in extreme weather events and frequent natural disasters stott 2016 milly et al 2005 yao et al 2021 streamflow as one of the most important elements of the hydrological cycle is directly affected by climate change and is easy to be observed how the streamflow would change if the precipitation increased by 10 in a catchment such a simple question has attracted a lot of attention of hydrologist and hydrogeologist since the last century dooge 1992 roderick and farquhar 2011 zhang et al 2017 yao et al 2020 thus there is a need and meaningful to assess the hydrologic sensitivity to climate change at the catchment scale schaake 1990 wang et al 2011 mishra and lilhare 2016 thackeray et al 2018 berghuijs et al 2017 in addition human activities have altered the state of the catchment to a large extent in different forms such as irrigation cultivation reservoir construction and afforestation at present which also greatly impacts the change in streamflow and evapotranspiration in a catchment brown et al 2005 han et al 2021 li et al 2017 it is more necessary and difficult to quantitatively evaluate the impact of human activities on hydrological sensitivity of catchments with climate change most previous studies have studied hydrological sensitivity with climate change at mean annual timescale sankarasubramanian et al 2001 berghuijs and woods 2016 roderick and farquhar 2011 while in recent years researchers have begun to pay attention to inter annual timescale with the deepening of research wu et al 2019 mianabadi et al 2020 han et al 2021 the hydrological variables in annual water balance at the catchment scale are highly dependent on several underlying surface factors such as the topography soils and plants which may be changed by human activities croplands and agricultural activities have greatly alter the natural geomorphic conditions in a large number of catchments water resources in many places over the world have been suffering from huge fluctuations because of climate change such as the illinois united states smith and richman 1993 the global warming trend may increase the hydrologic and agricultural drought risks in the future donohue et al 2010 mishra et al 2010 droughts have motivated rapid growth of irrigated areas in illinois for example during the 1952 1955 period more than a three fold increase in irrigated croplands was seen black 1957 in the illinois river catchment niemann and eltahir 2004 2005 developed a physical based model to investigate the change of hydrological elements with the varying climate and they draw a conclusion that when precipitation increase 1 the actual evapotranspiration would increase 0 4 and surface and groundwater runoff would increase approximately 2 however the effect of croplands on hydrological sensitivity has not been investigated the soil and water assessment tool swat was applied by wang et al 2011 to investigate the potential stress of droughts in central illinois the salt creek watershed where croplands were incorporated in the model they also assessed the changes in crop yield under some climatic scenarios while with uncertainties in parameterizing the swat model according to develop a conceptual hydrological model incorporating the impact of croplands han et al 2021 found the croplands would greatly change the hydrological processes in the catchments in illinois in general although previous studies recognized that croplands seriously changed the hydrological processes and would affect the hydrological sensitivity of the catchments the quantitative relationship between croplands and the hydrologic sensitivity of catchments at inter annual timescale has not been sufficiently investigated budyko framework model budyko 1974 is popular in investigating the hydrological variables in a catchment with varying climate in the last decades fu 1981 wang and alimohammadi 2012 wang and zhou 2016 han et al 2018 zhang et al 2001 it is first proposed to depict the nonlinear relation between the aridity index e p p and the evapotranspiration ratio e p without any parameter at mean annual timescale budyko 1958 1974 further research shows that a specific catchment parameter is needed in the framework which comprehensively represents the attributes of land surface such as topography vegetation and soil type yang et al 2014 the budyko framework is further expanded to the inter annual timescale and has also been applied to hydrological sensitivity analysis roderick and farquhar 2011 proposed a theoretical formula of hydrologic sensitivity on the basis of budyko framework at mean annual timescale that took into account both change in climate and underlying surface they further applied it to the murrary darling basin and found that a 10 change in p would result in a 26 change in runoff q han et al 2021 also developed a new inter annual hydrologic sensitivity method based on the budyko framework and an annual water balance model with the impact of croplands they applied the theoretically unsteady state sensitivity formula and bcd αk model to the 12 catchments in illinois and found the steady state analysis underestimated the unsteady hydrologic sensitivity of catchments however the role of croplands on hydrological sensitivity was not well studied and quantified in the budyko framework and the hydrologic sensitivity approach has not been validated in this study we used the inter annual sensitivity framework developed by han et al 2021 to further investigate and quantify the impacts of croplands the annual water balance is analyzed with the conceptual hydrological model bcd αk model proposed by han et al 2021 incorporating the effect of croplands due to its simplicity of operation section 2 the annual actual evapotranspiration e runoff q and change in storage c of the three catchments in illinois are estimated with the model from annual p and e p section 3 results are exhibited as plots of e p c p and q p versus the aridity index the natural state of the catchment can be traced back by setting a zero area of croplands in the calibrated bcd αk model thus the comparison between the current state and the natural state models provides an assessment on the contribution of croplands to the hydrologic sensitivity of catchments section 4 in addition the effectiveness of the inter annual hydrologic sensitivity is further discussed in section 5 2 method 2 1 inter annual hydrologic sensitivity framework hydrologic sensitivity of catchments can be assessed to know how the hydrological variables response to the change in climate represented by precipitation and potential evaporation in this study we introduce the inter annual sensitivity coefficients developed by han et al 2021 to investigate the catchment scale hydrological response to the climate change the annual precipitation in the closed catchment can be calculated by 1 p q e c as the evapotranspiration ratio e p is controlled by the aridity index ϕ e p p han et al 2021 proposed the change in storage c p is also the function of ϕ they define 2 e p f e p p f ϕ a n d c p g e p p g ϕ where f ϕ and g ϕ are curves representing the shift paths in the spaces of evapotranspiration ratio versus aridity index and storage change ratio versus aridity index in a catchment respectively they can be expressed by empirical functions estimated from observed or modeled data based on annual water balance the runoff ratio q p can be described by 3 q p h e p p h ϕ 1 c p e p 1 g ϕ f ϕ where h ϕ represents the function relating runoff ratio to the aridity index han et al 2021 proposed to use the slopes of correlation lines in the budyko space instead of the derivatives thus the derivatives of df dϕ and dg dϕ can be estimated as 4 df d ϕ δ e i p i δ ϕ i 5 dg d ϕ δ c i p i δ ϕ i where i denotes the index of years in a long period then according to use the slopes of f ϕ and g ϕ curves in a catchment han et al 2021 can calculate the change in runoff as shown below 6 dq q p d p p δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i e p p 2 d p 1 p d e p then they yielded the relative change in runoff as follows 7 dq q 1 e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i dp p e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i d e p e p eq 7 is rewritten by han et al 2021 as 8 dq q β qp dp p β q e p d e p e p where βqp and βqe p are sensitivity coefficients of runoff to the climate changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively which is proposed by han et al 2021 and can be expressed as 9 β qp 1 e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i β q e p e p q δ e i p i δ ϕ i δ c i p i δ ϕ i the relative change in actual evapotranspiration can also be derived similarly and expressed as 10 de β ep e p d p β e e p e e p d e p where βep and βee p are sensitivity coefficients developed by han et al 2021 of actual evapotranspiration to the climate changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as following 11 β ep 1 e p e δ e i p i δ ϕ i β e e p e p e δ e i p i δ ϕ i the time series of ei ci and qi at a site in a long period can be obtained from observation or using a calibrated hydrological model in this study the bcd αk hydrological model proposed by han et al 2021 is introduced to investigate the inter annual water balance and obtain the annual data of e and c using the observed annual data of p e p and q 2 2 the bcd αk model in the bcd αk model fig 1 the whole catchment is separated into two parts in the unsaturated zone a natural soil plant atmosphere continuum spac zone and a farming zone while they are connected to a same groundwater system in the saturated zone both the natural spac zone and farming zone can develop the surface runoff surface runoff and groundwater discharge together constitute the total runoff in a catchment in the natural zone the annual evapotranspiration eui and spac storage s i is calculated by han et al 2021 as 12 e ui e p i p i s i 1 e p i p i s i 1 13 s i p i s i 1 e ui 1 b where si denotes the effective spac storage parameter b represents the reservoir constant in the spac zone ri consists of direct surface runoff q s1 i and net groundwater recharge r g1 i which is calculated by 14 r i q s 1 i r g i b s i p i s i 1 e ui b 1 b the surface runoff and net groundwater recharge can be estimated by 1 c r and cr in the spac system respectively where c is a parameter representing the contribution ratio of r to net groundwater recharge in the farming zone with croplands han et al 2021 assumed that the annual actual evapotranspiration efi linearly and proportionally depends on the potential evapotranspiration as follows 15 e fi k c e p i where kc is the average crop coefficient the difference between pi and efi controls the distribution of the surface runoff and net groundwater recharge in the farming zone if pi efi the net groundwater recharge r g2 i and the surface runoff qs 2 are estimated by c pi efi and 1 c pi efi under the condition of pi efi the difference between efi and pi efi pi represents the net contribution of groundwater for irrigation and surface runoff is zero at this time take the catchment with the natural and farming zones as a whole the annual actual evapotranspiration e i is determined as 16 e i 1 α e p i p i s i 1 e p i p i s i 1 α k c e p i where α denotes the proportion of the farming area in the whole catchment the change in groundwater storage δg i is calculated by

section 3 we use the bcd αk model to investigate the annual water balance in three catchments that are rarely affected by inter basin groundwater flow in illinois 3 study area data and model calibration criterion 3 1 study area and data the illinois state with sub humid climate is located in the midwest in the united state the mean annual precipitation is generally larger than 900 mm which mainly occurs in the months when the croplands grow thus the croplands can grow normally as the precipitation is enough to feed in the humid years while in the dry years groundwater extraction is needed for irrigating croplands scott et al 1986 bowman and collins 1987 han et al 2021 wang 2012 previous studies also have shown that the influence of the inter catchment groundwater flow fig 2 is not obvious in the three catchments schaller and fan 2009 the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and streamflow data at the daily timescale during the period of 1948 2000 and the cropland area data of the study three basins are downloaded from the international model parameter estimation experiment mopex dataset duan et al 2006 ftp hydrology nws noaa gov pub gcip mopex us data the basic information of the study basins is shown in table 1 which indicates that these basins have the relatively large differences in the drainage area 1700 km2 4300 km2 and the area proportion of croplands 52 69 but have the relatively small differences in the average precipitation 902 mm 920 mm potential evapotranspiration 991 mm 1009 mm runoff 230 mm 248 mm and aridity index 1 08 1 12 the soil water content data with 0 25 0 25 resolution for the period of 1982 2000 are collected from the noah land surface model l4 data rodell and beaudoing 2015 in the global land data assimilation systems gldas 2 dataset https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas gldasdownload php for comparing with modeling results of the bcd αk model soil water storage data are extracted from the grid cells associated with the catchment the area weighted average value of the data points is used to represent the catchment scale soil water storage 3 2 model calibration the bcd αk model is applied in this investigation with calibrated parameters for the three basins we use the period from 1948 to 1957 to warm up the model at first then apply the period from 1958 to 1974 to calibrate the model with best fitting parameters and finally the model is verified during the period from 1975 to 2000 the parameter α cropland area proportion is a constant in a catchment and can be obtained from the mopex landuse data thus only four parameters of b c d and k c are needed to be identified in the bcd αk model the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and deterministic coefficient r2 are selected to examine the model performance based on the generalized reduced gradient non linear algorithm lasdon et al 1978 we make the value of rmse as the objection and the optimal parameters can be then determined automatically for calibration 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation and model performance parameters are identified using the method in section 3 2 and shown in table 2 using the identified parameters and initial values of si and gi in 1948 the modeling results for the whole 1948 2000 period are obtained in particular in order to test the rationality of the assumption that the cropland area proportion is a constant from 1948 2000 we try to consider the potential variation of croplands with time and assume that the α value retrieved from the mopex landuse data represents the mean cropland area proportion after 1975 rather than 1948 the period of 1948 1957 is also applied for model spin up whereas the model parameters are calibrated in the period of 1958 2000 then b c d and k c are identified using data in the period of 1975 2000 and fixed for simulating streamflow before 1975 a different α value will be further identified using data in the period of 1958 1974 after this test the α values in the period of 1958 1974 in three catchments are the same with those retrieved from the mopex landuse data therefore it is rational that cropland area proportion is assumed to be a constant from 1948 to 2000 performance of the model for the three study catchments can be assessed with the nse and r2 values table 2 in general the model realistically predicts the variability of annual runoff consistent with observations as r2 values range in 0 80 0 85 and nse values are higher than 0 78 which indicates that the model performs well and it can be used for further analysis for annual hydrological processes moriasi et al 2007 in addition we further compare the modeled inter annual change in spac storage in the three catchments for the period of 1983 2020 with the soil water change data at the top 100 cm depth suggested by han et al 2021 from gldas 2 dataset as indicated in fig 3 although a bit difference between the annual δs estimated by the calibrated bcd αk model and obtained from gldas data exists in the fluctuation amplitude they display a similar variation patterns in the three catchments it further implies that the calibrated bcd αk model is valid 4 2 reconstructed natural state for comparison to assess how croplands alter the annual water balance in the catchments we reconstruct the natural annual fluxes and storages in the three study catchments by setting a zero area of croplands α 0 with other parameters that previously identified in the calibrated bcd αk model the natural state does not exactly represents the real natural state but reduce the impact of croplands runoff actual evapotranspiration and water storage change at the annual timescale in the natural state are estimated and compared to the results obtained in section 4 1 typical comparable results are shown in fig 4 as shown in figs 4a 4d and 4g the streamflow in the natural state is higher than that in the croplands altered condition and slightly shows weaker inter annual fluctuations as indicated in figs 4b 4e and 4h evapotranspiration was significantly increased by croplands increments of the mean annual evapotranspiration are 143 mm 177 mm and 175 mm in the catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively more than 13 of the mean annual precipitation figs 4c 4f and 4i show that croplands have little effect on change in water storage 4 3 annual hydrological ratios versus aridity index the modeling results are illustrated as plots of the annual evapotranspiration ratio storage change ratio and runoff ratio versus the annual aridity index these plots figs 5 7 are used to yield the slopes of correlation lines of the functions of f ϕ g ϕ and h ϕ and show how croplands altered the hydrological variables of catchments on the changing dryness the annual e p exhibits a strong and positively linear relationship with e p p fig 5 in both the states of nature and croplands the correlation coefficient of e p and e p p is higher than 0 95 croplands significantly increase the actual evapotranspiration and result in a larger slope 0 59 of e p versus e p p indicating an increased sensitivity to climate compared to natural vegetation conditions 0 25 0 30 moreover e p 1 cases due to the contribution of the annual changes in water storage occur only when the croplands exist indicating that the e p 1 cases are mostly caused by croplands the results in fig 6 also show a negatively linear relationship between the annual c p and e p p with more discrete distribution it seems that croplands will not significantly change the slope between 0 17 and 0 33 of the annual c p versus e p p even they would slightly increase the slope i e weaken the sensitivity the comparable results of the modeled q p in the budyko space are shown in fig 7 data points of q p versus e p p also display a linear relationship the croplands reduce the annual q p value so their data points fall below that in the natural state the annual q p in the natural state decreases linearly in the catchments 2 and 3 while increases linearly in the catchments 1 with e p p this positive relationship between q p and e p p is an unexpected result for the traditional budyko curves also shown in fig 7 that yield a negative relationship however may be a result of the delayed release of water storage in drier than average years even the catchments 2 and 3 show a negative correlation in the natural state the slopes of q p curves are close to zero and different from the traditional budyko curves nevertheless the cropland altered q p significantly decreases with e p p in all of the studied catchments in the catchment 1 where the proportion of cropland area reaches to the maximum the slope of the q p curve drops from 0 04 in the natural state to 0 29 in the croplands altered condition fig 7a showing a maximum change in comparison the catchment 3 show a minimum change in the slope of the q p curve fig 7d where the proportion of cropland area is minimum it indicates that more croplands in a catchment would cause larger change in runoff 4 4 hydrologic sensitivity coefficients the sensitivity coefficients for the study three basins in the croplands altered and natural states can be calculated by eqs 8 11 using the slopes in figs 5 and 6 instead of δ e i pi δ ϕi and δ c i pi δ ϕi we can calculate the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients with eqs 9 and 11 the results of the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients of the three study basins are displayed in table 3 in the natural state most of the absolute values of sensitivity coefficients are less than 1 indicating that a change in p or e p would cause a smaller change in e or q the streamflow is more sensitive in the natural state to the change in p than to the change in e p because β qp is much higher than β qep croplands significantly increase β eep and β qp but decrease β qep and β ep as a result the runoff show a negative response to the increase in e p but its sensitivity β qep is less than the sensitivity to the change in p β qp according to eq 9 we can know why the croplands increase the sensitivity of runoff to climate change the reason is that croplands will increase the actual evapotranspiration e resulting in an increase in the slope of e p versus ϕ represented by δ e i p i δ ϕ i while the slope of c p versus ϕ i e δ c i p i δ ϕ i is almost unchanged 5 discussions 5 1 estimation of runoff change in typical climate change scenarios and comparison the change in streamflow following the climate change is combined runoff responses on both changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as indicated by niemann and eltahir 2005 the simultaneous 1 increases in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the illinois river basin would cause 1 2 increase in the surface runoff due to different sensitivities in this study the combination of the responses can be investigated with eq 8 typical inter annual change scenarios δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p are used to calculate the typical percent changes in streamflow a typical positive change for streamflow is a result of δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p 22 δ q q β qp β qe typical positive change a typical negative change is a result of δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p 23 δ q q β qp β qe typical negative change it is clearly that 24 δ q q δ q q 2 β qp 1 in eq 24 2β qp 1 is a consequence of eq 9 by which we know β qp β qep 1 the results of eq 24 for the studied catchments are shown in fig 8 the typical positive change in q is between 3 and 5 with croplands whereas it is generally less than 1 4 in the natural state a typical offset climatic change can be denoted as δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p or δp 1 p and δe p 1 e p which leads to 25 δ q q β qp β q e p 1 typical offset change where the 1 change in streamflow is a theoretical result of β qp β qep 1 according to eq 9 it is a consequence of the budyko framework in which the annual q p is a function of the annual e p p results of the probabilistic model in niemann and eltahir 2005 lead to a 1 2 typical offset change in surface runoff and a 0 4 typical offset change in groundwater runoff for the illinois river basin accordingly a 0 8 typical offset change in streamflow can be estimated because almost half of the runoff in the illinois river basin comes from the contribution of groundwater runoff niemann and eltahir 2005 such a modeled result of the typical offset change is close to the theoretical prediction in this study indicating that the extended budyko framework is basically available for the illinois river basin 5 2 comparison of the runoff sensitivity between different methods it is a common practice to predict runoff change and analyze runoff sensitivity in typical climate change scenarios based on a calibrated hydrological model niemann and eltahir 2004 2005 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang et al 2011 the bcd αk model in this study is directly used to investigate hydrologic response to climate change and further to validate the hydrologic sensitivity framework proposed by han et al 2021 typical inter annual climate change scenarios δp 10 p or δe p 10 e p in the calibrated bcd αk model are used to calculate the percent changes in runoff and the parameter values are the same as in the calibrated bcd αk model under the cropland altered condition when annual p increases by 10 the mean annual q will increase by 32 33 calculated by the bcd αk model which is slightly larger than the result 23 29 estimated by the sensitivity framework table 4 accordingly the changes in mean annual q 23 21 is also relatively larger than those 19 13 calculated by the sensitivity framework proposed by han et al 2021 in the scenario that annual e p increases by 10 table 4 the changes in q calculated by the two methods in the two climate change scenarios are generally consistent especially in the catchments 2 and 3 which further proves the effectiveness of the inter annual hydrologic sensitivity framework developed by han et al 2021 it is noted that the runoff sensitivities to climate change estimated by the bcd αk model in the three catchments are all larger than the results calculated by the sensitivity framework the reason may be that annual evapotranspiration ratio is assumed to be controlled by the aridity index instead of water storage change and aridity index which deserves further investigation 5 3 sensitivity analysis of cropland area proportion to runoff and runoff sensitivity the variations of the runoff and runoff sensitivity with changing area proportion of croplands from 0 to 1 in three catchments are further investigated according to set different values of parameter α in the calibrated bcd αk model and then substitute the modeling results into the hydrologic sensitivity framework the result shown in fig 9 a indicates that the mean annual runoff decreases linearly with the increase of croplands 10 increases in the area proportion of croplands will result in 20 mm 25 mm and 30 mm decrease in mean annual runoff in the catchments of 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 9b shows that as the area proportion of croplands increases β qp increases exponentially with β qp 0 90e1 32 α in catchment 1 β qp 1 22e1 13 α in catchment 2 and β qp 1 13e1 43 α in catchment 3 respectively accordingly the values of β qep also increase nonlinearly with the increase in α value the greater the runoff sensitivity coefficients the more unstable the runoff is to climate change catchments of 2 and 3 in the cropland altered state can be further used to compare the impact of croplands on runoff hydrologic sensitivity due to the similar climatic conditions and different area proportion of croplands it is indicated that the values of β qp and β qep in catchment 2 α 0 66 are larger than those in catchment 3 α 0 52 shown in table 3 which implies the actual situation is consistent with the results of theoretical sensitivity analysis and demonstrates that croplands decrease stability of runoff with changing climate 6 conclusions in this study we highlight and quantify the impact of croplands on the hydrologic sensitivity with varying climate in a catchment the bcd αk model incorporating the effect of croplands is applied to simulate the basin scale hydrological variables at the annual timescale the natural state of the basin can be traced back by setting a zero area of croplands the modeled data are applied to obtain an empirical curve in the budyko type space of a hydrologic ratio versus e p p then the hydrologic sensitivity coefficients proposed by han et al 2021 are estimated from curve slopes of the actual evapotranspiration ratio e p and storage change ratio c p the sensitivity framework and the hydrological model are applied in three catchments that are rarely affected by inter basin groundwater flow in the illinois usa to investigate the inter annual hydrological variations to climate change in the cropland altered state the model performs well and is further used to reconstruct the natural state water balance the result indicates that the croplands will increase the slope of the evapotranspiration ratio versus the aridity index curves and decrease the slope of the runoff ratio versus the aridity index curves the annual c p is negatively correlated to e p p and the curve slope is not significantly influenced by the croplands the estimated hydrologic sensitivity coefficients indicate that the runoff in both natural and cropland altered states are much more sensitive to the change in p than to the change in e p in illinois croplands significantly increase the sensitivity of streamflow to climate change for all of the catchments to at least twice of the sensitivity of the natural state in addition the effectiveness of the inter annual hydrologic sensitivity is further demonstrated by hydrological model although the results have a lot of uncertainties with limited data they demonstrate that croplands indeed have significantly influenced the catchment scale water balance and changed the hydrological response to climate change in illinois credit authorship

3693,snowmelt and groundwater surface water gw sw dynamics are the most dominant controllers of hydrological processes and water availability in northern latitudes particularly in warm seasons the dynamics and changes of snowmelt and gw sw interactions and their interrelationship at the regional scale are poorly understood in regional analyses to fill this gap this study implements a process based hydrological model using a coupled soil and water assessment tool swat and modflow model to map snowmelt and gw sw dynamics at regional scales the primary research questions are how are gw sw interactions altered by snowmelt dynamics and what is the effect of climate change on snowmelt and gw sw dynamics we simulated snowmelt and groundwater dynamics across a large watershed encompassing different ecohydrological regions including mountains foothills and plains analyzing the spatio temporal relationships between gw sw interactions and snowmelts in historical 1983 2007 and future 2040 2064 periods we used an ensemble of five global climate models gcms for future projections based on two emission scenarios i e rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 we also used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso method to examine the effects of snowmelt evapotranspiration et and rainfall on gw sw interactions these analyses are implemented in mountains foothills and plains regions in a large snow dominated watershed in western canada results show that earlier snowmelt is predicted in mountains and foothills regions under climate change scenarios while less snow accumulation and melt is anticipated in plains region future projections of gw sw interactions show an increase in groundwater discharge to streams in the winter and spring seasons mainly due to earlier snowmelt in winter and spring in mountains and foothills regions on the other hand more surface water loss to groundwater in summer and fall is predicted which can be caused by the low level of groundwater under future conditions in foothills regions correlation analysis between regional snowmelt and gw sw interactions for historical simulations show a higher correlation r 2 0 494 in mountains region compared to very low correlations r 2 0 01 in foothills and plains regions lasso results showed that et was the main control of dynamics of gw sw interactions in all regions of the study snowmelt was the next most important predictor of gw sw dynamics in the mountains region while rainfall was more important in the foothills region nevertheless none of the three predictors strongly influenced gw sw dynamics in the plains region mainly due to low groundwater levels and a lack of connectivity with the surface water overall it is shown that the eco hydrogeological and climatic variability of different regions plays an important part in governing gw sw dynamics keywords snowmelt groundwater surface water interactions regional hydrology climate change impacts swat modflow 1 introduction the spatial and temporal availability of water resources is controlled by hydrological cycles harding et al 2011 which are altered by climate change and anthropogenic influence vogel et al 2019 cochand et al 2019 in cold regions where the climate is cold enough to sustain a seasonal or permanent snowpack snowmelt is the primary source of streamflow during spring and early summer and also recharges groundwater which becomes the primary source of base flow during low flow periods dumanski et al 2015 all of these processes control the availability of water resources in dynamic e g surface run off and relatively static e g groundwater storage environments flerchinger et al 1992 the movement of groundwater and surface water in relation to snowmelt dynamics plays a significant role in dictating future water availability and distribution maurya et al 2018 aygün et al 2020 especially in northern latitudes assessment of groundwater surface water gw sw interactions in response to snowmelt has been the subject of several studies see for example schilling et al 2019 the gw sw interaction referred to here results in a permanent or seasonal water gain in the rivers due to high gw levels and groundwater discharge to streambeds or b water loss from river beds due to low gw levels baalousha 2012 kebede et al 2021 although some literature has focused on snowmelt and gw sw interactions most studies are conducted at the field scale focusing on understanding the effects of a particular physical process understanding gw sw interactions in cold regions requires a thorough assessment of the spatiotemporal variations of snowmelt and its relationship to both hydrological and hydrogeological processes under a range of diverse ecological settings at a regional scale studying such relationships and processes at a large watershed scale helps address future climate change concerns in systems where groundwater and surface water are used conjunctively to satisfy multiple water use sectors aliyari et al 2019 guevara ochoa et al 2020 hagemann et al 2013 earlier studies have demonstrated that in cold regions and northern latitudes snowmelt controls the storage and flow of water within both surface and subsurface hydrological systems hayashi and farrow 2014 lundberg et al 2016 while streamflow is vulnerable to changes in snowmelt patterns in these regions huntington and niswonger 2012 the hydrologic interactions between groundwater and streamflow are particularly affected by changes in snowmelt this is because deficits in the soil water profile or in the groundwater aquifers inhibit these exchanges from taking place unless they are restored by sources such as spring snowmelt or summer precipitation chauvin et al 2011 several field based studies have investigated snowmelt dynamics in relation to gw sw interactions clilverd et al 2011 hayashi and farrow 2014 jutebring sterte et al 2018 okkonen and kløve 2011 depending on the study site geographic location and the purpose of study the physical parameters dominating gw sw interactions or their relation to snow variations were different which makes the application of empirical studies to regional scale assessments challenging this is because the response of hydrogeological processes to snowmelt and gw sw connectivity can vary across different spatiotemporal scales avanzi et al 2015 bocchiola and groppelli 2010 as such process based hydrological and hydrogeological modelling is used as an alternative approach for evaluating snowmelt dynamics and gw sw interactions in current and future climates at the regional scale which is often the most relevant scale for policy and planning haddeland et al 2014 nevertheless in most of the model based studies both snowmelt simulation and gw sw interactions were analyzed in small areas with a relatively homogeneous climate land use and topography debele et al 2010 huntington and niswonger 2012 jutebring sterte et al 2018 qi et al 2017 saydi et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 in more complex regions such as the eastern slopes of the canadian rocky mountains several variables such as season climate vegetation and topography play distinctive and convoluted roles in the dynamics of these two processes carroll et al 2018 smith et al 2014 this is exemplified in mountainous and foothill environments where the properties of soils and subsurface media control the discharge of groundwater to streams that move water from high elevation catchments to valley bottoms allen et al 2010 jutebring sterte et al 2018 at lower elevations in foothills and plains regions where vegetation density is high the lower snowfall accumulation translates to less snowmelt and occurs prior to the peak of plant consumption producing small amounts of groundwater recharge the subsurface geology and variations in the thickness of units below the surface control the effects of groundwater recharge and the rate of groundwater flow leading to variable seasonal trends in water table fluctuation and its feedback to surface hydrology devito et al 1996 in warm seasons when snowmelt rapidly drops off and the growing season begins the connection between snowmelt and groundwater table weakens which is an example of how the relation between snowmelt and groundwater systems can vary in time and space carroll et al 2019 furthermore snowmelt is not only a critical source of water in mountains and foothills but also in plains regions of northern latitudes specifically in multiple prairie provinces in canada gray and landine 1988 pavlovskii et al 2018 the warmer average air temperatures produced by climate change in these regions can create a shift in the snowmelt season or in the precipitation type from snow to rain reducing water storage in snowpack and compromising its reliability as a viable water source macdonald et al 2012 schindler and donahue 2006 the relation between snowmelt and gw sw interactions and the potential impact of climate change are documented in various studies assani et al 2012 ferguson and maxwell 2010 mccallum et al 2013 scibek et al 2007 the literature shows that the impacts of gw sw interactions on the partitioning of water resources in hydrologic systems are significant and diverse akiyama sakai et al 2007 lewandowski et al 2020 which may be different in the future under climate change scenarios panagoulia and dimou 1996 scibek et al 2007 the physical relationships however are not thoroughly understood especially in regional scale landscapes where physical properties can show significant variations in time and space barthel and banzhaf 2016 also the existing studies are primarily conducted in more homogeneous environments and the direct effect of snowmelt on gw sw interactions in large watersheds is not adequately evaluated the analysis of correlations between snowmelt and gw sw interactions can provide insights into the factors governing these processes and how these relations might vary across landscapes with changing elevations land use land cover hydro climate and geologic settings the overarching goal of this study is to analyze snowmelt and gw sw interactions and their changes under future climate conditions at a regional scale this study aims to improve the understanding of correlations between snowmelt and gw sw interactions and how they are inter connected in different hydro climate and geologic settings we examine the effect of climate conditions topography and land use land cover on such changes and interactions in a large watershed to this end we coupled a surface hydrological model using the soil and water assessment tool swat with a groundwater model using modflow to evaluate the dynamics of snowmelt and gw sw interactions in different regions of the north saskatchewan river basin nsrb in western canada the specific objectives of this paper include 1 analysis of the response of seasonal changes in gw sw interactions to future climate at a regional scale 2 assessment of how spatiotemporal variation of gw sw interactions are associated with snowmelt patterns and other hydrological variables and 3 comparison and discussion of such responses and interactions in different hydro climatic regions such as mountains foothills and plains regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nsrb was selected for the study area as an example of a large watershed with high variability of climate and land use land cover fig 1 the nsrb is relatively large 60 000 km2 and comprises more than 9 of the landmass area in alberta canada north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 the nsrb elevation ranges from 3478 masl on the west side to 500 masl on the alberta saskatchewan border this difference in elevation leads to average annual precipitation 1983 to 2007 ranging from 760 mm year in the west to 400 mm year in the east the historical data for average daily temperature within the nsrb suggests a range from 30 c in winter up to 29 c in summer with high spatial and temporal variability government of canada 2019 the north saskatchewan river nsr originates from headwaters in the rocky mountains particularly in the columbia icefield in banff national park the river flows more than a thousand kilometers before reaching the alberta saskatchewan border the nsr later joins the south saskatchewan river which ultimately drains into hudson bay north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 the nsr is a major tributary to the saskatchewan river as the annual discharge of nsr at the alberta saskatchewan border is more than seven cubic kilometers alberta environment and parks 2019 this river is regulated by two hydroelectric dams namely bighorn dam on the main stem of nsr and brazeau dam on the tributary brazeau river the variation in topography presence of glaciers and mountain snowpacks and land cover consisting of forests wetlands and agricultural lands north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 fig 1a have resulted in complex hydrological processes gw sw interactions and climate variability from mountains to plains in the regions historic river flow at the city of edmonton hydat station 05df001 see fig 1 shows a decrease from 1911 to 2013 north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 also trend analysis of observed data from four selected climate stations within the nsrb namely nordegg 1915 to 2007 rocky mountain house 1978 to 2007 vermilion 1913 to 2007 and the city of edmonton 1880 to 2007 shows an increase in temperature climate change studies on the nsrb suggest an increase of temperature between 3 c and 5 c for different areas in the basin by 2100 farr et al 2018 the importance of groundwater and its relation to surface water is critical in the nsrb as a significant portion of groundwater recharge is from rivers and lakes when their water level is high north saskatchewan river basin council 2013 on the other hand groundwater discharge into many rivers and streams of the nsrb accounts for a significant share of streamflow that occurs in low flow seasons such as late fall and throughout the winter north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2009 therefore there is a need for watershed planners to understand the impacts of changing climate on these main hydrological processes and water availability within the nsrb in order to adapt their plans for surface water and groundwater management golder associates 2008 north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2012 2 2 hydrological model and input data 2 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based semi distributed hydrological model that simulates the quality and quantity of surface water in daily time steps arnold et al 2012 arnold et al 1998 swat is a powerful tool for simulating climate change impacts and the effects of land management practices on the dynamics of point source and non point source pollutants affecting surface water quality and water quantity over large and complex watersheds numerous hydrological processes can be simulated by swat including but not limited to surface run off groundwater discharge lateral flow streamflow snowmelt evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture dynamics neitsch et al 2011 developing a swat model requires input climate data including precipitation temperature humidity wind speed and solar radiation the delineation of sub basins and hydrological response units hrus can be performed through the application of gis maps including digital elevation models dems land use and land cover and soil maps and their physical properties hrus characterized by homogeneous soil land use and slope parameters are delineated within sub basins and they are the smallest spatial units for process simulations in the model table s1 shows the name extent and sources of different datasets for building the swat model in this study in this study a 90 m 90 m dem was used to set up the swat model for the nsrb a total of 174 sub basins were delineated using a pre defined river network generated previously from a 10 m 10 m resolution dem table s1 based on their elevation and land cover hrus were grouped into three distinct regions called mountains foothills and plains regions fig 1b zaremehrjardy et al 2020 for regional analysis historical climate data including precipitation temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity was derived from faramarzi et al 2015 who used various climate datasets from meteorological stations and gridded products to reproduce historical streamflow throughout the province of alberta we used the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour 2015 to calibrate and validate the nsrb swat model for 1993 2007 and 1983 1995 periods respectively with a warm up period of three years considered for each period the choice of parameters and their ranges for model calibration and validation were obtained from faramarzi et al 2017 during model calibration each iteration contained 1000 samples of parameter sets from their physically meaningful ranges neitsch et al 2011 resulting in 1000 swat simulations for each simulation the monthly observed and simulated streamflow were compared at six hydrometric stations within nsrb fig 1 several iterations each containing 1000 simulations were performed to acquire optimum ranges of swat parameters for efficiency this process was parallelized to over 200 computing cores using a parallelization approach developed by du et al 2020 the locations and properties of the hydrometric stations are shown in fig 1a and table s2 respectively to evaluate the goodness of fit of the swat model we considered three widely used criteria of efficiency the coefficient of determination r 2 the slope gradient weighted coefficient of determination b r 2 and the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency coefficient the detailed formulation and description of these criteria can be found in table s3 in addition to the performance criteria related to optimal swat parameter sets among the 1000 simulations in each iteration we used two statistical factors namely the p factor and r factor to evaluate uncertainties associated with model parameters model structure and observed data the p factor ranges from 0 to 1 and determines the percentage of the measured data bracketed within the uncertainty band generated by swat the uncertainty band in sufi 2 is calculated as 95 percent of the cumulative distribution of the simulated variables defined as 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu hereafter the r factor ranging from 0 to represents the width of the predicted uncertainty band when calibrating a model using the sufi 2 approach the ideal outcome is a p factor of 1 indicating that 100 of the measured data are reproduced using simulations an r factor of 0 indicates a minimum uncertainty prediction or a perfect simulation however due to uncertainty related to input and measured data the model structure and user defined parameters in hydrological modelling a p factor value of more than 0 5 and an r factor of close to 1 are suggested to be representative of a successful model calibration faramarzi et al 2009 faramarzi et al 2017 2 2 2 modflow model modflow is a three dimensional physically based groundwater model that uses a finite difference method for groundwater modelling in variably saturated subsurface systems bailey et al 2016 a modflow model for the nsrb was developed using visual modflow flex 6 0 waterloo hydrogeologic 2021 using the newton formulation of modflow 2005 modflow nwt to mitigate the challenge of wetting and drying modflow cells bailey et al 2016 the modflow model developed for the nsrb covers 181 500 k m 2 which is larger than the nsrb area in order for the modflow grid network to encompass the entire nsrb delineated by the swat model fig 1 a total of 55 33 grid cells were defined in the modflow model with the dimensions of each grid cell set to 10 km 10 km although a coarse grid resolution was chosen in modflow the structure of modflow and swat modflow for the nsrb remained relatively complex because of the representation of geological formations having a variable thickness and the west to east topographic elevation change across the nsrb fig 1c by defining the thickness and layer geometry of the geological formations in the modflow model the large scale west to east movement of groundwater from the mountains to the prairies plains region would be explicitly represented in the simulation of groundwater flow and interaction with the nsr the minimum input data required to set up modflow grids for an area consists of geological formations and corresponding hydraulic conductivity and aquifer storage properties in this study five main layers of modflow have been set up each corresponding to a geological formation in alberta from the ground surface to depth geological units include the sediments above the bedrock and the following upper cretaceous paleogene bedrock formations paskapoo siltstone and mudstone interbedded with coarse sandstone channels scollard sandstone siltstone and mudstone with extensive coal seams battle mudstone and horseshoe canyon mudstone sandstone and coal seams a very simplified bedrock unit that represents the rocky mountains has also been included to allow the representation of mountainous groundwater to be included in the modflow model the extent and elevation of geological formations and the hydraulic properties of each formation were acquired from the alberta geological survey alberta geological survey 2019 smerdon et al 2017 the possible ranges of horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h values for each geological formation were determined based on the maximum and minimum k h values measured from various boreholes throughout the west central part of alberta smerdon et al 2017 table 1 shows the names and property value ranges of each geological formation considered for this study the base of the modflow model was set to 500 m below sea level mbsl and was assigned a no flow hydraulic boundary this allowed groundwater conditions to be simulated from the ground surface varying from 3478 to 500 masl to 500 mbsl which represents at least 1 km total thickness and up to nearly 4 km of the subsurface thickness while this thickness is likely greater than the depth of groundwater movement interacting with the nsr it allows the large scale mountain to plains groundwater system as well as any deeper geological formations that might connect to the surface to be broadly represented chunn et al 2019 according to observation wells related to different geological formations of the nsrb the hydraulic head observed in this region is higher than 600 m above sea level see figure s1 as a result considering 500 m below sea level i e more than one kilometer below the lowest observed head as the bottom of modflow model will preserve groundwater dynamics simulations within different geological formations the geology of the rocky mountains is complex and includes layers that have been deformed and faulted during mountain formation alberta geological survey and alberta energy regulator 2021 as such the elevation data for the top and bottom of geological formations were not known for a part of the mountains region in the study area i e the western side of nsrb close to the rocky mountains however to include a generalized mountain block within the modflow model it was assumed that the elevation of geological formation at the west side of the nsrb is constant with a value equal to the most western side of the study area where elevation data was available we used information from the dem data of the nsrb to fill in the missing bedrock data for the top of the upmost layer the layer that is closest to the ground surface in modflow the hydraulic properties of bedrock in the rocky mountains are unknown and were assumed based on a range that seemed realistic considering the lower permeability nature of the rock formations furthermore groundwater observation data are absent in the mountains region rather than attempting to accurately represent an unknown groundwater component these assumptions allowed groundwater flow to occur in the mountains region as part of the simulation and established large scale groundwater movement from the mountains region to the plains to represent the initial condition of the groundwater system hydraulic boundary conditions rivers groundwater recharge and an initial hydraulic head distribution were necessary initial hydraulic heads were simulated by allowing modflow to equilibrate with river riv and recharge rch boundary conditions imported from nsrb swat model that was not initially integrated with modflow model once equilibrium was achieved these initial hydraulic heads were used to represent initial conditions in developing a coupled swat modflow model of the region additional details of the complete processes of importing riv and rch data from swat to modflow can be found in chunn et al 2019 and park and bailey 2017 modflow simulates hydraulic head in all the cells within a model which is the sum of actual groundwater elevation and pressure head historical hydraulic head data is available from observation wells and they are critical to the calibration and validation of groundwater flow models therefore historical data for 20 observation wells within nsrb geological system were collected for 1983 2007 locations are shown in fig 1b in order to calibrate the modflow model the horizontal k h hydraulic conductivity and its ratio to vertical hydraulic conductivity i e k h k v values were adjusted in each layer and the model was run to reproduce the hydraulic head trend throughout nsrb although specific storage and yield are also adjustable parameters in modflow for calibration to the best of our knowledge no observed data related to the storage of geological units were available for nsrb hence we used modflow default values of 10 5 m 1 for specific storage and 0 2 for specific yield for all geological units furthermore the initial ranges of k h values derived from borehole studies smerdon et al 2017 could facilitate model calibration in assigning hydraulic properties to the five layers the initial range of k h k v was derived from the suggested ranges in the literature chen et al 2017 tanachaichoksirikun et al 2020 see table 1 we used the sufi 2 approach to sample 1000 sets of modflow parameters i e five k h and five k h k v parameters related to five layers to compare simulated and measured hydraulic heads acquired from 20 observation wells for the 1983 2007 period the three criteria of r 2 mean absolute error mae and normalized root mean squared error nrmse were used to compare month by month i e first day of each month simulations of modflow to their corresponding observed data the ideal values of r 2 mae and rmse are 1 0 and 0 respectively chunn et al 2019 see table s3 2 2 3 swat modflow in this study we used a coupled swat as the surface hydrological model modflow as the groundwater model in order to analyze the dynamics of gw sw interactions throughout the nsrb the coupling between swat and modflow can be done through gis applications the elevation and location of each modflow grid cell are correlated to the same properties related to swat hrus park and bailey 2017 due to the differences between the resolution and boundaries of spatial units of swat and modflow i e hrus in swat and grid cells in modflow some geolocations need to be done before integrating swat and modflow for this purpose the hrus within the swat model were disaggregated and geo located to establish the connection between swat and modflow grid cells using arcgis 10 3 software the disaggregated hrus dhrus pass the location and the amount of groundwater recharge calculated for a sub basin to the corresponding modflow cells and return calculated hydraulic head values from modflow to swat at the stream locations this coupling approach simulates the gw sw interaction across the nsrb on a daily basis in other words in each day of simulation and for each dhru the amount of deep groundwater recharge from surface water is calculated and added to the groundwater level for the same dhru the modflow is then simulated and the new groundwater level of the dhru is calculated and compared to the surface water level in swat combining these two processes quantifies gw sw interactions within a given day for a given dhru dhrus are later combined to form modflow grids and swat hrus and subbasins park and bailey 2017 for the gw sw interactions to occur realistically the location of the stream network of swat is needed to be projected on modflow cells in order to geographically specify the location of gw sw interactions and river formations bailey et al 2016 guzman et al 2015 hence some data conversions and modifications are needed in gis environment to connect the swat dhrus to modflow grid cells it should be noted that since swat modflow runs on a daily basis one single model run of the nsrb regional swat modflow model for 25 years lasted 4 6 h while the run time for the decoupled swat or modflow models was less than one minute this made it impossible for the authors to calibrate the coupled swat modflow using sufi 2 approach as only one iteration would last several months improvements in coupling swat and modflow such as considering weekly or monthly variations of gw sw interactions instead of daily are suggested for a more comprehensive assessment of hydrogeological systems at the regional scale the details of creating linking files and setting up swat modflow model are available in park and bailey 2017 2 3 future climate projection data in order to investigate climate change impacts climate projections of five climate models acquired from the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic cannon 2015 were used in this study pcic provides downscaled gcm climate scenarios from 1950 to 2100 bürger et al 2013 based on the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and historical daily gridded climate data for canada mckenney et al 2011 the data provided by pcic is canada wide downscaled climate change projections which are provided using the bias correction constructed analogues with the quantile mapping reordering bccaq method http www pacificclimate org data in this study we used a further downscaled pcic data based on a study by ammar et al 2020 and masud et al 2018 in their work the pcic downscaled data were further bias corrected with the commonly used delta approach chen et al 2011 quilbé et al 2008 the bias correction was performed using projected climate time series and historical data which resulted from analyzing a suite of four climate data sources used for reproducing historical flow for 130 hydrometric stations across alberta through a process based hydrological model to investigate future scenarios gcms were forced with different representative concentration pathways rcps which define different emission scenarios and subsequent radiative forcing in the earth atmospheric system van vuuren et al 2011 therefore two emission scenarios namely rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 in an ensemble of five gcms were used in this study for evaluating the climate change effects on snowmelt and gw sw interactions for the 2040 2064 period the choice of gcms in our study is based on climate models resulting in the broadest range of projected future climate for western north america zaremehrjardy et al 2020 the details of gcms used in this study can be found in table s4 in this study we assumed that the rate and magnitude of glacier melts are identical to those of historical periods which may have created uncertainty in our study the glacier retreats due to global warming may change their mass balance and melt runoff in the future clarke et al 2015 which can alter gw sw interactions in the streambed especially in upstream glacier fed tributaries 2 4 controllers of gw sw interactions in order to understand how different processes control dynamics of groundwater levels and therefore gw sw interactions in the streambed correlation analysis can be used in this study we used swat simulated data and compared the effects of regional snowmelt rainfall and evapotranspiration et on the variation of gw sw interactions based on their correlations in the swat model precipitation is assigned to each hru as the input data while rainfall and snowfall partitioning are simulated in the model based on ambient daily temperature and snow fall temperature neitsch et al 2011 et is also simulated by swat using penman monteith method neitsch et al 2011 and gw sw interactions are simulated by the coupled swat modflow model see section 2 2 3 we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso method tibshirani 1996 to rank the parameter importance of snowmelt rainfall and et as predictors to interpret how they affect dynamics of gw sw interactions as the response variable in order to perform lasso we first separated swat hrus based on their region of location i e we classified swat hrus into three categories of mountains foothills and plains regions for a given time step we further performed lasso on all hrus of each region separately in other words we grouped predictors and response variables of all hrus of a given region in each simulation time step to undergo lasso since we had 22 years of simulated data for analysis we performed lasso analysis 264 times for each region 264 months 22 years of simulation results 12 months in each year as we had three regions we performed lasso for 792 datasets 264 lasso analysis for each region three regions in this study finally in order to better represent the 264 results within each region we averaged the importance values of each parameter over months and separately over the years this allowed us to understand the inter annual and monthly dynamics of the importance values the results of the importance values for each region are presented as normalized values i e between 0 and 100 where 0 is related to the least importance value obtained in each region and 100 is related to the highest importance value and other values are normalized using a uniform distribution between 0 and 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration validation and uncertainty analysis 3 1 1 swat the calibration of the swat model was performed for 1993 2007 i e three years of warm up and 12 years of calibration whereas the validation was completed for 1983 1995 i e three years of warm up followed by 10 years of validation as shown in table 2 the statistics of each hydrometric station under calibration and validation are very similar it can also be seen that in mountains regions where stations 1 and 2 are located the values of the p factor and r factor are both low albeit the performance of the best simulation is comparable to other regions however the increase of the r factor in mountains region would increase the r factor in foothills and plains regions earlier studies suggest the importance of historical climate data in hydrological simulations especially in mountainous environments zaremehrjardy et al 2020 the lack of reliable climate data both spatially and temporally in mountains region could have contributed to low ranges of the p factor moreover this study has used theoretical estimations of monthly glacier melt for several regions which are assumed to be repeated in each simulation year faramarzi et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 notably enhancements in glacier melt simulations through process based approaches can further improve streamflow simulations in mountains i e upstream region according to the streamflow calibration and validation results shown in fig 2 and table 2 more than 60 of the observed data are bracketed within simulated 95ppu between 1986 and 2007 with desirable statistics for the best swat simulation in most of the regions it should be noted that the performance of model calibration at stations 2 and 4 is marginally lower than in other areas which could be attributed to the seasonal availability of observed streamflow data at these stations see table s2 the observed streamflow data for stations 2 and 4 was not available for november to march meaning that the low flow simulations were not evaluated in these stations however satisfactory statistics i e r 2 ns and b r 2 are observed in the statistics of other two stations in upstream regions i e stations 1 and 3 at the same p factor and r factor levels as stations 2 and 4 respectively this suggests that the performance of stations 2 and 4 could be improved if observed data was available for all seasons enabling a comprehensive calibration of streamflow at those stations 3 1 2 modflow the results of comparisons between observed and simulated hydraulic heads are presented in this section out of 1000 parameter sets defined from the initial ranges of modflow parameters in table 1 the optimized parameter set listed in table 3 reproduced historical observations as shown in figure s1 using the best physical parameters in modflow table 3 calibration statistics were found to be satisfactory for the study region as a whole the comparison of our best simulated versus observed hydraulic heads available from 20 observation wells resulted in an r2 of 0 95 mae of 22 9 m and nrmse of 0 108 for the study region it should be noted that all of the groundwater observation data resides in the eastern part of the model i e foothills and plains regions and that there are no observation points within the mountains region the high values of mae could be related to the uncertainty arising from the lack of specific storage and yield data and the lack of reliable spatial data for defining regional scale boundary conditions in modflow however at the scale of our study region the calibration performance can be considered acceptable aliyari et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 clark et al 2011 for the mountains region where there is no observation data the simulated groundwater conditions generate flow both to the mountain creeks represented by hrus and established the large scale west to east groundwater system from mountains to plains regions although there is no observation data in the mountains for calibration conceptually the results honour conventional understanding 3 2 analysis of spatio temporal changes in snowmelt dynamics under changing climate the comparison of simulated historical 1983 2007 and future projections 2040 2064 of regional snowmelt along with their driving factors are presented in this section and summarized in table 4 since five gcms are used under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios see table s4 the future projections of model responses are presented in the form of possible ranges encompassing the minimum and maximum projected values for each time step the results are presented based on 7 day moving averages in order to smooth the daily outputs of swat and swat modflow as shown in fig 3 the snowmelt peak in mountains region historically occurs around may and june while the peak snowmelt in foothills and plains takes place earlier i e in march and april this is likely due to the lower temperatures in mountains region before spring i e before march fig 4 a the gcms simulated data showed that the average temperature of all regions in almost every season is projected to increase in the future fig 4a c this increase and changing snowfall patterns fig 3d have resulted in different snowmelt projections in different seasons in the nsrb mountains region increased snowmelt is projected in april and may for the mountains region fig 3a which can be mostly related to the increase of temperature in those months fig 4a although temperature increases are projected to occur almost every month in the mountains region their impact in colder seasons and springs is more significant because where air temperature increases from freezing point to melting points i e with temperatures close to 0 c more snowmelt events will be initiated this is consistent with the literature which shows that climate change in mountains region might result in earlier snowmelts than present aygün et al 2020 clilverd et al 2011 the earlier snowmelt fig 3a along with decreased projected snowfall in mountains region fig 3d has also resulted in less accumulated snow in summer ultimately leading to less projected snowmelt due to lower snow depths in summer furthermore comparison of fig 3d and 4d shows a projected decrease in snowfall and no change increase of precipitation in the mountains region this is translated into more rainfall events projected in the future which can result in more rain on snow events and potentially substantial change in streamflow and soil moisture dynamics qi et al 2017 these results are in line with numerous findings in the literature see for example elias et al 2015 kobierska et al 2011 moore et al 2007 sadro et al 2018 spring snowmelt in the plains region is projected to decrease fig 3c although no significant change in snowmelt peak timing is predicted nevertheless the snowmelt in the plains region is predicted to increase in the winter i e december to february although there is no significant change in predicted snowfall patterns for the plains region see fig 3f the projected increase in temperature of this area is more noticeable than those in other regions which can result in increased snowmelt in cold seasons fig 3c and 4c in addition snowmelt is predicted to decrease from march to september i e spring and summer and the projected snowmelt is mostly zero from june to september this is due to the decrease in snowfall and snow accumulation leaving less or no snowpack on the ground to be melted in warm seasons finally behaviour of snowmelt and climate variables in the foothills region lie between those of mountains and plains regions since this region holds the characteristics of both regions in terms of climate topography and elevation variations analysis of precipitation snowfall and temperature patterns of nsrb regions figs 3 and 4 suggest an overall increase of precipitation projected for the future of all regions except for warm seasons in the mountains region these trends however are not repeated for snowfall patterns where it is predicted that the snowfall will notably decrease in almost all seasons in mountains region and decreases or remains unchanged in the plains region fig 3d f based on such results more rainfall events can be anticipated under future conditions while snowfall is mostly projected to decrease or remain unchanged under climate change scenarios 3 3 analysis of spatio temporal changes in gw sw interactions under changing climate the results of gw sw interactions and their changes under climate change scenarios are presented in this section and are summarized in table 4 based on the following seasons winter december january february spring march april may summer june july august and fall september october november in fig 5 the average of historical gw sw interactions for 1983 2007 are shown for each modflow grid cell in the top model layer where positive values denote stream water gain due to groundwater discharge to the stream bed recharging surface water and negative values denote stream water loss due to the water transmission from the stream bed to recharge groundwater fig 5 demonstrates that stream water gain is greater than water loss especially in mountains and foothills regions nevertheless in some parts of the mountains region there is a water loss and groundwater recharge and the gw sw fluxes are mostly small compared to these in the foothills region most of the groundwater contribution to surface water within nsrb occurs in the foothills region this is intensified in the spring and summer months where the increased hydraulic head i e the water table in the unconfined aquifer due to snowmelt and precipitations has resulted in more contribution of groundwater to surface water in the stream beds our results are consistent with similar findings from earlier studies chunn et al 2019 foster and allen 2015 where most of the interactions had occurred in the form of groundwater discharge i e water gain in the streams in the foothills region the gaining conditions of the river network in mountainous and foothills region are due to high levels of groundwater which direct and discharge groundwater into the surface in the plains region areas i e modflow grid cells see fig 5 with groundwater recharge i e negative values of gw sw interactions are more than those in foothills and mountains regions yet the areas with lower groundwater discharge rates to the streams are slightly dominant in the plains region compared to mountain and foothills mainly due to the larger geographic extent of plains fig 5 more importantly gw sw exchanges at the watershed scale are mostly controlled by subsurface lithology i e bedrock and aquifer properties and depth buss et al 2009 stanford and ward 1993 particularly by the layers that are close to the surface chunn et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the geological formations connected to the foothills region are displaced bedrock paskapoo and scollard layers therefore the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the paskapoo and scollard formations compared to other layers see table 3 could have an important influence on the high values of gw sw interactions in the foothills region as compared to the plains the rate of gw sw exchange in terms of groundwater recharge and discharge is low in all seasons of the plains region the lower exchange rate between gw and sw can be related to a more subdued water table in the plains region which might not increase significantly from snowmelt and rainfall to enhance interactions with surface water moreover the low hydraulic conductivity of the underlying layers of the plains region can be another reason for the slow groundwater interactions with surface water foster and allen 2015 results of changes in gw sw interactions under two future rcp scenarios indicated that some areas i e grid cells in modflow might experience an overall loss of water in the streambeds due to lower groundwater table positions in the future fig 6 the areas that are projected to lose surface water to groundwater are not specific to any hydroclimatic region however such projections are mostly found in summer and fall figs 6 and 7 in general a comparison between fig 6a and 6b shows that the location of regions with increasing and decreasing rates of gw sw interactions projected for the near future are not significantly different between rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios however by comparing maximum and minimum values of gw sw interactions between fig 6a and 6b it is evident that rcp 8 5 has projected less potential for groundwater discharge to surface water and more potential for groundwater recharge in the future particularly in summer and fall this is likely due to the higher temperatures projected in rcp 8 5 than rcp 2 6 scenarios which will predictably result in drier soil and lower groundwater levels fig 4 erler et al 2019 wu et al 2020 such decreased levels may result in more water percolation to the aquifer and less groundwater discharge to surface water petpongpan et al 2020 in the mountains and plains regions the historical gw sw interactions and their changes under rcp scenarios are insignificant in summer and fall in spring some areas i e grid cells in fig 6 show a decrease in groundwater recharge while others show an increase taking into account all the areas within each region to aggregate the gw sw interactions it is predicted under both rcp scenarios that stream water gain and groundwater contribution to the rivers will increase in most of the spring and summer in the future fig 7 the higher values and changes of gw sw interactions in spring and summer highlight the important effect of snowmelt on initiating gw sw interactions in these seasons i e march to august foster and allen 2015 huntington and niswonger 2012 in fact higher projected stream water gain i e groundwater discharge to surface water can be partially attributed to snowmelt recession and its effect on soil water which is the buffer between surface water and groundwater in the future snowmelt plays an important part in groundwater recharge which ultimately leads to increased groundwater head and water discharge to the surface carroll et al 2019 flerchinger et al 1993 as shown in fig 7 the peak of historical gw sw interactions in early spring is projected to occur earlier and with higher rates than historical peaks in all regions particularly in the mountains such changes might be related to earlier snowmelt as the main source of soil water and gw recharge projected in the mountains fig 3a in fact a comparison of changes in gw sw interactions fig 7a and in snowmelt fig 3a in mountains region shows the same patterns of increase in both processes in spring this pattern however is not observed in the foothills and plains region as clearly as it can be seen in mountains suggesting that the changes in gw sw interactions in foothills and plains areas are less directly controlled by snowmelt this is in agreement with previous empirical studies showing that snowmelt run off and plants growing season precipitation are important factors in groundwater recharge although such studies have not explicitly focused on gw sw interactions carroll et al 2019 du et al 2019 hayashi and farrow 2014 the projected changes in gw sw interactions of the foothills region show two different patterns 1 a noticeable increase of water gain due to groundwater discharge to streams in winter and spring and 2 increase of groundwater recharge from changing surface hydrology in july to september mainly in summer which is intensified under rcp 8 5 scenarios figs 6 and 7 the projected increased groundwater discharge to surface water in spring can be related to 1 earlier snowmelt in mountains region which will likely increase groundwater levels and 2 snowmelt increase in spring in the foothills region under climate change such increases in groundwater levels may result in the contribution of groundwater to surface water in mountainous and particularly foothills regions moreover projected annual precipitation for the foothills region shows more potential for precipitation increase than projections in the mountains future changes of precipitation based on different climate change models and scenarios range between 871 6 mm3 year decrease to 2046 mm3 year increase for foothills while this range is between 1860 mm3 year decrease to 1144 1 mm3 year increase for mountains the high potential of the foothills for an increase in precipitation can be an important contributor to the projected increase of gw sw interactions in the foothills region it is worth mentioning that the groundwater levels of the mountains region affect the sub surface hydrogeology of foothills because of the connections of geological formations especially the paskapoo layer between these two regions analysis of our simulated data shows that changes of gw sw interactions within the foothills region that are most affected by climate change are consistent with changes in mountains regions rather than in the plains region this shows the close connection of mountains regions and foothills regions where groundwater heads in the mountains region have a direct influence on those in the foothills region leibowitz et al 2018 nepal et al 2014 as mentioned before future projections of the gw sw interactions for summer in the foothills region show an opposite trend compared to spring changes while a significant increase in surface water gain was projected in the spring for the foothills region summer projections show a noticeable decrease in surface water gain this can be related to the reduced snowmelt in summer in the foothills region nevertheless this seasonal shift of projected gw sw interactions from increased surface water gain in spring to increased surface water loss in summer is not projected in the mountains which creates an interesting distinction between these two regions in terms of gw sw interactions and their projections one possible reason for this could be the earlier snowmelt projected in the mountains which will substantially replenish groundwater and slow down the drop of gw sw interactions in subsequent months furthermore vegetation cover in the foothills region could also be a reason for such a phase change in gw sw interactions from spring to summer the dynamics of water consumption by the vegetation cover et are spatially and temporally variable therefore complex interactions between vegetation cover and soil water in different seasons can result in changes in soil water and its connection to groundwater this will ultimately impact gw sw interactions as it is directly related to groundwater level d odorico et al 2007 yin et al 2019 3 4 analysis of relations between gw sw interactions and snowmelt regional results of gw sw interactions in this section summarized in table 4 are calculated as the sum of water loss i e negative values or water gain i e positive values related to stream network grids delineated within each region i e mountains foothills plains regional snowmelt is calculated as the weighted average snowmelt of all hrus within each region where the weight of hrus are their surface areas comparison of monthly simulated snowmelt and gw sw interactions for the historical period fig 8 suggests that the correlation between these two processes is only meaningful in mountains region with an r 2 of 0 494 fig 8a this clearly shows that snowmelt plays a key role in gw sw interactions in mountains region which is also observed in the analysis of monthly data see fig 9 a conversely the correlation between snowmelt and gw sw interactions in foothills and plains regions is minimal figs 8 and 9 r 2 of 0 01 these results are consistent with the findings of carroll et al 2019 where a high correlation was found between snowmelt and groundwater recharge in a mountain system the response of gw sw interactions to snowmelt is delayed in the foothills region fig 9b and nearly diminished in the plains region fig 9c these findings suggest that the influence of snowmelt on gw sw interactions in terms of volumetric water exchange decreases from west to east across the nsrb therefore a comprehensive evaluation of possible predictors of gw sw interactions will increase our knowledge of controllers of these processes within different hydro climatic regions see following sections in addition to snowmelt we analyzed two important groups of processes that control hydrology and water balance in different regions before applying the lasso analysis to quantify the importance of such parameters first the effect of rainfall particularly summer rainfall on gw sw interactions is critical especially in foothills and plains regions and should be considered as a controller of gw sw interactions sytsma et al 2020 hayashi and farrow 2014 reported that by taking into account the effect of snowmelt and growing season rainfall the correlation between these predictors and groundwater level rises improved secondly et is an important indicator of groundwater dynamics as it integrates the influence of land cover soil type and vegetation on terrestrial groundwater recharge and the subsequent interactions with streams condon et al 2020 condon and maxwell 2019 maxwell and condon 2016 actual et can be an important controller of hydrologic balances across all regions even in mountains region where evaporative demand from land cover and soil might be lower due to higher elevation and colder climate shi et al 2014 based on correlation analysis done by abimbola et al 2017 precipitation and et are potentially among the most explanatory variables of hydrology and water balance of catchments consequently we analyzed snowmelt rainfall and et as the potential predictors of gw sw interactions using lasso lasso analyses of the monthly fig 10 a and yearly fig 11 a data for the mountains region indicated that et and snowmelt were mostly important parameters in gw sw interaction dynamics while the correlation of rainfall and gw sw interactions were far less critical the importance of et is slightly higher than that of snowmelt suggesting that even in a mountains region where the vegetation cover is sparse and elevation is higher et can still be an important control of groundwater and its interactions with surface water it is also shown that the average importance of three hydrological variables can be highly variable across different months fig 10a however the importance of all hydrologic predictors i e snowmelt rainfall and et is higher in warmer seasons i e march to september a possible reason for this is that when temperature increases vegetation growth occurs and the soil hydrological components become dynamic and more directly connected therefore the correlation of water cycle variables and their impacts and feedbacks becomes more evident comparisons of figs 10 and 11 between mountains and foothills regions show that et strongly affects the formation of gw sw interactions in both regions this can be related to the existence of vegetation cover in the foothills region mainly forest which results in both evaporative and transpiration demands to be effective in influencing hydrological dynamics the main difference between foothills and mountains regions is changes in the importance of rainfall and snowmelt while rainfall demonstrates more importance in foothills region the importance of snowmelt has generally decreased from mountains to foothills this shows the more important effect of rainfall than snowmelt in the formation and dynamics of gw sw interactions in foothills region finally the results of plains region are shown in fig 10c and 11c it can be seen that the importance of snowmelt rainfall and et are relatively low in many months and years as compared to mountains and foothills regions since most of the importance values in these figures are very small no conclusion can be made on the importance of any of the three predictors in forming gw sw interactions in the plains region in other words gw sw interactions in the plains region do not have high and consistent correlations with any of individual snowmelt rainfall or et parameters previous studies have shown various important predictors that have controlled groundwater recharge in the plains region for example rukundo and doğan 2019 found that groundwater recharge is mostly controlled by land use and soil variables rather than hydrological processes or climate variables furthermore parizi et al 2020 showed that among eight different predictors the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration p e t p and soil moisture sm had the greatest influence on groundwater recharge dynamics in non mountainous aquifers while none of these studies focused on gw sw interactions as the response variable their conclusion was based on a comprehensive assessment of various predictors related to climate hydrology land cover and soil therefore the response of gw sw based on different predictors could vary which may also depend on field scale watershed scale or regional scale analysis e g fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 4 conclusions and future directions snowmelt and gw sw interactions are among the most important and dynamic hydrological processes in high elevation watersheds in cold regions and will be sensitive to future climate scenarios in this study we developed the coupled swat modflow model to assess the historical trend of snowmelt and gw sw interactions and their projections under future climate scenarios by using an ensemble climate dataset of five gcms under two future rcp scenarios furthermore we evaluated and discussed the correlations between snowmelt rainfall and et and dynamics of gw sw interactions in different regions across a large watershed that spanned mountain foothill and prairie settings the main conclusions of this study are 1 regional analysis shows that the historical patterns of snowmelt and gw sw interactions differ within mountains foothills and plains regions these processes also showed distinct responses to climate change in different regions under climate change scenarios it is predicted that precipitation will increase in spring march to may and early summer in all regions of the nsrb however air temperature is projected to increase in most regions and in all seasons leading to a decrease in snowfall for all seasons in the mountains regions except for the winter and early spring snowfall no considerable change in snowfall is expected for the foothills region finally the spring and summer snowfall on the plains region is projected to decrease with negligible change in precipitation for the remainder of the year 2 analysis of regional snowmelt projections under future climate scenarios showed that the mountains region of the nsrb may experience earlier snowmelt with snowmelt increasing in april and may while decreasing in june and july also a considerable snowmelt decrease is predicted in fall and winter september to february in the mountains region possibly because of less snow accumulation projected for this area in the foothills region snowmelt is projected to increase in warm seasons i e spring and summer with no considerable changes in snowmelt peak time contrary to the mountains and foothills regions the plains region is projected to experience increased snowmelt in winter and less snowmelt in spring and summer the increased winter snowmelt of the plains region can be attributed to increased air temperature in winter whereas the decreased snowmelt of spring and summer is due to less snow cover available in the future for melting to occur 3 historical analysis of gw sw interactions shows that groundwater discharge to surface water dominates such interactions in most areas of nsrb and in all seasons both mountainous and foothills region showed predominant groundwater discharge to streams the groundwater contribution to surface water is notably larger in spring and summer suggesting the important effect of snowmelt driven recharge on increasing groundwater levels in mountains region and recharging surface water through gw sw interactions in mountainous and foothills region finally most of the historical groundwater recharge occurs in plains region which can be related to lower groundwater levels due to et land cover and topography 4 results of climate change scenarios and future projections of gw sw interactions show a general increase of groundwater discharge to surface water in mountains and plains regions the increased contribution of groundwater to surface water under climate change in mountains region occurs in warm seasons which can be related to the earlier snowmelt projected in this region in the plains region increased precipitation especially in warm seasons could be an important factor in increasing groundwater discharge to surface water furthermore the foothills region is projected to experience an increased groundwater discharge in winter and spring followed by a noticeable increase in groundwater recharge in summer it is argued that this trend can be a direct result of earlier snowmelt and its percolation in both mountains and foothills regions followed by groundwater level decline in summer resulting from less snowmelt and increased air temperature within the foothills region 5 the relationship between regional snowmelt and gw sw interactions in mountains foothills and plains regions showed high correlations r 2 0 494 in mountains regions but negligible correlations in foothills and plains regions r 2 0 01 for both regions the importance of snowmelt et and rainfall as main controls of hydrology on gw sw dynamics was analyzed using the lasso method it was shown that snowmelt and et were the main controllers of the gw sw dynamics in mountains region in the foothills region rainfall plays a more important part as snowmelt showed less correlation with gw sw interactions finally none of the snowmelt or rainfall were considered effective on changes of gw sw interactions in the plains region future research can focus on other indicators such as land use and soil parameters that can potentially control gw sw interactions in the plains region this research facilitates a better understanding of the dynamics of gw sw interactions in relation to snowmelt and the possible changes under future climate scenarios at a regional scale it also demonstrates how snowmelt et and rainfall might affect gw sw interactions and how such effects can differ in various seasons within different echo hydrological regions our study shows that although a complex relation among climate topography vegetation and other factors results in the formation of gw sw interactions the snowmelt run off is one of the main drivers of this process in mountains region and et greatly controls gw sw interactions in various regional settings future studies can also focus on the effects of other influential factors on gw sw dynamics in regions with various topography and land use settings to better recognize major drivers of groundwater recharge and its connection to surface water for example recent studies have shown the vital role of depression based recharge i e the recharge from wetlands potholes and other water bodies especially in canadian prairies on gw sw interactions brannen et al 2015 hayashi et al 2016 hayashi and farrow 2014 as a result it is important to explicitly simulate the effects of these landscape features and water bodies such as their seasonal fill and spill processes on groundwater recharge at a regional scale another consideration for a more detailed study in the future is the hypothesis that land use land cover soil properties and hydraulic conductivity of geological formations may change over time brannen et al 2015 moreover apart from snowmelt simulations addressed in this study a more detailed simulation of glacier melt and initial snowpack storage and their effects on infiltration and gw sw interactions allows for a more holistic understanding of glacier and snow partitioning in groundwater dynamics castellazzi et al 2019 safeeq et al 2013 finally the effect of frozen soil and low permeability lenses on infiltration groundwater recharge and gw sw interactions can be substantial in cold region hydrology and hydrogeology aygün et al 2020 gomez velez et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 we acknowledge that such effects are not explicitly considered in hydrological and hydrogeological modelling within this study but improvements can be made in future research on a better representation of the aforementioned factors in regional integrated hydrological and hydrogeological modelling this will result in a better understanding of the governing processes in the formation of groundwater recharge and how it connects to surface water declaration of competing

3693,snowmelt and groundwater surface water gw sw dynamics are the most dominant controllers of hydrological processes and water availability in northern latitudes particularly in warm seasons the dynamics and changes of snowmelt and gw sw interactions and their interrelationship at the regional scale are poorly understood in regional analyses to fill this gap this study implements a process based hydrological model using a coupled soil and water assessment tool swat and modflow model to map snowmelt and gw sw dynamics at regional scales the primary research questions are how are gw sw interactions altered by snowmelt dynamics and what is the effect of climate change on snowmelt and gw sw dynamics we simulated snowmelt and groundwater dynamics across a large watershed encompassing different ecohydrological regions including mountains foothills and plains analyzing the spatio temporal relationships between gw sw interactions and snowmelts in historical 1983 2007 and future 2040 2064 periods we used an ensemble of five global climate models gcms for future projections based on two emission scenarios i e rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 we also used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso method to examine the effects of snowmelt evapotranspiration et and rainfall on gw sw interactions these analyses are implemented in mountains foothills and plains regions in a large snow dominated watershed in western canada results show that earlier snowmelt is predicted in mountains and foothills regions under climate change scenarios while less snow accumulation and melt is anticipated in plains region future projections of gw sw interactions show an increase in groundwater discharge to streams in the winter and spring seasons mainly due to earlier snowmelt in winter and spring in mountains and foothills regions on the other hand more surface water loss to groundwater in summer and fall is predicted which can be caused by the low level of groundwater under future conditions in foothills regions correlation analysis between regional snowmelt and gw sw interactions for historical simulations show a higher correlation r 2 0 494 in mountains region compared to very low correlations r 2 0 01 in foothills and plains regions lasso results showed that et was the main control of dynamics of gw sw interactions in all regions of the study snowmelt was the next most important predictor of gw sw dynamics in the mountains region while rainfall was more important in the foothills region nevertheless none of the three predictors strongly influenced gw sw dynamics in the plains region mainly due to low groundwater levels and a lack of connectivity with the surface water overall it is shown that the eco hydrogeological and climatic variability of different regions plays an important part in governing gw sw dynamics keywords snowmelt groundwater surface water interactions regional hydrology climate change impacts swat modflow 1 introduction the spatial and temporal availability of water resources is controlled by hydrological cycles harding et al 2011 which are altered by climate change and anthropogenic influence vogel et al 2019 cochand et al 2019 in cold regions where the climate is cold enough to sustain a seasonal or permanent snowpack snowmelt is the primary source of streamflow during spring and early summer and also recharges groundwater which becomes the primary source of base flow during low flow periods dumanski et al 2015 all of these processes control the availability of water resources in dynamic e g surface run off and relatively static e g groundwater storage environments flerchinger et al 1992 the movement of groundwater and surface water in relation to snowmelt dynamics plays a significant role in dictating future water availability and distribution maurya et al 2018 aygün et al 2020 especially in northern latitudes assessment of groundwater surface water gw sw interactions in response to snowmelt has been the subject of several studies see for example schilling et al 2019 the gw sw interaction referred to here results in a permanent or seasonal water gain in the rivers due to high gw levels and groundwater discharge to streambeds or b water loss from river beds due to low gw levels baalousha 2012 kebede et al 2021 although some literature has focused on snowmelt and gw sw interactions most studies are conducted at the field scale focusing on understanding the effects of a particular physical process understanding gw sw interactions in cold regions requires a thorough assessment of the spatiotemporal variations of snowmelt and its relationship to both hydrological and hydrogeological processes under a range of diverse ecological settings at a regional scale studying such relationships and processes at a large watershed scale helps address future climate change concerns in systems where groundwater and surface water are used conjunctively to satisfy multiple water use sectors aliyari et al 2019 guevara ochoa et al 2020 hagemann et al 2013 earlier studies have demonstrated that in cold regions and northern latitudes snowmelt controls the storage and flow of water within both surface and subsurface hydrological systems hayashi and farrow 2014 lundberg et al 2016 while streamflow is vulnerable to changes in snowmelt patterns in these regions huntington and niswonger 2012 the hydrologic interactions between groundwater and streamflow are particularly affected by changes in snowmelt this is because deficits in the soil water profile or in the groundwater aquifers inhibit these exchanges from taking place unless they are restored by sources such as spring snowmelt or summer precipitation chauvin et al 2011 several field based studies have investigated snowmelt dynamics in relation to gw sw interactions clilverd et al 2011 hayashi and farrow 2014 jutebring sterte et al 2018 okkonen and kløve 2011 depending on the study site geographic location and the purpose of study the physical parameters dominating gw sw interactions or their relation to snow variations were different which makes the application of empirical studies to regional scale assessments challenging this is because the response of hydrogeological processes to snowmelt and gw sw connectivity can vary across different spatiotemporal scales avanzi et al 2015 bocchiola and groppelli 2010 as such process based hydrological and hydrogeological modelling is used as an alternative approach for evaluating snowmelt dynamics and gw sw interactions in current and future climates at the regional scale which is often the most relevant scale for policy and planning haddeland et al 2014 nevertheless in most of the model based studies both snowmelt simulation and gw sw interactions were analyzed in small areas with a relatively homogeneous climate land use and topography debele et al 2010 huntington and niswonger 2012 jutebring sterte et al 2018 qi et al 2017 saydi et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 in more complex regions such as the eastern slopes of the canadian rocky mountains several variables such as season climate vegetation and topography play distinctive and convoluted roles in the dynamics of these two processes carroll et al 2018 smith et al 2014 this is exemplified in mountainous and foothill environments where the properties of soils and subsurface media control the discharge of groundwater to streams that move water from high elevation catchments to valley bottoms allen et al 2010 jutebring sterte et al 2018 at lower elevations in foothills and plains regions where vegetation density is high the lower snowfall accumulation translates to less snowmelt and occurs prior to the peak of plant consumption producing small amounts of groundwater recharge the subsurface geology and variations in the thickness of units below the surface control the effects of groundwater recharge and the rate of groundwater flow leading to variable seasonal trends in water table fluctuation and its feedback to surface hydrology devito et al 1996 in warm seasons when snowmelt rapidly drops off and the growing season begins the connection between snowmelt and groundwater table weakens which is an example of how the relation between snowmelt and groundwater systems can vary in time and space carroll et al 2019 furthermore snowmelt is not only a critical source of water in mountains and foothills but also in plains regions of northern latitudes specifically in multiple prairie provinces in canada gray and landine 1988 pavlovskii et al 2018 the warmer average air temperatures produced by climate change in these regions can create a shift in the snowmelt season or in the precipitation type from snow to rain reducing water storage in snowpack and compromising its reliability as a viable water source macdonald et al 2012 schindler and donahue 2006 the relation between snowmelt and gw sw interactions and the potential impact of climate change are documented in various studies assani et al 2012 ferguson and maxwell 2010 mccallum et al 2013 scibek et al 2007 the literature shows that the impacts of gw sw interactions on the partitioning of water resources in hydrologic systems are significant and diverse akiyama sakai et al 2007 lewandowski et al 2020 which may be different in the future under climate change scenarios panagoulia and dimou 1996 scibek et al 2007 the physical relationships however are not thoroughly understood especially in regional scale landscapes where physical properties can show significant variations in time and space barthel and banzhaf 2016 also the existing studies are primarily conducted in more homogeneous environments and the direct effect of snowmelt on gw sw interactions in large watersheds is not adequately evaluated the analysis of correlations between snowmelt and gw sw interactions can provide insights into the factors governing these processes and how these relations might vary across landscapes with changing elevations land use land cover hydro climate and geologic settings the overarching goal of this study is to analyze snowmelt and gw sw interactions and their changes under future climate conditions at a regional scale this study aims to improve the understanding of correlations between snowmelt and gw sw interactions and how they are inter connected in different hydro climate and geologic settings we examine the effect of climate conditions topography and land use land cover on such changes and interactions in a large watershed to this end we coupled a surface hydrological model using the soil and water assessment tool swat with a groundwater model using modflow to evaluate the dynamics of snowmelt and gw sw interactions in different regions of the north saskatchewan river basin nsrb in western canada the specific objectives of this paper include 1 analysis of the response of seasonal changes in gw sw interactions to future climate at a regional scale 2 assessment of how spatiotemporal variation of gw sw interactions are associated with snowmelt patterns and other hydrological variables and 3 comparison and discussion of such responses and interactions in different hydro climatic regions such as mountains foothills and plains regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nsrb was selected for the study area as an example of a large watershed with high variability of climate and land use land cover fig 1 the nsrb is relatively large 60 000 km2 and comprises more than 9 of the landmass area in alberta canada north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 the nsrb elevation ranges from 3478 masl on the west side to 500 masl on the alberta saskatchewan border this difference in elevation leads to average annual precipitation 1983 to 2007 ranging from 760 mm year in the west to 400 mm year in the east the historical data for average daily temperature within the nsrb suggests a range from 30 c in winter up to 29 c in summer with high spatial and temporal variability government of canada 2019 the north saskatchewan river nsr originates from headwaters in the rocky mountains particularly in the columbia icefield in banff national park the river flows more than a thousand kilometers before reaching the alberta saskatchewan border the nsr later joins the south saskatchewan river which ultimately drains into hudson bay north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 the nsr is a major tributary to the saskatchewan river as the annual discharge of nsr at the alberta saskatchewan border is more than seven cubic kilometers alberta environment and parks 2019 this river is regulated by two hydroelectric dams namely bighorn dam on the main stem of nsr and brazeau dam on the tributary brazeau river the variation in topography presence of glaciers and mountain snowpacks and land cover consisting of forests wetlands and agricultural lands north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 fig 1a have resulted in complex hydrological processes gw sw interactions and climate variability from mountains to plains in the regions historic river flow at the city of edmonton hydat station 05df001 see fig 1 shows a decrease from 1911 to 2013 north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2005 also trend analysis of observed data from four selected climate stations within the nsrb namely nordegg 1915 to 2007 rocky mountain house 1978 to 2007 vermilion 1913 to 2007 and the city of edmonton 1880 to 2007 shows an increase in temperature climate change studies on the nsrb suggest an increase of temperature between 3 c and 5 c for different areas in the basin by 2100 farr et al 2018 the importance of groundwater and its relation to surface water is critical in the nsrb as a significant portion of groundwater recharge is from rivers and lakes when their water level is high north saskatchewan river basin council 2013 on the other hand groundwater discharge into many rivers and streams of the nsrb accounts for a significant share of streamflow that occurs in low flow seasons such as late fall and throughout the winter north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2009 therefore there is a need for watershed planners to understand the impacts of changing climate on these main hydrological processes and water availability within the nsrb in order to adapt their plans for surface water and groundwater management golder associates 2008 north saskatchewan watershed alliance 2012 2 2 hydrological model and input data 2 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based semi distributed hydrological model that simulates the quality and quantity of surface water in daily time steps arnold et al 2012 arnold et al 1998 swat is a powerful tool for simulating climate change impacts and the effects of land management practices on the dynamics of point source and non point source pollutants affecting surface water quality and water quantity over large and complex watersheds numerous hydrological processes can be simulated by swat including but not limited to surface run off groundwater discharge lateral flow streamflow snowmelt evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture dynamics neitsch et al 2011 developing a swat model requires input climate data including precipitation temperature humidity wind speed and solar radiation the delineation of sub basins and hydrological response units hrus can be performed through the application of gis maps including digital elevation models dems land use and land cover and soil maps and their physical properties hrus characterized by homogeneous soil land use and slope parameters are delineated within sub basins and they are the smallest spatial units for process simulations in the model table s1 shows the name extent and sources of different datasets for building the swat model in this study in this study a 90 m 90 m dem was used to set up the swat model for the nsrb a total of 174 sub basins were delineated using a pre defined river network generated previously from a 10 m 10 m resolution dem table s1 based on their elevation and land cover hrus were grouped into three distinct regions called mountains foothills and plains regions fig 1b zaremehrjardy et al 2020 for regional analysis historical climate data including precipitation temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity was derived from faramarzi et al 2015 who used various climate datasets from meteorological stations and gridded products to reproduce historical streamflow throughout the province of alberta we used the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour 2015 to calibrate and validate the nsrb swat model for 1993 2007 and 1983 1995 periods respectively with a warm up period of three years considered for each period the choice of parameters and their ranges for model calibration and validation were obtained from faramarzi et al 2017 during model calibration each iteration contained 1000 samples of parameter sets from their physically meaningful ranges neitsch et al 2011 resulting in 1000 swat simulations for each simulation the monthly observed and simulated streamflow were compared at six hydrometric stations within nsrb fig 1 several iterations each containing 1000 simulations were performed to acquire optimum ranges of swat parameters for efficiency this process was parallelized to over 200 computing cores using a parallelization approach developed by du et al 2020 the locations and properties of the hydrometric stations are shown in fig 1a and table s2 respectively to evaluate the goodness of fit of the swat model we considered three widely used criteria of efficiency the coefficient of determination r 2 the slope gradient weighted coefficient of determination b r 2 and the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency coefficient the detailed formulation and description of these criteria can be found in table s3 in addition to the performance criteria related to optimal swat parameter sets among the 1000 simulations in each iteration we used two statistical factors namely the p factor and r factor to evaluate uncertainties associated with model parameters model structure and observed data the p factor ranges from 0 to 1 and determines the percentage of the measured data bracketed within the uncertainty band generated by swat the uncertainty band in sufi 2 is calculated as 95 percent of the cumulative distribution of the simulated variables defined as 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu hereafter the r factor ranging from 0 to represents the width of the predicted uncertainty band when calibrating a model using the sufi 2 approach the ideal outcome is a p factor of 1 indicating that 100 of the measured data are reproduced using simulations an r factor of 0 indicates a minimum uncertainty prediction or a perfect simulation however due to uncertainty related to input and measured data the model structure and user defined parameters in hydrological modelling a p factor value of more than 0 5 and an r factor of close to 1 are suggested to be representative of a successful model calibration faramarzi et al 2009 faramarzi et al 2017 2 2 2 modflow model modflow is a three dimensional physically based groundwater model that uses a finite difference method for groundwater modelling in variably saturated subsurface systems bailey et al 2016 a modflow model for the nsrb was developed using visual modflow flex 6 0 waterloo hydrogeologic 2021 using the newton formulation of modflow 2005 modflow nwt to mitigate the challenge of wetting and drying modflow cells bailey et al 2016 the modflow model developed for the nsrb covers 181 500 k m 2 which is larger than the nsrb area in order for the modflow grid network to encompass the entire nsrb delineated by the swat model fig 1 a total of 55 33 grid cells were defined in the modflow model with the dimensions of each grid cell set to 10 km 10 km although a coarse grid resolution was chosen in modflow the structure of modflow and swat modflow for the nsrb remained relatively complex because of the representation of geological formations having a variable thickness and the west to east topographic elevation change across the nsrb fig 1c by defining the thickness and layer geometry of the geological formations in the modflow model the large scale west to east movement of groundwater from the mountains to the prairies plains region would be explicitly represented in the simulation of groundwater flow and interaction with the nsr the minimum input data required to set up modflow grids for an area consists of geological formations and corresponding hydraulic conductivity and aquifer storage properties in this study five main layers of modflow have been set up each corresponding to a geological formation in alberta from the ground surface to depth geological units include the sediments above the bedrock and the following upper cretaceous paleogene bedrock formations paskapoo siltstone and mudstone interbedded with coarse sandstone channels scollard sandstone siltstone and mudstone with extensive coal seams battle mudstone and horseshoe canyon mudstone sandstone and coal seams a very simplified bedrock unit that represents the rocky mountains has also been included to allow the representation of mountainous groundwater to be included in the modflow model the extent and elevation of geological formations and the hydraulic properties of each formation were acquired from the alberta geological survey alberta geological survey 2019 smerdon et al 2017 the possible ranges of horizontal hydraulic conductivity k h values for each geological formation were determined based on the maximum and minimum k h values measured from various boreholes throughout the west central part of alberta smerdon et al 2017 table 1 shows the names and property value ranges of each geological formation considered for this study the base of the modflow model was set to 500 m below sea level mbsl and was assigned a no flow hydraulic boundary this allowed groundwater conditions to be simulated from the ground surface varying from 3478 to 500 masl to 500 mbsl which represents at least 1 km total thickness and up to nearly 4 km of the subsurface thickness while this thickness is likely greater than the depth of groundwater movement interacting with the nsr it allows the large scale mountain to plains groundwater system as well as any deeper geological formations that might connect to the surface to be broadly represented chunn et al 2019 according to observation wells related to different geological formations of the nsrb the hydraulic head observed in this region is higher than 600 m above sea level see figure s1 as a result considering 500 m below sea level i e more than one kilometer below the lowest observed head as the bottom of modflow model will preserve groundwater dynamics simulations within different geological formations the geology of the rocky mountains is complex and includes layers that have been deformed and faulted during mountain formation alberta geological survey and alberta energy regulator 2021 as such the elevation data for the top and bottom of geological formations were not known for a part of the mountains region in the study area i e the western side of nsrb close to the rocky mountains however to include a generalized mountain block within the modflow model it was assumed that the elevation of geological formation at the west side of the nsrb is constant with a value equal to the most western side of the study area where elevation data was available we used information from the dem data of the nsrb to fill in the missing bedrock data for the top of the upmost layer the layer that is closest to the ground surface in modflow the hydraulic properties of bedrock in the rocky mountains are unknown and were assumed based on a range that seemed realistic considering the lower permeability nature of the rock formations furthermore groundwater observation data are absent in the mountains region rather than attempting to accurately represent an unknown groundwater component these assumptions allowed groundwater flow to occur in the mountains region as part of the simulation and established large scale groundwater movement from the mountains region to the plains to represent the initial condition of the groundwater system hydraulic boundary conditions rivers groundwater recharge and an initial hydraulic head distribution were necessary initial hydraulic heads were simulated by allowing modflow to equilibrate with river riv and recharge rch boundary conditions imported from nsrb swat model that was not initially integrated with modflow model once equilibrium was achieved these initial hydraulic heads were used to represent initial conditions in developing a coupled swat modflow model of the region additional details of the complete processes of importing riv and rch data from swat to modflow can be found in chunn et al 2019 and park and bailey 2017 modflow simulates hydraulic head in all the cells within a model which is the sum of actual groundwater elevation and pressure head historical hydraulic head data is available from observation wells and they are critical to the calibration and validation of groundwater flow models therefore historical data for 20 observation wells within nsrb geological system were collected for 1983 2007 locations are shown in fig 1b in order to calibrate the modflow model the horizontal k h hydraulic conductivity and its ratio to vertical hydraulic conductivity i e k h k v values were adjusted in each layer and the model was run to reproduce the hydraulic head trend throughout nsrb although specific storage and yield are also adjustable parameters in modflow for calibration to the best of our knowledge no observed data related to the storage of geological units were available for nsrb hence we used modflow default values of 10 5 m 1 for specific storage and 0 2 for specific yield for all geological units furthermore the initial ranges of k h values derived from borehole studies smerdon et al 2017 could facilitate model calibration in assigning hydraulic properties to the five layers the initial range of k h k v was derived from the suggested ranges in the literature chen et al 2017 tanachaichoksirikun et al 2020 see table 1 we used the sufi 2 approach to sample 1000 sets of modflow parameters i e five k h and five k h k v parameters related to five layers to compare simulated and measured hydraulic heads acquired from 20 observation wells for the 1983 2007 period the three criteria of r 2 mean absolute error mae and normalized root mean squared error nrmse were used to compare month by month i e first day of each month simulations of modflow to their corresponding observed data the ideal values of r 2 mae and rmse are 1 0 and 0 respectively chunn et al 2019 see table s3 2 2 3 swat modflow in this study we used a coupled swat as the surface hydrological model modflow as the groundwater model in order to analyze the dynamics of gw sw interactions throughout the nsrb the coupling between swat and modflow can be done through gis applications the elevation and location of each modflow grid cell are correlated to the same properties related to swat hrus park and bailey 2017 due to the differences between the resolution and boundaries of spatial units of swat and modflow i e hrus in swat and grid cells in modflow some geolocations need to be done before integrating swat and modflow for this purpose the hrus within the swat model were disaggregated and geo located to establish the connection between swat and modflow grid cells using arcgis 10 3 software the disaggregated hrus dhrus pass the location and the amount of groundwater recharge calculated for a sub basin to the corresponding modflow cells and return calculated hydraulic head values from modflow to swat at the stream locations this coupling approach simulates the gw sw interaction across the nsrb on a daily basis in other words in each day of simulation and for each dhru the amount of deep groundwater recharge from surface water is calculated and added to the groundwater level for the same dhru the modflow is then simulated and the new groundwater level of the dhru is calculated and compared to the surface water level in swat combining these two processes quantifies gw sw interactions within a given day for a given dhru dhrus are later combined to form modflow grids and swat hrus and subbasins park and bailey 2017 for the gw sw interactions to occur realistically the location of the stream network of swat is needed to be projected on modflow cells in order to geographically specify the location of gw sw interactions and river formations bailey et al 2016 guzman et al 2015 hence some data conversions and modifications are needed in gis environment to connect the swat dhrus to modflow grid cells it should be noted that since swat modflow runs on a daily basis one single model run of the nsrb regional swat modflow model for 25 years lasted 4 6 h while the run time for the decoupled swat or modflow models was less than one minute this made it impossible for the authors to calibrate the coupled swat modflow using sufi 2 approach as only one iteration would last several months improvements in coupling swat and modflow such as considering weekly or monthly variations of gw sw interactions instead of daily are suggested for a more comprehensive assessment of hydrogeological systems at the regional scale the details of creating linking files and setting up swat modflow model are available in park and bailey 2017 2 3 future climate projection data in order to investigate climate change impacts climate projections of five climate models acquired from the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic cannon 2015 were used in this study pcic provides downscaled gcm climate scenarios from 1950 to 2100 bürger et al 2013 based on the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and historical daily gridded climate data for canada mckenney et al 2011 the data provided by pcic is canada wide downscaled climate change projections which are provided using the bias correction constructed analogues with the quantile mapping reordering bccaq method http www pacificclimate org data in this study we used a further downscaled pcic data based on a study by ammar et al 2020 and masud et al 2018 in their work the pcic downscaled data were further bias corrected with the commonly used delta approach chen et al 2011 quilbé et al 2008 the bias correction was performed using projected climate time series and historical data which resulted from analyzing a suite of four climate data sources used for reproducing historical flow for 130 hydrometric stations across alberta through a process based hydrological model to investigate future scenarios gcms were forced with different representative concentration pathways rcps which define different emission scenarios and subsequent radiative forcing in the earth atmospheric system van vuuren et al 2011 therefore two emission scenarios namely rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 in an ensemble of five gcms were used in this study for evaluating the climate change effects on snowmelt and gw sw interactions for the 2040 2064 period the choice of gcms in our study is based on climate models resulting in the broadest range of projected future climate for western north america zaremehrjardy et al 2020 the details of gcms used in this study can be found in table s4 in this study we assumed that the rate and magnitude of glacier melts are identical to those of historical periods which may have created uncertainty in our study the glacier retreats due to global warming may change their mass balance and melt runoff in the future clarke et al 2015 which can alter gw sw interactions in the streambed especially in upstream glacier fed tributaries 2 4 controllers of gw sw interactions in order to understand how different processes control dynamics of groundwater levels and therefore gw sw interactions in the streambed correlation analysis can be used in this study we used swat simulated data and compared the effects of regional snowmelt rainfall and evapotranspiration et on the variation of gw sw interactions based on their correlations in the swat model precipitation is assigned to each hru as the input data while rainfall and snowfall partitioning are simulated in the model based on ambient daily temperature and snow fall temperature neitsch et al 2011 et is also simulated by swat using penman monteith method neitsch et al 2011 and gw sw interactions are simulated by the coupled swat modflow model see section 2 2 3 we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso method tibshirani 1996 to rank the parameter importance of snowmelt rainfall and et as predictors to interpret how they affect dynamics of gw sw interactions as the response variable in order to perform lasso we first separated swat hrus based on their region of location i e we classified swat hrus into three categories of mountains foothills and plains regions for a given time step we further performed lasso on all hrus of each region separately in other words we grouped predictors and response variables of all hrus of a given region in each simulation time step to undergo lasso since we had 22 years of simulated data for analysis we performed lasso analysis 264 times for each region 264 months 22 years of simulation results 12 months in each year as we had three regions we performed lasso for 792 datasets 264 lasso analysis for each region three regions in this study finally in order to better represent the 264 results within each region we averaged the importance values of each parameter over months and separately over the years this allowed us to understand the inter annual and monthly dynamics of the importance values the results of the importance values for each region are presented as normalized values i e between 0 and 100 where 0 is related to the least importance value obtained in each region and 100 is related to the highest importance value and other values are normalized using a uniform distribution between 0 and 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration validation and uncertainty analysis 3 1 1 swat the calibration of the swat model was performed for 1993 2007 i e three years of warm up and 12 years of calibration whereas the validation was completed for 1983 1995 i e three years of warm up followed by 10 years of validation as shown in table 2 the statistics of each hydrometric station under calibration and validation are very similar it can also be seen that in mountains regions where stations 1 and 2 are located the values of the p factor and r factor are both low albeit the performance of the best simulation is comparable to other regions however the increase of the r factor in mountains region would increase the r factor in foothills and plains regions earlier studies suggest the importance of historical climate data in hydrological simulations especially in mountainous environments zaremehrjardy et al 2020 the lack of reliable climate data both spatially and temporally in mountains region could have contributed to low ranges of the p factor moreover this study has used theoretical estimations of monthly glacier melt for several regions which are assumed to be repeated in each simulation year faramarzi et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 notably enhancements in glacier melt simulations through process based approaches can further improve streamflow simulations in mountains i e upstream region according to the streamflow calibration and validation results shown in fig 2 and table 2 more than 60 of the observed data are bracketed within simulated 95ppu between 1986 and 2007 with desirable statistics for the best swat simulation in most of the regions it should be noted that the performance of model calibration at stations 2 and 4 is marginally lower than in other areas which could be attributed to the seasonal availability of observed streamflow data at these stations see table s2 the observed streamflow data for stations 2 and 4 was not available for november to march meaning that the low flow simulations were not evaluated in these stations however satisfactory statistics i e r 2 ns and b r 2 are observed in the statistics of other two stations in upstream regions i e stations 1 and 3 at the same p factor and r factor levels as stations 2 and 4 respectively this suggests that the performance of stations 2 and 4 could be improved if observed data was available for all seasons enabling a comprehensive calibration of streamflow at those stations 3 1 2 modflow the results of comparisons between observed and simulated hydraulic heads are presented in this section out of 1000 parameter sets defined from the initial ranges of modflow parameters in table 1 the optimized parameter set listed in table 3 reproduced historical observations as shown in figure s1 using the best physical parameters in modflow table 3 calibration statistics were found to be satisfactory for the study region as a whole the comparison of our best simulated versus observed hydraulic heads available from 20 observation wells resulted in an r2 of 0 95 mae of 22 9 m and nrmse of 0 108 for the study region it should be noted that all of the groundwater observation data resides in the eastern part of the model i e foothills and plains regions and that there are no observation points within the mountains region the high values of mae could be related to the uncertainty arising from the lack of specific storage and yield data and the lack of reliable spatial data for defining regional scale boundary conditions in modflow however at the scale of our study region the calibration performance can be considered acceptable aliyari et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 clark et al 2011 for the mountains region where there is no observation data the simulated groundwater conditions generate flow both to the mountain creeks represented by hrus and established the large scale west to east groundwater system from mountains to plains regions although there is no observation data in the mountains for calibration conceptually the results honour conventional understanding 3 2 analysis of spatio temporal changes in snowmelt dynamics under changing climate the comparison of simulated historical 1983 2007 and future projections 2040 2064 of regional snowmelt along with their driving factors are presented in this section and summarized in table 4 since five gcms are used under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios see table s4 the future projections of model responses are presented in the form of possible ranges encompassing the minimum and maximum projected values for each time step the results are presented based on 7 day moving averages in order to smooth the daily outputs of swat and swat modflow as shown in fig 3 the snowmelt peak in mountains region historically occurs around may and june while the peak snowmelt in foothills and plains takes place earlier i e in march and april this is likely due to the lower temperatures in mountains region before spring i e before march fig 4 a the gcms simulated data showed that the average temperature of all regions in almost every season is projected to increase in the future fig 4a c this increase and changing snowfall patterns fig 3d have resulted in different snowmelt projections in different seasons in the nsrb mountains region increased snowmelt is projected in april and may for the mountains region fig 3a which can be mostly related to the increase of temperature in those months fig 4a although temperature increases are projected to occur almost every month in the mountains region their impact in colder seasons and springs is more significant because where air temperature increases from freezing point to melting points i e with temperatures close to 0 c more snowmelt events will be initiated this is consistent with the literature which shows that climate change in mountains region might result in earlier snowmelts than present aygün et al 2020 clilverd et al 2011 the earlier snowmelt fig 3a along with decreased projected snowfall in mountains region fig 3d has also resulted in less accumulated snow in summer ultimately leading to less projected snowmelt due to lower snow depths in summer furthermore comparison of fig 3d and 4d shows a projected decrease in snowfall and no change increase of precipitation in the mountains region this is translated into more rainfall events projected in the future which can result in more rain on snow events and potentially substantial change in streamflow and soil moisture dynamics qi et al 2017 these results are in line with numerous findings in the literature see for example elias et al 2015 kobierska et al 2011 moore et al 2007 sadro et al 2018 spring snowmelt in the plains region is projected to decrease fig 3c although no significant change in snowmelt peak timing is predicted nevertheless the snowmelt in the plains region is predicted to increase in the winter i e december to february although there is no significant change in predicted snowfall patterns for the plains region see fig 3f the projected increase in temperature of this area is more noticeable than those in other regions which can result in increased snowmelt in cold seasons fig 3c and 4c in addition snowmelt is predicted to decrease from march to september i e spring and summer and the projected snowmelt is mostly zero from june to september this is due to the decrease in snowfall and snow accumulation leaving less or no snowpack on the ground to be melted in warm seasons finally behaviour of snowmelt and climate variables in the foothills region lie between those of mountains and plains regions since this region holds the characteristics of both regions in terms of climate topography and elevation variations analysis of precipitation snowfall and temperature patterns of nsrb regions figs 3 and 4 suggest an overall increase of precipitation projected for the future of all regions except for warm seasons in the mountains region these trends however are not repeated for snowfall patterns where it is predicted that the snowfall will notably decrease in almost all seasons in mountains region and decreases or remains unchanged in the plains region fig 3d f based on such results more rainfall events can be anticipated under future conditions while snowfall is mostly projected to decrease or remain unchanged under climate change scenarios 3 3 analysis of spatio temporal changes in gw sw interactions under changing climate the results of gw sw interactions and their changes under climate change scenarios are presented in this section and are summarized in table 4 based on the following seasons winter december january february spring march april may summer june july august and fall september october november in fig 5 the average of historical gw sw interactions for 1983 2007 are shown for each modflow grid cell in the top model layer where positive values denote stream water gain due to groundwater discharge to the stream bed recharging surface water and negative values denote stream water loss due to the water transmission from the stream bed to recharge groundwater fig 5 demonstrates that stream water gain is greater than water loss especially in mountains and foothills regions nevertheless in some parts of the mountains region there is a water loss and groundwater recharge and the gw sw fluxes are mostly small compared to these in the foothills region most of the groundwater contribution to surface water within nsrb occurs in the foothills region this is intensified in the spring and summer months where the increased hydraulic head i e the water table in the unconfined aquifer due to snowmelt and precipitations has resulted in more contribution of groundwater to surface water in the stream beds our results are consistent with similar findings from earlier studies chunn et al 2019 foster and allen 2015 where most of the interactions had occurred in the form of groundwater discharge i e water gain in the streams in the foothills region the gaining conditions of the river network in mountainous and foothills region are due to high levels of groundwater which direct and discharge groundwater into the surface in the plains region areas i e modflow grid cells see fig 5 with groundwater recharge i e negative values of gw sw interactions are more than those in foothills and mountains regions yet the areas with lower groundwater discharge rates to the streams are slightly dominant in the plains region compared to mountain and foothills mainly due to the larger geographic extent of plains fig 5 more importantly gw sw exchanges at the watershed scale are mostly controlled by subsurface lithology i e bedrock and aquifer properties and depth buss et al 2009 stanford and ward 1993 particularly by the layers that are close to the surface chunn et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the geological formations connected to the foothills region are displaced bedrock paskapoo and scollard layers therefore the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the paskapoo and scollard formations compared to other layers see table 3 could have an important influence on the high values of gw sw interactions in the foothills region as compared to the plains the rate of gw sw exchange in terms of groundwater recharge and discharge is low in all seasons of the plains region the lower exchange rate between gw and sw can be related to a more subdued water table in the plains region which might not increase significantly from snowmelt and rainfall to enhance interactions with surface water moreover the low hydraulic conductivity of the underlying layers of the plains region can be another reason for the slow groundwater interactions with surface water foster and allen 2015 results of changes in gw sw interactions under two future rcp scenarios indicated that some areas i e grid cells in modflow might experience an overall loss of water in the streambeds due to lower groundwater table positions in the future fig 6 the areas that are projected to lose surface water to groundwater are not specific to any hydroclimatic region however such projections are mostly found in summer and fall figs 6 and 7 in general a comparison between fig 6a and 6b shows that the location of regions with increasing and decreasing rates of gw sw interactions projected for the near future are not significantly different between rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios however by comparing maximum and minimum values of gw sw interactions between fig 6a and 6b it is evident that rcp 8 5 has projected less potential for groundwater discharge to surface water and more potential for groundwater recharge in the future particularly in summer and fall this is likely due to the higher temperatures projected in rcp 8 5 than rcp 2 6 scenarios which will predictably result in drier soil and lower groundwater levels fig 4 erler et al 2019 wu et al 2020 such decreased levels may result in more water percolation to the aquifer and less groundwater discharge to surface water petpongpan et al 2020 in the mountains and plains regions the historical gw sw interactions and their changes under rcp scenarios are insignificant in summer and fall in spring some areas i e grid cells in fig 6 show a decrease in groundwater recharge while others show an increase taking into account all the areas within each region to aggregate the gw sw interactions it is predicted under both rcp scenarios that stream water gain and groundwater contribution to the rivers will increase in most of the spring and summer in the future fig 7 the higher values and changes of gw sw interactions in spring and summer highlight the important effect of snowmelt on initiating gw sw interactions in these seasons i e march to august foster and allen 2015 huntington and niswonger 2012 in fact higher projected stream water gain i e groundwater discharge to surface water can be partially attributed to snowmelt recession and its effect on soil water which is the buffer between surface water and groundwater in the future snowmelt plays an important part in groundwater recharge which ultimately leads to increased groundwater head and water discharge to the surface carroll et al 2019 flerchinger et al 1993 as shown in fig 7 the peak of historical gw sw interactions in early spring is projected to occur earlier and with higher rates than historical peaks in all regions particularly in the mountains such changes might be related to earlier snowmelt as the main source of soil water and gw recharge projected in the mountains fig 3a in fact a comparison of changes in gw sw interactions fig 7a and in snowmelt fig 3a in mountains region shows the same patterns of increase in both processes in spring this pattern however is not observed in the foothills and plains region as clearly as it can be seen in mountains suggesting that the changes in gw sw interactions in foothills and plains areas are less directly controlled by snowmelt this is in agreement with previous empirical studies showing that snowmelt run off and plants growing season precipitation are important factors in groundwater recharge although such studies have not explicitly focused on gw sw interactions carroll et al 2019 du et al 2019 hayashi and farrow 2014 the projected changes in gw sw interactions of the foothills region show two different patterns 1 a noticeable increase of water gain due to groundwater discharge to streams in winter and spring and 2 increase of groundwater recharge from changing surface hydrology in july to september mainly in summer which is intensified under rcp 8 5 scenarios figs 6 and 7 the projected increased groundwater discharge to surface water in spring can be related to 1 earlier snowmelt in mountains region which will likely increase groundwater levels and 2 snowmelt increase in spring in the foothills region under climate change such increases in groundwater levels may result in the contribution of groundwater to surface water in mountainous and particularly foothills regions moreover projected annual precipitation for the foothills region shows more potential for precipitation increase than projections in the mountains future changes of precipitation based on different climate change models and scenarios range between 871 6 mm3 year decrease to 2046 mm3 year increase for foothills while this range is between 1860 mm3 year decrease to 1144 1 mm3 year increase for mountains the high potential of the foothills for an increase in precipitation can be an important contributor to the projected increase of gw sw interactions in the foothills region it is worth mentioning that the groundwater levels of the mountains region affect the sub surface hydrogeology of foothills because of the connections of geological formations especially the paskapoo layer between these two regions analysis of our simulated data shows that changes of gw sw interactions within the foothills region that are most affected by climate change are consistent with changes in mountains regions rather than in the plains region this shows the close connection of mountains regions and foothills regions where groundwater heads in the mountains region have a direct influence on those in the foothills region leibowitz et al 2018 nepal et al 2014 as mentioned before future projections of the gw sw interactions for summer in the foothills region show an opposite trend compared to spring changes while a significant increase in surface water gain was projected in the spring for the foothills region summer projections show a noticeable decrease in surface water gain this can be related to the reduced snowmelt in summer in the foothills region nevertheless this seasonal shift of projected gw sw interactions from increased surface water gain in spring to increased surface water loss in summer is not projected in the mountains which creates an interesting distinction between these two regions in terms of gw sw interactions and their projections one possible reason for this could be the earlier snowmelt projected in the mountains which will substantially replenish groundwater and slow down the drop of gw sw interactions in subsequent months furthermore vegetation cover in the foothills region could also be a reason for such a phase change in gw sw interactions from spring to summer the dynamics of water consumption by the vegetation cover et are spatially and temporally variable therefore complex interactions between vegetation cover and soil water in different seasons can result in changes in soil water and its connection to groundwater this will ultimately impact gw sw interactions as it is directly related to groundwater level d odorico et al 2007 yin et al 2019 3 4 analysis of relations between gw sw interactions and snowmelt regional results of gw sw interactions in this section summarized in table 4 are calculated as the sum of water loss i e negative values or water gain i e positive values related to stream network grids delineated within each region i e mountains foothills plains regional snowmelt is calculated as the weighted average snowmelt of all hrus within each region where the weight of hrus are their surface areas comparison of monthly simulated snowmelt and gw sw interactions for the historical period fig 8 suggests that the correlation between these two processes is only meaningful in mountains region with an r 2 of 0 494 fig 8a this clearly shows that snowmelt plays a key role in gw sw interactions in mountains region which is also observed in the analysis of monthly data see fig 9 a conversely the correlation between snowmelt and gw sw interactions in foothills and plains regions is minimal figs 8 and 9 r 2 of 0 01 these results are consistent with the findings of carroll et al 2019 where a high correlation was found between snowmelt and groundwater recharge in a mountain system the response of gw sw interactions to snowmelt is delayed in the foothills region fig 9b and nearly diminished in the plains region fig 9c these findings suggest that the influence of snowmelt on gw sw interactions in terms of volumetric water exchange decreases from west to east across the nsrb therefore a comprehensive evaluation of possible predictors of gw sw interactions will increase our knowledge of controllers of these processes within different hydro climatic regions see following sections in addition to snowmelt we analyzed two important groups of processes that control hydrology and water balance in different regions before applying the lasso analysis to quantify the importance of such parameters first the effect of rainfall particularly summer rainfall on gw sw interactions is critical especially in foothills and plains regions and should be considered as a controller of gw sw interactions sytsma et al 2020 hayashi and farrow 2014 reported that by taking into account the effect of snowmelt and growing season rainfall the correlation between these predictors and groundwater level rises improved secondly et is an important indicator of groundwater dynamics as it integrates the influence of land cover soil type and vegetation on terrestrial groundwater recharge and the subsequent interactions with streams condon et al 2020 condon and maxwell 2019 maxwell and condon 2016 actual et can be an important controller of hydrologic balances across all regions even in mountains region where evaporative demand from land cover and soil might be lower due to higher elevation and colder climate shi et al 2014 based on correlation analysis done by abimbola et al 2017 precipitation and et are potentially among the most explanatory variables of hydrology and water balance of catchments consequently we analyzed snowmelt rainfall and et as the potential predictors of gw sw interactions using lasso lasso analyses of the monthly fig 10 a and yearly fig 11 a data for the mountains region indicated that et and snowmelt were mostly important parameters in gw sw interaction dynamics while the correlation of rainfall and gw sw interactions were far less critical the importance of et is slightly higher than that of snowmelt suggesting that even in a mountains region where the vegetation cover is sparse and elevation is higher et can still be an important control of groundwater and its interactions with surface water it is also shown that the average importance of three hydrological variables can be highly variable across different months fig 10a however the importance of all hydrologic predictors i e snowmelt rainfall and et is higher in warmer seasons i e march to september a possible reason for this is that when temperature increases vegetation growth occurs and the soil hydrological components become dynamic and more directly connected therefore the correlation of water cycle variables and their impacts and feedbacks becomes more evident comparisons of figs 10 and 11 between mountains and foothills regions show that et strongly affects the formation of gw sw interactions in both regions this can be related to the existence of vegetation cover in the foothills region mainly forest which results in both evaporative and transpiration demands to be effective in influencing hydrological dynamics the main difference between foothills and mountains regions is changes in the importance of rainfall and snowmelt while rainfall demonstrates more importance in foothills region the importance of snowmelt has generally decreased from mountains to foothills this shows the more important effect of rainfall than snowmelt in the formation and dynamics of gw sw interactions in foothills region finally the results of plains region are shown in fig 10c and 11c it can be seen that the importance of snowmelt rainfall and et are relatively low in many months and years as compared to mountains and foothills regions since most of the importance values in these figures are very small no conclusion can be made on the importance of any of the three predictors in forming gw sw interactions in the plains region in other words gw sw interactions in the plains region do not have high and consistent correlations with any of individual snowmelt rainfall or et parameters previous studies have shown various important predictors that have controlled groundwater recharge in the plains region for example rukundo and doğan 2019 found that groundwater recharge is mostly controlled by land use and soil variables rather than hydrological processes or climate variables furthermore parizi et al 2020 showed that among eight different predictors the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration p e t p and soil moisture sm had the greatest influence on groundwater recharge dynamics in non mountainous aquifers while none of these studies focused on gw sw interactions as the response variable their conclusion was based on a comprehensive assessment of various predictors related to climate hydrology land cover and soil therefore the response of gw sw based on different predictors could vary which may also depend on field scale watershed scale or regional scale analysis e g fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 4 conclusions and future directions snowmelt and gw sw interactions are among the most important and dynamic hydrological processes in high elevation watersheds in cold regions and will be sensitive to future climate scenarios in this study we developed the coupled swat modflow model to assess the historical trend of snowmelt and gw sw interactions and their projections under future climate scenarios by using an ensemble climate dataset of five gcms under two future rcp scenarios furthermore we evaluated and discussed the correlations between snowmelt rainfall and et and dynamics of gw sw interactions in different regions across a large watershed that spanned mountain foothill and prairie settings the main conclusions of this study are 1 regional analysis shows that the historical patterns of snowmelt and gw sw interactions differ within mountains foothills and plains regions these processes also showed distinct responses to climate change in different regions under climate change scenarios it is predicted that precipitation will increase in spring march to may and early summer in all regions of the nsrb however air temperature is projected to increase in most regions and in all seasons leading to a decrease in snowfall for all seasons in the mountains regions except for the winter and early spring snowfall no considerable change in snowfall is expected for the foothills region finally the spring and summer snowfall on the plains region is projected to decrease with negligible change in precipitation for the remainder of the year 2 analysis of regional snowmelt projections under future climate scenarios showed that the mountains region of the nsrb may experience earlier snowmelt with snowmelt increasing in april and may while decreasing in june and july also a considerable snowmelt decrease is predicted in fall and winter september to february in the mountains region possibly because of less snow accumulation projected for this area in the foothills region snowmelt is projected to increase in warm seasons i e spring and summer with no considerable changes in snowmelt peak time contrary to the mountains and foothills regions the plains region is projected to experience increased snowmelt in winter and less snowmelt in spring and summer the increased winter snowmelt of the plains region can be attributed to increased air temperature in winter whereas the decreased snowmelt of spring and summer is due to less snow cover available in the future for melting to occur 3 historical analysis of gw sw interactions shows that groundwater discharge to surface water dominates such interactions in most areas of nsrb and in all seasons both mountainous and foothills region showed predominant groundwater discharge to streams the groundwater contribution to surface water is notably larger in spring and summer suggesting the important effect of snowmelt driven recharge on increasing groundwater levels in mountains region and recharging surface water through gw sw interactions in mountainous and foothills region finally most of the historical groundwater recharge occurs in plains region which can be related to lower groundwater levels due to et land cover and topography 4 results of climate change scenarios and future projections of gw sw interactions show a general increase of groundwater discharge to surface water in mountains and plains regions the increased contribution of groundwater to surface water under climate change in mountains region occurs in warm seasons which can be related to the earlier snowmelt projected in this region in the plains region increased precipitation especially in warm seasons could be an important factor in increasing groundwater discharge to surface water furthermore the foothills region is projected to experience an increased groundwater discharge in winter and spring followed by a noticeable increase in groundwater recharge in summer it is argued that this trend can be a direct result of earlier snowmelt and its percolation in both mountains and foothills regions followed by groundwater level decline in summer resulting from less snowmelt and increased air temperature within the foothills region 5 the relationship between regional snowmelt and gw sw interactions in mountains foothills and plains regions showed high correlations r 2 0 494 in mountains regions but negligible correlations in foothills and plains regions r 2 0 01 for both regions the importance of snowmelt et and rainfall as main controls of hydrology on gw sw dynamics was analyzed using the lasso method it was shown that snowmelt and et were the main controllers of the gw sw dynamics in mountains region in the foothills region rainfall plays a more important part as snowmelt showed less correlation with gw sw interactions finally none of the snowmelt or rainfall were considered effective on changes of gw sw interactions in the plains region future research can focus on other indicators such as land use and soil parameters that can potentially control gw sw interactions in the plains region this research facilitates a better understanding of the dynamics of gw sw interactions in relation to snowmelt and the possible changes under future climate scenarios at a regional scale it also demonstrates how snowmelt et and rainfall might affect gw sw interactions and how such effects can differ in various seasons within different echo hydrological regions our study shows that although a complex relation among climate topography vegetation and other factors results in the formation of gw sw interactions the snowmelt run off is one of the main drivers of this process in mountains region and et greatly controls gw sw interactions in various regional settings future studies can also focus on the effects of other influential factors on gw sw dynamics in regions with various topography and land use settings to better recognize major drivers of groundwater recharge and its connection to surface water for example recent studies have shown the vital role of depression based recharge i e the recharge from wetlands potholes and other water bodies especially in canadian prairies on gw sw interactions brannen et al 2015 hayashi et al 2016 hayashi and farrow 2014 as a result it is important to explicitly simulate the effects of these landscape features and water bodies such as their seasonal fill and spill processes on groundwater recharge at a regional scale another consideration for a more detailed study in the future is the hypothesis that land use land cover soil properties and hydraulic conductivity of geological formations may change over time brannen et al 2015 moreover apart from snowmelt simulations addressed in this study a more detailed simulation of glacier melt and initial snowpack storage and their effects on infiltration and gw sw interactions allows for a more holistic understanding of glacier and snow partitioning in groundwater dynamics castellazzi et al 2019 safeeq et al 2013 finally the effect of frozen soil and low permeability lenses on infiltration groundwater recharge and gw sw interactions can be substantial in cold region hydrology and hydrogeology aygün et al 2020 gomez velez et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 we acknowledge that such effects are not explicitly considered in hydrological and hydrogeological modelling within this study but improvements can be made in future research on a better representation of the aforementioned factors in regional integrated hydrological and hydrogeological modelling this will result in a better understanding of the governing processes in the formation of groundwater recharge and how it connects to surface water declaration of competing

3694,actively heated fiber optic ahfo method has become a research focus for soil water content measurement in recent years due to its advantages such as small size distributed measurement and good durability however the ahfo method is presently coupled to distributed temperature sensing ahfo dts which is inevitably limited by low temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution furthermore the existing studies about ahfo method do not consider the existence of frozen soil caused by temperature changes which further limits its application in the field here a new method for total water content measurement in frozen soil using actively heated fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg sensing is proposed for the first time which directly determines the calibration formulas of frozen soil under different soil temperatures from the calibration formula of unfrozen soil moreover the feasibility and reliability of ahfo fbg technology are proved through laboratory calibration tests and in situ monitoring data of chinese loess and the temporal and spatial distribution of total water content in shallow seasonally frozen loess is also revealed it is suggested that the ahfo fbg technology can complement with the traditional techniques to achieve quasi distributed and in situ total water content monitoring in seasonally frozen soil keywords total water content actively heated fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg seasonally frozen soil calibration model in situ measurement freezing depth estimation 1 introduction water content is one of the basic physical indexes of soil and it is also an important parameter to determine the hydrological and mechanical properties of soil bittelli et al 2008 heitman et al 2008 sun et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance to accurately acquire the in situ soil water content distribution for a series of hydrological and engineering applications gil rodríguez et al 2013 tong et al 2020 wang et al 2020 feldman et al 2020 such as exploring water resources storage investigating soil engineering properties preventing geological disasters and evaluating ecological quality shallow unsaturated soil is a critical zone connecting the atmosphere and deep soils and its water content distribution is particularly important and directly affects a series of hydrological geotechnical meteorological and ecological processes romano 2014 note that the shallow soil in cold regions often undergoes seasonal freezing and thawing due to changes in soil temperature in different seasons tian et al 2017 the freezing depth and total water content distribution of seasonally frozen soil both have obvious influence on the soil atmosphere interaction processes including rainfall infiltration surface runoff soil water evaporation and surface soil heat flux transfer therefore seasonally frozen soil has a significant impact on the hydrological processes of the entire region in addition for the numerical simulation of soil atmosphere interaction or heat water transport soil water content is the key parameter to determine the initial and boundary conditions of the model li and sun 2008 yang and wang 2008 wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 hence the in situ measurement accuracy of soil water content directly determines the reliability of the calculation results in general accurate acquisition of the spatio temporal total water content distribution in in situ soil especially in seasonally frozen soil is of great significance for the study of regionally hydrological process frozen soil is composed of solid particles liquid water ice and air zhou et al 2014 the coexistence of liquid water and ice is a key factor to determine the hydraulic thermal and mechanical properties of frozen soil burt and williams 1976 farouki 1981 overduin et al 2006 the total water content in frozen soil is the sum of liquid water and solid ice zhang et al 2011 which is an essential indicator for studying the behaviors of the frozen soil on the one hand the total water content in frozen soil is significant for evaluating the water migration path and frost heaving potential hayhoe et al 1983 hayhoe and bailey 1985 the higher the total water content is the more runoff will be generated in frozen soil and the greater the frost heaving potential will be on the other hand whether calculating ice content or unfrozen water content the total water content in frozen soil is an indispensable parameter he et al 2015 walker 2003 the in situ ice content measurement of frozen soil is widely concerned by scholars and still faces challenges liu and si 2011 at present the ice content is mainly inferred from the difference between total water content and unfrozen water content zhou et al 2014 for unfrozen water content its direct measurement methods mainly include nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and time domain reflection tdr hayhoe et al 1983 spaans and baker 1995 watanabe and wake 2009 however the nmr method is only suitable for laboratory test and the equipment is expensive liu and si 2011 zhou et al 2014 tdr is a widely accepted in situ unfrozen water measurement technology but its measurement results are affected by the total water content in frozen soil watanabe and wake 2009 and thus often need to be corrected combined with the total water content data zhou et al 2014 it indicates that the acquisition of total water content is essential for both unfrozen water content measurement and ice content measurement the existing total water content measurement methods are divided into destructive measurement methods contact measurement methods and non contact measurement methods the destructive measurement methods mainly include oven drying method and specific gravity method he et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 which not only destroy the structure of the soil but also consume a lot of time and effort to obtain soil samples tdr frequency domain reflection fdr gamma ray and neutron probe methods belong to the contact measurement methods chung et al 2019 dobriyal et al 2012 he et al 2020 lin et al 2008 pastuszka et al 2014 which are limited mostly to point scale thermal infrared remote sensing ultrasonic and ground penetrating radar gpr methods are categorized as the non contact measurement methods bano and girard 2001 verstraeten et al 2006 tanaka et al 2009 hassan esfahani et al 2017 feldman et al 2020 which are only suitable for measuring the surface soil water content all the above methods are difficult to achieve distributed measurement of soil water content moreover there are few methods suitable for frozen soil only including oven drying gamma ray and neutron scattering methods hayhoe and bailey 1985 zhou et al 2014 the oven drying method destroys the structure of in situ soil while gamma ray method and neutron method are limited due to radioactive safety concerns and indispensable site specific calibration zhang et al 2011 hence the above methods are not ideal in situ measurement methods of total water content in frozen soil the actively heated fiber optic ahfo method developed in recent years can overcome the deficiencies of traditional methods such as damage to the soil structure limited measuring points and tedious sensor layout operation selker et al 2006 striegl and loheide ii 2012 read et al 2013 this method uses the fiber optic sensor as both a heat source and a thermometer in soil at the same time to determine the soil water content by recording the temperature rise called temperature characteristic value t t along the fiber optic sun et al 2020 the ahfo method mostly relies on distributed temperature sensing dts technology and has been applied to soil science hydrology environment energy geotechnical engineering and other fields he et al 2018a klepikova et al 2011 kobs et al 2014 sayde et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 at present most reports about the ahfo method are about its application in laboratory tests ciocca et al 2012 gil rodríguez et al 2013 sayde et al 2010 vidana gamage et al 2018 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 while few reports are about its in situ applications sayde et al 2014 vidana gamage et al 2018 this is mainly due to the low temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution of dts he et al 2018 sun et al 2020 in field tests high voltage supply is usually required to heat dts cable which limits the further promotion and application of the ahfo method in response to the above problems of the ahfo method the authors group proposed the ahfo method coupled to fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg in 2018 cao et al 2018 and developed the ahfo fbg sensor cao et al 2018 which not only avoids the problem of low spatial resolution in dts but also improves the temperature measurement accuracy to 0 1 cao et al 2018 sun et al 2020 moreover writing multiple fbgs on a single fiber optic can achieve quasi distributed sensing network tian et al 2017 in 2019 an ahfo fbg in situ monitoring system was established in yan an china sun et al 2021 which is mainly used to monitor the water content change in the surface loess during the long term monitoring process a new phenomenon that was not involved in previous studies was discovered that is during the dry snow period in winter the t t measured by some ahfo fbg sensors changed sharply twice the first corresponds to a sharp decrease and the second corresponds to a sharp increase to distinguish the two sudden changes of t t the t t after a sharp decrease is abbreviated as t t1 and the t t after a sharp increase is abbreviated as t t2 fig 1 interestingly the soil temperature t 0 in the period between t t1 and t t2 happened to be lower than 0 through field investigation it was found that the in situ loess had become hard and frozen the main reason why this phenomenon was not covered in the previous studies is that the dts technology has the problems of low temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution which leads to an ignorance of the change of t t caused by frozen soil or a misunderstanding that it is caused by water content change however the changed t t due to the presence of frozen soil will make the measured water content deviate from the real value which limits the application of the ahfo method in frozen soil therefore it is necessary to achieve the total water content measurement in frozen soil using the ahfo fbg method in this paper a new ahfo fbg method for determining the total water content of frozen soil is proposed on basis of the calibration formula of unfrozen soil which accounts for partially frozen conditions at different soil temperatures on this basis an ahfo fbg sensor was applied to the in situ monitoring of loess water content in yan an city shaanxi province china data acquired from november 5 2019 to april 17 2020 verifies the feasibility and reliability of ahfo fbg method in total water content measurement in frozen soil furthermore the frozen soil distribution is roughly estimated and the temporal and spatial distribution of total water content in shallow loess is acquired based on 5 month in situ monitoring data 2 materials and methods 2 1 ahfo fbg measurement principle for soil total water content fbg is one of the most mature fiber optic sensing technologies it can reflect a specific wavelength when a broadband light is injected into the fiber optic the reflected wavelength is called bragg wavelength λ b which shifts with the change of ambient temperature and strain morey et al 1990 hill and meltz 1997 when the bottom of the fbg is strain free λ b is only determined by temperature sun et al 2020 1 δ λ b λ b α ξ δ t where δλ b is the bragg wavelength variation δt is the temperature variation α is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fiber and ξ is the thermo optical coefficient of the fiber the ahfo fbg sensor is formed by encapsulating fbg and resistance wire in an alundum tube which is not only a heat source but also a thermometer when the ahfo fbg sensor is embedded in the soil its temperature rise during heating is called temperature characteristic value t t there is a monotonic relationship between t t and soil thermal conductivity λ according to sun et al 2020 2 t t t t t 0 m λ θ 3 m q ln 4 k t a 2 c 4 π where t t is the temperature characteristic value t t is the temperature of the ahfo fbg sensor corresponding to the heating time t t 0 is the initial soil temperature λ θ is the functional expression of λ and total volumetric water content of soil θ and m is a constant w m 1 related to the heating strategy soil type and sensor size in which q is the heating power per unit length w m 1 k is the thermal diffusivity m2 s 1 of soil a is the outer diameter m of the ahfo fbg sensor and c is a constant with a value of 1 7811 therefore as long as a suitable λ θ calculation model is found the monotonic t t θ relationship can be obtained in the actual application the measured t t is substituted into the t t θ relationship then the θ can be calculated thereby realizing the total water content measurement 2 2 t t θ calibration model establishment of frozen soil the côté and konrad model is one of the most commonly used thermal conductivity calculation models and suitable for both unfrozen soil and frozen soil therefore the côté and konrad model is selected to deduce the t t θ calibration model the t t θ relationship of unfrozen soil is as follows sun et al 2020 4 t t 1 a u θ 1 b u θ c u 5 a u κ u λ satu λ dry m n 6 b u κ u 1 n 7 c u λ dry m where au k 1 bu and cu k 1 are all constants λ dry is the dry thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 λ sat is the saturated thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 n is the soil porosity and κ is an empirical parameter related to the soil type and freezing state the saturated thermal conductivities of unfrozen soil and frozen soil are denoted by λ satu and λ satf respectively similarly the empirical parameters of unfrozen soil and frozen soil are denoted by κ u and κ f respectively for λ satu the following geometric average model is used côté and konrad 2005 8 λ satu λ s 1 n λ w n where λ s is the thermal conductivity of solid particles w m 1 k 1 and λ w is the thermal conductivity of water w m 1 k 1 with a value of 0 6 w m 1 k 1 when the soil is frozen there is always a certain amount of liquid water called unfrozen water in the soil anderson and tice 1972 due to the water particle interaction and solute effects similarly the t t θ relationship of frozen soil is as follows 9 t t 1 a f θ 1 b f θ c f 10 a f κ f λ satf λ dry m n 11 b f κ f 1 n 12 c u λ dry m note that in eq 10 it is assumed that λ dry and λ satf exist in nature although soil may not be necessarily saturated at frozen state and dry prior to freezing eq 10 can be considered reasonable in most cases it should be also noted that the empirical parameter κ f and saturated thermal conductivity λ satf of frozen soil are different from those of unfrozen soil the λ satf can be expressed as côté and konrad 2005 13 λ satf λ s 1 n λ i n ϕ u λ w ϕ u where λ i is the thermal conductivity of ice w m 1 k 1 and its value is 2 24 w m 1 k 1 and ϕ u is the volume fraction of unfrozen water in soil there is a dynamic equilibrium between unfrozen water content and negative soil temperature that is with the decrease of soil temperature the unfrozen water content decreases and vice versa the relationship between the two parameters is as follows anderson and tice 1972 14 w u k t n h where w u is the unfrozen mass water content t n is the negative soil temperature and k and h are empirical constants related to soil types for loess the values of k and h are 13 05 and 0 53 respectively the research of wu et al 2021 has proved that eq 14 is very effective in estimating the unfrozen water content in frozen soil at different soil temperatures for frozen soils the following relationship between volume fraction of unfrozen water ϕ u and dry density ρ d holds 15 ϕ u w u ρ d 100 ρ w where ρ d is the dry density of soil g cm3 and ρ w is the density of water g cm3 when the soil temperature is lower than 0 the soil with different initial total water contents w 0 has different freezing temperatures t f xu et al 1987 showed that the relationship between w u and t n eq 14 can be used to determine the freezing temperature t f corresponding to different w 0 16 t f exp ln k ln w 0 h therefore when the soil temperature is lower than 0 the relationship between initial soil temperature t 0 and freezing temperature t f should first be judged by eq 16 if t 0 is greater than t f the pore water is still liquid and the calibration model of unfrozen soil eq 4 should be adopted on the contrary if t 0 is less than or equal to t f the calibration model of frozen soil eq 9 should be adopted fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of two calibration models of unfrozen and frozen soil the calibration test of unfrozen soil is easy to operate so the calibration formula of unfrozen soil can be determined by the calibration test however for frozen soil due to the dynamic change of initial soil temperature t 0 at the monitoring site it is tricky to perform the calibration test as such it is suggested that the calibration formula of frozen soil be determined based on that of unfrozen soil and the field measured data according to the calibration models of unfrozen soil eq 4 and frozen soil eq 9 the parameter c in the two models is the same but the parameters a and b are different specifically κ and λ sat in the expression of a and κ in the parameter b are different according to eq 8 and eq 13 λ satf can be readily calculated from λ satu 17 λ satf λ satu λ i λ w n ϕ u from the above analysis it can be seen that κ f in the frozen soil is a key parameter to determine the calibration formula of frozen soil the total water content before and after the sudden change of t t can be considered as constant therefore the κ f can be determined by combining the eqs 9 12 and the field data which include the t t1 and the corresponding total water content at that time once κ f and λ satf are determined af bf and cf can be obtained according to eqs 10 12 and the calibration formula of frozen soil can be established in summary t t θ calibration formula of frozen soil can be established based on that of unfrozen soil it is very convenient to use this method to determine the calibration results of frozen soil under different soil temperatures due to the simple calibration test of unfrozen soil for a specific frozen soil the detailed determination steps of t t θ calibration formula can be summarized as follows fig 3 1 determine the t t θ calibration formula of the unfrozen soil through the calibration test 2 determine au bu cu and λ dry according to the t t θ calibration result of unfrozen soil 3 calculate κ u m and λ satu according to the known parameters in step 2 and the expressions of au bu and cu eqs 5 7 4 calculate λ satf according to the known parameters in step 3 and the relationship between au and af eq 17 5 obtain the t t1 and its corresponding total water content according to the in situ monitoring data 6 substitute the known parameters in steps 3 5 into the calibration model of frozen soil eqs 9 12 to obtain κ f 7 calculate af bf and cf based on the above known parameters and the expressions of af bf and cf eqs 10 12 note that the value of af is related to the soil temperature 8 obtain the t t θ calibration formulas of frozen soil at different soil temperatures 2 3 calibration test of unfrozen soil the calibration test device for unfrozen soil is shown in fig 4 the soil used in this calibration test is loess which is taken from the field site the grain size distribution curve and basic physical parameters of the loess are shown in fig 5 and table 1 respectively noted that plastic limit liquid limit and saturated water content shown in table 1 are mass water contents to make loess samples with different water contents the acrylic boxes with the length width and height of 20 cm 15 cm and 20 cm respectively are used the wall thickness of the box is 5 mm and there is a circular hole with a diameter of 1 cm in the center of an acrylic board the length of ahfo fbg sensor is 15 cm which is consistent with the width of the box loess samples with mass water content of 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 0 10 0 12 0 14 0 16 0 17 0 21 0 31 g g were prepared and the dry density was 1 2 g cm3 when the loess was filled to half the height of the box an ahfo fbg sensor was placed in the loess through the circular hole after the loess was completely filled each sensor was connected to the fbg demodulator nanzee sensing suzhou china during the test the heating power is controlled to 11 w m by the dc power supply and the data are obtained by the computer and supporting software 2 4 in situ verification test next an ahfo fbg sensor was deployed in the loess of yan an city china fig 6 shows the geographic location of the monitoring site the region belongs to the typical continental warm temperate monsoon climate which is hot and rainy in summer cold and dry in winter with sparse rain and snow the monitoring site is located at the top of the slope at an altitude of 1188 m where the local lithology is mainly quaternary aeolian loess the terrain here is high the temperature is low the surrounding is open and the vegetation coverage is thin in the sensor layout process a series of measures were adopted to ensure the close contact between the ahfo fbg sensor and the surrounding soil fig 7 shows the installation steps of the ahfo fbg sensor first a hole was punched using a soil extractor with a diameter slightly smaller than the sensor diameter then the sensor was slowly inserted into the hole to ensure good contact with the surrounding soil finally the sensor was protected with a fence the electric wire and optical cable of the ahfo fbg sensor were routed from underground to the monitoring station through a trench dug in advance the monitoring data were sent to the client computer wirelessly and in real time through the local monitoring station fig 8 the ahfo fbg sensor fig 9 has five measurement points with the interval of 0 1 m which measures the soil temperature and total water content at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m away from the surface the heating power is 11 w m the monitoring time of this in situ test is from november 5 2019 to april 17 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil temperature profile and frozen soil distribution fig 10 a shows the temporal and spatial distribution of soil temperature t 0 at the monitoring site the t 0 fluctuates regularly with seasons the t 0 in autumn and spring is higher than that in winter in addition the distribution of t 0 is also depth related the closer to the surface the more easily the t 0 is affected by the atmosphere and the more obvious the seasonal regularity it can be seen from fig 10a that the t 0 within 0 4 m from the ground surface is lower than 0 in winter and the t 0 reaches the minimum on january 14 2020 fig 10b shows the variation of temperature characteristic value t t measured by ahfo fbg sensor over time the t t of 0 1 m measurement point has two sudden change in winter namely t t1 and t t2 respectively and the t t in this time period is lower than that in the other periods however the t t of the four measurement points within the depth of 0 2 0 5 m have no obvious sudden change to further explore the reason for the sudden change of t t at 0 1 m measurement point the t 0 is further compared with the t t fig 10c the t t measured from december 26 2019 to february 11 2020 is significantly lower than that in other periods and the corresponding t 0 in this period is all lower than 0 because the local rainfall is very small in winter and the measurement points are all located below 0 1 m depth this phenomenon is not likely caused by rainfall a reasonable explanation is that the loess is frozen during this period because the thermal conductivity of ice is about 4 times larger than that of water the thermal conductivity of frozen soil is higher than that of unfrozen soil thus the measured t t will be lower note that the t 0 was already lower than the theoretical freezing temperature t f 0 897 calculated according to eq 16 on december 7 2019 but the t t1 occurred on december 26 2019 corresponding to a t 0 of 1 878 this illustrates that when the in situ t 0 reaches the theoretical t f the soil will not enter the frozen state immediately but after some time the reason for this phenomenon is that the daily temperature changes drastically and cannot be regarded as a constant at that time therefore the actual t f is lower than the theoretical t f during the in situ measurement also note that at the t t2 0 619 february 11 2020 the corresponding t 0 is very close to the theoretical t f indicating that the theoretical t f is relatively accurate when the in situ soil has experienced a long period of frozen state and then enters the unfrozen state again therefore during the freezing period of the 0 1 m measurement point the calibration formula of frozen soil should be adopted while the calibration formula of unfrozen soil should be utilized for other periods and the remaining four measurement points to further verify that the sudden decrease of t t from december 26 2019 to february 11 2020 is caused by the phase transition of unfrozen water into ice in soil the measured t t is compared with the unfrozen water content w u calculated by eq 14 and the relationship between the two parameters is obtained fig 11 there is an obvious linearly positive correlation between t t and w u and the sensitivity coefficient is 0 04789 the higher w u means the less ice content and the smaller thermal conductivity of frozen soil resulting in the larger t t the relationship between t t and w u indicates that the change of t t is closely related to the ice content in soil therefore the sudden decrease and increase of t t in winter in fig 8 comes from phase change of water and ice according to the above analysis it can be inferred that the freezing interface occurs between 0 1 m and 0 2 m at the location of the ahfo fbg sensor thus the ahfo fbg technology can roughly estimate the depth of frozen soil during the in situ application of the ahfo fbg technology in frozen soil regions it is recommended to comprehensively judge the depth of frozen soil by combining the variation trends of measured t t and the corresponding t 0 3 2 t t θ calibration formula determination of frozen soil fig 12 a shows the temperature characteristic value t t total volumetric water content θ calibration result of unfrozen soil it can be seen that t t θ calibration model of unfrozen soil is reliable which fits the experimental data well with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 from the calibration result of unfrozen soil we can directly get the values of parameters au bu and cu and also can get λ dry from the temperature rise curve of the dry soil λ dry 0 18548 w m 1 k 1 then the relevant parameters of loess can be obtained by eqs 5 7 including m 3 37793 w m 1 κ u 0 47116 λ satu 2 46748 w m 1 k 1 for the same type of soil the parameters λ dry and m are constants whether frozen or not according to the above analysis the value of λ satf at a certain soil temperature can be calculated according to eq 17 for 0 1 m measurement point once the soil is frozen the measured t t t t1 in fig 10b changes obviously at the same time the total water content can be considered as constant before and after the sudden change of t t note there is a fact that water expands in volume by roughly 9 upon freezing which would change the volume percentage when the soil total water content is high or the freezing degree is high the change of porosity in frozen soil should be considered however in this paper due to the low total water content of in situ loess the change of porosity caused by freezing can be neglected thus it can be considered that the total water content corresponding to t t1 is equal to that of unfrozen soil note that the assumption of zero water redistribution is not always true especially in medium to fine textured soils and these special cases in medium to fine textured soil are not considered in this paper combined with the related parameters of frozen soil obtained above the empirical parameter κ f can be determined by substituting the t t1 and θ into the calibration model of frozen soil eqs 9 12 after obtaining λ satf and κ f the parameters af bf and cf in the calibration model of frozen soil under any negative soil temperature can be calculated thus the calibration formula of frozen soil under different soil temperatures can be determined the field data show that t t1 is 4 30 the corresponding t 0 is 1 878 and the θ of the previous day is 0 166 cm3 cm3 then the empirical parameter κ f can be calculated as 0 38853 therefore the t t θ calibration formulas of unfrozen loess and frozen loess are as follows 18 t t 1 a u θ 1 b u θ c u a u 0 57124 b u 0 94911 c u 0 05491 19 t t 1 a f θ 1 b f θ c f a f 0 50935 3 73333 0 55720 0 162 t 0 0 53 0 03829 b f 1 09740 c f 0 05491 fig 12b shows the comparison of the t t θ calibration formulas between frozen soil and unfrozen soil the calibration curves of frozen soil are all located below the calibration curve of unfrozen soil and only the t t in dry soil are the same which is consistent with the previous analysis in addition the lower the t 0 of frozen soil the lower the position of calibration curve which indicates that the soil freezing degree increases with the decrease of soil temperature 3 3 total water content profile in the in situ test and reliability analysis fig 13 a shows the calculated results of soil total water content θ at 0 1 m measurement point the θ values calculated by different calibration formulas are basically consistent and the θ values before and after t t1 have good time continuity more importantly the θ values before and after t t2 are also very consistent and continuous which indicates that the frozen soil calibration formulas under different temperatures are effective and reliable the reliability of the ahfo fbg method for unfrozen soil water content measurement has been verified by previous studies cao et al 2018 sun et al 2020 therefore according to the consistent measurement results between frozen soil and unfrozen soil it can be inferred that the measured total water content in frozen soil is also reliable and trustworthy in addition the total water content at 0 1 m depth does not change much in winter basically maintaining at about 0 170 cm3 cm3 but it is slightly higher than that before and after soil freezing this is because of the difference in matric suction between the frozen soil and unfrozen soil caused by the soil temperature gradient and hence the water in the soil migrates from the deep high temperature to the surface low temperature area xu et al 1997 watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 fig 13b shows the temporal and spatial variation of soil total water content θ the θ is higher in autumn and spring but lower in winter which is consistent with the time variation of soil temperature this is attributed to the dry climate in winter the soil evaporation intensity is large and there is little rainfall supply so the θ decreases in winter under the effect of evaporation on the contrary rainfall replenishment gradually increases in spring so the θ also increases from the θ distribution along the depth it can be seen that the θ of shallow soil 0 1 0 2 m is higher than that of the soil in the range of 0 3 0 5 m it should be noted that during the freezing period between two yellow dotted lines the contour line of θ in a certain period is in an arch shape red dotted line which is consistent with the previous analysis it also can be found that this phenomenon obviously occurred after january 14 2020 the lowest t 0 white dotted line which indicates that the lower the soil temperature is the more obvious water migration between frozen soil and unfrozen soil is the above analysis further verifies the effectiveness of the ahfo fbg technology in the total water content measurement of frozen soil the calibration model proposed in this paper takes into account the partially frozen phenomenon ice water phase transition existing in frozen soil at the same time this calibration model assumes that the ice water phase transition does not occur during the heating process the main reason for adopting this assumption is that the heating power used in the tests is low and the effect of latent heat on the measurement results can be ignored however heating will inevitably trigger a certain degree of ice water phase transition and hence the reliability of this assumption should be verified therefore the heating process of frozen soil under the actual field situation is simulated by using the comsol multiphysics software the simulation object is the soil with a volumetric water content of 0 166 cm3 cm3 december 26 2019 the simulation results are shown in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 that the farther away from the ahfo fbg sensor the smaller the temperature rise and the heating influence radius is about 6 cm fig 15 a and fig 15b show the soil temperature distribution after heating when the t 0 is 1 8780 december 26 2019 and 2 7173 january 14 2020 respectively generally speaking 0 is the critical temperature of ice water phase transition so the critical radius for ice water phase transition corresponds to the radius where the soil temperature is 0 without considering the ice water phase transition the critical radius is 1 41178 cm when t 0 is 1 8780 by subtracting the volume of the ahfo fbg sensor itself with a radius of 0 35 cm the calculated soil volume with phase transition is 5 87637 cm3 in the same way the critical radius is 0 87113 cm when t 0 is 2 7173 and soil volume with phase transition is 1 99921 cm3 for this in situ loess the heat transfer radius is 6 cm so the soil volume affected by heating is 112 71249 cm3 when t 0 is 1 8780 and 2 7173 the soil volume with phase transition only accounts for 5 21 and 1 77 of the total soil volume respectively therefore the assumption of ignoring ice water phase transition during the heating process is acceptable it can also be seen that the lower the t 0 is the smaller the soil volume with phase transformation is during the heating process therefore the proposed total water content measurement model of frozen soil will be more effective when the negative soil temperature is lower 3 4 uncertainty and applicability analysis first and foremost based on the côté and konrad model of unfrozen soil the calibration model of frozen soil and its determination method are established the most significant advantages of côté and konrad model are as follows first it is the optimal calibration model for unfrozen soil with the highest accuracy and the fewest fitting parameters which has been confirmed in the research of sun et al 2020 the second is that the model is applicable to both frozen soil and unfrozen soil therefore the fitting parameters can be determined by the relationship between λ satf and λ satu eq 17 which avoids the complex process of calculating the ice and unfrozen water content in frozen soil it should be pointed out that when calculating the λ satf and λ satu the geometric average model used by côté and konrad 2005 namely eq 8 and eq 13 is adopted in addition to this model there are other models available for calculating the λ satf and λ satu barry macaulay et al 2015 he et al 2021 it is worth further exploring in the following works to evaluate the influence of different thermal conductivity models on the measurement accuracy secondly the influence of initial soil temperature on unfrozen water content is considered in the t t θ calibration model of frozen soil which benefits from the fact that ahfo fbg technology can accurately obtain soil temperature compared with dts technology with unsatisfactory temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution this is a unique advantage of ahfo fbg technology and also is a main technical prerequisite for realizing total water content measurement in frozen soil it is worth noting that the calibration model of frozen soil derived in this paper does not consider the influence of ice water phase transition during the heating process this is because the heating power used in the tests is relatively small and the phase transition occurs only in a thin layer of soil around the sensor which has little influence on the t t therefore the calibration model is feasible in the present in situ test however if the heating power or the initial total water content of soil is high the influence of ice water phase transition on the t t should be considered this is where the theoretical calibration model needs to be improved in addition the hysteresis phenomenon during freezing and thawing processes is not considered when determining the unfrozen water content because this paper focuses on in situ soil and the soil temperature decreased steadily about 0 08 c d 1 from 0 c to a minimum value with a uninterrupted freezing process in this situation the soil freezing characteristic curves of in situ soil during freezing and thawing are basically coincident which has been confirmed by the research of parkin et al 2013 this is because the in situ soil has experienced numerous freeze thaw cycles under natural conditions and the soil structure has become stable however when studying the remolded soil or there are numerous interruptions temporary increase in soil temperature the hysteresis effect cannot be ignored ren and vanapalli 2020 this is also an aspect that the t t θ calibration model should be improved in the future finally the ahfo fbg sensor used in this paper is packaged with alundum tube it is easy to achieve close contact with surrounding loess by drilling holes slightly smaller than the diameter of the sensor however when encapsulating the sensor with other materials such as plastic materials or applying this technology to the coarse grained soil and rock the corresponding layout method should be improved and or the contact thermal resistance between the sensor and the surrounding soil should be considered so as to ensure the total water content measurement accuracy in frozen soil 4 conclusions in this paper a new method for total water content measurement in seasonally frozen soil was proposed using actively heated fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg sensing in this method the partially frozen conditions of frozen soil under different soil temperatures were considered and the specific steps to determine the t t θ calibration formula of frozen soil were described in detail moreover the reliability and practicability of this method were proved by in situ total water content measurement results the main conclusions are as follows 1 the ahfo fbg technology can be used to estimate the frozen soil distribution and determine the total water content distribution of frozen soil 2 the calibration formulas of frozen soil under different temperatures can be determined from the calibration formula of unfrozen soil so the total water content measurement method for frozen soil using the ahfo fbg sensing is simple and convenient 3 the total water content values of frozen soil and unfrozen soil measured by the ahfo fbg technology in the in situ test have good consistency with time which proves the feasibility and reliability of this method 4 the ahfo fbg sensor provides a new technical means for the research about the seasonally frozen soil in summary this ahfo fbg based method provides a new way to measure the total water content of frozen soil under partially frozen conditions which can complement with the traditional techniques to achieve quasi distributed and in situ total water content monitoring in frozen and unfrozen soil moreover this new method may also offer helpful insights for other hydrological explorations and engineering applications related to the seasonally frozen soil in the future the establishment of theoretical calibration model considering the latent heat effect of ice water phase transition in the heating process is an important subject to be improved credit authorship contribution statement mengya sun conceptualization methodology writing original

3694,actively heated fiber optic ahfo method has become a research focus for soil water content measurement in recent years due to its advantages such as small size distributed measurement and good durability however the ahfo method is presently coupled to distributed temperature sensing ahfo dts which is inevitably limited by low temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution furthermore the existing studies about ahfo method do not consider the existence of frozen soil caused by temperature changes which further limits its application in the field here a new method for total water content measurement in frozen soil using actively heated fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg sensing is proposed for the first time which directly determines the calibration formulas of frozen soil under different soil temperatures from the calibration formula of unfrozen soil moreover the feasibility and reliability of ahfo fbg technology are proved through laboratory calibration tests and in situ monitoring data of chinese loess and the temporal and spatial distribution of total water content in shallow seasonally frozen loess is also revealed it is suggested that the ahfo fbg technology can complement with the traditional techniques to achieve quasi distributed and in situ total water content monitoring in seasonally frozen soil keywords total water content actively heated fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg seasonally frozen soil calibration model in situ measurement freezing depth estimation 1 introduction water content is one of the basic physical indexes of soil and it is also an important parameter to determine the hydrological and mechanical properties of soil bittelli et al 2008 heitman et al 2008 sun et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance to accurately acquire the in situ soil water content distribution for a series of hydrological and engineering applications gil rodríguez et al 2013 tong et al 2020 wang et al 2020 feldman et al 2020 such as exploring water resources storage investigating soil engineering properties preventing geological disasters and evaluating ecological quality shallow unsaturated soil is a critical zone connecting the atmosphere and deep soils and its water content distribution is particularly important and directly affects a series of hydrological geotechnical meteorological and ecological processes romano 2014 note that the shallow soil in cold regions often undergoes seasonal freezing and thawing due to changes in soil temperature in different seasons tian et al 2017 the freezing depth and total water content distribution of seasonally frozen soil both have obvious influence on the soil atmosphere interaction processes including rainfall infiltration surface runoff soil water evaporation and surface soil heat flux transfer therefore seasonally frozen soil has a significant impact on the hydrological processes of the entire region in addition for the numerical simulation of soil atmosphere interaction or heat water transport soil water content is the key parameter to determine the initial and boundary conditions of the model li and sun 2008 yang and wang 2008 wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 hence the in situ measurement accuracy of soil water content directly determines the reliability of the calculation results in general accurate acquisition of the spatio temporal total water content distribution in in situ soil especially in seasonally frozen soil is of great significance for the study of regionally hydrological process frozen soil is composed of solid particles liquid water ice and air zhou et al 2014 the coexistence of liquid water and ice is a key factor to determine the hydraulic thermal and mechanical properties of frozen soil burt and williams 1976 farouki 1981 overduin et al 2006 the total water content in frozen soil is the sum of liquid water and solid ice zhang et al 2011 which is an essential indicator for studying the behaviors of the frozen soil on the one hand the total water content in frozen soil is significant for evaluating the water migration path and frost heaving potential hayhoe et al 1983 hayhoe and bailey 1985 the higher the total water content is the more runoff will be generated in frozen soil and the greater the frost heaving potential will be on the other hand whether calculating ice content or unfrozen water content the total water content in frozen soil is an indispensable parameter he et al 2015 walker 2003 the in situ ice content measurement of frozen soil is widely concerned by scholars and still faces challenges liu and si 2011 at present the ice content is mainly inferred from the difference between total water content and unfrozen water content zhou et al 2014 for unfrozen water content its direct measurement methods mainly include nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and time domain reflection tdr hayhoe et al 1983 spaans and baker 1995 watanabe and wake 2009 however the nmr method is only suitable for laboratory test and the equipment is expensive liu and si 2011 zhou et al 2014 tdr is a widely accepted in situ unfrozen water measurement technology but its measurement results are affected by the total water content in frozen soil watanabe and wake 2009 and thus often need to be corrected combined with the total water content data zhou et al 2014 it indicates that the acquisition of total water content is essential for both unfrozen water content measurement and ice content measurement the existing total water content measurement methods are divided into destructive measurement methods contact measurement methods and non contact measurement methods the destructive measurement methods mainly include oven drying method and specific gravity method he et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 which not only destroy the structure of the soil but also consume a lot of time and effort to obtain soil samples tdr frequency domain reflection fdr gamma ray and neutron probe methods belong to the contact measurement methods chung et al 2019 dobriyal et al 2012 he et al 2020 lin et al 2008 pastuszka et al 2014 which are limited mostly to point scale thermal infrared remote sensing ultrasonic and ground penetrating radar gpr methods are categorized as the non contact measurement methods bano and girard 2001 verstraeten et al 2006 tanaka et al 2009 hassan esfahani et al 2017 feldman et al 2020 which are only suitable for measuring the surface soil water content all the above methods are difficult to achieve distributed measurement of soil water content moreover there are few methods suitable for frozen soil only including oven drying gamma ray and neutron scattering methods hayhoe and bailey 1985 zhou et al 2014 the oven drying method destroys the structure of in situ soil while gamma ray method and neutron method are limited due to radioactive safety concerns and indispensable site specific calibration zhang et al 2011 hence the above methods are not ideal in situ measurement methods of total water content in frozen soil the actively heated fiber optic ahfo method developed in recent years can overcome the deficiencies of traditional methods such as damage to the soil structure limited measuring points and tedious sensor layout operation selker et al 2006 striegl and loheide ii 2012 read et al 2013 this method uses the fiber optic sensor as both a heat source and a thermometer in soil at the same time to determine the soil water content by recording the temperature rise called temperature characteristic value t t along the fiber optic sun et al 2020 the ahfo method mostly relies on distributed temperature sensing dts technology and has been applied to soil science hydrology environment energy geotechnical engineering and other fields he et al 2018a klepikova et al 2011 kobs et al 2014 sayde et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 at present most reports about the ahfo method are about its application in laboratory tests ciocca et al 2012 gil rodríguez et al 2013 sayde et al 2010 vidana gamage et al 2018 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 while few reports are about its in situ applications sayde et al 2014 vidana gamage et al 2018 this is mainly due to the low temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution of dts he et al 2018 sun et al 2020 in field tests high voltage supply is usually required to heat dts cable which limits the further promotion and application of the ahfo method in response to the above problems of the ahfo method the authors group proposed the ahfo method coupled to fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg in 2018 cao et al 2018 and developed the ahfo fbg sensor cao et al 2018 which not only avoids the problem of low spatial resolution in dts but also improves the temperature measurement accuracy to 0 1 cao et al 2018 sun et al 2020 moreover writing multiple fbgs on a single fiber optic can achieve quasi distributed sensing network tian et al 2017 in 2019 an ahfo fbg in situ monitoring system was established in yan an china sun et al 2021 which is mainly used to monitor the water content change in the surface loess during the long term monitoring process a new phenomenon that was not involved in previous studies was discovered that is during the dry snow period in winter the t t measured by some ahfo fbg sensors changed sharply twice the first corresponds to a sharp decrease and the second corresponds to a sharp increase to distinguish the two sudden changes of t t the t t after a sharp decrease is abbreviated as t t1 and the t t after a sharp increase is abbreviated as t t2 fig 1 interestingly the soil temperature t 0 in the period between t t1 and t t2 happened to be lower than 0 through field investigation it was found that the in situ loess had become hard and frozen the main reason why this phenomenon was not covered in the previous studies is that the dts technology has the problems of low temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution which leads to an ignorance of the change of t t caused by frozen soil or a misunderstanding that it is caused by water content change however the changed t t due to the presence of frozen soil will make the measured water content deviate from the real value which limits the application of the ahfo method in frozen soil therefore it is necessary to achieve the total water content measurement in frozen soil using the ahfo fbg method in this paper a new ahfo fbg method for determining the total water content of frozen soil is proposed on basis of the calibration formula of unfrozen soil which accounts for partially frozen conditions at different soil temperatures on this basis an ahfo fbg sensor was applied to the in situ monitoring of loess water content in yan an city shaanxi province china data acquired from november 5 2019 to april 17 2020 verifies the feasibility and reliability of ahfo fbg method in total water content measurement in frozen soil furthermore the frozen soil distribution is roughly estimated and the temporal and spatial distribution of total water content in shallow loess is acquired based on 5 month in situ monitoring data 2 materials and methods 2 1 ahfo fbg measurement principle for soil total water content fbg is one of the most mature fiber optic sensing technologies it can reflect a specific wavelength when a broadband light is injected into the fiber optic the reflected wavelength is called bragg wavelength λ b which shifts with the change of ambient temperature and strain morey et al 1990 hill and meltz 1997 when the bottom of the fbg is strain free λ b is only determined by temperature sun et al 2020 1 δ λ b λ b α ξ δ t where δλ b is the bragg wavelength variation δt is the temperature variation α is the thermal expansion coefficient of the fiber and ξ is the thermo optical coefficient of the fiber the ahfo fbg sensor is formed by encapsulating fbg and resistance wire in an alundum tube which is not only a heat source but also a thermometer when the ahfo fbg sensor is embedded in the soil its temperature rise during heating is called temperature characteristic value t t there is a monotonic relationship between t t and soil thermal conductivity λ according to sun et al 2020 2 t t t t t 0 m λ θ 3 m q ln 4 k t a 2 c 4 π where t t is the temperature characteristic value t t is the temperature of the ahfo fbg sensor corresponding to the heating time t t 0 is the initial soil temperature λ θ is the functional expression of λ and total volumetric water content of soil θ and m is a constant w m 1 related to the heating strategy soil type and sensor size in which q is the heating power per unit length w m 1 k is the thermal diffusivity m2 s 1 of soil a is the outer diameter m of the ahfo fbg sensor and c is a constant with a value of 1 7811 therefore as long as a suitable λ θ calculation model is found the monotonic t t θ relationship can be obtained in the actual application the measured t t is substituted into the t t θ relationship then the θ can be calculated thereby realizing the total water content measurement 2 2 t t θ calibration model establishment of frozen soil the côté and konrad model is one of the most commonly used thermal conductivity calculation models and suitable for both unfrozen soil and frozen soil therefore the côté and konrad model is selected to deduce the t t θ calibration model the t t θ relationship of unfrozen soil is as follows sun et al 2020 4 t t 1 a u θ 1 b u θ c u 5 a u κ u λ satu λ dry m n 6 b u κ u 1 n 7 c u λ dry m where au k 1 bu and cu k 1 are all constants λ dry is the dry thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 λ sat is the saturated thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 n is the soil porosity and κ is an empirical parameter related to the soil type and freezing state the saturated thermal conductivities of unfrozen soil and frozen soil are denoted by λ satu and λ satf respectively similarly the empirical parameters of unfrozen soil and frozen soil are denoted by κ u and κ f respectively for λ satu the following geometric average model is used côté and konrad 2005 8 λ satu λ s 1 n λ w n where λ s is the thermal conductivity of solid particles w m 1 k 1 and λ w is the thermal conductivity of water w m 1 k 1 with a value of 0 6 w m 1 k 1 when the soil is frozen there is always a certain amount of liquid water called unfrozen water in the soil anderson and tice 1972 due to the water particle interaction and solute effects similarly the t t θ relationship of frozen soil is as follows 9 t t 1 a f θ 1 b f θ c f 10 a f κ f λ satf λ dry m n 11 b f κ f 1 n 12 c u λ dry m note that in eq 10 it is assumed that λ dry and λ satf exist in nature although soil may not be necessarily saturated at frozen state and dry prior to freezing eq 10 can be considered reasonable in most cases it should be also noted that the empirical parameter κ f and saturated thermal conductivity λ satf of frozen soil are different from those of unfrozen soil the λ satf can be expressed as côté and konrad 2005 13 λ satf λ s 1 n λ i n ϕ u λ w ϕ u where λ i is the thermal conductivity of ice w m 1 k 1 and its value is 2 24 w m 1 k 1 and ϕ u is the volume fraction of unfrozen water in soil there is a dynamic equilibrium between unfrozen water content and negative soil temperature that is with the decrease of soil temperature the unfrozen water content decreases and vice versa the relationship between the two parameters is as follows anderson and tice 1972 14 w u k t n h where w u is the unfrozen mass water content t n is the negative soil temperature and k and h are empirical constants related to soil types for loess the values of k and h are 13 05 and 0 53 respectively the research of wu et al 2021 has proved that eq 14 is very effective in estimating the unfrozen water content in frozen soil at different soil temperatures for frozen soils the following relationship between volume fraction of unfrozen water ϕ u and dry density ρ d holds 15 ϕ u w u ρ d 100 ρ w where ρ d is the dry density of soil g cm3 and ρ w is the density of water g cm3 when the soil temperature is lower than 0 the soil with different initial total water contents w 0 has different freezing temperatures t f xu et al 1987 showed that the relationship between w u and t n eq 14 can be used to determine the freezing temperature t f corresponding to different w 0 16 t f exp ln k ln w 0 h therefore when the soil temperature is lower than 0 the relationship between initial soil temperature t 0 and freezing temperature t f should first be judged by eq 16 if t 0 is greater than t f the pore water is still liquid and the calibration model of unfrozen soil eq 4 should be adopted on the contrary if t 0 is less than or equal to t f the calibration model of frozen soil eq 9 should be adopted fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of two calibration models of unfrozen and frozen soil the calibration test of unfrozen soil is easy to operate so the calibration formula of unfrozen soil can be determined by the calibration test however for frozen soil due to the dynamic change of initial soil temperature t 0 at the monitoring site it is tricky to perform the calibration test as such it is suggested that the calibration formula of frozen soil be determined based on that of unfrozen soil and the field measured data according to the calibration models of unfrozen soil eq 4 and frozen soil eq 9 the parameter c in the two models is the same but the parameters a and b are different specifically κ and λ sat in the expression of a and κ in the parameter b are different according to eq 8 and eq 13 λ satf can be readily calculated from λ satu 17 λ satf λ satu λ i λ w n ϕ u from the above analysis it can be seen that κ f in the frozen soil is a key parameter to determine the calibration formula of frozen soil the total water content before and after the sudden change of t t can be considered as constant therefore the κ f can be determined by combining the eqs 9 12 and the field data which include the t t1 and the corresponding total water content at that time once κ f and λ satf are determined af bf and cf can be obtained according to eqs 10 12 and the calibration formula of frozen soil can be established in summary t t θ calibration formula of frozen soil can be established based on that of unfrozen soil it is very convenient to use this method to determine the calibration results of frozen soil under different soil temperatures due to the simple calibration test of unfrozen soil for a specific frozen soil the detailed determination steps of t t θ calibration formula can be summarized as follows fig 3 1 determine the t t θ calibration formula of the unfrozen soil through the calibration test 2 determine au bu cu and λ dry according to the t t θ calibration result of unfrozen soil 3 calculate κ u m and λ satu according to the known parameters in step 2 and the expressions of au bu and cu eqs 5 7 4 calculate λ satf according to the known parameters in step 3 and the relationship between au and af eq 17 5 obtain the t t1 and its corresponding total water content according to the in situ monitoring data 6 substitute the known parameters in steps 3 5 into the calibration model of frozen soil eqs 9 12 to obtain κ f 7 calculate af bf and cf based on the above known parameters and the expressions of af bf and cf eqs 10 12 note that the value of af is related to the soil temperature 8 obtain the t t θ calibration formulas of frozen soil at different soil temperatures 2 3 calibration test of unfrozen soil the calibration test device for unfrozen soil is shown in fig 4 the soil used in this calibration test is loess which is taken from the field site the grain size distribution curve and basic physical parameters of the loess are shown in fig 5 and table 1 respectively noted that plastic limit liquid limit and saturated water content shown in table 1 are mass water contents to make loess samples with different water contents the acrylic boxes with the length width and height of 20 cm 15 cm and 20 cm respectively are used the wall thickness of the box is 5 mm and there is a circular hole with a diameter of 1 cm in the center of an acrylic board the length of ahfo fbg sensor is 15 cm which is consistent with the width of the box loess samples with mass water content of 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 0 10 0 12 0 14 0 16 0 17 0 21 0 31 g g were prepared and the dry density was 1 2 g cm3 when the loess was filled to half the height of the box an ahfo fbg sensor was placed in the loess through the circular hole after the loess was completely filled each sensor was connected to the fbg demodulator nanzee sensing suzhou china during the test the heating power is controlled to 11 w m by the dc power supply and the data are obtained by the computer and supporting software 2 4 in situ verification test next an ahfo fbg sensor was deployed in the loess of yan an city china fig 6 shows the geographic location of the monitoring site the region belongs to the typical continental warm temperate monsoon climate which is hot and rainy in summer cold and dry in winter with sparse rain and snow the monitoring site is located at the top of the slope at an altitude of 1188 m where the local lithology is mainly quaternary aeolian loess the terrain here is high the temperature is low the surrounding is open and the vegetation coverage is thin in the sensor layout process a series of measures were adopted to ensure the close contact between the ahfo fbg sensor and the surrounding soil fig 7 shows the installation steps of the ahfo fbg sensor first a hole was punched using a soil extractor with a diameter slightly smaller than the sensor diameter then the sensor was slowly inserted into the hole to ensure good contact with the surrounding soil finally the sensor was protected with a fence the electric wire and optical cable of the ahfo fbg sensor were routed from underground to the monitoring station through a trench dug in advance the monitoring data were sent to the client computer wirelessly and in real time through the local monitoring station fig 8 the ahfo fbg sensor fig 9 has five measurement points with the interval of 0 1 m which measures the soil temperature and total water content at 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m away from the surface the heating power is 11 w m the monitoring time of this in situ test is from november 5 2019 to april 17 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil temperature profile and frozen soil distribution fig 10 a shows the temporal and spatial distribution of soil temperature t 0 at the monitoring site the t 0 fluctuates regularly with seasons the t 0 in autumn and spring is higher than that in winter in addition the distribution of t 0 is also depth related the closer to the surface the more easily the t 0 is affected by the atmosphere and the more obvious the seasonal regularity it can be seen from fig 10a that the t 0 within 0 4 m from the ground surface is lower than 0 in winter and the t 0 reaches the minimum on january 14 2020 fig 10b shows the variation of temperature characteristic value t t measured by ahfo fbg sensor over time the t t of 0 1 m measurement point has two sudden change in winter namely t t1 and t t2 respectively and the t t in this time period is lower than that in the other periods however the t t of the four measurement points within the depth of 0 2 0 5 m have no obvious sudden change to further explore the reason for the sudden change of t t at 0 1 m measurement point the t 0 is further compared with the t t fig 10c the t t measured from december 26 2019 to february 11 2020 is significantly lower than that in other periods and the corresponding t 0 in this period is all lower than 0 because the local rainfall is very small in winter and the measurement points are all located below 0 1 m depth this phenomenon is not likely caused by rainfall a reasonable explanation is that the loess is frozen during this period because the thermal conductivity of ice is about 4 times larger than that of water the thermal conductivity of frozen soil is higher than that of unfrozen soil thus the measured t t will be lower note that the t 0 was already lower than the theoretical freezing temperature t f 0 897 calculated according to eq 16 on december 7 2019 but the t t1 occurred on december 26 2019 corresponding to a t 0 of 1 878 this illustrates that when the in situ t 0 reaches the theoretical t f the soil will not enter the frozen state immediately but after some time the reason for this phenomenon is that the daily temperature changes drastically and cannot be regarded as a constant at that time therefore the actual t f is lower than the theoretical t f during the in situ measurement also note that at the t t2 0 619 february 11 2020 the corresponding t 0 is very close to the theoretical t f indicating that the theoretical t f is relatively accurate when the in situ soil has experienced a long period of frozen state and then enters the unfrozen state again therefore during the freezing period of the 0 1 m measurement point the calibration formula of frozen soil should be adopted while the calibration formula of unfrozen soil should be utilized for other periods and the remaining four measurement points to further verify that the sudden decrease of t t from december 26 2019 to february 11 2020 is caused by the phase transition of unfrozen water into ice in soil the measured t t is compared with the unfrozen water content w u calculated by eq 14 and the relationship between the two parameters is obtained fig 11 there is an obvious linearly positive correlation between t t and w u and the sensitivity coefficient is 0 04789 the higher w u means the less ice content and the smaller thermal conductivity of frozen soil resulting in the larger t t the relationship between t t and w u indicates that the change of t t is closely related to the ice content in soil therefore the sudden decrease and increase of t t in winter in fig 8 comes from phase change of water and ice according to the above analysis it can be inferred that the freezing interface occurs between 0 1 m and 0 2 m at the location of the ahfo fbg sensor thus the ahfo fbg technology can roughly estimate the depth of frozen soil during the in situ application of the ahfo fbg technology in frozen soil regions it is recommended to comprehensively judge the depth of frozen soil by combining the variation trends of measured t t and the corresponding t 0 3 2 t t θ calibration formula determination of frozen soil fig 12 a shows the temperature characteristic value t t total volumetric water content θ calibration result of unfrozen soil it can be seen that t t θ calibration model of unfrozen soil is reliable which fits the experimental data well with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 from the calibration result of unfrozen soil we can directly get the values of parameters au bu and cu and also can get λ dry from the temperature rise curve of the dry soil λ dry 0 18548 w m 1 k 1 then the relevant parameters of loess can be obtained by eqs 5 7 including m 3 37793 w m 1 κ u 0 47116 λ satu 2 46748 w m 1 k 1 for the same type of soil the parameters λ dry and m are constants whether frozen or not according to the above analysis the value of λ satf at a certain soil temperature can be calculated according to eq 17 for 0 1 m measurement point once the soil is frozen the measured t t t t1 in fig 10b changes obviously at the same time the total water content can be considered as constant before and after the sudden change of t t note there is a fact that water expands in volume by roughly 9 upon freezing which would change the volume percentage when the soil total water content is high or the freezing degree is high the change of porosity in frozen soil should be considered however in this paper due to the low total water content of in situ loess the change of porosity caused by freezing can be neglected thus it can be considered that the total water content corresponding to t t1 is equal to that of unfrozen soil note that the assumption of zero water redistribution is not always true especially in medium to fine textured soils and these special cases in medium to fine textured soil are not considered in this paper combined with the related parameters of frozen soil obtained above the empirical parameter κ f can be determined by substituting the t t1 and θ into the calibration model of frozen soil eqs 9 12 after obtaining λ satf and κ f the parameters af bf and cf in the calibration model of frozen soil under any negative soil temperature can be calculated thus the calibration formula of frozen soil under different soil temperatures can be determined the field data show that t t1 is 4 30 the corresponding t 0 is 1 878 and the θ of the previous day is 0 166 cm3 cm3 then the empirical parameter κ f can be calculated as 0 38853 therefore the t t θ calibration formulas of unfrozen loess and frozen loess are as follows 18 t t 1 a u θ 1 b u θ c u a u 0 57124 b u 0 94911 c u 0 05491 19 t t 1 a f θ 1 b f θ c f a f 0 50935 3 73333 0 55720 0 162 t 0 0 53 0 03829 b f 1 09740 c f 0 05491 fig 12b shows the comparison of the t t θ calibration formulas between frozen soil and unfrozen soil the calibration curves of frozen soil are all located below the calibration curve of unfrozen soil and only the t t in dry soil are the same which is consistent with the previous analysis in addition the lower the t 0 of frozen soil the lower the position of calibration curve which indicates that the soil freezing degree increases with the decrease of soil temperature 3 3 total water content profile in the in situ test and reliability analysis fig 13 a shows the calculated results of soil total water content θ at 0 1 m measurement point the θ values calculated by different calibration formulas are basically consistent and the θ values before and after t t1 have good time continuity more importantly the θ values before and after t t2 are also very consistent and continuous which indicates that the frozen soil calibration formulas under different temperatures are effective and reliable the reliability of the ahfo fbg method for unfrozen soil water content measurement has been verified by previous studies cao et al 2018 sun et al 2020 therefore according to the consistent measurement results between frozen soil and unfrozen soil it can be inferred that the measured total water content in frozen soil is also reliable and trustworthy in addition the total water content at 0 1 m depth does not change much in winter basically maintaining at about 0 170 cm3 cm3 but it is slightly higher than that before and after soil freezing this is because of the difference in matric suction between the frozen soil and unfrozen soil caused by the soil temperature gradient and hence the water in the soil migrates from the deep high temperature to the surface low temperature area xu et al 1997 watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 fig 13b shows the temporal and spatial variation of soil total water content θ the θ is higher in autumn and spring but lower in winter which is consistent with the time variation of soil temperature this is attributed to the dry climate in winter the soil evaporation intensity is large and there is little rainfall supply so the θ decreases in winter under the effect of evaporation on the contrary rainfall replenishment gradually increases in spring so the θ also increases from the θ distribution along the depth it can be seen that the θ of shallow soil 0 1 0 2 m is higher than that of the soil in the range of 0 3 0 5 m it should be noted that during the freezing period between two yellow dotted lines the contour line of θ in a certain period is in an arch shape red dotted line which is consistent with the previous analysis it also can be found that this phenomenon obviously occurred after january 14 2020 the lowest t 0 white dotted line which indicates that the lower the soil temperature is the more obvious water migration between frozen soil and unfrozen soil is the above analysis further verifies the effectiveness of the ahfo fbg technology in the total water content measurement of frozen soil the calibration model proposed in this paper takes into account the partially frozen phenomenon ice water phase transition existing in frozen soil at the same time this calibration model assumes that the ice water phase transition does not occur during the heating process the main reason for adopting this assumption is that the heating power used in the tests is low and the effect of latent heat on the measurement results can be ignored however heating will inevitably trigger a certain degree of ice water phase transition and hence the reliability of this assumption should be verified therefore the heating process of frozen soil under the actual field situation is simulated by using the comsol multiphysics software the simulation object is the soil with a volumetric water content of 0 166 cm3 cm3 december 26 2019 the simulation results are shown in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 that the farther away from the ahfo fbg sensor the smaller the temperature rise and the heating influence radius is about 6 cm fig 15 a and fig 15b show the soil temperature distribution after heating when the t 0 is 1 8780 december 26 2019 and 2 7173 january 14 2020 respectively generally speaking 0 is the critical temperature of ice water phase transition so the critical radius for ice water phase transition corresponds to the radius where the soil temperature is 0 without considering the ice water phase transition the critical radius is 1 41178 cm when t 0 is 1 8780 by subtracting the volume of the ahfo fbg sensor itself with a radius of 0 35 cm the calculated soil volume with phase transition is 5 87637 cm3 in the same way the critical radius is 0 87113 cm when t 0 is 2 7173 and soil volume with phase transition is 1 99921 cm3 for this in situ loess the heat transfer radius is 6 cm so the soil volume affected by heating is 112 71249 cm3 when t 0 is 1 8780 and 2 7173 the soil volume with phase transition only accounts for 5 21 and 1 77 of the total soil volume respectively therefore the assumption of ignoring ice water phase transition during the heating process is acceptable it can also be seen that the lower the t 0 is the smaller the soil volume with phase transformation is during the heating process therefore the proposed total water content measurement model of frozen soil will be more effective when the negative soil temperature is lower 3 4 uncertainty and applicability analysis first and foremost based on the côté and konrad model of unfrozen soil the calibration model of frozen soil and its determination method are established the most significant advantages of côté and konrad model are as follows first it is the optimal calibration model for unfrozen soil with the highest accuracy and the fewest fitting parameters which has been confirmed in the research of sun et al 2020 the second is that the model is applicable to both frozen soil and unfrozen soil therefore the fitting parameters can be determined by the relationship between λ satf and λ satu eq 17 which avoids the complex process of calculating the ice and unfrozen water content in frozen soil it should be pointed out that when calculating the λ satf and λ satu the geometric average model used by côté and konrad 2005 namely eq 8 and eq 13 is adopted in addition to this model there are other models available for calculating the λ satf and λ satu barry macaulay et al 2015 he et al 2021 it is worth further exploring in the following works to evaluate the influence of different thermal conductivity models on the measurement accuracy secondly the influence of initial soil temperature on unfrozen water content is considered in the t t θ calibration model of frozen soil which benefits from the fact that ahfo fbg technology can accurately obtain soil temperature compared with dts technology with unsatisfactory temperature measurement accuracy and spatial resolution this is a unique advantage of ahfo fbg technology and also is a main technical prerequisite for realizing total water content measurement in frozen soil it is worth noting that the calibration model of frozen soil derived in this paper does not consider the influence of ice water phase transition during the heating process this is because the heating power used in the tests is relatively small and the phase transition occurs only in a thin layer of soil around the sensor which has little influence on the t t therefore the calibration model is feasible in the present in situ test however if the heating power or the initial total water content of soil is high the influence of ice water phase transition on the t t should be considered this is where the theoretical calibration model needs to be improved in addition the hysteresis phenomenon during freezing and thawing processes is not considered when determining the unfrozen water content because this paper focuses on in situ soil and the soil temperature decreased steadily about 0 08 c d 1 from 0 c to a minimum value with a uninterrupted freezing process in this situation the soil freezing characteristic curves of in situ soil during freezing and thawing are basically coincident which has been confirmed by the research of parkin et al 2013 this is because the in situ soil has experienced numerous freeze thaw cycles under natural conditions and the soil structure has become stable however when studying the remolded soil or there are numerous interruptions temporary increase in soil temperature the hysteresis effect cannot be ignored ren and vanapalli 2020 this is also an aspect that the t t θ calibration model should be improved in the future finally the ahfo fbg sensor used in this paper is packaged with alundum tube it is easy to achieve close contact with surrounding loess by drilling holes slightly smaller than the diameter of the sensor however when encapsulating the sensor with other materials such as plastic materials or applying this technology to the coarse grained soil and rock the corresponding layout method should be improved and or the contact thermal resistance between the sensor and the surrounding soil should be considered so as to ensure the total water content measurement accuracy in frozen soil 4 conclusions in this paper a new method for total water content measurement in seasonally frozen soil was proposed using actively heated fiber bragg grating ahfo fbg sensing in this method the partially frozen conditions of frozen soil under different soil temperatures were considered and the specific steps to determine the t t θ calibration formula of frozen soil were described in detail moreover the reliability and practicability of this method were proved by in situ total water content measurement results the main conclusions are as follows 1 the ahfo fbg technology can be used to estimate the frozen soil distribution and determine the total water content distribution of frozen soil 2 the calibration formulas of frozen soil under different temperatures can be determined from the calibration formula of unfrozen soil so the total water content measurement method for frozen soil using the ahfo fbg sensing is simple and convenient 3 the total water content values of frozen soil and unfrozen soil measured by the ahfo fbg technology in the in situ test have good consistency with time which proves the feasibility and reliability of this method 4 the ahfo fbg sensor provides a new technical means for the research about the seasonally frozen soil in summary this ahfo fbg based method provides a new way to measure the total water content of frozen soil under partially frozen conditions which can complement with the traditional techniques to achieve quasi distributed and in situ total water content monitoring in frozen and unfrozen soil moreover this new method may also offer helpful insights for other hydrological explorations and engineering applications related to the seasonally frozen soil in the future the establishment of theoretical calibration model considering the latent heat effect of ice water phase transition in the heating process is an important subject to be improved credit authorship contribution statement mengya sun conceptualization methodology writing original
