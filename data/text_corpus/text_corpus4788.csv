vortices during their evolution new relations between basic vortex parameters at horizontal mid depth are derived in order to compare vortices with the same potential vorticity extremum at the vortex center the fluid rotation is shown to be larger for smaller vortices which can be interpreted as a capability of vortex amplification due to radial redistribution of the angular momentum resulting

important theme of physical oceanography for decades carton 2001 haller 2015 the velocity maximum of long lived vortices can be at any depth but will be referred to as mid depth in this study for

vortices can propagate westward in tropical corridors for up to 5 years chen et al 2019 deep mediterranean salt lenses commonly called meddies have a maximum velocity at 1 km depth and have been recorded to travel through the north atlantic for two or more years bashmachnikov et al 2015 however vortices in numerical models typically have a shorter life petersen et al 2013 barbosa aguiar et al 2013 therefore the search continues for physical mechanisms that help such super long lived vortices to remain coherent for several years in highly anisotropic environments sutyrin 2018 from here on super long lived vortices are taken to refer to mesoscale features with closed vorticity contours significantly exceeding surrounding vorticity for more than a year typically the observed shape of monopolar coherent vortices in the ocean is not perfectly circular although the axisymmetric part usually dominates chen et al 2019 the horizontal scales of mesoscale vortices are much larger than their vertical scale and a common first step to characterize coherent vortices is to consider exact shape preserving solutions to the barotropic two dimensional 2d model dritschel 1998 or equivalent barotropic eb rotating shallow water model zeitlin 2018 in spatially uniform environments circular vortices do not generate non axisymmetric components if they are stable to small perturbations see sutyrin 2019a and references therein when perturbed stable vortices often display a tendency to return to an axisymmetric state owing to the spiral wind up of the nonaxisymmetric vorticity which becomes finely scaled in the underlying flow melander et al 1987 mccalpin 1987 sutyrin 1989a guinn and shubert 1993 smith and montgomery 1995 montgomery and kallenbach 1997 rossi et al 1997 bassom and

this simple theory serves to rationalize the inverse energy cascade of 2d turbulence xiao et al 2009 as well as the peripheral amplification of 2d vortices in simulations by sutyrin and radko 2019 the energy transfer is faster for stronger vortices and therefore the mechanisms of vortex intensification are expected to play an important role in long time survival of coherent vortices beyond 2d flows where only kinetic energy exists stretching of isopycnal surfaces in stratified fluids provides a reservoir of potential energy available for a transfer into kinetic energy of baroclinic vortices

consequences of deviations from the axisymmetry see carton 2010 and sokolovskiy and verron 2014 the major purpose of this study is to derive universal relations between basic vortex parameters at horizontal mid depth in order to compare vortices with the same potential vorticity extremum at the vortex center it allows elucidation of a process of inviscid redistribution of angular momentum that may lead to amplification of the internal fluid rotation at the center of baroclinic vortices during gradual erosion of the vortex core and or changing environment the paper is arranged as follows model of a circular baroclinic vortex is formulated in section 2 the relation between the potential vorticity and the angular velocity is derived in section 3 comparison with numerical observational and laboratory examples is presented in section 4 discussion and conclusions can be found in section 5 2 the equations for an axisymmetric flow consider large scale flows in the rotating stratified fluid layer with spatially uniform coriolis parameter f in the boussinesq and quasi static approximations assuming axisymmetry we start with the governing equations for an inviscid flow with velocity u v w in the cylindrical coordinates r θ z following sutyrin 2006 1 d u d t v f v r p r 2 d m d t 0 m f r 2 2 v r 3 d b d t 0 b p z 4 1 r r u r w z 0 5 d a d t a t 1 r r u a r w a z here the radial velocity u is related to radially propagating inertial gravity waves generated by a cyclo geostrophic disbalance in 1 where p is the geopotential while both angular momentum m and hydrostatic buoyancy b g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 are conserved by fluid parcels in 2 3 the conservation of ertel s potential vorticity q follows from 2 3 6 d q d t 0 q 1 r n 2 m r m z b r n 2 b z where n is the brunt vaisala frequency any circular vortex with azimuthal velocity v r z in the cyclo geostrophic balance u w 0 is known to be a steady solution to 1 5 in the unbounded domain with horizontally uniform background p z the properties of baroclinic monopoles with the geopotential anomaly p r z p z decaying in all directions from the vortex center r 0 at the mid depth z 0 b 0 were analyzed in detail mcwilliams 1985 they are stable for monotonic radial profiles of m and q e g sutyrin and radko 2016 2017 and references therein further we compare parameters of circular vortices with the same extremum of the potential vorticity assuming that the cyclo geostrophic balance holds if they are slightly perturbed the subsequent evolution involves radiation of inertial gravity waves and the development of a balancing circulation as the centrifugal and coriolis forces turn the radial motion towards the azimuthal direction after the waves propagate away the flow is assumed to adjust to the cyclo geostrophic balance with slightly different v r z which can be evaluated based on the lagrangian conservation of angular momentum buoyancy and potential vorticity without calculating details of inertial gravity waves mcwilliams 1988 here we exclude strongly disbalanced vortices which can trap inertial gravity waves and keep pulsating sutyrin 2006 3 parameters of a monopolar vortex at the mid depth let us consider a monopolar vortex with fluid rotation rate ω r v r 0 f r at the mid depth z 0 where b 0 and the potential vorticity q r q r 0 is given by 7 q q 1 2 ω r ω r φ 1 φ r n 2 n 2 r here φ r is the relative stretching at the mid depth at the periphery far from the vortex center n 2 n 2 φ 1 and the background pv q f n 2 at the vortex center the extremum of pv anomaly a 8 a q c q 1 1 2 ω c φ c 1 or 2 ω c a 1 φ c 1 1 1 a where q c q 0 the rotation rate is ω c ω 0 and the extremum of stretching is φ c φ 0 we see that due to baroclinic effects the ratio ω c a 1 2 in cyclonic eddies because ω c 0 a 0 and φ c 1 as well as in anticyclonic eddies because 0 5 ω c 0 a 0 and φ c 1 for the same pv anomaly a change in stretching is compensated by a change in the rotation rate according to 2 3 9 d φ c d t d φ c d ω c d t d 1 2 ω c where d u r c is the derivative evaluated at the vortex center r 0 and where w 0 at the mid depth therefore the ratio ω c a increases due to radial redistribution of angular momentum after convergence d 0 in cyclones or divergence d 0 in anticyclones integrating 1 in the radial direction the geopotential anomaly p p p at the mid depth can be obtained from ω assuming that the vortex is adjusted to the cyclo geostrophic balance given by 10 p r f 2 r ω 1 ω r d r using the extremum value of the geopotential anomaly at the vortex center p c p 0 the characteristic vortex radius r 0 can be defined by 11 f 2 0 ω 1 ω r d r r 0 2 f 2 ω c 1 ω c p c this value of p c can be related to the relative stretching within the eb approximation by introducing the characteristic gravity wave speed v g so that 12 p c v g 2 φ c 1 inserting this expression for p c into 11 and dividing by f 2 the rotation rate ω c and the vortex size r 0 can be related to the difference between l d 2 where l d v g f is the equivalent barotropic radius of deformation ebrd and l c 2 where l c l d φ c is the radius of deformation modified by the stretching at the vortex center 13 r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c l d 2 1 φ c l c 2 n c 2 n 2 1 l d 2 l c 2 both l d and l c are useful for characterization of eddies in stratified models laboratory experiments and observations various alternative forms of 13 were used for baroclinic vortices such as 7 in mcwilliams 1985 5 in carton 2001 or 2 9 in hassanzadeh et al 2012 using the vertical scale h l c f 0 n instead of l c 13 was validated with 3d numerical simulations of the boussinesq equations hassanzadeh et al 2012 as well as with laboratory experiments and with observations of atlantic ocean meddies and jovian vortices aubert et al 2012 in the next section we shall see examples of ebrd conservation despite the erosion of vortex cores during their evolution as follows from 13 the size of intense cyclones is known to be limited by 14 φ c 1 ω c 1 ω c r 0 2 l d 2 0 in the limit φ c 0 l c 0 so that r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c l d 2 in the opposite limit of homogeneous anticyclonic lenses as considered by gill 1981 and aubert et al 2012 φ c l d 0 so that 15 r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c l c 2 further using 8 and 13 the stretching can be excluded to obtain an explicit relation between the rotation rate and the pv anomaly a depending on the vortex size 16 a q c q 1 ω c 2 1 a 1 ω c r 0 2 l d 2 generally 16 allows for comparison of eddy parameters with the same q c but different size and or the background q in the quasigeostrophic limit when the pv anomaly is small a 1 16 is simplified 17 a ω c 2 r 0 2 l d 2 one can see here that for the same pv anomaly the rotation rate is larger for smaller vortex radii relative to ebrd l d in the limit of very small eddies r 0 l d 0 the stretching is negligible and therefore ω c a 0 5 as in the barotropic model for finite ω c and a the ageostrophic difference between 16 and 17 can be elucidated by introducing a local deformation radius r d l d 1 a 1 2 as suggested by sutyrin and yushina 1989 for the eb model then 18 r 0 2 r d 2 r 0 2 l c 2 1 2 ω c μ a ω c 2 1 ω c or ω c a 2 μ 1 0 5 0 25 a f μ 1 where f μ 2 μ 2 has maximum f 2 1 8 fig 1 shows that for cyclonic eddies with ω c 0 a 0 and r d l d the ratio ω c a is smaller than for anticyclonic eddies with 0 5 ω c 0 a 0 and r d l d nevertheless along the curve with the same a the rotation rate of vortices with smaller μ is always larger as in the quasigeostrophic limit 17 therefore if pv is conserved during erosion of the vortex core its rotation rate is expected to increase which is related to radial redistribution of angular momentum according to 9 in order to illustrate how vortex parameters are related to its horizontal structure note that 1 gives f 2 ω c 1 ω c 0 5 2 p c at the mid depth at the vortex center where the laplacian contains only r derivatives therefore from 11 a 19 r 0 2 2 p c 2 p c which can be useful to characterize surface intensified vortices with satellite data for vortices with commonly observed solid body rotating core within radius r s the value of r 0 depends on the peripheral decay of the geopotential anomaly in particular for exponential periphery 20 p p s exp γ r r s r 0 2 r s 2 2 p s f 2 ω c 1 ω c r s r s 2 1 γ fig 2 illustrates a comparison of orbital velocity defined from 20 with the commonly used gaussian profile ω ω c exp r 2 2 r s 2 where r 0 r s corresponds to the radius of maximum orbital velocity we see that r 0 r s if γ r s 2 4 supporting examples deep mediterranean salt lenses meddies are well isolated from atmospheric forcing and ideally suited for an analysis of their evolution assuming the pv conservation among numerous studies of meddies bashmachnikov et al 2015 only one meddy was surveyed in detail over a two year period hebert et al 1990 schultz tokos and rossby 1991 a noticeable increase of fluid rotation at the mid depth associated with substantial reduction of the vortex size can be seen in fig 3 during october 1984 october 1985 this meddy moved from 32n f 7 7 1 0 5 s 1 to 27n f 1 6 6 1 0 5 s 1 while the background stratification slightly weakened from n 2 g 1 2 1 0 6 m 1 to n 1 2 g 1 05 1 0 6 m 1 so that the background pv f n 2 decreased by 25 at the eddy center the stratification has slightly increased from n c 2 g 0 6 1 0 6 m 1 to n c 1 2 g 0 7 1 0 6 m 1 while fluid rotation has slightly intensified from ω c 0 15 to ω c 1 0 17 therefore the pv at the eddy center was nearly conserved during the first survey φ c 2 and the pv anomaly a 0 65 at the vortex center for p c 0 55 m 2 s 2 we find v g p c φ c 1 0 75 m s and l d v g f 10 km while the local deformation radius r d l d 1 a 16 km then the vortex size r 0 27 km defined by 11 gives the ratio r 0 r d μ 1 7 and ω c a 0 23 which corresponds well to relation 18 marked by at fig 1 at the second survey φ c 1 5 and the pv anomaly a 0 56 has decreased due to reduction of the background pv f 1 n 1 2 nevertheless l d and r d remained nearly the same as the decrease of the characteristic gravity wave speed to v g 1 0 63 m s for smaller geopotential p c 1 0 2 m 2 s 2 was mostly compensated by the reduction of the coriolis parameter observed increase of the ratio ω c a 0 3 agrees with the decrease of r 0 r d 1 25 as marked by another at fig 1 which is comparable with observed erosion of the vortex core radius from 24 km to 16 km see fig 3 it should be noted that without reduction of the pv anomaly due to adjustment to decreased background pv even stronger vortex amplification can be expected the revealed vortex amplification is consistent with observed pv conservation at the vortex center despite the largely unknown physical mechanisms of the vortex core erosion the double diffusive interleaving does not seem to be sufficient hebert et al 1990 substantial vortex core erosion was obtained in the long term numerical evolution of gaussian eddies using the quasigeostrophic beta plane eb model early et al 2011 initially r 0 80 km and l d 47 km so that μ 1 7 was nearly the same as for the meddy using their figure 11c we find that ω c 0 22 a marked by a diamond at fig 1 which is slightly less than for the meddy marked by in fig 1 due to the quasigeostrophic model for small a 0 23 after a year the stretching contribution decreased from initial a 2 ω c 0 56 a by 25 while the rotation rate remained nearly the same giving an increase of the ratio ω c a 0 27 and a reduction in μ 1 3 marked by another diamond at fig 1 which is close to the meddy at the second survey in this case the pv anomaly has decreased also due to meridional drift towards the latitude of rest sutyrin 1988 another example of the vortex core shrinking was described during splitting of stratified gaussian eddy by sutyrin and radko 2016 before splitting p c 0 44 m 2 s 2 f 1 0 4 s 1 and ω c 0 1 so that r 0 22 km is close to the radius of maximum velocity the eddy was imbedded in a uniformly stratified ocean with buoyancy frequency of n 2 8 1 0 3 s 1 at the vortex center φ c 2 7 then the pv anomaly a 0 7 and l d 5 km in this case the local deformation radius r d 9 km so that μ 2 4 corresponds to ω c a 0 14 marked by at fig 1 assuming a was nearly conserved after splitting into two baroclinic dipoles we see from 18 that increasing rotation rate ω c a 0 24 corresponds to reduction in μ by 1 3 marked by another at fig 1 that is close to the mark for meddy at the first survey it is consistent with a 30 decrease of the core radius assuming pv anomaly area conservation and we see that the ebrd l d remains nearly the same corresponding to the same eb gravity wave speed v g 0 5 m s note that this vortex intensification during splitting is mainly related to radial divergence 9 due to decreasing stretching to φ c 2 2 and associated cyclo geostrophic adjustment to the same background pv opposite evolution of anticyclonic vortices in uniformly stratified fluid was reported in laboratory experiments with homogeneous solid body rotating lens n c 0 by aubert et al 2012 in this limiting case of zero pv a 1 and l d 0 both are conserved l c 2 r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c while according to 18 21 μ 1 2 ω c ω c 1 ω c for freely evolving lens with constant volume l c r 0 2 and we find from 15 that 22 ω c 1 ω c r 0 6 which agrees well with the rotation rate reduction from ω c 0 08 to ω c 0 027 during the radius increase by 20 presented in fig 2 by aubert et al 2012 corresponding values of μ are marked by o in fig 1 illustrating that observational shrinking of vortices in the ocean cannot be modeled by viscous spreading of anticyclonic vortices in the laboratory experiments 5 conclusions the basic parameters of circular vortices in stratified rotating fluids are reconsidered using the equivalent barotropic eb approximation derived from the adiabatic model 1 5 at the mid depth where the eb radius of deformation ebrd l d p c φ c 1 1 2 f is defined by the vortex parameters extrema of geopotential p c and the relative stretching in the vortex core φ c n 2 n c 2 as well as the coriolis parameter f the obtained relation 16 between the maximum fluid rotation rate potential vorticity anomaly and the vortex size implies a vortex amplification with reduction of the vortex radius relative to the ebrd assuming the potential vorticity q c is conserved during the vortex evolution this relation holds in variable environment when the potential vorticity anomaly may change the non trivial conservation of the ebrd is found in observational and numerical examples together with the amplification of fluid rotation related to shrinking of the vortex radius if the vortex radius is known it can also be used to estimate the ebrd for the stratified model and corresponding parameters of the eb model for each particular vortex this approach clearly defines parameters of the eb approximation for stratified vortices providing an efficient way for comparison of observational vortex evolution with simplified models see fig 1 the obtained relations between parameters of circular vortices are universal irrelative to physical processes changing the vortex parameters as long as the vortices are in approximate cyclo geostrophic balance horizontally and hydrostatic balance vertically cf hassanzadeh et al 2012 however it is a competition between generating and relaxing of nonaxisymmetric components that is expected to cause the observed evolution of vortices in the ocean for example the background lateral shear and strain are known to provide an effective mechanism for gradual erosion of the stable vortices due to vorticity stripping at the core boundary in 2d flows legras and dritschel 1993 legras et al 2001 similar vortex erosion is expected in baroclinic vortices a stronger resistance of anticyclonic vortices than cyclonic vortices to the imposed strain was found by graves et al 2006 in the eb model in nonuniform horizontal shear such as in the large scale rossby wave the role of available potential energy for the vortex resilience remains under investigated sutyrin and carton 2006 the large scale vertical shear is also able to erode the vortex core e g vandermeirsh et al 2002 despite vortex self propagation and core deformations in nonuniform environment having been widely investigated such as in relation to the beta effect sutyrin et al 1994 early et al 2011 the long term evolution of the vortex core remains to be clarified reznik and kravtsov 2019 the growth of nonaxisymmetric perturbations on unstable vortices and the puzzling survival of wide baroclinic eddies in predominantly monopolar states is known to be strongly sensitive to the initial vortex structure and the model stratification e g benilov 2004 sutyrin and radko 2016 in a three layer model the stabilizing effect of a middle layer with uniform pv owing to a weakening of the vertical coupling between the upper and lower layers and a reduction of the pv gradient in the deep layer at rest was revealed by sutyrin 2015 vortex self elongation and nonlinear saturation of baroclinic instability in the form of tripolar states is also accompanied by the vortex core shrinking and the rotation amplification sutyrin 2016 physical mechanisms of the erosion of long lived vortices need further investigation to better understand the vortex evolution in the ocean declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

the vortex is adjusted to the cyclo geostrophic balance given by 10 p r f 2 r ω 1 ω r d r using the extremum value of the geopotential anomaly at the vortex center p c p 0 the characteristic vortex radius r 0 can be defined by 11 f 2 0 ω 1 ω r d r r 0 2 f 2 ω c 1 ω c p c this value of p c can be related to the relative stretching within the eb approximation by introducing the characteristic gravity wave speed v g so that 12 p c v g 2 φ c 1 inserting this expression for p c into 11 and dividing by f 2 the rotation rate ω c and the vortex size r 0 can be related to the difference between l d 2 where l d v g f is the equivalent barotropic radius of deformation ebrd and l c 2 where l c l d φ c is the radius of deformation modified by the stretching at the vortex center 13 r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c l d 2 1 φ c l c 2 n c 2 n 2 1 l d 2 l c 2 both l d and l c are useful for characterization of eddies in stratified models laboratory experiments and observations various alternative forms of 13 were used for baroclinic vortices such as 7 in mcwilliams 1985 5 in carton 2001 or 2 9 in hassanzadeh et al 2012 using the vertical scale h l c f 0 n instead of l c 13 was validated with 3d numerical simulations of the boussinesq equations hassanzadeh et al 2012 as well as with laboratory experiments and with observations of atlantic ocean meddies and jovian vortices aubert et al 2012 in the next section we shall see examples of ebrd conservation despite the erosion of vortex cores during their evolution as follows from 13 the size of intense cyclones is known to be limited by 14 φ c 1 ω c 1 ω c r 0 2 l d 2 0 in the limit φ c 0 l c 0 so that r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c l d 2 in the opposite limit of homogeneous anticyclonic lenses as considered by gill 1981 and aubert et al 2012 φ c l d 0 so that 15 r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c l c 2 further using 8 and 13 the stretching can be excluded to obtain an explicit relation between the rotation rate and the pv anomaly a depending on the vortex size 16 a q c q 1 ω c 2 1 a 1 ω c r 0 2 l d 2 generally 16 allows for comparison of eddy parameters with the same q c but different size and or the background q in the quasigeostrophic limit when the pv anomaly is small a 1 16 is simplified 17 a ω c 2 r 0 2 l d 2 one can see here that for the same pv anomaly the rotation rate is larger for smaller vortex radii relative to ebrd l d in the limit of very small eddies r 0 l d 0 the stretching is negligible and therefore ω c a 0 5 as in the barotropic model for finite ω c and a the ageostrophic difference between 16 and 17 can be elucidated by introducing a local deformation radius r d l d 1 a 1 2 as suggested by sutyrin and yushina 1989 for the eb model then 18 r 0 2 r d 2 r 0 2 l c 2 1 2 ω c μ a ω c 2 1 ω c or ω c a 2 μ 1 0 5 0 25 a f μ 1 where f μ 2 μ 2 has maximum f 2 1 8 fig 1 shows that for cyclonic eddies with ω c 0 a 0 and r d l d the ratio ω c a is smaller than for anticyclonic eddies with 0 5 ω c 0 a 0 and r d l d nevertheless along the curve with the same a the rotation rate of vortices with smaller μ is always larger as in the quasigeostrophic limit 17 therefore if pv is conserved during erosion of the vortex core its rotation rate is expected to increase which is related to radial redistribution of angular momentum according to 9 in order to illustrate how vortex parameters are related to its horizontal structure note that 1 gives f 2 ω c 1 ω c 0 5 2 p c at the mid depth at the vortex center where the laplacian contains only r derivatives therefore from 11 a 19 r 0 2 2 p c 2 p c which can be useful to characterize surface intensified vortices with satellite data for vortices with commonly observed solid body rotating core within radius r s the value of r 0 depends on the peripheral decay of the geopotential anomaly in particular for exponential periphery 20 p p s exp γ r r s r 0 2 r s 2 2 p s f 2 ω c 1 ω c r s r s 2 1 γ fig 2 illustrates a comparison of orbital velocity defined from 20 with the commonly used gaussian profile ω ω c exp r 2 2 r s 2 where r 0 r s corresponds to the radius of maximum orbital velocity we see that r 0 r s if γ r s 2 4 supporting examples deep mediterranean salt lenses meddies are well isolated from atmospheric forcing and ideally suited for an analysis of their evolution assuming the pv conservation among numerous studies of meddies bashmachnikov et al 2015 only one meddy was surveyed in detail over a two year period hebert et al 1990 schultz tokos and rossby 1991 a noticeable increase of fluid rotation at the mid depth associated with substantial reduction of the vortex size can be seen in fig 3 during october 1984 october 1985 this meddy moved from 32n f 7 7 1 0 5 s 1 to 27n f 1 6 6 1 0 5 s 1 while the background stratification slightly weakened from n 2 g 1 2 1 0 6 m 1 to n 1 2 g 1 05 1 0 6 m 1 so that the background pv f n 2 decreased by 25 at the eddy center the stratification has slightly increased from n c 2 g 0 6 1 0 6 m 1 to n c 1 2 g 0 7 1 0 6 m 1 while fluid rotation has slightly intensified from ω c 0 15 to ω c 1 0 17 therefore the pv at the eddy center was nearly conserved during the first survey φ c 2 and the pv anomaly a 0 65 at the vortex center for p c 0 55 m 2 s 2 we find v g p c φ c 1 0 75 m s and l d v g f 10 km while the local deformation radius r d l d 1 a 16 km then the vortex size r 0 27 km defined by 11 gives the ratio r 0 r d μ 1 7 and ω c a 0 23 which corresponds well to relation 18 marked by at fig 1 at the second survey φ c 1 5 and the pv anomaly a 0 56 has decreased due to reduction of the background pv f 1 n 1 2 nevertheless l d and r d remained nearly the same as the decrease of the characteristic gravity wave speed to v g 1 0 63 m s for smaller geopotential p c 1 0 2 m 2 s 2 was mostly compensated by the reduction of the coriolis parameter observed increase of the ratio ω c a 0 3 agrees with the decrease of r 0 r d 1 25 as marked by another at fig 1 which is comparable with observed erosion of the vortex core radius from 24 km to 16 km see fig 3 it should be noted that without reduction of the pv anomaly due to adjustment to decreased background pv even stronger vortex amplification can be expected the revealed vortex amplification is consistent with observed pv conservation at the vortex center despite the largely unknown physical mechanisms of the vortex core erosion the double diffusive interleaving does not seem to be sufficient hebert et al 1990 substantial vortex core erosion was obtained in the long term numerical evolution of gaussian eddies using the quasigeostrophic beta plane eb model early et al 2011 initially r 0 80 km and l d 47 km so that μ 1 7 was nearly the same as for the meddy using their figure 11c we find that ω c 0 22 a marked by a diamond at fig 1 which is slightly less than for the meddy marked by in fig 1 due to the quasigeostrophic model for small a 0 23 after a year the stretching contribution decreased from initial a 2 ω c 0 56 a by 25 while the rotation rate remained nearly the same giving an increase of the ratio ω c a 0 27 and a reduction in μ 1 3 marked by another diamond at fig 1 which is close to the meddy at the second survey in this case the pv anomaly has decreased also due to meridional drift towards the latitude of rest sutyrin 1988 another example of the vortex core shrinking was described during splitting of stratified gaussian eddy by sutyrin and radko 2016 before splitting p c 0 44 m 2 s 2 f 1 0 4 s 1 and ω c 0 1 so that r 0 22 km is close to the radius of maximum velocity the eddy was imbedded in a uniformly stratified ocean with buoyancy frequency of n 2 8 1 0 3 s 1 at the vortex center φ c 2 7 then the pv anomaly a 0 7 and l d 5 km in this case the local deformation radius r d 9 km so that μ 2 4 corresponds to ω c a 0 14 marked by at fig 1 assuming a was nearly conserved after splitting into two baroclinic dipoles we see from 18 that increasing rotation rate ω c a 0 24 corresponds to reduction in μ by 1 3 marked by another at fig 1 that is close to the mark for meddy at the first survey it is consistent with a 30 decrease of the core radius assuming pv anomaly area conservation and we see that the ebrd l d remains nearly the same corresponding to the same eb gravity wave speed v g 0 5 m s note that this vortex intensification during splitting is mainly related to radial divergence 9 due to decreasing stretching to φ c 2 2 and associated cyclo geostrophic adjustment to the same background pv opposite evolution of anticyclonic vortices in uniformly stratified fluid was reported in laboratory experiments with homogeneous solid body rotating lens n c 0 by aubert et al 2012 in this limiting case of zero pv a 1 and l d 0 both are conserved l c 2 r 0 2 ω c 1 ω c while according to 18 21 μ 1 2 ω c ω c 1 ω c for freely evolving lens with constant volume l c r 0 2 and we find from 15 that 22 ω c 1 ω c r 0 6 which agrees well with the rotation rate reduction from ω c 0 08 to ω c 0 027 during the radius increase by 20 presented in fig 2 by aubert et al 2012 corresponding values of μ are marked by o in fig 1 illustrating that observational shrinking of vortices in the ocean cannot be modeled by viscous spreading of anticyclonic vortices in the laboratory experiments 5 conclusions the basic parameters of circular vortices in stratified rotating fluids are reconsidered using the equivalent barotropic eb approximation derived from the adiabatic model 1 5 at the mid depth where the eb radius of deformation ebrd l d p c φ c 1 1 2 f is defined by the vortex parameters extrema of geopotential p c and the relative stretching in the vortex core φ c n 2 n c 2 as well as the coriolis parameter f the obtained relation 16 between the maximum fluid rotation rate potential vorticity anomaly and the vortex size implies a vortex amplification with reduction of the vortex radius relative to the ebrd assuming the potential vorticity q c is conserved during the vortex evolution this relation holds in variable environment when the potential vorticity anomaly may change the non trivial conservation of the ebrd is found in observational and numerical examples together with the amplification of fluid rotation related to shrinking of the vortex radius if the vortex radius is known it can also be used to estimate the ebrd for the stratified model and corresponding parameters of the eb model for each particular vortex this approach clearly defines parameters of the eb approximation for stratified vortices providing an efficient way for comparison of observational vortex evolution with simplified models see fig 1 the obtained relations between parameters of circular vortices are universal irrelative to physical processes changing the vortex parameters as long as the vortices are in approximate cyclo geostrophic balance horizontally and hydrostatic balance vertically cf hassanzadeh et al 2012 however it is a competition between generating and relaxing of nonaxisymmetric components that is expected to cause the observed evolution of vortices in the ocean for example the background lateral shear and strain are known to provide an effective mechanism for gradual erosion of the stable vortices due to vorticity stripping at the core boundary in 2d flows legras and dritschel 1993 legras et al 2001 similar vortex erosion is expected in baroclinic vortices a stronger resistance of anticyclonic vortices than cyclonic vortices to the imposed strain was found by graves et al 2006 in the eb model in nonuniform horizontal shear such as in the large scale rossby wave the role of available potential energy for the vortex resilience remains under investigated sutyrin and carton 2006 the large scale vertical shear is also able to erode the vortex core e g vandermeirsh et al 2002 despite vortex self propagation and core deformations in nonuniform environment having been widely investigated such as in relation to the beta effect sutyrin et al 1994 early et al 2011 the long term evolution of the vortex core remains to be clarified reznik and kravtsov 2019 the growth of nonaxisymmetric perturbations on unstable vortices and the puzzling survival of wide baroclinic eddies in predominantly monopolar states is known to be strongly sensitive to the initial vortex structure and the model stratification e g benilov 2004 sutyrin and radko 2016 in a three layer model the stabilizing effect of a middle layer with uniform pv owing to a weakening of the vertical coupling between the upper and lower layers and a reduction of the pv gradient in the deep layer at rest was revealed by sutyrin 2015 vortex self elongation and nonlinear saturation of baroclinic instability in the form of tripolar states is also accompanied by the vortex core shrinking and the rotation amplification sutyrin 2016 physical mechanisms of the erosion of long lived vortices need further investigation to better understand the

23941,from satellite altimetry it is known the benefit of assimilating sea level anomalies sla has been shown in the context of operational ocean forecast systems however how much data assimilation da of altimetry data improves the representation of mesoscale eddies has still not been investigated in previous studies especially in the south china sea scs no estimation for that has been done in a long time in this study a nested scs model system uses the ensemble optimal interpolation method to assimilate along track sla data from 1993 to 2011 we assess the representation of eddy characteristics in two hindcast simulations one with da and the other without and compare them to satellite derived eddy characteristics in the whole scs the assimilation improves the number of simulated cyclonic anticyclonic eddies by 10 3 13 6 the corresponding improvement in the eddy rich northern scs is 17 9 19 6 assimilation improves the seasonality of eddy occurrence with cyclones and anticyclones showing an obviously asymmetric seasonality however diagnosed assimilation effects and associated residual errors show large spatial and temporal dependencies the radii of anticyclonic eddies smaller than 70 km are not changed with da the results show that deficiencies of cyclonic eddies in winter and anticyclonic eddies in summer around 13 n in the southeastern scs are not well corrected by da where one of the shortcomings resulted from the used wind forcing although this study does not conduct one to one forecasting experiments for each eddy track improved eddy reproduction is the first step towards detailed validation metrics for eddy forecasting systems keywords mesoscale eddy reproduction data assimilation south china sea altimeter sea level anomalies 1 introduction ocean mesoscale eddies are stable closed circulation features found over almost the entire global oceans and acting over time scales ranging from a few days to more than a hundred days they are characterized by their strong kinetic energy more than ten times the background mean kinetic energy richardson 1983 chelton et al 2007 eddies generally propagate westward at a phase speed close to that of baroclinic rossby waves chelton et al 2007 early et al 2011 typical mesoscale eddies are horizontally symmetrical vortices with radii ranging from 50 km to 500 km they are regarded as the ocean weather that stirs the stratified ocean le traon and dibarboure 1999 li and pohlmann 2002 halo et al 2014 and facilitates the exchange of properties between different water masses wunsch 2008 dufois et al 2016 the south china sea scs is a semi enclosed marginal sea having only one main connection to the western pacific through luzon strait its circulation relatively independent from the tropical ocean circulation is mainly driven by the alternating northeast and southwest monsoon winds in winter and summer respectively qu 2000 metzger 2003 gan et al 2006 however the kuroshio intrusion combined with complex local topographic steering directly affects the ocean circulation through luzon strait resulting in mesoscale eddies easily spreading into the northern scs nscs wang et al 2003 chow et al 2008 chen et al 2012 eddy genesis mechanisms have been related to the wind stress curl ring shedding from the kuroshio frontal instability related to the kuroshio intrusion and orographic wind jets wu and chiang 2007 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 numerical simulations of eddies rely strongly on high quality atmospheric forcing boundary transports and ocean initial state numerous cases of improvements in simulations or forecasts of specific eddies due to data assimilation have been reported e g wu and chiang 2007 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2019 however no studies quantitatively evaluate the extent to which the predicted eddies and their trajectories over a long time are attributed to data assimilation da except for a few cases under ocean reanalysis frameworks this may be a result of the intrinsic chaotic nonlinear dynamics involved and practical limits in accurately characterizing real eddies and their tracks in a two years assimilation experiment de vos et al 2018 noted a generally positive impact of assimilating along track sea level anomaly sla on simulated eddy characteristics in the agulhas current system based on an eddy resolving ocean reanalysis pilo et al 2018 found the model s response to da distorts the eddies and were cautious about interpreting their results because the adjusted vertical advection terms are about 1 5 times larger after assimilation this issue is hopefully irrelevant in the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian coordinates model used for this study which represents vertical velocities by vertical displacements of material coordinates smoothed by the model the growth of the satellite altimeter constellation to a mature state has enabled statistics of eddy trajectories by various automatic eddy detection algorithms to be determined e g penven et al 2005 chelton et al 2007 souza et al 2011 faghmous et al 2015 previous efforts to document scs eddies by manual detection from altimetry have been made wang et al 2003 chen et al 2011 du et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 however there are only a few attempts to evaluate automatically simulations of eddy trajectories against satellite altimeter products in the scs this is asserted to be valuable in the context of the scs serving as a useful example for other semi enclosed marginal seas xiu et al 2010 give a census of long lived eddies 30 days in the scs during 1993 2007 they first validate a regional ocean model system roms simulation of eddies against merged weekly sla maps from archiving validation and interpolation of satellite oceanographic data aviso now available through cmems copernicus marine environmental monitoring services neglecting eddies in waters shallower than 1000 m they counted 32 8 3 4 eddies in satellite maps each year with 53 of them being cyclonic and 70 of these having radii smaller than 100 km zhu et al 2016 contrast eddies originating from a global and a regional forecast system to a daily 1 4 deg resolution satellite sla data product in 2012 for eddies with lifetimes longer than 28 days they found 24 47 and 24 eddies in altimeter data global and regional forecast systems respectively but the spatial distributions of eddies origins their figure 12 uncover large differences between the different forecasting systems further all the above studies disregard eddies with lifetimes between 10 days and 28 days since these account for over 50 of all eddies referred to as short lived in chen and han 2019 they are an important component of the ocean s dynamic variability due to various technical reasons in situ profiles of temperature and salinity are notably poor and intermittent in the scs for instance yearly in situ profiles in 2004 2007 are fewer than 500 as shown in fig 4b of zeng et al 2016 this further highlights the important role of assimilating altimeter data in representing mesoscale eddy activity in the scs and the importance of multivariate corrections by da an eddy resolving numerical model such as the one used in this study should in principle reproduce the statistics of eddy activity but not the timing of the chaotic events during its lifetime genesis motions decay merging although data assimilation experiments in the scs do show the benefits of altimeter data for reducing errors in sla e g xie et al 2011 lyu et al 2014 the extent to which reproduced eddies are attributable to da has not yet been addressed two initial challenges arise from sensitivities to the selection of parameters used in the eddy tracking process as well as to differing spatial resolutions between the models and altimetry data this has a bearing on the fair comparison of the performance of the different products to understand the role of da on simulated ocean mesoscale variability cipollone et al 2017 compared eddy statistics of a global ocean reanalysis a free ocean simulation and an observation based dataset on a common 1 4 horizontal grid they concluded that da enhances the mesoscale variability of some features which cannot be well reproduced in the free running model another challenge is to select appropriate eddy characteristics for evaluation which is both useful and available from long time series of observations in general data assimilation techniques also assume the model to be bias free if this is the case they should effectively constrain eddy lifecycles but residual errors can be higher with model biases which may be stronger in certain locations or during certain seasons biases may arise from various reasons for example due to numerical schemes backeberg et al 2009 biases in the forcing fields or errors in the bottom topography the ensemble optimal interpolation method enoi oke et al 2002 has been applied to assimilate sla data in different ocean operational forecast centers e g oke et al 2008 lyu et al 2014 tanajura et al 2014 and has proven able to improve forecasts of mesoscale eddies and fronts backeberg et al 2014 counillon and bertino 2009 oke et al 2008 other da methods relying on static ensembles are used in several operational centers tonani et al 2015 and references therein in this study applying the enoi method we only assimilate along track altimetry data weekly into a nested eddy resolving scs ocean model the da system is used in hindcast mode with the model forced by reanalyzed winds rather than in real time prediction as such higher performance than might be achieved by operational forecast modes can be expected based on the diagnostic evaluation of two model runs without and with da its effects are quantified in terms of the basic eddy characteristics such as eddy centroids and radii as a pilot study this evaluation initially highlights their geographic and seasonal variations disregarding the irregular shapes of the eddies and neglecting the eddy distance error mechanism analysis related to the eddies cyclogenesis and propagation speeds has not been pursued in this study 2 data and the scs assimilation system 2 1 altimetry data for assimilation and evaluation the delayed time dt along track sea level anomaly tsla data were produced data unification and altimeter combination system duacs and released by aviso http www aviso oceanobs com to assimilate a fine resolution of tsla equivalent to the model resolution the unfiltered tsla product of duacs dt2014 is used with a 7 km horizontal resolution along track pujol et al 2016 nowadays another similar tsla product but with a lower resolution 14 km is available through the cmems portal product id sealevel glo phy l3 rep observations 008 045 several altimeters have flown during the experimental period namely ers 1 1992 1996 topex poseidon 1992 2002 ers 2 1995 2011 gfo 2000 2008 envisat 2002 2011 and jason 1 2 2002 2011 measurements potentially polluted by land data and unresolved coastal processes are removed only sla measurements located both in water deeper than 200 m and further than 50 km from the coast are assimilated eddy tracking algorithms however do not work on along track data gridded sla data created by merging the along track data based on an objective analysis le traon and dibarboure 1999 are required due to the increase of temporal resolution from weekly to daily the gridded sla data with 1 4 spatial resolution allows for robust tracking of eddy movement dibarboure et al 2011 pujol and mertz 2019 the used dt product of merged sla data is accessible through the cmems portal product id sealevel glo sla map l4 rep observations 008 027 this data source clearly not independent from the assimilated along track data is used for eddy tracking but not data assimilation 2 2 implementation of the data assimilation system a nested ocean model system was built in the complex topographic domain of the scs xie et al 2015 2018 based on version 2 2 of the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom see chassignet et al 2009 with a homogeneous 5 km horizontal resolution the inner model covers the whole scs basin including the gulf of thailand the sulu sea and the java sea and the pacific side of luzon strait in the vertical the model has 30 hybrid layers defined by target potential densities ranging from 0 1 to 27 84 in which the top 5 layers are imposed on z coordinates starting by 3 m thickness and increasing gradually with the same vertical hybrid layers the outer model covers the indian and pacific oceans as shown fig 1 in xie et al 2018 by a coarse resolution about 37 km which one way feeds the inner model with the lateral boundary conditions further details about the model setup are given in xie et al 2015 the inner model has been integrated without data assimilation driven by the 6 hourly atmospheric forcing from era interim era i simmons et al 2007 without tidal forcing during the period 1992 2007 to prepare the background error covariance matrix for assimilation snapshots of the model state have been stored every 10 days into a historical dataset used as an ensemble by the enoi data assimilation e g counillon and bertino 2009 in the sequential assimilation method the optimized model state as the vector x a is calculated by 1 x a x f k y h x f where y is the observations in a previous time window h is the observation operator and the vector x f represents the model forecast state the innovation between the model forecast and the observation is expressed by the term in brackets which is fed back to the analysis with a linear weight determined by the matrix array k namely kalman gain to represent the mesoscale ocean circulation the tsla high frequency tidal signals are filtered off before being delivered to users in the scs xie et al 2011 proposed a practical modification of the enoi scheme to constrain the mesoscale ocean circulations without interference from the tidal signal and demonstrated it over a period of two years the kalman gain k is simply expressed as follows 2 k a h a t h a h a t n 1 α r 1 where a is composed of the n model states from the historical simulations the matrix a is a centered ensemble the r in the brackets of eq 2 is the observation error matrix the assimilation parameter α is 0 8 which was tuned at the beginning of the assimilation to be built the data assimilation is applied every week to obtain almost a uniform coverage of the model domain by satellite tracks no temporal smoothing is applied to the assimilation increments in this system the enoi method used is derived from the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 and simplified using a static ensemble to approximate the multivariate model background error covariance bec since the decadal variability represented by the historical ensemble has wide spatial scales of little relevance for data assimilation every week the assimilation is used locally selecting only neighboring observations even with o 100 members ensemble covariance contains large spurious correlations that are larger than the signal a common approach is to assimilate data locally and tapper the innovation and observation error as a function of distance to limit discontinuity we have tuned the localization radius to 150 km for best qualitative performance compared to the model built in xie et al 2011 the present scs model uses the same method but has been upgraded to a higher resolution from 10 km to 5 km this resolution is considered eddy resolving and should in principle suffice for the purpose of eddy forecasting every week the tsla data collected in the 7 days before the assimilation time are assimilated then the model restarts from the corrected state and is integrated forward using the atmosphere forcing the model produces daily averages in the following week this reanalysis cycle has been repeated from october 1992 until the end of 2011 apart from the use of reanalysis atmospheric forcing and the quality checks of input data the data assimilation schedule is identical to an operational forecast system the daily outputs from two parallel model runs without and with the assimilation of tsla are subsequently named free and assim respectively these sla fields in the 19 years from 1993 to 2011 are compared against the gridded sla product from aviso in fig 1 on average the rms errors for sla in the nscs basin decrease by 3 1 cm a reduction of 28 2 due to data assimilation reaching a very stable error level of 8 cm throughout the assimilation experiment such sla errors are on par with other eddy resolving model systems e g xu et al 2019 3 automatic eddy track detection and validation 3 1 automatic eddy detection and tracking procedure using closed contours of sla from satellite maps wang et al 2003 identify scs eddies with a lifetime longer than 30 days and in depths deeper than 1000 m they find 58 anticyclonic eddies and 28 cyclonic eddies during the years of 1993 2000 in automatic detection methods the okubo weiss parameter okubo 1970 weiss 1991 is one of the most widespread tools to treat both satellite data and numerical model results it is defined as 3 w s n 2 s s 2 ζ 2 where s n u x v y is the normal component of the strain tensor s s v x u y is the shear component whilst ζ is the relative vorticity of the flow for altimeter data the geostrophic velocity field u v is derived from gradients of the sla maps the okubo weissparameter w characterizes the flow field either as vorticity dominated w 0 or strain dominated w 0 the criteria of closed sla loops and negative ow parameter are applied to detect the eddy deformation automatically the detection algorithm used in this study combines geometric and dynamical detection criteria and has proven robust in previous studies du et al 2016 halo et al 2014 then the eddy tracking algorithm follows the methodology used by penven et al 2005 also successfully implemented in the scs xiu et al 2010 chen et al 2011 du et al 2016 consequently the final criteria for detecting and tracking the eddies in the scs are mainly followed i w 2e 12 s 2 for detecting eddy central areas following chelton et al 2007 ii only the sla maxima or minima within the central areas are identified as eddy centers iii the closed contour of sla has an interval of 2 cm and the maximum radius of the closed contour is 400 km to avoid defining a whole ocean gyre as a giant eddy iv eddies centers located in water shallower than 100 m are discarded v the maximum permissible drift velocity of eddy is 0 5 m s 1 other eddy detection approaches have been proposed based on geometric criteria faghmous et al 2015 search for a relative sla extreme in a neighboring sub grid the global daily eddy dataset faghmous et al 2016 has been released on https datadryad org stash dataset and is used for a general validation of the eddy detection procedure in this study 3 2 validation of the detected eddies to avoid sporadic eddy events at the detection limit of the aviso product we only consider eddies in which radii are larger than 40 km lifetimes longer than 10 days and amplitudes larger than 3 cm to avoid uncertainties resulting from the eddy tracking algorithm applied at different spatial resolutions all daily sla data from two model runs are interpolated onto the coarser grid used in the aviso product with 1 4 horizontal resolution note that this resolution is still high enough to preserve model eddies because the numerical model effective resolution is always about four times coarser than the grid resolution afterward interpolated fields are fed to the automatic detection and tracking procedure to obtain model simulated eddy properties that are then compared to the satellite the same coarsening strategy was applied by cipollone et al 2017 to compute eddy statistics in a global ocean eddy permitting numerical model fig 2 shows an example of all detected eddies with lifetimes longer than 10 days from aviso free and assim on the 4th of july 2007 the overestimations of small eddies appearing at the nscs in the free run are corrected by da beside the anticyclonic eddy a0 located off the coast of vietnam there are three anticyclonic eddies close to 18 n named as a1 a2 and a3 as in nan et al 2011 the eddy a1 is discernible although not detected by the algorithm referring to the eddy dataset of faghmous et al 2016 on the same day the anticyclone a0 is also detected but removed due to a shorter lifetime or a smaller radius compared to the eddies in the free run the eddies a2 and a3 in assim agree better with the eddy location and drift from the satellite derived eddies besides compared to the eddies in altimeter data four cyclonic eddies occur in the middle of the scs basin in assim some of them also appear in the eddy dataset of faghmous et al 2016 but would not if considering those eddies lasting longer than 10 days or having radii larger than 50 km this highlights the sensitivity of eddy detection and tracking to the configuration settings of the algorithm in the agulhas current system de vos et al 2018 found that the predefined maximum propagation velocity is the most sensitive parameter in the eddy detection scheme visual inspection of a few examples not shown revealed neither false positive nor missed eddies consequently in this study we prefer to focus on the most basic properties to characterize the scs eddy activities no further tuning of this parameter nor comparisons with other automatic detection schemes were therefore undertaken whilst no eddy detection and tracking system is perfect interpolating results in a common grid and maintaining the same algorithm settings help to ensure the fairest practical comparison to identify whether the vertical water mass is consistent with the eddies or not the in situ profiles around the eddy centers are investigated based on the met office hadley centre en dataset with global quality control good et al 2013 in the scs basin 10 22 n 110 120 e there are 12305 temperature profiles during the 19 years extracted from en4 the latest version of en 4 2 1 at https www metoffice gov uk hadobs en4 data en4 2 1 we only retain profiles in waters deeper than 100 m to avoid coastal areas a matchup is counted when it coincides temporally with the detected eddy same day and is located no further than half the detected eddy s radius from its center following raj et al 2016 fig 3 shows the en4 profiles collocated with cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies detected from altimeter data free and assim respectively the maximal temperature difference of 4 9 c in the left panel clearly shows the effect of upwelling and downwelling dynamics of the eddies which independently suggests that the automatic detection and tracking approach works very well here in assim the two types of temperature profiles exhibit a similar temperature contrast the maximum is 3 7 c and the mean difference is 1 6 c in the upper 800 m compared with the profiles in the free run in which eddies are randomly located the tsla assimilation improves the water stratification near the eddy centers thanks to the multivariate properties of our data assimilation scheme 4 results having verified the expected effect of da on the location and vertical structure of eddies their detailed characteristics are investigated here we focus on the eddies whose centers once appeared in the deep basin 100 m of the scs domain 105 120 5 e 2 22 5 n the main expected eddy hotspots follow the continental slopes from the northwest of luzon strait to the coast of vietnam until 6 n another eddy hotspot 70 eddy days resides northwest of luzon island and is known as the west luzon eddy qu 2000 lin et al 2016 to evaluate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the simulated eddies after data assimilation we define a loss rate regarding that detected from satellite observations as follows 4 r m p o p m p o 100 where p represents the evaluated property number of eddies or average radius all positive values the superscripts of o and m represent the observed and the model forecast respectively the value of r m represents a relative deviation and the subscript m can be replaced by f and a for the free and assim runs the effect of data assimilation is measured by the increment of absolute loss rates of r a and r f 5 i r e r f r a eq 5 measures the improvement of reproduction for eddies ir e through da to be evaluated in different regions and periods where the free simulation suffers from inherent biases due to forcing fields bottom topography and numerics etc its loss rate r f should remain rather high in places and times where the errors are due to random effects and chaotic dynamics and might thereby be reasonably constrained the assimilation is expected to work well it would result in a decreased loss rate thus a positive ir e on the contrary the reproduction should remain very small or negative 4 1 overall evaluation in the whole scs we first consider the entire scs basin to the west of 120 5 e in for the whole 19 years 1822 1286 and 1502 eddies have been detected from aviso the free and assim respectively according to the criteria in section 3 1 taking the end positions of the eddy centers the counts of observed and simulated eddies are shown as a function of latitude in the left column of fig 4 in the top panel the presented eddies in the scs both cyclonic and anticyclonic densely reside between 12 n and 20 n both in the satellite and in the two model runs two peaks of eddy counts 180 appear clearly at 18 n and 14 n in satellite data the two peaks are visible in both model runs but the peaks are lower and their latitudes shifted especially for the free run the peak around 18 n can be linked to the eddies generated through the luzon strait propagating along the continental slope and those arising to the northwest of the luzon island they correspond to the major eddy corridors described in du et al 2016 the peak at 14 n reflects the eddies concentrating east of vietnam and southwest of luzon island similarly to the corridors in figures 3 and 6 of du et al 2016 in total the model tends to miss several eddies considering cyclones and anticyclones altogether although the assimilation of satellite data decreases the number of missed eddies from 536 to 319 this corresponds to a reduction of loss rate eq 4 from 29 4 to 17 5 in a shorter period of 1993 2007 xiu et al 2010 tracked about 32 9 32 8 eddies from the model satellite data per year of which about 52 were cyclonic in this study setting a shorter lifetime limit 10 days rather than 28 days more than twice as many eddies have been detected see fig 4 right but the fraction of cyclonic eddies tracked from satellites remain the same 52 taking cyclones only shown in the middle panel there are 948 750 and 848 eddies tracked in aviso free and assim respectively thanks to assimilation the number of missing eddies reduces from 198 to 100 during the 19 years corresponding to 10 3 of ir e in the whole scs basin the underestimation in the free run compared to aviso is consistent from 9 n until 22 n this is well corrected in assim except for a degradation around 17 n for anticyclones bottom panel the eddies in free are mostly underestimated in assim the eddies located at 13 n 16 n and 18 n 20 n are significantly improved and close to the observations on average the ir e for anticyclones is about 13 6 due to data assimilation in the whole scs it is higher than for cyclonic eddies which indicates that anticyclonic eddies gain a little more benefit from data assimilation in the scs this is visible in fig 6 on the other hand anticyclonic eddies south of 13 n are hardly improved relative to the free run which shows that the efficacy of data assimilation is confined to the nscs for anticyclonic eddies in the next section we highlight the ir e evolution to the north of 10 n 4 2 interannual and seasonal eddy variability in the northern scs in the sector of the nscs between 109 e and 120 e the yearly eddies occurred in the free and assim runs are counted in the right column of fig 4 the counts in aviso vary between 78 and 103 eddies without any obvious temporal trend the free run eddies are consistently underestimated between 50 and 76 per year in assim the number of eddies is larger varying from 66 to 95 the ir e of the yearly eddy occurrences is about 18 7 in the nscs for the tsla assimilation the interannual variations of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are shown in the middle and bottom panels respectively in the right column of fig 4 the cyclonic eddies in the free run are equally underestimated in most years and data assimilation improves the eddy occurrences very close to the observations for most years the annual mean of cyclonic eddies is 47 5 35 1 and 43 6 from aviso free and assim respectively corresponding to an ir e of 17 9 by da for anticyclonic eddies the underestimation in the free run is even stronger than for cyclones consistently for all 19 years through assimilation the number of anticyclonic eddies increases and agrees better with the observations the ir e climbs to about 19 6 which is probably related to the free run tendency to favor cyclonic eddies over anticyclones while the interannual variability of the eddies was relativelymarginal the seasonal variability of eddies is more visible in fig 5 the left column compares the number of accumulated eddies per month in aviso free and assim the sum of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies does not exhibit a seasonal cycle neither in the models nor in observations as indicated by fig 5a for cyclones however shown in the middle panel the observations show a marked seasonality from fewer than 60 eddies in summer months to more than 90 in october and november the seasonal variability of cyclones anticyclones in aviso is about 18 9 21 1 as indicated by the standard deviations in fig 5b fig 5c wu and chiang 2007 attributed the higher frequency of cyclonic eddies in winter to the seasonal variability of the kuroshio intrusion however the seasonality is weaker in the free run and partially retrieved in the assim run for anticyclones a reverse seasonality is found in observations fig 5c which is qualitatively consistent with the findings in table 1 of wang et al 2003 the anticyclonic eddies in the free run also show too weak a seasonality which also improves with assimilation the opposite seasonal cycles of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are discussed by liu et al 2001 pointing out two factors the surface wind curl and the baroclinic rossby waves as eddy generation mechanisms chassignet and xu 2017 also indicate that the inclusion of sub mesoscale effects does improve the seasonal cycle of mesoscale activity in the gulf stream in july and august of the 19 years eddies living longer than 10 days and their tracks from aviso and the two model runs are contrasted in fig 6 cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are shown in the upper and bottom panels respectively the numbers of cyclonic eddies from aviso free and assim are 116 103 and 106 respectively and their tracks are similarly scattered to the north of 6 n the number of anticyclonic eddies in the three datasets is 188 107 and 144 respectively giving an ir e eq 5 significantly higher than the above ir e of 13 6 in general compared to the anticyclonic eddies in free obvious improvements are noticeable for the eddy tracks in assim for instance there are more eddy tracks around 14 n in the middle of the scs basin to the east of vietnam the eddy tracks are more numerous and concentrated around 10 n besides two underestimations of eddy occurrences should be noted in fig 6 around 6 n south of vietnam and around 13 n near mindoro island in the philippines fig 5 also shows that the assim run does not increase the number of anticyclonic eddies in january and december indicating that the assimilation effect has a seasonal dependence 4 3 eddy radii the radii of ocean eddies are essential properties related to the eddy form associated with the first baroclinic deformation scale chelton et al 2007 kawaguchi et al 2012 as described by kawaguchi et al 2012 an eddy with a 30 km radius rotates as a solid body in its inner 15 km it specifically indicates how wide the extent of water mass exchange is incurred by the vortex significantly different from that of the mean flow the eddy size influences the strength of ekman pumping and as a consequence it is important for background general circulations for example seasonal variations of the radii over the 19 years are shown in the right column of fig 5 considering cyclones and anticyclones together in the top panel eddy radii in aviso are smaller than in the models for all months with a mean radius of 70 km and no obvious seasonal variability 1 2 km anticyclones are only slightly larger than cyclones by less than 2 km to quantify the significance of this difference we calculate the monthly standard deviations of the eddy radius in the observed sla data ignoring the change of radius within each eddy track the standard deviations of all cyclones and anticyclones radii are shown month by month in fig 7a the radius standard deviations in free are much larger than others and those in assim slightly larger than in aviso the difference of radii is then evaluated by comparison with the standard deviations of the sampled radii from aviso by application of cohen s d cohen 1988 the difference between the two means of eddy radius is expressed in units of the standard deviations in two scored groups as follows 6 d m 1 m 2 σ where m 1 and m 2 represent two mean radii from two datasets σ is the pooled standard deviation of both groups cohen 1988 qualifies d value below 0 2 as small 0 5 medium and above 8 large the standard deviation of the eddies radius in aviso is 10 7 km on average for all years as shown in the top panel according to cohen s d the 2 km difference mentioned above for the eddies in aviso is small the cyclones radii are slightly overestimated in the free run by 3 km all year round this is reduced in the assim run to 1 km also consistently all year round except in may and september during the seasonal transition of prevailing winds the related cohen s d shown as blue lines in fig 7b confirms that the change of radius of cyclones between the two model runs is insignificant for anticyclones the eddy radii in free are overestimated especially in july and august by more than 12 and 17 km respectively these are significantly larger than in aviso as shown by the red solid line in fig 7b wang et al 2004 clearly showed the strong southwest winds in july and august fig 1 accompanying the rainy season the onset of the scs summer monsoon is generally accompanied by an increase of convective activity and even the genesis of tropical cyclones over this region choi et al 2016 wang et al 2012 da reduces the overestimation of anticyclone radii from 8 3 km to 4 5 km on average corresponding to an ir e of 5 4 by eq 5 looking at august alone the radii overestimation is reduced from 17 km to 11 km with ir e increased to 9 5 the improvement is large by comparison to the difficulties encountered in ocean modeling for simulating eddies in winther et al 2007 see their fig 7 it was shown that a doubling of the model horizontal resolution from 4 to 2 km changed the typical eddy radius by about 5 km in an area the norwegian trench where the observed radius is 60 km to further examine the impact of assimilation on eddy geometry histograms of the simulated eddy radii in the nscs are superimposed on those of observations in fig 8 in the free run the cyclonic eddies of radii 55 80 km are underestimated but those with radii larger than 80 km are too numerous da increases the occurrence of eddies with radii 55 70 km too much it reduces the overestimations of large eddies of radii larger than 80 km for anticyclones large eddies 80 km are over represented in the free run and the occurrence of small eddies 75 km is too low the degree of improvement yielded by data assimilation varies for eddies of different sizes excesses in large eddies 105 120 km are well constrained yielding good agreement with aviso excesses in eddies of 85 105 km are reduced resulting in moderate improvement there is no noticeable improvement in the excesses of small eddies 70 km it suggests the da constrains more efficiently large anticyclones than small ones this point is consistent with the improvement of the radius seasonal cycle in fig 5f in addition we notice that the seasonal cycle of occurrences of anticyclonic eddies see fig 5c is specifically challenging to reproduce in january and december moreover the small anticyclonic eddies less than 70 km mostly appear in winter months as shown in the radius seasonal cycle in fig 5f it further indicates that small anticyclonic eddies in winter should particularly be improved 4 4 winter eddy tracks considering now the winter conditions fig 9 shows eddy trajectories and their last centers in the months of december and january separating cyclones from anticyclones in the scs during all 19 years the 178 tracks of cyclonic eddies in aviso reveal three main clusters along the nscs continental slope from the southwest of taiwan west of luzon island separated into two subclusters around 18 n and 13 n and east of vietnam also separated into three subclusters from north to south around 14 n 10 n and 6 n respectively the distributions of these dense tracks agree well with the main cyclonic eddy corridors shown in figure 6 of du et al 2016 in the free run the 145 simulated eddies are too dense east of vietnam both for the northern and southern subclusters but almost no tracks originate from the west of mindoro island at 13 n through da the increased number of simulated eddies of 169 agrees better with that from aviso and also the eddy distributions are improved for example the two sub clusters at 14 n and 10 n are better separated east of vietnam this is also confirmed by the strength and relative position of the two main negative mean sla centers shown in fig 10 fig 10 also reveals a negative sla center close to mindoro island at 13 n which is only visible in satellite data but not in the model runs it shows that the model cannot generate these local cyclonic eddies furthermore it is worth mentioning that the same limit has been identified here in summer months but for anticyclonic eddies shown in the bottom panels of fig 6 pullen et al 2008 attributed the eddies in the southeast quadrant of the scs to intensified wind jets and wakes in the lee of mindoro and luzon islands focusing on the generation of winter eddies wang et al 2008 found abundant eddies in the eastern basin but only if the wind resolves the orographic effects of local wind jets in this respect the wind forcing from era i has too coarse a resolution 80 km to resolve properly the local orographic effects at 13 n close to the mountainous mindoro island for anticyclones the eddy tracks in aviso see fig 9 are separated into three well defined clusters 1 along the continental slope extending southwestward from the west of luzon strait 2 east of vietnam at 13 n and 3 to the southeast of macclesfield bank mb and west of luzon island these dense eddy clusters agree with the first two anticyclones corridors in figure 3 of du et al 2016 the northern anticyclone corridor seems to dissipate near paracel island pi in the assim run the corridor 2 in du et al 2016 extends from west of luzon island to east of vietnam at 14 n which corresponds to the two other clusters in the middle of the scs basin although da does not increase the number of tracks it removes the eddies close to palawan island this indicates that the generation mechanisms of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies at 13 n are triggered by different local mechanisms in winter contrary to our expectations the sparse eddy tracks near the vietnamese coastline but outside of the three aforementioned clusters have been removed in assim this points to eddy genesis being underestimated through assimilation along the coast of vietnam the high positive mean sla fig 10 reflects the accumulation of seawater by the northeast monsoon even after the assimilation of altimetry data the sla gradient remains too close to the coast of vietnam compared to satellite data one likely explanation would be a too strong wind near the coast of vietnam strong southerly winds lead to cyclonic eddy generation and sustain them for long due to the wind stress curl e g metzger 2003 wang et al 2008 moreover strong easterly winds establish prevailing cyclonic wind stress curl and reduce the area where anticyclonic eddies can be generated and maintained 5 discussion and conclusions since the early 2000s altimetry data have been routinely assimilated into regional and global ocean forecast models to improve the eddy forecasts however little documentation of the accuracy of eddy characteristics has been produced even less so in a regional sea like the scs even though our experiments have been conducted in reanalysis mode the eddy characteristics evaluated here are useful as an upper limit of the eddy prediction skill one would expect in a general ocean operational forecast model the novelty of this study is thus to evaluate the reproduction of the scs eddies characteristics by assimilation of altimetry data alone given the simple design of evaluating the basic eddy characteristics on a common horizontal grid we are confident that the method is applicable to the output of operational forecasting centers the robust performance of our system over 19 years should also provide a valuable benchmark to track the scs eddies objectively a combined geometric and dynamical algorithm has been applied to satellite data and model runs it was found satisfactory in that the temperature vertical profiles could confirm the presence of eddies but still suffers from uncertainties in the choices of a few parameters considering both cyclones and anticyclones data assimilation of altimeter data leads to an ir e of 11 9 for the eddy generation in the whole scs the reproduction for cyclones is 10 3 slightly lower than for anticyclones this is partially related to anticyclones being more under represented than cyclones in the free run see fig 7b regional variations of eddy reproduction are more important than the asymmetry cyclones anticyclones the benefits are more obvious in the eddy rich nscs 10 n with an ir e of 17 9 and 19 6 for cyclones and anticyclones respectively the opposite seasonal cycles of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy frequencies are too weak in the free run but can be well remediated by data assimilation the eddy sizes are slightly exaggerated in the free run especially for anticyclones during the summer months radii 17 km too large it could partially explain the reasons why the vertical structure of eddies in the free run did not agree with observations even though assimilation shrinks the eddies as expected anticyclones remain too large in the summer months histograms of eddy radii show that assimilation corrects well for cyclonic eddies and large anticyclonic eddies but not anticyclonic eddies smaller than 70 km in radius seasonal differences indicate that the origin of the mismatch either lies in the forcing fields or the kuroshio intrusion rather than the numerical schemes of the model seasonal influences could either be caused by the intrusion of the kuroshio current chow et al 2008 or a bias in the summer monsoon winds which seems the most likely cause since the simulated anticyclonic eddies are more realistic near luzon strait than in the center of the basin in the winter december and january cyclones are generally reproducible where the satellite data show higher density especially east of vietnam this is further improved by data assimilation however at 13 n the cyclonic eddies near the philippines are captured by neither the free nor the assimilation run using higher resolution atmospheric forcings 8 km pullen et al 2008 conclude that intensified wind jets and wakes in the lee of luzon island induce eddy generation in january 2005 which seems to be a missing mechanism and a bias in the coarse resolution forcing fields used here this concurs with the requirement of finely resolved wind forcing in wang et al 2008 understanding the impact of atmospheric forcing on the scs eddy reproduction requires comparative experiments and is outside of our present scope a limitation of this study is the coarse horizontal resolution of the era i forcing in the enoi used here the background covariances depend on a historical model run that used the coarse wind forcings which therefore indirectly limits the assimilation this limitation can be mitigated in an enkf using perturbations of the winds because the intensity of the perturbations can be set so that they represent the winds deficiencies however running ensemble simulations is more expensive than running a model once using forcings of higher resolution if they are available future studies will therefore implement a higher resolution reanalysis such as the fifth generation of ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis era5 hoffmann et al 2019 to better represent the orographic effects on the winds besides this understanding needs to be further verified in the prediction of real eddy trajectories within a longer time along with the use of an operational atmosphere forecast for anticyclones both the excess of eddies close to palawan island and the deficiency of eddies north of rt are corrected by da however assimilation fails to address several missed eddies around the south corridor at 13 n du et al 2016 the main reason seems to be a too strong zonal component of the northeast monsoon as revealed by the too sharp sla gradient along the vietnam coast shown in fig 10 a resulting practical recommendation for the eddy reproductions is therefore the use of bias corrected wind forcing with a resolution high enough to represent the fine orographic effects of the philippines 8 km as in pullen et al 2008 recently era5 has been accessible through the website https cds climate copernicuse eu cdsapp home compared to the era i fields its higher resolutions in space 30 km and time hourly allows a better representation of tropical cyclones gravity waves and other meso to synoptic scale features hennermann and giusti 2020 it is reasonable to believe that the era5 or other high resolution datasets would be able to further improve the eddy reproduction in the future the above eddy track metrics can be applied to any forecasting system in which data are publicly available and can be compared to satellite altimeter maps operational users of eddy forecasts can then determine the expected level of accuracy by area of interest and by season and rely on the demonstrated temporal stability of these statistics in 19 years neither the model resolution its lateral boundary conditions nor the data assimilation scheme appeared as limiting factors in the performance the eddy reproduction examples provided here are restricted to the position of eddy center number and radius many more features could describe in more detail eddy structure and cyclogenesis length the direction of the tracks the evolution of tracers dissipation among others but these would be more sensitive to the atmospheric forcing and the uncertainties in the eddy tracking algorithm credit

23941,from satellite altimetry it is known the benefit of assimilating sea level anomalies sla has been shown in the context of operational ocean forecast systems however how much data assimilation da of altimetry data improves the representation of mesoscale eddies has still not been investigated in previous studies especially in the south china sea scs no estimation for that has been done in a long time in this study a nested scs model system uses the ensemble optimal interpolation method to assimilate along track sla data from 1993 to 2011 we assess the representation of eddy characteristics in two hindcast simulations one with da and the other without and compare them to satellite derived eddy characteristics in the whole scs the assimilation improves the number of simulated cyclonic anticyclonic eddies by 10 3 13 6 the corresponding improvement in the eddy rich northern scs is 17 9 19 6 assimilation improves the seasonality of eddy occurrence with cyclones and anticyclones showing an obviously asymmetric seasonality however diagnosed assimilation effects and associated residual errors show large spatial and temporal dependencies the radii of anticyclonic eddies smaller than 70 km are not changed with da the results show that deficiencies of cyclonic eddies in winter and anticyclonic eddies in summer around 13 n in the southeastern scs are not well corrected by da where one of the shortcomings resulted from the used wind forcing although this study does not conduct one to one forecasting experiments for each eddy track improved eddy reproduction is the first step towards detailed validation metrics for eddy forecasting systems keywords mesoscale eddy reproduction data assimilation south china sea altimeter sea level anomalies 1 introduction ocean mesoscale eddies are stable closed circulation features found over almost the entire global oceans and acting over time scales ranging from a few days to more than a hundred days they are characterized by their strong kinetic energy more than ten times the background mean kinetic energy richardson 1983 chelton et al 2007 eddies generally propagate westward at a phase speed close to that of baroclinic rossby waves chelton et al 2007 early et al 2011 typical mesoscale eddies are horizontally symmetrical vortices with radii ranging from 50 km to 500 km they are regarded as the ocean weather that stirs the stratified ocean le traon and dibarboure 1999 li and pohlmann 2002 halo et al 2014 and facilitates the exchange of properties between different water masses wunsch 2008 dufois et al 2016 the south china sea scs is a semi enclosed marginal sea having only one main connection to the western pacific through luzon strait its circulation relatively independent from the tropical ocean circulation is mainly driven by the alternating northeast and southwest monsoon winds in winter and summer respectively qu 2000 metzger 2003 gan et al 2006 however the kuroshio intrusion combined with complex local topographic steering directly affects the ocean circulation through luzon strait resulting in mesoscale eddies easily spreading into the northern scs nscs wang et al 2003 chow et al 2008 chen et al 2012 eddy genesis mechanisms have been related to the wind stress curl ring shedding from the kuroshio frontal instability related to the kuroshio intrusion and orographic wind jets wu and chiang 2007 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 numerical simulations of eddies rely strongly on high quality atmospheric forcing boundary transports and ocean initial state numerous cases of improvements in simulations or forecasts of specific eddies due to data assimilation have been reported e g wu and chiang 2007 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2019 however no studies quantitatively evaluate the extent to which the predicted eddies and their trajectories over a long time are attributed to data assimilation da except for a few cases under ocean reanalysis frameworks this may be a result of the intrinsic chaotic nonlinear dynamics involved and practical limits in accurately characterizing real eddies and their tracks in a two years assimilation experiment de vos et al 2018 noted a generally positive impact of assimilating along track sea level anomaly sla on simulated eddy characteristics in the agulhas current system based on an eddy resolving ocean reanalysis pilo et al 2018 found the model s response to da distorts the eddies and were cautious about interpreting their results because the adjusted vertical advection terms are about 1 5 times larger after assimilation this issue is hopefully irrelevant in the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian coordinates model used for this study which represents vertical velocities by vertical displacements of material coordinates smoothed by the model the growth of the satellite altimeter constellation to a mature state has enabled statistics of eddy trajectories by various automatic eddy detection algorithms to be determined e g penven et al 2005 chelton et al 2007 souza et al 2011 faghmous et al 2015 previous efforts to document scs eddies by manual detection from altimetry have been made wang et al 2003 chen et al 2011 du et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 however there are only a few attempts to evaluate automatically simulations of eddy trajectories against satellite altimeter products in the scs this is asserted to be valuable in the context of the scs serving as a useful example for other semi enclosed marginal seas xiu et al 2010 give a census of long lived eddies 30 days in the scs during 1993 2007 they first validate a regional ocean model system roms simulation of eddies against merged weekly sla maps from archiving validation and interpolation of satellite oceanographic data aviso now available through cmems copernicus marine environmental monitoring services neglecting eddies in waters shallower than 1000 m they counted 32 8 3 4 eddies in satellite maps each year with 53 of them being cyclonic and 70 of these having radii smaller than 100 km zhu et al 2016 contrast eddies originating from a global and a regional forecast system to a daily 1 4 deg resolution satellite sla data product in 2012 for eddies with lifetimes longer than 28 days they found 24 47 and 24 eddies in altimeter data global and regional forecast systems respectively but the spatial distributions of eddies origins their figure 12 uncover large differences between the different forecasting systems further all the above studies disregard eddies with lifetimes between 10 days and 28 days since these account for over 50 of all eddies referred to as short lived in chen and han 2019 they are an important component of the ocean s dynamic variability due to various technical reasons in situ profiles of temperature and salinity are notably poor and intermittent in the scs for instance yearly in situ profiles in 2004 2007 are fewer than 500 as shown in fig 4b of zeng et al 2016 this further highlights the important role of assimilating altimeter data in representing mesoscale eddy activity in the scs and the importance of multivariate corrections by da an eddy resolving numerical model such as the one used in this study should in principle reproduce the statistics of eddy activity but not the timing of the chaotic events during its lifetime genesis motions decay merging although data assimilation experiments in the scs do show the benefits of altimeter data for reducing errors in sla e g xie et al 2011 lyu et al 2014 the extent to which reproduced eddies are attributable to da has not yet been addressed two initial challenges arise from sensitivities to the selection of parameters used in the eddy tracking process as well as to differing spatial resolutions between the models and altimetry data this has a bearing on the fair comparison of the performance of the different products to understand the role of da on simulated ocean mesoscale variability cipollone et al 2017 compared eddy statistics of a global ocean reanalysis a free ocean simulation and an observation based dataset on a common 1 4 horizontal grid they concluded that da enhances the mesoscale variability of some features which cannot be well reproduced in the free running model another challenge is to select appropriate eddy characteristics for evaluation which is both useful and available from long time series of observations in general data assimilation techniques also assume the model to be bias free if this is the case they should effectively constrain eddy lifecycles but residual errors can be higher with model biases which may be stronger in certain locations or during certain seasons biases may arise from various reasons for example due to numerical schemes backeberg et al 2009 biases in the forcing fields or errors in the bottom topography the ensemble optimal interpolation method enoi oke et al 2002 has been applied to assimilate sla data in different ocean operational forecast centers e g oke et al 2008 lyu et al 2014 tanajura et al 2014 and has proven able to improve forecasts of mesoscale eddies and fronts backeberg et al 2014 counillon and bertino 2009 oke et al 2008 other da methods relying on static ensembles are used in several operational centers tonani et al 2015 and references therein in this study applying the enoi method we only assimilate along track altimetry data weekly into a nested eddy resolving scs ocean model the da system is used in hindcast mode with the model forced by reanalyzed winds rather than in real time prediction as such higher performance than might be achieved by operational forecast modes can be expected based on the diagnostic evaluation of two model runs without and with da its effects are quantified in terms of the basic eddy characteristics such as eddy centroids and radii as a pilot study this evaluation initially highlights their geographic and seasonal variations disregarding the irregular shapes of the eddies and neglecting the eddy distance error mechanism analysis related to the eddies cyclogenesis and propagation speeds has not been pursued in this study 2 data and the scs assimilation system 2 1 altimetry data for assimilation and evaluation the delayed time dt along track sea level anomaly tsla data were produced data unification and altimeter combination system duacs and released by aviso http www aviso oceanobs com to assimilate a fine resolution of tsla equivalent to the model resolution the unfiltered tsla product of duacs dt2014 is used with a 7 km horizontal resolution along track pujol et al 2016 nowadays another similar tsla product but with a lower resolution 14 km is available through the cmems portal product id sealevel glo phy l3 rep observations 008 045 several altimeters have flown during the experimental period namely ers 1 1992 1996 topex poseidon 1992 2002 ers 2 1995 2011 gfo 2000 2008 envisat 2002 2011 and jason 1 2 2002 2011 measurements potentially polluted by land data and unresolved coastal processes are removed only sla measurements located both in water deeper than 200 m and further than 50 km from the coast are assimilated eddy tracking algorithms however do not work on along track data gridded sla data created by merging the along track data based on an objective analysis le traon and dibarboure 1999 are required due to the increase of temporal resolution from weekly to daily the gridded sla data with 1 4 spatial resolution allows for robust tracking of eddy movement dibarboure et al 2011 pujol and mertz 2019 the used dt product of merged sla data is accessible through the cmems portal product id sealevel glo sla map l4 rep observations 008 027 this data source clearly not independent from the assimilated along track data is used for eddy tracking but not data assimilation 2 2 implementation of the data assimilation system a nested ocean model system was built in the complex topographic domain of the scs xie et al 2015 2018 based on version 2 2 of the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom see chassignet et al 2009 with a homogeneous 5 km horizontal resolution the inner model covers the whole scs basin including the gulf of thailand the sulu sea and the java sea and the pacific side of luzon strait in the vertical the model has 30 hybrid layers defined by target potential densities ranging from 0 1 to 27 84 in which the top 5 layers are imposed on z coordinates starting by 3 m thickness and increasing gradually with the same vertical hybrid layers the outer model covers the indian and pacific oceans as shown fig 1 in xie et al 2018 by a coarse resolution about 37 km which one way feeds the inner model with the lateral boundary conditions further details about the model setup are given in xie et al 2015 the inner model has been integrated without data assimilation driven by the 6 hourly atmospheric forcing from era interim era i simmons et al 2007 without tidal forcing during the period 1992 2007 to prepare the background error covariance matrix for assimilation snapshots of the model state have been stored every 10 days into a historical dataset used as an ensemble by the enoi data assimilation e g counillon and bertino 2009 in the sequential assimilation method the optimized model state as the vector x a is calculated by 1 x a x f k y h x f where y is the observations in a previous time window h is the observation operator and the vector x f represents the model forecast state the innovation between the model forecast and the observation is expressed by the term in brackets which is fed back to the analysis with a linear weight determined by the matrix array k namely kalman gain to represent the mesoscale ocean circulation the tsla high frequency tidal signals are filtered off before being delivered to users in the scs xie et al 2011 proposed a practical modification of the enoi scheme to constrain the mesoscale ocean circulations without interference from the tidal signal and demonstrated it over a period of two years the kalman gain k is simply expressed as follows 2 k a h a t h a h a t n 1 α r 1 where a is composed of the n model states from the historical simulations the matrix a is a centered ensemble the r in the brackets of eq 2 is the observation error matrix the assimilation parameter α is 0 8 which was tuned at the beginning of the assimilation to be built the data assimilation is applied every week to obtain almost a uniform coverage of the model domain by satellite tracks no temporal smoothing is applied to the assimilation increments in this system the enoi method used is derived from the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 and simplified using a static ensemble to approximate the multivariate model background error covariance bec since the decadal variability represented by the historical ensemble has wide spatial scales of little relevance for data assimilation every week the assimilation is used locally selecting only neighboring observations even with o 100 members ensemble covariance contains large spurious correlations that are larger than the signal a common approach is to assimilate data locally and tapper the innovation and observation error as a function of distance to limit discontinuity we have tuned the localization radius to 150 km for best qualitative performance compared to the model built in xie et al 2011 the present scs model uses the same method but has been upgraded to a higher resolution from 10 km to 5 km this resolution is considered eddy resolving and should in principle suffice for the purpose of eddy forecasting every week the tsla data collected in the 7 days before the assimilation time are assimilated then the model restarts from the corrected state and is integrated forward using the atmosphere forcing the model produces daily averages in the following week this reanalysis cycle has been repeated from october 1992 until the end of 2011 apart from the use of reanalysis atmospheric forcing and the quality checks of input data the data assimilation schedule is identical to an operational forecast system the daily outputs from two parallel model runs without and with the assimilation of tsla are subsequently named free and assim respectively these sla fields in the 19 years from 1993 to 2011 are compared against the gridded sla product from aviso in fig 1 on average the rms errors for sla in the nscs basin decrease by 3 1 cm a reduction of 28 2 due to data assimilation reaching a very stable error level of 8 cm throughout the assimilation experiment such sla errors are on par with other eddy resolving model systems e g xu et al 2019 3 automatic eddy track detection and validation 3 1 automatic eddy detection and tracking procedure using closed contours of sla from satellite maps wang et al 2003 identify scs eddies with a lifetime longer than 30 days and in depths deeper than 1000 m they find 58 anticyclonic eddies and 28 cyclonic eddies during the years of 1993 2000 in automatic detection methods the okubo weiss parameter okubo 1970 weiss 1991 is one of the most widespread tools to treat both satellite data and numerical model results it is defined as 3 w s n 2 s s 2 ζ 2 where s n u x v y is the normal component of the strain tensor s s v x u y is the shear component whilst ζ is the relative vorticity of the flow for altimeter data the geostrophic velocity field u v is derived from gradients of the sla maps the okubo weissparameter w characterizes the flow field either as vorticity dominated w 0 or strain dominated w 0 the criteria of closed sla loops and negative ow parameter are applied to detect the eddy deformation automatically the detection algorithm used in this study combines geometric and dynamical detection criteria and has proven robust in previous studies du et al 2016 halo et al 2014 then the eddy tracking algorithm follows the methodology used by penven et al 2005 also successfully implemented in the scs xiu et al 2010 chen et al 2011 du et al 2016 consequently the final criteria for detecting and tracking the eddies in the scs are mainly followed i w 2e 12 s 2 for detecting eddy central areas following chelton et al 2007 ii only the sla maxima or minima within the central areas are identified as eddy centers iii the closed contour of sla has an interval of 2 cm and the maximum radius of the closed contour is 400 km to avoid defining a whole ocean gyre as a giant eddy iv eddies centers located in water shallower than 100 m are discarded v the maximum permissible drift velocity of eddy is 0 5 m s 1 other eddy detection approaches have been proposed based on geometric criteria faghmous et al 2015 search for a relative sla extreme in a neighboring sub grid the global daily eddy dataset faghmous et al 2016 has been released on https datadryad org stash dataset and is used for a general validation of the eddy detection procedure in this study 3 2 validation of the detected eddies to avoid sporadic eddy events at the detection limit of the aviso product we only consider eddies in which radii are larger than 40 km lifetimes longer than 10 days and amplitudes larger than 3 cm to avoid uncertainties resulting from the eddy tracking algorithm applied at different spatial resolutions all daily sla data from two model runs are interpolated onto the coarser grid used in the aviso product with 1 4 horizontal resolution note that this resolution is still high enough to preserve model eddies because the numerical model effective resolution is always about four times coarser than the grid resolution afterward interpolated fields are fed to the automatic detection and tracking procedure to obtain model simulated eddy properties that are then compared to the satellite the same coarsening strategy was applied by cipollone et al 2017 to compute eddy statistics in a global ocean eddy permitting numerical model fig 2 shows an example of all detected eddies with lifetimes longer than 10 days from aviso free and assim on the 4th of july 2007 the overestimations of small eddies appearing at the nscs in the free run are corrected by da beside the anticyclonic eddy a0 located off the coast of vietnam there are three anticyclonic eddies close to 18 n named as a1 a2 and a3 as in nan et al 2011 the eddy a1 is discernible although not detected by the algorithm referring to the eddy dataset of faghmous et al 2016 on the same day the anticyclone a0 is also detected but removed due to a shorter lifetime or a smaller radius compared to the eddies in the free run the eddies a2 and a3 in assim agree better with the eddy location and drift from the satellite derived eddies besides compared to the eddies in altimeter data four cyclonic eddies occur in the middle of the scs basin in assim some of them also appear in the eddy dataset of faghmous et al 2016 but would not if considering those eddies lasting longer than 10 days or having radii larger than 50 km this highlights the sensitivity of eddy detection and tracking to the configuration settings of the algorithm in the agulhas current system de vos et al 2018 found that the predefined maximum propagation velocity is the most sensitive parameter in the eddy detection scheme visual inspection of a few examples not shown revealed neither false positive nor missed eddies consequently in this study we prefer to focus on the most basic properties to characterize the scs eddy activities no further tuning of this parameter nor comparisons with other automatic detection schemes were therefore undertaken whilst no eddy detection and tracking system is perfect interpolating results in a common grid and maintaining the same algorithm settings help to ensure the fairest practical comparison to identify whether the vertical water mass is consistent with the eddies or not the in situ profiles around the eddy centers are investigated based on the met office hadley centre en dataset with global quality control good et al 2013 in the scs basin 10 22 n 110 120 e there are 12305 temperature profiles during the 19 years extracted from en4 the latest version of en 4 2 1 at https www metoffice gov uk hadobs en4 data en4 2 1 we only retain profiles in waters deeper than 100 m to avoid coastal areas a matchup is counted when it coincides temporally with the detected eddy same day and is located no further than half the detected eddy s radius from its center following raj et al 2016 fig 3 shows the en4 profiles collocated with cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies detected from altimeter data free and assim respectively the maximal temperature difference of 4 9 c in the left panel clearly shows the effect of upwelling and downwelling dynamics of the eddies which independently suggests that the automatic detection and tracking approach works very well here in assim the two types of temperature profiles exhibit a similar temperature contrast the maximum is 3 7 c and the mean difference is 1 6 c in the upper 800 m compared with the profiles in the free run in which eddies are randomly located the tsla assimilation improves the water stratification near the eddy centers thanks to the multivariate properties of our data assimilation scheme 4 results having verified the expected effect of da on the location and vertical structure of eddies their detailed characteristics are investigated here we focus on the eddies whose centers once appeared in the deep basin 100 m of the scs domain 105 120 5 e 2 22 5 n the main expected eddy hotspots follow the continental slopes from the northwest of luzon strait to the coast of vietnam until 6 n another eddy hotspot 70 eddy days resides northwest of luzon island and is known as the west luzon eddy qu 2000 lin et al 2016 to evaluate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the simulated eddies after data assimilation we define a loss rate regarding that detected from satellite observations as follows 4 r m p o p m p o 100 where p represents the evaluated property number of eddies or average radius all positive values the superscripts of o and m represent the observed and the model forecast respectively the value of r m represents a relative deviation and the subscript m can be replaced by f and a for the free and assim runs the effect of data assimilation is measured by the increment of absolute loss rates of r a and r f 5 i r e r f r a eq 5 measures the improvement of reproduction for eddies ir e through da to be evaluated in different regions and periods where the free simulation suffers from inherent biases due to forcing fields bottom topography and numerics etc its loss rate r f should remain rather high in places and times where the errors are due to random effects and chaotic dynamics and might thereby be reasonably constrained the assimilation is expected to work well it would result in a decreased loss rate thus a positive ir e on the contrary the reproduction should remain very small or negative 4 1 overall evaluation in the whole scs we first consider the entire scs basin to the west of 120 5 e in for the whole 19 years 1822 1286 and 1502 eddies have been detected from aviso the free and assim respectively according to the criteria in section 3 1 taking the end positions of the eddy centers the counts of observed and simulated eddies are shown as a function of latitude in the left column of fig 4 in the top panel the presented eddies in the scs both cyclonic and anticyclonic densely reside between 12 n and 20 n both in the satellite and in the two model runs two peaks of eddy counts 180 appear clearly at 18 n and 14 n in satellite data the two peaks are visible in both model runs but the peaks are lower and their latitudes shifted especially for the free run the peak around 18 n can be linked to the eddies generated through the luzon strait propagating along the continental slope and those arising to the northwest of the luzon island they correspond to the major eddy corridors described in du et al 2016 the peak at 14 n reflects the eddies concentrating east of vietnam and southwest of luzon island similarly to the corridors in figures 3 and 6 of du et al 2016 in total the model tends to miss several eddies considering cyclones and anticyclones altogether although the assimilation of satellite data decreases the number of missed eddies from 536 to 319 this corresponds to a reduction of loss rate eq 4 from 29 4 to 17 5 in a shorter period of 1993 2007 xiu et al 2010 tracked about 32 9 32 8 eddies from the model satellite data per year of which about 52 were cyclonic in this study setting a shorter lifetime limit 10 days rather than 28 days more than twice as many eddies have been detected see fig 4 right but the fraction of cyclonic eddies tracked from satellites remain the same 52 taking cyclones only shown in the middle panel there are 948 750 and 848 eddies tracked in aviso free and assim respectively thanks to assimilation the number of missing eddies reduces from 198 to 100 during the 19 years corresponding to 10 3 of ir e in the whole scs basin the underestimation in the free run compared to aviso is consistent from 9 n until 22 n this is well corrected in assim except for a degradation around 17 n for anticyclones bottom panel the eddies in free are mostly underestimated in assim the eddies located at 13 n 16 n and 18 n 20 n are significantly improved and close to the observations on average the ir e for anticyclones is about 13 6 due to data assimilation in the whole scs it is higher than for cyclonic eddies which indicates that anticyclonic eddies gain a little more benefit from data assimilation in the scs this is visible in fig 6 on the other hand anticyclonic eddies south of 13 n are hardly improved relative to the free run which shows that the efficacy of data assimilation is confined to the nscs for anticyclonic eddies in the next section we highlight the ir e evolution to the north of 10 n 4 2 interannual and seasonal eddy variability in the northern scs in the sector of the nscs between 109 e and 120 e the yearly eddies occurred in the free and assim runs are counted in the right column of fig 4 the counts in aviso vary between 78 and 103 eddies without any obvious temporal trend the free run eddies are consistently underestimated between 50 and 76 per year in assim the number of eddies is larger varying from 66 to 95 the ir e of the yearly eddy occurrences is about 18 7 in the nscs for the tsla assimilation the interannual variations of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are shown in the middle and bottom panels respectively in the right column of fig 4 the cyclonic eddies in the free run are equally underestimated in most years and data assimilation improves the eddy occurrences very close to the observations for most years the annual mean of cyclonic eddies is 47 5 35 1 and 43 6 from aviso free and assim respectively corresponding to an ir e of 17 9 by da for anticyclonic eddies the underestimation in the free run is even stronger than for cyclones consistently for all 19 years through assimilation the number of anticyclonic eddies increases and agrees better with the observations the ir e climbs to about 19 6 which is probably related to the free run tendency to favor cyclonic eddies over anticyclones while the interannual variability of the eddies was relativelymarginal the seasonal variability of eddies is more visible in fig 5 the left column compares the number of accumulated eddies per month in aviso free and assim the sum of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies does not exhibit a seasonal cycle neither in the models nor in observations as indicated by fig 5a for cyclones however shown in the middle panel the observations show a marked seasonality from fewer than 60 eddies in summer months to more than 90 in october and november the seasonal variability of cyclones anticyclones in aviso is about 18 9 21 1 as indicated by the standard deviations in fig 5b fig 5c wu and chiang 2007 attributed the higher frequency of cyclonic eddies in winter to the seasonal variability of the kuroshio intrusion however the seasonality is weaker in the free run and partially retrieved in the assim run for anticyclones a reverse seasonality is found in observations fig 5c which is qualitatively consistent with the findings in table 1 of wang et al 2003 the anticyclonic eddies in the free run also show too weak a seasonality which also improves with assimilation the opposite seasonal cycles of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are discussed by liu et al 2001 pointing out two factors the surface wind curl and the baroclinic rossby waves as eddy generation mechanisms chassignet and xu 2017 also indicate that the inclusion of sub mesoscale effects does improve the seasonal cycle of mesoscale activity in the gulf stream in july and august of the 19 years eddies living longer than 10 days and their tracks from aviso and the two model runs are contrasted in fig 6 cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are shown in the upper and bottom panels respectively the numbers of cyclonic eddies from aviso free and assim are 116 103 and 106 respectively and their tracks are similarly scattered to the north of 6 n the number of anticyclonic eddies in the three datasets is 188 107 and 144 respectively giving an ir e eq 5 significantly higher than the above ir e of 13 6 in general compared to the anticyclonic eddies in free obvious improvements are noticeable for the eddy tracks in assim for instance there are more eddy tracks around 14 n in the middle of the scs basin to the east of vietnam the eddy tracks are more numerous and concentrated around 10 n besides two underestimations of eddy occurrences should be noted in fig 6 around 6 n south of vietnam and around 13 n near mindoro island in the philippines fig 5 also shows that the assim run does not increase the number of anticyclonic eddies in january and december indicating that the assimilation effect has a seasonal dependence 4 3 eddy radii the radii of ocean eddies are essential properties related to the eddy form associated with the first baroclinic deformation scale chelton et al 2007 kawaguchi et al 2012 as described by kawaguchi et al 2012 an eddy with a 30 km radius rotates as a solid body in its inner 15 km it specifically indicates how wide the extent of water mass exchange is incurred by the vortex significantly different from that of the mean flow the eddy size influences the strength of ekman pumping and as a consequence it is important for background general circulations for example seasonal variations of the radii over the 19 years are shown in the right column of fig 5 considering cyclones and anticyclones together in the top panel eddy radii in aviso are smaller than in the models for all months with a mean radius of 70 km and no obvious seasonal variability 1 2 km anticyclones are only slightly larger than cyclones by less than 2 km to quantify the significance of this difference we calculate the monthly standard deviations of the eddy radius in the observed sla data ignoring the change of radius within each eddy track the standard deviations of all cyclones and anticyclones radii are shown month by month in fig 7a the radius standard deviations in free are much larger than others and those in assim slightly larger than in aviso the difference of radii is then evaluated by comparison with the standard deviations of the sampled radii from aviso by application of cohen s d cohen 1988 the difference between the two means of eddy radius is expressed in units of the standard deviations in two scored groups as follows 6 d m 1 m 2 σ where m 1 and m 2 represent two mean radii from two datasets σ is the pooled standard deviation of both groups cohen 1988 qualifies d value below 0 2 as small 0 5 medium and above 8 large the standard deviation of the eddies radius in aviso is 10 7 km on average for all years as shown in the top panel according to cohen s d the 2 km difference mentioned above for the eddies in aviso is small the cyclones radii are slightly overestimated in the free run by 3 km all year round this is reduced in the assim run to 1 km also consistently all year round except in may and september during the seasonal transition of prevailing winds the related cohen s d shown as blue lines in fig 7b confirms that the change of radius of cyclones between the two model runs is insignificant for anticyclones the eddy radii in free are overestimated especially in july and august by more than 12 and 17 km respectively these are significantly larger than in aviso as shown by the red solid line in fig 7b wang et al 2004 clearly showed the strong southwest winds in july and august fig 1 accompanying the rainy season the onset of the scs summer monsoon is generally accompanied by an increase of convective activity and even the genesis of tropical cyclones over this region choi et al 2016 wang et al 2012 da reduces the overestimation of anticyclone radii from 8 3 km to 4 5 km on average corresponding to an ir e of 5 4 by eq 5 looking at august alone the radii overestimation is reduced from 17 km to 11 km with ir e increased to 9 5 the improvement is large by comparison to the difficulties encountered in ocean modeling for simulating eddies in winther et al 2007 see their fig 7 it was shown that a doubling of the model horizontal resolution from 4 to 2 km changed the typical eddy radius by about 5 km in an area the norwegian trench where the observed radius is 60 km to further examine the impact of assimilation on eddy geometry histograms of the simulated eddy radii in the nscs are superimposed on those of observations in fig 8 in the free run the cyclonic eddies of radii 55 80 km are underestimated but those with radii larger than 80 km are too numerous da increases the occurrence of eddies with radii 55 70 km too much it reduces the overestimations of large eddies of radii larger than 80 km for anticyclones large eddies 80 km are over represented in the free run and the occurrence of small eddies 75 km is too low the degree of improvement yielded by data assimilation varies for eddies of different sizes excesses in large eddies 105 120 km are well constrained yielding good agreement with aviso excesses in eddies of 85 105 km are reduced resulting in moderate improvement there is no noticeable improvement in the excesses of small eddies 70 km it suggests the da constrains more efficiently large anticyclones than small ones this point is consistent with the improvement of the radius seasonal cycle in fig 5f in addition we notice that the seasonal cycle of occurrences of anticyclonic eddies see fig 5c is specifically challenging to reproduce in january and december moreover the small anticyclonic eddies less than 70 km mostly appear in winter months as shown in the radius seasonal cycle in fig 5f it further indicates that small anticyclonic eddies in winter should particularly be improved 4 4 winter eddy tracks considering now the winter conditions fig 9 shows eddy trajectories and their last centers in the months of december and january separating cyclones from anticyclones in the scs during all 19 years the 178 tracks of cyclonic eddies in aviso reveal three main clusters along the nscs continental slope from the southwest of taiwan west of luzon island separated into two subclusters around 18 n and 13 n and east of vietnam also separated into three subclusters from north to south around 14 n 10 n and 6 n respectively the distributions of these dense tracks agree well with the main cyclonic eddy corridors shown in figure 6 of du et al 2016 in the free run the 145 simulated eddies are too dense east of vietnam both for the northern and southern subclusters but almost no tracks originate from the west of mindoro island at 13 n through da the increased number of simulated eddies of 169 agrees better with that from aviso and also the eddy distributions are improved for example the two sub clusters at 14 n and 10 n are better separated east of vietnam this is also confirmed by the strength and relative position of the two main negative mean sla centers shown in fig 10 fig 10 also reveals a negative sla center close to mindoro island at 13 n which is only visible in satellite data but not in the model runs it shows that the model cannot generate these local cyclonic eddies furthermore it is worth mentioning that the same limit has been identified here in summer months but for anticyclonic eddies shown in the bottom panels of fig 6 pullen et al 2008 attributed the eddies in the southeast quadrant of the scs to intensified wind jets and wakes in the lee of mindoro and luzon islands focusing on the generation of winter eddies wang et al 2008 found abundant eddies in the eastern basin but only if the wind resolves the orographic effects of local wind jets in this respect the wind forcing from era i has too coarse a resolution 80 km to resolve properly the local orographic effects at 13 n close to the mountainous mindoro island for anticyclones the eddy tracks in aviso see fig 9 are separated into three well defined clusters 1 along the continental slope extending southwestward from the west of luzon strait 2 east of vietnam at 13 n and 3 to the southeast of macclesfield bank mb and west of luzon island these dense eddy clusters agree with the first two anticyclones corridors in figure 3 of du et al 2016 the northern anticyclone corridor seems to dissipate near paracel island pi in the assim run the corridor 2 in du et al 2016 extends from west of luzon island to east of vietnam at 14 n which corresponds to the two other clusters in the middle of the scs basin although da does not increase the number of tracks it removes the eddies close to palawan island this indicates that the generation mechanisms of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies at 13 n are triggered by different local mechanisms in winter contrary to our expectations the sparse eddy tracks near the vietnamese coastline but outside of the three aforementioned clusters have been removed in assim this points to eddy genesis being underestimated through assimilation along the coast of vietnam the high positive mean sla fig 10 reflects the accumulation of seawater by the northeast monsoon even after the assimilation of altimetry data the sla gradient remains too close to the coast of vietnam compared to satellite data one likely explanation would be a too strong wind near the coast of vietnam strong southerly winds lead to cyclonic eddy generation and sustain them for long due to the wind stress curl e g metzger 2003 wang et al 2008 moreover strong easterly winds establish prevailing cyclonic wind stress curl and reduce the area where anticyclonic eddies can be generated and maintained 5 discussion and conclusions since the early 2000s altimetry data have been routinely assimilated into regional and global ocean forecast models to improve the eddy forecasts however little documentation of the accuracy of eddy characteristics has been produced even less so in a regional sea like the scs even though our experiments have been conducted in reanalysis mode the eddy characteristics evaluated here are useful as an upper limit of the eddy prediction skill one would expect in a general ocean operational forecast model the novelty of this study is thus to evaluate the reproduction of the scs eddies characteristics by assimilation of altimetry data alone given the simple design of evaluating the basic eddy characteristics on a common horizontal grid we are confident that the method is applicable to the output of operational forecasting centers the robust performance of our system over 19 years should also provide a valuable benchmark to track the scs eddies objectively a combined geometric and dynamical algorithm has been applied to satellite data and model runs it was found satisfactory in that the temperature vertical profiles could confirm the presence of eddies but still suffers from uncertainties in the choices of a few parameters considering both cyclones and anticyclones data assimilation of altimeter data leads to an ir e of 11 9 for the eddy generation in the whole scs the reproduction for cyclones is 10 3 slightly lower than for anticyclones this is partially related to anticyclones being more under represented than cyclones in the free run see fig 7b regional variations of eddy reproduction are more important than the asymmetry cyclones anticyclones the benefits are more obvious in the eddy rich nscs 10 n with an ir e of 17 9 and 19 6 for cyclones and anticyclones respectively the opposite seasonal cycles of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy frequencies are too weak in the free run but can be well remediated by data assimilation the eddy sizes are slightly exaggerated in the free run especially for anticyclones during the summer months radii 17 km too large it could partially explain the reasons why the vertical structure of eddies in the free run did not agree with observations even though assimilation shrinks the eddies as expected anticyclones remain too large in the summer months histograms of eddy radii show that assimilation corrects well for cyclonic eddies and large anticyclonic eddies but not anticyclonic eddies smaller than 70 km in radius seasonal differences indicate that the origin of the mismatch either lies in the forcing fields or the kuroshio intrusion rather than the numerical schemes of the model seasonal influences could either be caused by the intrusion of the kuroshio current chow et al 2008 or a bias in the summer monsoon winds which seems the most likely cause since the simulated anticyclonic eddies are more realistic near luzon strait than in the center of the basin in the winter december and january cyclones are generally reproducible where the satellite data show higher density especially east of vietnam this is further improved by data assimilation however at 13 n the cyclonic eddies near the philippines are captured by neither the free nor the assimilation run using higher resolution atmospheric forcings 8 km pullen et al 2008 conclude that intensified wind jets and wakes in the lee of luzon island induce eddy generation in january 2005 which seems to be a missing mechanism and a bias in the coarse resolution forcing fields used here this concurs with the requirement of finely resolved wind forcing in wang et al 2008 understanding the impact of atmospheric forcing on the scs eddy reproduction requires comparative experiments and is outside of our present scope a limitation of this study is the coarse horizontal resolution of the era i forcing in the enoi used here the background covariances depend on a historical model run that used the coarse wind forcings which therefore indirectly limits the assimilation this limitation can be mitigated in an enkf using perturbations of the winds because the intensity of the perturbations can be set so that they represent the winds deficiencies however running ensemble simulations is more expensive than running a model once using forcings of higher resolution if they are available future studies will therefore implement a higher resolution reanalysis such as the fifth generation of ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis era5 hoffmann et al 2019 to better represent the orographic effects on the winds besides this understanding needs to be further verified in the prediction of real eddy trajectories within a longer time along with the use of an operational atmosphere forecast for anticyclones both the excess of eddies close to palawan island and the deficiency of eddies north of rt are corrected by da however assimilation fails to address several missed eddies around the south corridor at 13 n du et al 2016 the main reason seems to be a too strong zonal component of the northeast monsoon as revealed by the too sharp sla gradient along the vietnam coast shown in fig 10 a resulting practical recommendation for the eddy reproductions is therefore the use of bias corrected wind forcing with a resolution high enough to represent the fine orographic effects of the philippines 8 km as in pullen et al 2008 recently era5 has been accessible through the website https cds climate copernicuse eu cdsapp home compared to the era i fields its higher resolutions in space 30 km and time hourly allows a better representation of tropical cyclones gravity waves and other meso to synoptic scale features hennermann and giusti 2020 it is reasonable to believe that the era5 or other high resolution datasets would be able to further improve the eddy reproduction in the future the above eddy track metrics can be applied to any forecasting system in which data are publicly available and can be compared to satellite altimeter maps operational users of eddy forecasts can then determine the expected level of accuracy by area of interest and by season and rely on the demonstrated temporal stability of these statistics in 19 years neither the model resolution its lateral boundary conditions nor the data assimilation scheme appeared as limiting factors in the performance the eddy reproduction examples provided here are restricted to the position of eddy center number and radius many more features could describe in more detail eddy structure and cyclogenesis length the direction of the tracks the evolution of tracers dissipation among others but these would be more sensitive to the atmospheric forcing and the uncertainties in the eddy tracking algorithm credit

23942,wetting and drying processes in shallow water systems by surges tides and seiches have important societal physical and biological impacts operational 3d regional models are of sufficient resolution o 1 km that the processes of wetting and drying need to be included here we describe a flux limiter based approach that allows a numerical ocean model with a flux formulation of tracer advection to wet and dry the flux limiter approach limits the outflow from a cell whose depth is below a critical value defined by the user the limiter can be a step function or a smooth function of the water depth the latter increases model stability and avoids rapid alternation between dry and wet states on long slopes as the critical depth is approached furthermore the user may proportionally limit the baroclinic fluxes as a cell transitions from wet to dry over the course of the large baroclinic time step the simplicity of the flux limiter approach lends itself to its application within existing numerical models without significant intrusion into the code base in this paper the vertical coordinate is restricted to pure terrain following coordinates with no z like steps we explore the scheme s effectiveness sensitivities and limitations within the 3d nemo ocean model by assessing it using test cases of increasing complexity it is shown to perform well in classic channel test cases and 2d parabolic test cases with analytic solutions all test cases with initially uniform temperature and salinity preserve this initial condition throughout the wetting and drying phases the scheme s performance against analytical 1d dam break experiments is explored and used to interpret its performance against laboratory measurements of a 2d dam break it is also shown to run stably for a realistic 3d regional domain of the north west european shelf and to improve some aspects of the model s performance against tide gauges keywords wetting and drying flux limiter storm surge tide idealised test cases 1 introduction the prediction of storm surges around the coast lines of many countries e g in north west europe north america and the indian ocean is essential to support public safety and the efficient operation of ports harbours barrages and other national infrastructure pugh and woodworth 2014 projections of the impact of climate change on future high water levels are also of great importance church et al 2013 palmer et al 2018 forecasts of the three dimensional structure of the temperature salinity and currents of the north west european shelf and other coastal and estuarine regions are also produced on an operational basis sotillo et al 2015 hordoir et al 2019 tonani et al 2019 these prediction systems have horizontal resolutions of the order of 1 km at this resolution the variation in the shore line is appreciable in some regions furthermore models which do not allow grid cells to wet and dry typically specify a minimum depth for their wet cells on the north west european shelf the tidal range is several metres and the minimum depth of wet cells is usually taken to be of order 10 m this minimum depth is likely to affect the tidal propagation and other aspects of the simulation higher resolution simulations of the currents sediments and ecosystems of near coastal waters and estuaries are even more dependent on accurate simulation of variations in the shore line the flow governed by the shallow water equations in a time varying domain is relevant to the modelling of rivers and dam breaks as well as tidal and estuarine waters these equations admit solutions such as shocks and bores in which the solutions have discontinuities consequently a large number of methods have been developed to address them for example some authors allow the grid to evolve with the flow lynch and gray 1980 whilst others use riemann solvers with carefully chosen upwind advection schemes zoppou and roberts 2000 toro 2009 to represent bores with high accuracy we will restrict our discussion below to models which use a static grid and a c grid discretisation although a number of authors focus on implicit time stepping methods angeloudis et al 2018 balzano 1998 stelling and duinmeijer 2003 zhang et al 2016 our focus will be on split explicit time step solvers in which the depth average barotropic motions are simulated using the shallow water equations with a short time step and the departures from the depth average are simulated with a longer time step the distinguishing features of wetting and drying w d schemes can be explained by the situation depicted in fig 1 which shows a thin film of water on bathymetry that is steeply sloping downward to the right the surface pressure gradient on this film of water will strongly accelerate it down the slope leaving no water on its up slope side the key issue is how to limit the flux of water out of the tracer cell centred at x i through its down slope face at point x i 1 2 whilst allowing flow through this face when the flow reverses the various schemes specify criteria under which the depth of the flow through the face is considered to be zero so that no flux through that face is permitted some of the schemes also modify the specification of terms in the momentum equation either reducing them to take account of the shallowness of the water burchard et al 2004 and or adjusting the surface pressure gradient in order to reduce the down slope acceleration the scheme we have implemented is based on warner et al 2013 wdha hereafter which exploited ideas proposed by oey 2005 these authors specify some ocean grid points to be permanently dry the other grid points may be fully wet or dry these dry points are not allowed to have zero depth instead they are covered by a thin film of water so that the equations of motion can be calculated at all grid points in wdha the key idea is that the direction of the flow is determined at each of the faces of a tracer cell and the flux and velocity through the face is set to zero if the depth of the upstream tracer cell is less than or equal to a user specified critical depth d crit the scheme of flather and heaps 1975 is equivalent to this scheme if the direction of the flow is determined by the direction of the surface pressure gradient this paper has two main aims first in section 2 it describes in more detail the wetting and drying w d scheme we have implemented in the nemo model madec et al 2017 second in sections 3 and 4 it assesses and explores the performance of nemo using this scheme in a variety of test cases balzano 1998 assessed the performance of a number of w d schemes sections 3 1 1 3 1 3 compare our results with his for a number of 1d channel test cases of increasing complexity section 3 1 4 then compares our solutions for oscillations within a paraboloid with the analytical solutions of thacker 1981 and the simulations described by balzano 1998 a large number of steady state and time varying analytical solutions for test cases have been assembled by delestre et al 2013 we explore the simulation of two 1d dam break problems in section 3 1 5 these simulations give significant insight into our simulations of the 2d dam break experiments performed by fraccarollo and toro 1995 section 3 1 6 compares our solutions with these experimental measurements and the solutions of wdha and others all test cases in sections 3 1 1 3 1 6 are initialised with uniform constant temperature and salinity domain wide this initial condition is preserved throughout the integrations section 3 2 illustrates the impact on the vertical profiles of tracers of alternative schemes for reducing the vertical variation of the flow in cells as they dry out the final section 3 3 of section 3 illustrates the impacts of smoothing the transition to no flux through a cell face as the upwind cell dries out section 4 describes an implementation of the scheme in a 3d configuration covering the north west european shelf and briefly describes its impacts on the simulations by comparison with tide gauge measurements section 5 provides a concluding summary and discussion 2 wetting drying methodology 2 1 assumptions our w d scheme is intended for use in an ocean model with a standard static c grid that did not consider w d in its original development one of the scheme s design aims is to minimise the changes to the model code the scheme assumes that the ocean model conserves volume and uses 1 a c grid for the horizontal placement of the tracers and horizontal velocities 2 a terrain following coordinate at points that may become dry 3 a free surface with layers whose thickness varies with the free surface height i e σ layers or mixed z σ layers 4 a split explicit time step scheme for the external barotropic mode 5 a flux form for the advection of tracers and momentum 6 an upwind scheme for the calculation of the fluxes of tracers and momentum 7 a pre existing land sea mask 8 and the boussinesq approximation in nemo the free surface described in the third point is based on the formulation of adcroft and campin 2004 in deep water which is typically about 4000 m deep external gravity waves travel at about 200 m s this fast wave speed motivates the fourth point which states that the external mode is advanced using a much smaller explicit time step than that used for the other components it is calculated using the depth mean currents referred to as the barotropic currents and the height of the free surface the baroclinic currents are defined as the total currents minus the barotropic currents the longer time step used for components other than the barotropic mode is referred to as the baroclinic time step except for diffusion the baroclinic step in nemo uses a leapfrog scheme with a robert asselin filter leclair and madec 2009 for horizontal diffusion a forward time scheme is used and for vertical diffusion a backward implicit time scheme is used the split explicit scheme for the barotropic mode used in nemo is based on the formulation of shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the time stepping of the fast barotropic mode in the time splitting algorithm uses a three time step generalised forward backward algorithm in nemo a forward backward algorithm following shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 is used as mentioned earlier for the treatment of shocks it is important to use a suitable upwind scheme for the calculation of fluxes zoppou and roberts 2000 the simulations presented here use the 3rd order upstream biased scheme ubs in nemo version 4 also known as the cell averaged quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme leonard 1995 2 2 notation and definition of layer depths and dry cells as depicted in fig 2 we denote the depth of the bathymetry relative to a chosen geopotential surface s g by h and the surface height relative to s g by η t the total water column depth h t at any time t is thus given by h η t the water column may be divided into k vertical layers with the thickness of the k th layer at a time t given by e 3 k t the reference depths of the layers at a nominal time t 0 are specified when the free surface coincides with s g then η 0 0 and 1 h k 1 k e 3 k 0 point 2 asserts that the depths of the layers vary as the surface height varies in proportion to their reference values 2 e 3 k t e 3 k 0 h η t h in order to avoid negative or zero values of h the surface s g should be chosen to be higher than any grid point which may become wet a vertical column of tracer cells is defined to be dry if the depth of water within it h η t is less than a user specified value d crit the value of d crit depends on the application for real world cases with complex steep bathymetry it may be of the order of a few centimetres for simplified idealised test cases it may be less than a millimetre for real world cases and unless explicitly stated to the contrary in the test cases when the model is initialised at rest the minimum depth criterion is enforced that is if the actual initial depth h η t 0 d crit then the initial depth is set equal to d crit by initialising the model surface height as η t 0 d crit h the prognostic equations are evaluated at all the sea points dictated by the model s pre existing land sea mask at every baroclinic time step and barotropic sub step we will describe how the w d scheme is applied first on each barotropic sub step and then on each baroclinic step 2 2 1 on each barotropic sub step as in wdha the central constraint enforced by the w d scheme is that there is no outward flux of water through any face of a dry cell as the model uses a c grid once the direction of the depth integrated flow at any face of a tracer cell is calculated the upstream tracer cell can be determined and the constraint enforced in addition to setting the mass fluxes out of dry cells to zero we also set their velocities to zero on each barotropic sub step the acceleration of the flow at the faces of the cells is calculated and used together with velocities on the previous time steps to determine the direction of the flow in or out of each cell this avoids the velocities out of dry cells accelerating to large values it also means that the velocities at the faces of a dry cell reflect the momentum of the flow through the face we found that the abrupt imposition of the flux limiter as either on or off at a hard defined d crit cut off can lead to rapid alternation between wet and dry states and or grid scale noise thus our scheme includes an option to apply the flux limiter gradually as the depth reduces from d taper towards d crit as the critical depth is approached the fluxes and velocities across the cell face can be multiplied by a factor α wd t which is given by 3 α wd t 0 for h η t d crit tanh 50 h η t d crit d crit for d crit h η t d taper 1 for h η t d taper the value of d taper is a user defined variable but throughout this study we take it as twice d crit with this choice of d crit as h η t approaches d taper α wd t is very nearly 1 and any jump is numerically insignificant other choices for d taper and cheaper tapering functions are clearly possible but have not been explored although this approach can reduce unwanted noise it can also act as if there is an extra friction term similar to schemes such as burchard et al 2004 it is anticipated that this gradual application of the flux limiter to avoid noise may come at the cost of slowing propagation of the wet dry interface as in the schemes that modify the friction term balzano 1998 the sum of the fluxes through each of the faces of the tracer cells during the barotropic sub steps must be calculated to give the total flux over the baroclinic time step with the predictor corrector method for the split explicit free surface described in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 this involves the use of consistent time filters for the calculation of the free surface η and depth integrated velocities u v at the new time step t n 1 and u v averaged between steps t n and t n 1 see section 3 2 and fig 15 of shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the time mean of the volume fluxes through the four faces of the water column at each tracer point must sum to the change in volume of that water column the fluxes out of a tracer cell as it approaches d crit can result in tracer cells with water depths slightly less than d crit the water depth in these cells is not rounded up this is necessary to ensure that the volume of water including water depths in dry cells is strictly conserved by the scheme and this imposes a practical limit on how small d crit can be set we have confirmed that w d integrations in which the potential temperature t and salinity s are initially uniform retain these original values of t and s at every grid point to an accuracy broadly consistent with machine precision 2 2 2 on each baroclinic time step the barotropic volume fluxes summed over the barotropic sub steps are required to compute the barotropic velocities in the baroclinic time step in particular they are used within the calculation of the fluxes at the faces of the tracer cells this consistency between the volume changes in the barotropic sub steps and the calculation of fluxes in the baroclinic step is required to ensure that an ocean state with uniform tracer values maintains those values shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 section 1 3 our scheme appears to differ in this respect from the description on page 56 of wdha who say that they set their umask wet and vmask wet values either to 0 or 1 based on the average of all the barotropic sub steps it seems that their scheme is intended for calculation of tracers by an advective formulation u t rather than a flux formulation u t whilst the flux limiter as defined thus far would ensure the fluxes through the faces are consistent between the baroclinic and barotropic time steps the limiter would have no impact on the residual baroclinic velocities in a dry cell if no further action was taken even when a cell is completely dry residual baroclinic velocities could still exist in an initially vertically sheared flow so we multiply the baroclinic fluxes and velocities by the factor α c equal to the mean value of the flux limiters α wd t on the n barotropic sub steps 4 α c 1 n t 1 n α wd t this allows some baroclinic velocities to occur as a cell transitions from wet to dry over the long baroclinic time step the impact of alternative options for the baroclinic fluxes is assessed in section 3 2 3 assessments using idealised test cases unless otherwise stated in this section no explicit lateral diffusion is applied the advection schemes being upstream biased have an implicit biharmonic diffusion all the idealised experimental data original source code and figure plotting code are freely available from o dea 2019 readme notes are included to allow all of the experiments to be reproduced 3 1 classical w d test cases 3 1 1 1d uniformly sloping basin the scheme is tested first in the simple uniformly sloping 1d channel considered by both falconer and owens 1987 and balzano 1998 the case is described as one dimensional 1d because the flow is taken to be independent of the cross channel coordinate y and there is only one layer in the vertical the channel is 13800 m long and 5 m deep at an open boundary on its left hand end it slopes uniformly from this open boundary up to a depth of zero at a closed boundary at the far end we use the same open boundary condition as balzano 1998 that is a sinusoidal variation in water level with an amplitude of 2 m and a period of 43200 s falconer and owens 1987 used a different period of 32400 s in keeping with the balzano 1998 experiments we implement a manning strickler bed friction formula with the bed friction coefficient defined as c d g k 2 h η 1 3 here as in balzano 1998 k 50 m 1 3 s 1 is the strickler coefficient h η is the water column depth and g is gravitational acceleration the time step used is t 600 s our experiments differ from balzano 1998 in that balzano used schemes that are implicit in time whereas we have used a split explicit time step for the external mode fig 3 shows the ebb and flood phases of the flow in exactly the same way as in balzano 1998 the surface elevation η is shown for each time step the lines with additional circles marking the lines for every 5 th step it may appear at first sight that on the flooding phase there are undesirable wiggles in the surface height on the upper part of the slope but this is an artefact of the plotting method which connects the height of the last wet grid point to its adjacent dry grid point in balzano 1998 a number of the w d schemes investigated had issues with undesired grid scale variations in the flooding stage which are absent from fig 3 3 1 2 slope with bottom convexity balzano 1998 also shows that a simple modification of the linear slope experiment with what he terms a bottom convexity can result in problems for w d schemes fig 4 shows the equivalent test in nemo with our flux limiter scheme the channel is as in the linear slope experiment except that the bottom has been modified by raising point 9 to the same level as point 10 the boundary conditions are the same as in section 3 1 1 balzano 1998 shows that problems can arise with schemes preventing the flow over the convexity as the tide ebbs fig 4 shows that these problems do not arise in our nemo simulations during the ebbing phase fig 4 a as the depth at point 9 becomes small the friction becomes relatively large and the flow rate is small but it remains non zero as the tide floods the domain again fig 4 b the water level continues to reduce at points 9 and 10 until the returning flood elevation is higher at point 8 than at point 9 three factors could account for the fact that the difficulties in some of the simulations described by balzano 1998 are absent from our simulations the first relates to the definition of the bathymetries in nemo the bathymetry at the velocity points the faces of the tracer cells is determined by linear interpolation of the bathymetry at the tracer points as shown in fig 1 by contrast balzano 1998 took the bathymetry at the tracer points to be calculated by linear interpolation of the bathymetry at the velocity points as illustrated in fig 5 this design choice was made with the aim of increasing the effective resolution of bathymetry if one takes the surface height at velocity points to be calculated by linear interpolation of the heights at tracer points it is clear from fig 5 that the depth at the u point will dry out prematurely on the ebb phase of the tide this convexity issue does not arise with the nemo bathymetry balzano recognised that his definition of the bathymetry could have been poorly suited to some of the schemes that he tested the bea scheme of benqué et al 1982 for example was originally designed for a different choice of grid the second and third factors relate to the form of interpolation used by our scheme to determine whether a cell face is wet or dry following wdha and flather and heaps 1975 the depth of the water layer rather than the height of the sea surface is interpolated in our scheme the second factor and the interpolation is performed by looking up stream rather than by linear interpolation the third factor 3 1 3 drying tests of 1d channel with reservoir the last in our series of simple 1d channel test cases concerns draining from a reservoir in this case the basin starts entirely underwater with an initial surface level of 2 0 m it is emptied over 100 h initially using a sinusoidal boundary condition as in 3 1 however once the boundary reaches 2 0 m it is fixed at 2 0 m leading to an asymptotic drain of the entire basin balzano 1998 shows that with the schemes he considered and the bathymetry defined at the u points some schemes cannot drain out of the reservoir correctly fig 6 shows the surface elevation in the channel after 100 h with our model and that there is no issue with drainage from the reservoir the critical depth d crit at point 8 will be the limiting depth for elevation inside the reservoir at point 9 3 1 4 free oscillations in a paraboloid basin balzano 1998 quantifies the accuracy of a set of wetting and drying schemes using a 2d test case with an analytic solution derived in thacker 1981 we also use this test case to assess the flux limiter scheme implemented in nemo the experiment consists of a frictionless basin defined by a paraboloid of revolution with a mass of water freely oscillating within it with a free surface that is also a paraboloid the basin depicted by the blue curve in fig 7 has a depth d x y given by 5 d d 0 1 x 2 y 2 l 2 where d 0 is the water depth at x 0 y 0 for the equilibrium level η 0 and l is the radius of the horizontal circular cross section of the paraboloid at η 0 the equilibrium shoreline is given by x 2 y 2 l 2 balzano compared his simulations with a specific solution from thacker in which coriolis acceleration terms are omitted the analytical expressions for the horizontal velocities and surface elevation are given by 6 u 1 2 ω x a sin ω t 1 a cos ω t v 1 2 ω y a sin ω t 1 a cos ω t 7 η d 0 1 a 2 1 a c o s ω t 1 x 2 y 2 l 2 1 a 2 1 a cos ω t 2 1 where 8 ω 2 8 g d 0 l 2 a d 0 η 0 2 d 0 2 d 0 η 0 2 d 0 2 and η 0 is the elevation at x 0 y 0 at time t 0 eq 7 is equivalent to eq 21 in balzano 1998 1 1 in balzano s equation there appears to be a typographic error for the first denominator term which ought to be 1 a cos ω t and the numerator which should be 1 a 2 see 51 of thacker 1981 for our baseline experiment we retain the same model resolution and domain as in balzano the period t and bowl depth d are chosen to be t 12 h and d 0 50 m which requires that l 430 620 km at x 0 y 0 the initial elevation η 0 2 m following balzano 1998 we use a numerical grid of 200 by 200 points such that the grid size is δ x δ y 4758 232 m and a time step of δ t 300 s the initial surface elevation η x y t 0 is depicted as the purple curve in fig 7 a comparison of the model and analytic solutions is shown in fig 8 a perturbation in the model solution emanates from the wetting and drying interface the methods that performed well for this test case in balzano 1998 the wut and wwu methods proposed by him are also upstream methods it can be seen as variations in the numerical solutions about the analytic solutions in fig 8 a there is a small loss of about 1 5 in amplitude at 12 h in the numerical solutions which can just be seen in fig 8 b and is more clearly evident in the inset in the top right of fig 8 b which focuses on the solutions near x 0 the test is severe with no bottom friction nor diffusion and the quality of the results shown here is comparable to the best of the schemes considered in balzano 1998 we conducted sensitivity experiments to model parameters and found that the perturbations have a clear dependency on model resolution fig 9 compares the baseline experiment with an experiment with a horizontal resolution refined by a factor of 4 from 4 758 km to 1 189 km clearly the perturbations in surface elevation are greatly diminished in the higher resolution simulation the perturbations are more clearly visible in the barotropic velocity as shown in fig 9 b the above experiments were conducted with no addition of explicit diffusion on momentum we also conducted further experiments with diffusion explicitly added this smoothed the perturbations at the wet and dry interface but increased the decay rate of the oscillating free surface 3 1 5 frictionless one dimensional dam break experiments we consider next two classical frictionless one dimensional dam break problems solved using the shallow water equations first that of a dam break into a completely dry horizontal bottom for which the analytic solution was derived by ritter 1892 the second problem solved by stoker 1957 is the same as the first except that the dam breaks into a region initially occupied by still water of some prescribed depth lower than the water retained by the dam as the dry areas in nemo cannot be set to be of exactly zero depth the numerical model solves a problem similar to that solved by stoker in this sub section we conduct some experiments in which the initial dry depth is allowed to be significantly smaller than d crit to explore to what extent our method is able to reproduce the stoker and ritter solutions solutions for both analytic cases can be readily computed within the shallow water analytic solutions for hydraulic and environmental studies swashes library delestre et al 2013 the purpose of the swashes library is to help users of shallow water based models to easily find an adaptable benchmark library to validate numerical methods in the following experiment both h and s g are 0 thus the water depth h t is exactly equal to the free surface height η the experiment consists of a dam at point x x 0 with a reservoir of water of constant initial depth h l retained behind a dam for x x 0 there is also a dry region downstream of the dam for x x 0 the two problems are distinguished by whether the downstream region is exactly dry or has some still water of uniform depth 0 h r h l the initial water depth is defined by 9 h x h l for 0 x x 0 h r for x 0 x x l and the initial velocity by u x 0 0 m s the dam breaks instantaneously and the water flows from the region of depth h l to the left into the region of depth h r to the right for ritter s problem h r 0 and there are three zones in the solution the analytic evolution in time of the solution across the three zones in the domain is 10 h x t h l if x x a t 4 9 g g h l x x 0 2 t 2 if x a t x x b r t 0 if x b r t x where 11 x a t x 0 t g h l and x b r t x 0 2 t g h l for stoker s problem h r 0 and there is an additional zone behind a bore whose height h m does not change with time the time evolving solution across the 4 regions is 12 h x t h l if x x a t 4 9 g g h l x x 0 2 t 2 if x a t x x b s t c m 2 g if x b s t x x c t h r if x c t x where 13 x a t x 0 t g h l x b s t x 0 t 2 g h l 3 c m 14 x c t x 0 t 2 c m 2 g h l c m c m 2 g h r and 15 8 g h r c m 2 g h l c m 2 c m 2 g h r 2 c m 2 g h r 0 we note that ritter s and stoker s solutions are the same for x x b s and that h in stoker s solution is discontinuous at x c the front of the bore from 12 the height of stoker s bore h b relative to h r is given by c m 2 g h r dividing 15 by g h r 3 one can write it as a 6 th order polynomial for h b h r whose coefficients depend on h l h r table 1 shows the values of h b h r calculated from the roots of the polynomial for some values of h l h r that are relevant to the discussion of the numerical experiments below our numerical experiments have a domain from x 1 25 m to x 1 25 m with the dam break located at x 0 0 the initial height in the reservoir is set at h l 1 0 m the grid resolution δ x 0 0025 m and the time step is δ t 0 00001 s different values of d crit are used to illustrate its impact fig 10 compares the model solution against stoker s analytic solution given by 12 15 using an initial depth h r 0 001 m and d crit 1 0 6 m panel a shows the solution for the full domain and panel b shows it in more detail in the region of the bore the bore is simulated quite well and its height agrees well with the value of 66 8 mm shown in table 1 we can attempt to simulate the case where the dam breaks into a dry region by setting both h r and d crit to be very small fig 11 compares two model simulations with stoker s solution when h r 1 0 6 m and according to table 1 the bore height should be around 2 7 mm one of the simulations uses a small value of d crit d crit 1 0 6 m and the other a very large value d crit 1 0 2 m compared with h r the figure also shows ritter s solution for a completely dry bed in the first case the model compares fairly well with ritter s solution however for the large d crit experiment the flux limiter prevents flux into a neighbouring cell until its own depth has reached d crit thus acting as an impedance on the propagation of the flood wave in fig 11 this can be seen manifesting as a bore like feature somewhat resembling the stoker solution caused by the flux limiter we note that the height of the bore is much smaller than that which would be obtained using the value 1 0 2 m that we have used for d crit for h r according to table 1 when h r 1 0 2 m the bore height is about 0 17 m fig 11 b shows a bore slightly smaller than 0 08 m only slightly larger than that obtained using h r 1 0 3 m in large scale simulations with relatively coarse grids the bore will not be resolved by the model grid nonetheless this experiment shows both the potential impact of a non zero water depth in dry areas and the potential for fairly modest values of d crit to delay the propagation of the wet dry interface 3 1 6 two dimensional dam break armed with the information about the impacts of non zero water depths in dry areas and d crit from the previous sub section we now explore a 2d dam break problem that has been investigated extensively both with real laboratory experiments fraccarollo and toro 1995 and subsequent numerical studies ferrari et al 2010 warner et al 2013 the experimental domain consists of a dry region of dimensions 2 m by 2 m downstream of a reservoir of dimensions 1 m by 2 m the reservoir is initially filled to a depth of 0 6 m and a break in the dam between the reservoir and the dry region of width 0 4 m is opened instantaneously water floods over the dry region and is allowed to pour over the sides of the edge of the domain a plane view of the domain is shown in fig 12 the location of the positions of the measurements of surface height in the experiment of fraccarollo and toro 1995 which we evaluate the model against are also plotted on fig 12 analogous to the 1d case the results depend on both the initial non zero depth in the dry region dry ini and the value of d crit fig 13 shows two numerical experiments after 0 5 s both of which used d crit 1 0 4 m the simulation shown on the left has a dry ini 5 1 0 3 m and that on the right the much smaller value of 1 0 4 m the resultant bore like solution with delayed propagation of wave front in the deeper dry initial case on the left side of fig 13 can clearly be seen this can also be seen in fig 14 which shows time series of the surface height at site 13 a the orange dashed and blue solid lines show respectively simulations for the deeper and shallower initial depths with d crit 1 0 4 m the green dotted and red dot dashed lines are also for different initial depths but with d crit 5 1 0 3 m fig 15 similarly enables the dependence on d crit to be visualised for two simulations which both use dry ini 1 0 4 m on the left d crit 5 1 0 3 m and on the right d crit 1 0 4 m as in the 1d case there is a delay in the wave propagation with increased d crit as the water cannot flow into adjacent dry cells until the current cell fills up to the critical depth though the retardation due to the change in d crit is markedly smaller than that due to the corresponding change in the initial dry depth as found in the previous sub section in order to reproduce well the original 2d dam experiment of fraccarollo and toro 1995 we must use both a small initial dry depth and a small value for d crit as nemo is effectively solving the shallow water equations swe we should expect the results to be similar to the swe solutions presented in ferrari et al 2010 those authors also show the results of a numerical experiment with the full 3d non hydrostatic navier stokes equations which give better agreement with the laboratory experiments for the initial transients at longer times the full navier stokes and swe solutions converge fig 16 shows the model simulation at 6 time snapshots in time nemo exhibits the same rarefaction wave and reflections in the reservoir as in the swe simulations of ferrari et al 2010 fig 17 compares simulations made using d crit dry ini 1 0 4 m with the observations of fraccarollo and toro 1995 at four further locations c o 8 a and 5 a as noted by ferrari et al 2010 close to the dam break site where vertical accelerations are large the assumption of the hydrostatic model are invalid however further from the dam break and as the vertical gradients reduce in time the hydrostatic model results agree well with the measured data of particular interest to the w d scheme is the timing and magnitude of the flood wave in to the dry plane which can be seen at site 8 a the model solution here is in good agreement with the measured data 3 2 baroclinic velocity comparison we now investigate the effect of different treatments of the baroclinic velocities when applying the flux limiter the experiments as depicted in fig 18 are made in a simple 1d channel with a linearly sloping bathymetry whose depth is 2 5 m at the open end on the left and 0 m at the opposite end which is closed the initial condition consists of the channel filled with water at rest that has a uniform temperature domain wide and a horizontal gradient in salinity from 35 to 1 from the open end of the channel to the closed end two cases are considered differing only in the equation of state used in one case the equation of state has density only dependent on temperature so that salinity acts as a passive tracer and the vertical shear in the flow is purely a result of the bed friction in the second case both temperature and salinity are used to calculate density using the teos 10 equation of state ioc et al 2010 there is no explicit horizontal diffusion applied the bottom boundary condition consists of a manning strickler bed friction formula with a large strickler coefficient k 200 m 1 3 s 1 to enhance vertical shear in the velocity the open boundary condition linearly lowers η from the initial value 0 m to 1 m over a period of 3 h and then remains at 1 m thereafter the water drains out of the channel until the dry condition is met for the tests presented d crit is set to a relatively large value d crit 0 5 m the numerical domain is 50 points long and has 50 vertical levels the horizontal grid spacing δ x 1000 m and the time step δ t 600 s the large value of d crit is chosen in this case so that the vertical distribution of salinity through depth at the point of drying is clearly visible for each baroclinic timestep there are 50 barotropic substeps each of length 12 s as the water drains out the fresher water at the closed end of the channel is advected towards the open boundary in the passive salinity test case only the bottom friction induces vertical velocity shear and this leads to surface water advecting faster than water near the bed the salinity gradients have been chosen so that in the second case they enhance the vertical current shear in our w d scheme the default option is to scale the baroclinic velocities by the time mean sum over all the barotropic time steps of the factors α wd t that are used to calculate the barotropic velocities see sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 we defined this time averaged value as α c in eq 4 we have explored two alternative options based on algorithms described in wdha one option aint sets the baroclinic velocities to zero if for any of the n sub time steps t the cell is declared dry inside the barotropic sub cycle 16 aint α c 0 if α w d t 0 for any t 1 n 1 if all α w d t 0 t 1 n the second option anint sets the baroclinic velocity to zero if the mean number of times the cell is dry is 0 5 and retains the full baroclinic velocities otherwise 17 anint α c 0 if α c 0 5 1 if α c 0 5 fig 19 shows the salinity distribution in the water remaining in the dry zone after the channel emptied at point x 45 km near the right hand end of the channel obtained using the three options in the aint approach the vertical gradient in salinity is reduced as the baroclinic velocities are set to zero more frequently than the other two cases which are nearly coincident in fig 19 the effect is cumulative as the water flows down the slope leading to greater differences away from the closed end adding the density effect of the salinity increases the baroclinicity and amplifies the effect although the differences are small and reduce as d crit is reduced the effect could be important in estuaries where there may be large horizontal gradients in salinity and large tidal amplitudes and we recommend using the mean value approach to retain the baroclinicity of the flow 3 3 tapering test cases as described in section 2 2 1 the w d scheme may apply the limiter sharply at the value of d crit or optionally taper out the limiter from d crit to d taper the effect of the tapering option is now explored in a simple 1d channel test case the channel is closed at both ends its bathymetry see fig 20 a consists of a small shelf at its left hand end at 0 m depth a linear slope down to 10 m and a flat bottom at 10 m depth in the rest of the domain the initial values for η also shown in fig 20 a are constructed using a linear slope from a height of 1 175 m at the right hand end of the channel to 2 5 m at its left hand end where η h the initial value for η is set as η d crit h the numerical domain has 50 points along the channel with grid step δ x 1 5 km the baroclinic time step is δ t 10 s there are 50 barotropic time steps taken for every baroclinic time step there is no friction applied and the model is run calculating only the barotropic mode once the initial free surface is released it sends a wave from right to left along the channel that is reflected off the opposite end creating both initial wetting and later drying on the left hand side of the domain during the drying phase the flow over the upper part of the shelf is similar to the hydraulically controlled flow over a weir two cases are simulated one with and one without the tapering in both cases d crit 12 cm this value was chosen to ensure both experiments remained stable for the given geometry and time step we found that once d crit 5 cm or less the simulation without a tapering became unstable panels a and b of fig 21 present time series of the barotropic velocities averaged over each baroclinic time step from the simulations at a position 12 km along the channel model point 8 in the hydraulically controlled region just off the shelf when no taper is applied see panel a rapid alternations in the barotropic velocity occur as water flows off the shelf over a period p of about an hour approximately 4 h into the simulation during period p fig 21 c shows that the limiter is applied on all barotropic sub steps in some baroclinic steps but not on others in fig 21 d the tapered limiter is classified as being applied when the depth is less than 2 d crit and it is apparent that during period p the limiter is applied at every barotropic sub step panels e and f of fig 21 show the mean value over each baroclinic time step of the limiter mask and of the tapered coefficient α wd respectively after an initial adjustment at the start of period p the tapered coefficient takes a value which is only slightly smaller than 1 so during period p the tapering is being continuously applied with a value close to 1 panel e shows that in the no taper case the mean value of the flux limiter over any baroclinic step during period p is greater than 0 98 but that it fluctuates more than in the tapered case fig 22 shows output from the two simulations at the same point as before for a short segment near the start of period p on every barotropic sub step fig 22 a shows that in the no taper case the mask is typically only applied for one barotropic sub step before it switches off again whereas in the taper case the flux limiter is applied continuously on every barotropic sub step the modification of the flux by the taper is very small as α wd is only very slightly less than one fig 22 b shows the flux out of the cell minus the flux into it in both simulations the flux out is initially larger than the flux in leading to the water depth falling in the cell in the no taper case the flux is not modified until the depth of the cell is d crit the limiter is then applied so that the flux out is exactly zero and the cell immediately begins to refill as the flux into the cell is unaffected the cell water depth is then again d crit and the flux out can resume until later in time the flux out is again larger than the flux in and in time the critical depth is reached again in the tapered case the very slight reduction in flux as the water depth decreases below d taper slows the outgoing flux until the in going flux is greater and the cell depth starts to increase upon increasing the cell depth the effect of the flux limiter gradually decreases as α wd increases towards one and allows more outgoing flux the effect of this feedback between the difference of ingoing and outgoing fluxes with cell depth is that the outgoing flux is modulated through the flux limiter towards the value of incoming flux this leads to smoother time variations in the cell depth and consequently the velocity field for larger time steps or smaller values of d crit the model without the taper applied becomes unstable before that with the taper applied an additional simulation doubling the value of d crit to 24 cm with no taper also shows rapid changes between dry and wet states thus the taper can enhance the model stability by reducing fluctuations between dry and wet states that the sharp flux cut off generates 4 preliminary assessments of a 3d north west european shelf configuration 4 1 amm15 model configuration with w d we use the atlantic margins model amm15 with 1 5 km horizontal grid spacing to test the w d scheme in a realistic regional ocean configuration amm15 is the current copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems operational model for the northwest european shelf the amm15 domain and bathymetry are shown in fig 23 and graham et al 2018 describe the baseline amm15 configuration in detail only modifications of the amm15 configuration specifically related to w d are presented here the w d code we use was introduced into nemo version 4 0 so we have upgraded the configuration originally based on version 3 6 described by graham et al 2018 to 4 0 as in graham et al 2018 the high resolution emodnet bathymetry emodnet portal september 2015 release was used to derive the amm15 model bathymetry adjusting from the emodnet reference level of lowest astronomical tide lat to mean sea level msl using an estimate of tidal range from a 19 year tidal simulation of the cs3x tidal model of batstone et al 2013 we inherit all the model parameters specified in graham et al 2018 including the baroclinic timestep of 60 s the value of d crit was chosen to be 5 cm values smaller than 2 cm led to instabilities in the model at the given time step unlike graham et al 2018 however the bathymetry is not forced to take a minimum depth of 10 m and its depth is allowed to be negative we found many points in the original emodnet data that are close to the coastline provided by emodnet and that according to that coastline are sea points where the depth of the bathymetry has large negative values e g depths 20 m we have restricted the height of the bathymetry at sea points to be no higher than the tidal maximum calculated using the 2d cs3x model we made these changes to the bathymetry to improve the stability of the model configuration during its initial implementation our rationale for these changes is that only points whose height is less than the tidal maximum should be classified as sea points it is possible that the emodnet data at these high points has been contaminated by sharply sloping on shore orography e g cliffs or bathymetry our test simulations required additional pre smoothing of the bathymetry to ensure pure sigma coordinates are used instead of a mix of z and s coordinates in w d zones the pre smoothing method used is the 1d iterative method of martinho and batteen 2006 with a specified maximum slope parameter of 0 2 in this paper we do not consider the case of using a different number of levels in adjoining grids cells with w d as occurs in hybrid s z coordinates but this will be the subject of further studies it was found that to maintain stability for multi year runs some river points required both the bathymetry to be deepened and the input river flux to be distributed over all vertical levels rather than just the topmost cells these adjustments are probably required because of the very shallow water depths and model layer depths obtained in a model with w d capability there are 50 vertical levels in amm15 resulting in very thin model layers and resultant sensitivity to model time step for some of the largest rivers in the domain the input of river water was also spread over 4 neighbouring horizontal grid sea points to ensure model stability in these experiments there is no special treatment of the shortwave radiation at the seabed one consequence of this is that if the water is optically clear the remaining shortwave flux at the bed in shallow water will be unaccounted for within the model however water in tidally active areas is usually very turbid consequently the short wave flux is likely to be absorbed rapidly by suspended matter in the water column and not penetrate deeply however consideration of a seabed module to deal with fluxes at the bed could be incorporated to improve the model further particularly in the context of ocean atmosphere coupled models as there is no specific seabed module in these experiments we have augmented the treatment of atmospheric surface fluxes for very shallow layers if a cell is declared dry that is h η t d crit then all surface fluxes are set to zero however we also found that some cells with a very shallow depth just greater than d crit could be cooled or heated to excessively high or low temperatures to prevent this a user controlled weighting function that is dependent on cell depth is applied that tapers the surface fluxes towards zero as the critical depth is approached as vast majority of the amm15 domain is ice free throughout the year an ice model is not included in our configuration this omission to include an ice model is down to a trade off between computational cost and model fidelity although not implemented in the model simulations in this paper the model temperature could be constrained not to fall below the local freezing point of sea water in lieu of the more physically satisfying if costly inclusion of a sea ice model the model initial conditions are taken from the long runs of graham et al 2018 and interpolated to the modified amm15 w d model grid surface forcing and lateral boundary conditions are as in graham et al 2018 the surface forcing is derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis product era interim dee et al 2011 lateral boundary conditions for the atlantic are taken from the global seasonal forecast system glosea version 5 maclachlan et al 2015 boundary conditions for the baltic open boundary are taken from a regional baltic simulation gräwe et al 2015 tidal forcing at the open boundaries was derived from the topex poseidon cross over solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 tpxo7 2 atlantic ocean 2011 atlas results are presented from two model simulations one with and one without w d the only difference between the simulations is in the specification of the bathymetry at shallow points where the depth is less than 10 m in the w d simulation this shallow bathymetry is left unaltered in the simulation without w d the bathymetric depth at these shallow points is set to the minimum value of 10 m this follows the procedure of graham et al 2018 and prevents any area in the domain from drying out these model simulations cover the period from 1st january 2010 to 31st december 2015 data from the amm15 experiments is available at each tide gauge location together with python scripts to reproduce the plots in this paper in o dea 2019 with a 1 5 km grid amm15 does not resolve in much detail the complicated bathymetry characteristics of many tidal mud flats and estuaries the main advantage of w d at this resolution is that a domain wide minimum depth of 10 m is not enforced however the wadden sea indicated by the blue rectangle in fig 23 and shown in more detail in fig 24 is extensive enough for the 1 5 km grid to resolve some of the larger channels in the w d region fig 24 shows bathymetries between 3 m and 3 m depth for a the amm15 grid and b the emodnet grid whose grid spacing is 1 8 arc minute approximately 230 m much finer grain features of the narrow dendritic drainage channels can be seen in panel b which are largely unresolved by the 1 5 km grid in panel a our assessment focuses on years 2014 2015 as there are a large number of tide gauge observations at 10 minute intervals available for that period in the wadden sea from the bsh north west shelf data portal http nwsportal bsh de fig 24 shows the locations of the tide gauges against which we will compare the model there are further tide gauges available for comparison in this region however the model resolution is insufficient to resolve the fine scale channels as shown in fig 24 in which such tide gauges are located we include the nes tide gauge as a specific case study to emphasise the extra attention and care needed at sites where the bathymetry is insufficiently resolved by the model fig 25 shows in detail the bathymetry around the nes tide gauge in amm15 and the input emodnet bathymetry 4 2 model comparison with tide gauge data fig 26 compares model data from the integrations with and without w d with tide gauge data at the sites oudeschild and nes in the case of the oudeschild tide gauge the agreement between the w d model and the observations is very good and a clear improvement upon the model with no w d can be seen however in the case of the nes tide gauge the model resolution is unable to resolve the narrow channel at this site as seen in fig 25 the w d model dries out completely at the cells marked a and b in fig 25 during the ebb of the tide this prevents any outflow from the nes site and so the water level only varies during the highest point of the tidal phase in effect the water at the nes site becomes an isolated pond left unable to communicate with the rest of the ocean until the tide returns this results in the truncated curve for w d with amm15 seen in fig 26 b if we plotted a bathymetry plot for the case without w d as in fig 25 all sea points would be blue at 10 m as the colour range is only 3 m where the minimum depth is set as 10 m the model has a full tidal cycle and thus at this point gives the appearance of a much better match to the observations than the model with w d we have also computed a model integration with the cells a and b deepened to the depth of the centre of the channel seen in the emodnet bathymetry in 25 b in this integration the volume transport will be larger than it should be but the purpose of the integration is to demonstrate the blocking effect of the coarse resolution and the kind of attention to detail that is required with a model that can wet and dry note there is no alteration to the bathymetry at the nes site itself the simulations with the deepened cells corresponds to the red dot dashed line in fig 26 b as expected the opening of the channel by directly deepening cells a and b allows the water to drain from the nes site in the amm15 model grid during the ebb phase of the tide and thus gives an improved agreement with the tide gauge measurements other tide gauges in this analysis are thus selected at points where amm15 resolves the local bathymetry sufficiently so that the w d model has a full tidal cycle without drying as in the observations for the 2014 2015 period we compute a harmonic analysis of surface elevation for both the tidal observations and model data at the locations shown in fig 24 where observational data is missing in the time series we also omit it from the model data time series to ensure a like for like comparison fig 27 compares the difference from observations of the model with and without w d over one period for each constituent at the oudeschild tide gauge site at this site the model without w d has substantially larger errors for primary constituents m2 s2 and n2 and the shallow water constituents m4 ms4 and mn4 the results show that the transfer of energy from primary constituents to shallow water constituents is more consistent with the observations in the model with w d than without such a difference between the models might be expected given the imposition of the minimum depth of 10 m in the model without w d in order to concisely assess more than one location the maximum deviation over 1 period for each constituent at 6 tide gauge sites is presented in fig 28 the model with no w d is shown by the grey bars as a reference the model with w d is shown by green where the deviation is less than that of the model with no w d and red where it is larger in most cases other than at the nes site the model with w d is closer to the observational values for most constituents as discussed earlier at the nes site the w d model dries out unlike the observations and so in this assessment performs poorly for this reason similar gauges in the domain that also dry out in the model but not in the observations are omitted from the analysis the nes site is included here to illustrate the difficulty with such sites the above assessment is only a preliminary one covering a limited area of a proto amm15 domain further configuration optimisation and domain wide assessment will need to be done nevertheless it shows that within the limited area of focus of the wadden sea the inclusion of the w d process and the resultant freedom to remove the minimum depth restriction on the bathymetry yields better representation of the shallow water tides in areas of particularly shallow depth it has also highlighted the need for careful consideration of the model s representation of the bathymetry near tide gauges used to assess the model performance 5 concluding summary and discussion the wetting and drying w d scheme that has recently been implemented in nemo version 4 has been described in some detail in section 2 the scheme is based on that of warner et al 2013 which in turn built on oey 2005 and has some similarities to the flather and heaps 1975 scheme its main characteristic is that the depth mean barotropic velocity at each point and sub time step are limited set to zero when the depth of the nearest tracer cell in the upwind direction falls below a critical dry depth d crit nemo uses a c grid and a split explicit time stepping scheme carefully formulated to respect the continuity equation this allows our scheme to employ a flux form for tracer advection our scheme adjusts the baroclinic velocities i e the departures from the depth mean in the same way that it adjusts the barotropic velocities it requires a suitable choice of upwind advection scheme for both tracers and momentum to avoid undesirable oscillatory behaviour in the solutions it also allows an option for tapering out the flux limiter gradually between the depths d crit and d taper the scheme is primarily intended for use in large scale 2d storm tide predictions and 3d simulations physical and biogeochemical simulations of regions like the north west european shelf nonetheless with the aim of improving our understanding of the sensitivities limitations robustness and performance of the scheme and following other authors we have applied the scheme to a number of idealised case studies and summarised our findings in section 3 sections 3 1 1 3 1 3 show and briefly explain why our scheme does not encounter the difficulties with tidal ebb and flow in 1d channels involving simple slopes described by balzano 1998 section 3 1 4 shows that the scheme also performs well for oscillatory flow in a parabolic bowl and that the results are rather sensitive to the grid resolution used fig 9 section 3 1 5 compares our simulations of 1d dam break flows to analytical solutions for dam breaks into initially dry or wet regions it shows that our simulations depend on both the specification of d crit and the initial water depth in dry regions with suitable choices and grid resolution our scheme is able to simulate reasonably well both the bore generated by dam break into a wet region and dam break into an initially dry region figs 10 and 11 section 3 1 6 used this understanding to develop successful simulations of 2d dam break laboratory experiments furthermore test cases in sections 3 1 1 3 1 6 are shown to preserve an initially constant uniform temperature and salinity throughout the integrations this is an important result with regards to tracer conservation section 3 2 explored alternative options for limiting the baroclinic velocities as well as the barotropic velocities in a consistent manner section 3 3 showed that using a tapered flux limiter can reduce noise in the barotropic velocities and allow larger time steps to be taken in the case of hydraulically controlled flow similar to that over a weir fig 21 finally section 4 demonstrates that the scheme runs stably in a simulation of the north west european shelf without requiring a reduction in the time step a preliminary comparison of the results with tide gauges in resolved channels in the wadden sea shows significant improvement fig 28 some careful re evaluation of the model bathymetry and frictional parameters could be required to obtain full benefit from the w d scheme the w d simulations dry out at some tide gauge locations so some assessment of the model s representation of each tide gauge e g which model point s best represent the tide gauge is also required many idealised test cases have been assembled by delestre et al 2013 and it would no doubt be of value to explore them further it would be useful to attempt a more structured approach to this than has been made here for example different types of flow problems and numerical issues could be identified ideally the dependence of the performance and numerical stability of w d schemes on non dimensional parameters of the grid resolution and the flow properties e g velocities and depths would be clarified idealised test cases and parameter settings particularly relevant to operational storm surge predictions could be identified there are clearly many lines of investigation that could be pursued and despite the fact that this is not a new area of study the current paper has barely scratched their surface the scheme described in this paper could also almost certainly be further developed the characteristics of turbulence and drag in shallow water could be refined following burchard et al 2004 and the characterisation of the sea bottom e g its roughness improved in this paper we have restricted the vertical coordinate to pure σ development of the scheme to allow the use of hybrid z and s coordinates is another avenue for further investigation that may allow a reduction in the need for pre smoothing of bathymetry whilst there are many further avenues to explore this scheme provides a simple and computationally efficient method to allow w d processes in a standard structured fixed grid model with minimal intrusion into the model code the validation from simple test cases through to a proto amm15 regional configuration provides a firm foundation upon which to build a future operational system without the limitations of imposing a minimum bathymetric depth of

23942,wetting and drying processes in shallow water systems by surges tides and seiches have important societal physical and biological impacts operational 3d regional models are of sufficient resolution o 1 km that the processes of wetting and drying need to be included here we describe a flux limiter based approach that allows a numerical ocean model with a flux formulation of tracer advection to wet and dry the flux limiter approach limits the outflow from a cell whose depth is below a critical value defined by the user the limiter can be a step function or a smooth function of the water depth the latter increases model stability and avoids rapid alternation between dry and wet states on long slopes as the critical depth is approached furthermore the user may proportionally limit the baroclinic fluxes as a cell transitions from wet to dry over the course of the large baroclinic time step the simplicity of the flux limiter approach lends itself to its application within existing numerical models without significant intrusion into the code base in this paper the vertical coordinate is restricted to pure terrain following coordinates with no z like steps we explore the scheme s effectiveness sensitivities and limitations within the 3d nemo ocean model by assessing it using test cases of increasing complexity it is shown to perform well in classic channel test cases and 2d parabolic test cases with analytic solutions all test cases with initially uniform temperature and salinity preserve this initial condition throughout the wetting and drying phases the scheme s performance against analytical 1d dam break experiments is explored and used to interpret its performance against laboratory measurements of a 2d dam break it is also shown to run stably for a realistic 3d regional domain of the north west european shelf and to improve some aspects of the model s performance against tide gauges keywords wetting and drying flux limiter storm surge tide

resolution the variation in the shore line is appreciable in some regions furthermore models which do not allow grid cells to wet and dry typically specify a minimum depth for their wet cells on the north west european shelf the tidal range is several metres and the minimum depth of wet cells is usually taken to be of order 10 m this minimum depth is likely to affect the tidal propagation and other aspects of the simulation higher resolution simulations of the currents sediments and ecosystems of near coastal waters and estuaries are even more dependent on accurate simulation of variations in the shore line the flow governed by the shallow water equations in a time varying domain is relevant to the modelling of rivers and dam breaks as well as tidal and estuarine waters these equations admit solutions such as shocks and bores in which the solutions have discontinuities consequently a large number of methods have been developed to address them for example some authors allow the grid to evolve with the flow lynch and gray 1980 whilst others use riemann solvers with carefully chosen upwind advection schemes zoppou and roberts 2000 toro 2009 to represent bores with high accuracy we will restrict our discussion below to models which use a static grid and a c grid discretisation although a number of authors focus on implicit time stepping methods angeloudis et al 2018 balzano 1998 stelling and duinmeijer 2003 zhang et al 2016 our focus will be on split explicit time step solvers in which the depth average barotropic motions are simulated using the shallow water equations with a short time step and the departures from the depth average are simulated with a longer time step the distinguishing features of wetting and drying w d schemes can be explained by the situation depicted in fig 1 which shows a thin film of water on bathymetry that is steeply sloping downward to the right the surface pressure gradient on this film of water will strongly accelerate it down the slope leaving no water on its up slope side the key issue is how to limit the flux of water out of the tracer cell centred at x i through its down slope face at point x i 1 2 whilst allowing flow through this face when the flow reverses the various schemes specify criteria under which the depth of the flow through the face is considered to be zero so that no flux through that face is permitted some of the schemes also modify the specification of terms in the momentum equation either reducing them to take account of the shallowness of the water burchard et al 2004 and or adjusting the surface pressure gradient in order to reduce the down slope acceleration the scheme we have implemented is based on warner et al 2013 wdha hereafter which exploited ideas proposed by oey 2005 these authors specify some ocean grid points to be permanently dry the other grid points may be fully wet or dry these dry points are not allowed to have zero depth instead they are covered by a thin film of water so that the equations of motion can be calculated at all grid points in wdha the key idea is that the direction of the flow is determined at each of the faces of a tracer cell and the flux and velocity through the face is set to zero if the depth of the upstream tracer cell is less than or equal to a user specified critical depth d crit the scheme of flather and heaps 1975 is equivalent to this scheme if the direction of the flow is determined by the direction of the surface pressure gradient this paper has two main aims first in section 2 it describes in more detail the wetting and drying w d scheme we have implemented in the nemo model madec et al 2017 second in sections 3 and 4 it assesses and explores the performance of nemo using this scheme in a variety of test cases balzano 1998 assessed the performance of a number of w d schemes sections 3 1 1 3 1 3 compare our results with his for a number of 1d channel test cases of increasing complexity section 3 1 4 then compares our solutions for oscillations within a paraboloid with the analytical solutions of thacker 1981 and the simulations described by balzano 1998 a large number of steady state and time varying analytical solutions for test cases have been assembled by delestre et al 2013 we explore the simulation of two 1d dam break problems in section 3 1 5 these simulations give significant insight into our simulations of the 2d dam break experiments performed by fraccarollo and toro 1995 section 3 1 6 compares our solutions with these experimental measurements and the solutions of wdha and others all test cases in sections 3 1 1 3 1 6 are initialised with uniform constant temperature and salinity domain wide this initial condition is preserved throughout the integrations section 3 2 illustrates the impact on the vertical profiles of tracers of alternative schemes for reducing the vertical variation of the flow in cells as they dry out the final section 3 3 of section 3 illustrates the impacts of smoothing the transition to no flux through a cell face as the upwind cell dries out section 4 describes an implementation of the scheme in a 3d configuration covering the north west european shelf and briefly describes its impacts on the simulations by comparison with tide gauge measurements section 5 provides a concluding summary and discussion 2 wetting drying methodology 2 1 assumptions our w d scheme is intended for use in an ocean model with a standard static c grid that did not consider w d in its original development one of the scheme s design aims is to minimise the changes to the model code the scheme assumes that the ocean model conserves volume and uses 1 a c grid for the horizontal placement of the tracers and horizontal velocities 2 a terrain following coordinate at points that may become dry 3 a free surface with layers whose thickness varies with the free surface height i e σ layers or mixed z σ layers 4 a split explicit time step scheme for the external barotropic mode 5 a flux form for the advection of tracers and momentum 6 an upwind scheme for the calculation of the fluxes of tracers and momentum 7 a pre existing land sea mask 8 and the boussinesq approximation in nemo the free surface described in the third point is based on the formulation of adcroft and campin 2004 in deep water which is typically about 4000 m deep external gravity waves travel at about 200 m s this fast wave speed motivates the fourth point which states that the external mode is advanced using a much smaller explicit time step than that used for the other components it is calculated using the depth mean currents referred to as the barotropic currents and the height of the free surface the baroclinic currents are defined as the total currents minus the barotropic currents the longer time step used for components other than the barotropic mode is referred to as the baroclinic time step except for diffusion the baroclinic step in nemo uses a leapfrog scheme with a robert asselin filter leclair and madec 2009 for horizontal diffusion a forward time scheme is used and for vertical diffusion a backward implicit time scheme is used the split explicit scheme for the barotropic mode used in nemo is based on the formulation of shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the time stepping of the fast barotropic mode in the time splitting algorithm uses a three time step generalised forward backward algorithm in nemo a forward backward algorithm following shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 is used as mentioned earlier for the treatment of shocks it is important to use a suitable upwind scheme for the calculation of fluxes zoppou and roberts 2000 the simulations presented here use the 3rd order upstream biased scheme ubs in nemo version 4 also known as the cell averaged quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme leonard 1995 2 2 notation and definition of layer depths and dry cells as depicted in fig 2 we denote the depth of the bathymetry relative to a chosen geopotential surface s g by h and the surface height relative to s g by η t the total water column depth h t at any time t is thus given by h η t the water column may be divided into k vertical layers with the thickness of the k th layer at a time t given by e 3 k t the reference depths of the layers at a nominal time t 0 are specified when the free surface coincides with s g then η 0 0 and 1 h k 1 k e 3 k 0 point 2 asserts that the depths of the layers vary as the surface height varies in proportion to their reference values 2 e 3 k t e 3 k 0 h η t h in order to avoid negative or zero values of h the surface s g should be chosen to be higher than any grid point which may become wet a vertical column of tracer cells is defined to be dry if the depth of water within it h η t is less than a user specified value d crit the value of d crit depends on the application for real world cases with complex steep bathymetry it may be of the order of a few centimetres for simplified idealised test cases it may be less than a millimetre for real world cases and unless explicitly stated to the contrary in the test cases when the model is initialised at rest the minimum depth criterion is enforced that is if the actual initial depth h η t 0 d crit then the initial depth is set equal to d crit by initialising the model surface height as η t 0 d crit h the prognostic equations are evaluated at all the sea points dictated by the model s pre existing land sea mask at every baroclinic time step and barotropic sub step we will describe how the w d scheme is applied first on each barotropic sub step and then on each baroclinic step 2 2 1 on each barotropic sub step as in wdha the central constraint enforced by the w d scheme is that there is no outward flux of water through any face of a dry cell as the model uses a c grid once the direction of the depth integrated flow at any face of a tracer cell is calculated the upstream tracer cell can be determined and the constraint enforced in addition to setting the mass fluxes out of dry cells to zero we also set their velocities to zero on each barotropic sub step the acceleration of the flow at the faces of the cells is calculated and used together with velocities on the previous time steps to determine the direction of the flow in or out of each cell this avoids the velocities out of dry cells accelerating to large values it also means that the velocities at the faces of a dry cell reflect the momentum of the flow through the face we found that the abrupt imposition of the flux limiter as either on or off at a hard defined d crit cut off can lead to rapid alternation between wet and dry states and or grid scale noise thus our scheme includes an option to apply the flux limiter gradually as the depth reduces from d taper towards d crit as the critical depth is approached the fluxes and velocities across the cell face can be multiplied by a factor α wd t which is given by 3 α wd t 0 for h η t d crit tanh 50 h η t d crit d crit for d crit h η t d taper 1 for h η t d taper the value of d taper is a user defined variable but throughout this study we take it as twice d crit with this choice of d crit as h η t approaches d taper α wd t is very nearly 1 and any jump is numerically insignificant other choices for d taper and cheaper tapering functions are clearly possible but have not been explored although this approach can reduce unwanted noise it can also act as if there is an extra friction term similar to schemes such as burchard et al 2004 it is anticipated that this gradual application of the flux limiter to avoid noise may come at the cost of slowing propagation of the wet dry interface as in the schemes that modify the friction term balzano 1998 the sum of the fluxes through each of the faces of the tracer cells during the barotropic sub steps must be calculated to give the total flux over the baroclinic time step with the predictor corrector method for the split explicit free surface described in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 this involves the use of consistent time filters for the calculation of the free surface η and depth integrated velocities u v at the new time step t n 1 and u v averaged between steps t n and t n 1 see section 3 2 and fig 15 of shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the time mean of the volume fluxes through the four faces of the water column at each tracer point must sum to the change in volume of that water column the fluxes out of a tracer cell as it approaches d crit can result in tracer cells with water depths slightly less than d crit the water depth in these cells is not rounded up this is necessary to ensure that the volume of water including water depths in dry cells is strictly conserved by the scheme and this imposes a practical limit on how small d crit can be set we have confirmed that w d integrations in which the potential temperature t and salinity s are initially uniform retain these original values of t and s at every grid point to an accuracy broadly consistent with machine precision 2 2 2 on each baroclinic time step the barotropic volume fluxes summed over the barotropic sub steps are required to compute the barotropic velocities in the baroclinic time step in particular they are used within the calculation of the fluxes at the faces of the tracer cells this consistency between the volume changes in the barotropic sub steps and the calculation of fluxes in the baroclinic step is required to ensure that an ocean state with uniform tracer values maintains those values shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 section 1 3 our scheme appears to differ in this respect from the description on page 56 of wdha who say that they set their umask wet and vmask wet values either to 0 or 1 based on the average of all the barotropic sub steps it seems that their scheme is intended for calculation of tracers by an advective formulation u t rather than a flux formulation u t whilst the flux limiter as defined thus far would ensure the fluxes through the faces are consistent between the baroclinic and barotropic time steps the limiter would have no impact on the residual baroclinic velocities in a dry cell if no further action was taken even when a cell is completely dry residual baroclinic velocities could still exist in an initially vertically sheared flow so we multiply the baroclinic fluxes and velocities by the factor α c equal to the mean value of the flux limiters α wd t on the n barotropic sub steps 4 α c 1 n t 1 n α wd t this allows some baroclinic velocities to occur as a cell transitions from wet to dry over the long baroclinic time step the impact of alternative options for the baroclinic fluxes is assessed in section 3 2 3 assessments using idealised test cases unless otherwise stated in this section no explicit lateral diffusion is applied the advection schemes being upstream biased have an implicit biharmonic diffusion all the idealised experimental data original source code and figure plotting code are freely available from o dea 2019 readme notes are included to allow all of the experiments to be reproduced 3 1 classical w d test cases 3 1 1 1d uniformly sloping basin the scheme is tested first in the simple uniformly sloping 1d channel considered by both falconer and owens 1987 and balzano 1998 the case is described as one dimensional 1d because the flow is taken to be independent of the cross channel coordinate y and there is only one layer in the vertical the channel is 13800 m long and 5 m deep at an open boundary on its left hand end it slopes uniformly from this open boundary up to a depth of zero at a closed boundary at the far end we use the same open boundary condition as balzano 1998 that is a sinusoidal variation in water level with an amplitude of 2 m and a period of 43200 s falconer and owens 1987 used a different period of 32400 s in keeping with the balzano 1998 experiments we implement a manning strickler bed friction formula with the bed friction coefficient defined as c d g k 2 h η 1 3 here as in balzano 1998 k 50 m 1 3 s 1 is the strickler coefficient h η is the water column depth and g is gravitational acceleration the time step used is t 600 s our experiments differ from balzano 1998 in that balzano used schemes that are implicit in time whereas we have used a split explicit time step for the external mode fig 3 shows the ebb and flood phases of the flow in exactly the same way as in balzano 1998 the surface elevation η is shown for each time step the lines with additional circles marking the lines for every 5 th step it may appear at first sight that on the flooding phase there are undesirable wiggles in the surface height on the upper part of the slope but this is an artefact of the plotting method which connects the height of the last wet grid point to its adjacent dry grid point in balzano 1998 a number of the w d schemes investigated had issues with undesired grid scale variations in the flooding stage which are absent from fig 3 3 1 2 slope with bottom convexity balzano 1998 also shows that a simple modification of the linear slope experiment with what he terms a bottom convexity can result in problems for w d schemes fig 4 shows the equivalent test in nemo with our flux limiter scheme the channel is as in the linear slope experiment except that the bottom has been modified by raising point 9 to the same level as point 10 the boundary conditions are the same as in section 3 1 1 balzano 1998 shows that problems can arise with schemes preventing the flow over the convexity as the tide ebbs fig 4 shows that these problems do not arise in our nemo simulations during the ebbing phase fig 4 a as the depth at point 9 becomes small the friction becomes relatively large and the flow rate is small but it remains non zero as the tide floods the domain again fig 4 b the water level continues to reduce at points 9 and 10 until the returning flood elevation is higher at point 8 than at point 9 three factors could account for the fact that the difficulties in some of the simulations described by balzano 1998 are absent from our simulations the first relates to the definition of the bathymetries in nemo the bathymetry at the velocity points the faces of the tracer cells is determined by linear interpolation of the bathymetry at the tracer points as shown in fig 1 by contrast balzano 1998 took the bathymetry at the tracer points to be calculated by linear interpolation of the bathymetry at the velocity points as illustrated in fig 5 this design choice was made with the aim of increasing the effective resolution of bathymetry if one takes the surface height at velocity points to be calculated by linear interpolation of the heights at tracer points it is clear from fig 5 that the depth at the u point will dry out prematurely on the ebb phase of the tide this convexity issue does not arise with the nemo bathymetry balzano recognised that his definition of the bathymetry could have been poorly suited to some of the schemes that he tested the bea scheme of benqué et al 1982 for example was originally designed for a different choice of grid the second and third factors relate to the form of interpolation used by our scheme to determine whether a cell face is wet or dry following wdha and flather and heaps 1975 the depth of the water layer rather than the height of the sea surface is interpolated in our scheme the second factor and the interpolation is performed by looking up stream rather than by linear interpolation the third factor 3 1 3 drying tests of 1d channel with reservoir the last in our series of simple 1d channel test cases concerns draining from a reservoir in this case the basin starts entirely underwater with an initial surface level of 2 0 m it is emptied over 100 h initially using a sinusoidal boundary condition as in 3 1 however once the boundary reaches 2 0 m it is fixed at 2 0 m leading to an asymptotic drain of the entire basin balzano 1998 shows that with the schemes he considered and the bathymetry defined at the u points some schemes cannot drain out of the reservoir correctly fig 6 shows the surface elevation in the channel after 100 h with our model and that there is no issue with drainage from the reservoir the critical depth d crit at point 8 will be the limiting depth for elevation inside the reservoir at point 9 3 1 4 free oscillations in a paraboloid basin balzano 1998 quantifies the accuracy of a set of wetting and drying schemes using a 2d test case with an analytic solution derived in thacker 1981 we also use this test case to assess the flux limiter scheme implemented in nemo the experiment consists of a frictionless basin defined by a paraboloid of revolution with a mass of water freely oscillating within it with a free surface that is also a paraboloid the basin depicted by the blue curve in fig 7 has a depth d x y given by 5 d d 0 1 x 2 y 2 l 2 where d 0 is the water depth at x 0 y 0 for the equilibrium level η 0 and l is the radius of the horizontal circular cross section of the paraboloid at η 0 the equilibrium shoreline is given by x 2 y 2 l 2 balzano compared his simulations with a specific solution from thacker in which coriolis acceleration terms are omitted the analytical expressions for the horizontal velocities and surface elevation are given by 6 u 1 2 ω x a sin ω t 1 a cos ω t v 1 2 ω y a sin ω t 1 a cos ω t 7 η d 0 1 a 2 1 a c o s ω t 1 x 2 y 2 l 2 1 a 2 1 a cos ω t 2 1 where 8 ω 2 8 g d 0 l 2 a d 0 η 0 2 d 0 2 d 0 η 0 2 d 0 2 and η 0 is the elevation at x 0 y 0 at time t 0 eq 7 is equivalent to eq 21 in balzano 1998 1 1 in balzano s equation there appears to be a typographic error for the first denominator term which ought to be 1 a cos ω t and the numerator which should be 1 a 2 see 51 of thacker 1981 for our baseline experiment we retain the same model resolution and domain as in balzano the period t and bowl depth d are chosen to be t 12 h and d 0 50 m which requires that l 430 620 km at x 0 y 0 the initial elevation η 0 2 m following balzano 1998 we use a numerical grid of 200 by 200 points such that the grid size is δ x δ y 4758 232 m and a time step of δ t 300 s the initial surface elevation η x y t 0 is depicted as the purple curve in fig 7 a comparison of the model and analytic solutions is shown in fig 8 a perturbation in the model solution emanates from the wetting and drying interface the methods that performed well for this test case in balzano 1998 the wut and wwu methods proposed by him are also upstream methods it can be seen as variations in the numerical solutions about the analytic solutions in fig 8 a there is a small loss of about 1 5 in amplitude at 12 h in the numerical solutions which can just be seen in fig 8 b and is more clearly evident in the inset in the top right of fig 8 b which focuses on the solutions near x 0 the test is severe with no bottom friction nor diffusion and the quality of the results shown here is comparable to the best of the schemes considered in balzano 1998 we conducted sensitivity experiments to model parameters and found that the perturbations have a clear dependency on model resolution fig 9 compares the baseline experiment with an experiment with a horizontal resolution refined by a factor of 4 from 4 758 km to 1 189 km clearly the perturbations in surface elevation are greatly diminished in the higher resolution simulation the perturbations are more clearly visible in the barotropic velocity as shown in fig 9 b the above experiments were conducted with no addition of explicit diffusion on momentum we also conducted further experiments with diffusion explicitly added this smoothed the perturbations at the wet and dry interface but increased the decay rate of the oscillating free surface 3 1 5 frictionless one dimensional dam break experiments we consider next two classical frictionless one dimensional dam break problems solved using the shallow water equations first that of a dam break into a completely dry horizontal bottom for which the analytic solution was derived by ritter 1892 the second problem solved by stoker 1957 is the same as the first except that the dam breaks into a region initially occupied by still water of some prescribed depth lower than the water retained by the dam as the dry areas in nemo cannot be set to be of exactly zero depth the numerical model solves a problem similar to that solved by stoker in this sub section we conduct some experiments in which the initial dry depth is allowed to be significantly smaller than d crit to explore to what extent our method is able to reproduce the stoker and ritter solutions solutions for both analytic cases can be readily computed within the shallow water analytic solutions for hydraulic and environmental studies swashes library delestre et al 2013 the purpose of the swashes library is to help users of shallow water based models to easily find an adaptable benchmark library to validate numerical methods in the following experiment both h and s g are 0 thus the water depth h t is exactly equal to the free surface height η the experiment consists of a dam at point x x 0 with a reservoir of water of constant initial depth h l retained behind a dam for x x 0 there is also a dry region downstream of the dam for x x 0 the two problems are distinguished by whether the downstream region is exactly dry or has some still water of uniform depth 0 h r h l the initial water depth is defined by 9 h x h l for 0 x x 0 h r for x 0 x x l and the initial velocity by u x 0 0 m s the dam breaks instantaneously and the water flows from the region of depth h l to the left into the region of depth h r to the right for ritter s problem h r 0 and there are three zones in the solution the analytic evolution in time of the solution across the three zones in the domain is 10 h x t h l if x x a t 4 9 g g h l x x 0 2 t 2 if x a t x x b r t 0 if x b r t x where 11 x a t x 0 t g h l and x b r t x 0 2 t g h l for stoker s problem h r 0 and there is an additional zone behind a bore whose height h m does not change with time the time evolving solution across the 4 regions is 12 h x t h l if x x a t 4 9 g g h l x x 0 2 t 2 if x a t x x b s t c m 2 g if x b s t x x c t h r if x c t x where 13 x a t x 0 t g h l x b s t x 0 t 2 g h l 3 c m 14 x c t x 0 t 2 c m 2 g h l c m c m 2 g h r and 15 8 g h r c m 2 g h l c m 2 c m 2 g h r 2 c m 2 g h r 0 we note that ritter s and stoker s solutions are the same for x x b s and that h in stoker s solution is discontinuous at x c the front of the bore from 12 the height of stoker s bore h b relative to h r is given by c m 2 g h r dividing 15 by g h r 3 one can write it as a 6 th order polynomial for h b h r whose coefficients depend on h l h r table 1 shows the values of h b h r calculated from the roots of the polynomial for some values of h l h r that are relevant to the discussion of the numerical experiments below our numerical experiments have a domain from x 1 25 m to x 1 25 m with the dam break located at x 0 0 the initial height in the reservoir is set at h l 1 0 m the grid resolution δ x 0 0025 m and the time step is δ t 0 00001 s different values of d crit are used to illustrate its impact fig 10 compares the model solution against stoker s analytic solution given by 12 15 using an initial depth h r 0 001 m and d crit 1 0 6 m panel a shows the solution for the full domain and panel b shows it in more detail in the region of the bore the bore is simulated quite well and its height agrees well with the value of 66 8 mm shown in table 1 we can attempt to simulate the case where the dam breaks into a dry region by setting both h r and d crit to be very small fig 11 compares two model simulations with stoker s solution when h r 1 0 6 m and according to table 1 the bore height should be around 2 7 mm one of the simulations uses a small value of d crit d crit 1 0 6 m and the other a very large value d crit 1 0 2 m compared with h r the figure also shows ritter s solution for a completely dry bed in the first case the model compares fairly well with ritter s solution however for the large d crit experiment the flux limiter prevents flux into a neighbouring cell until its own depth has reached d crit thus acting as an impedance on the propagation of the flood wave in fig 11 this can be seen manifesting as a bore like feature somewhat resembling the stoker solution caused by the flux limiter we note that the height of the bore is much smaller than that which would be obtained using the value 1 0 2 m that we have used for d crit for h r according to table 1 when h r 1 0 2 m the bore height is about 0 17 m fig 11 b shows a bore slightly smaller than 0 08 m only slightly larger than that obtained using h r 1 0 3 m in large scale simulations with relatively coarse grids the bore will not be resolved by the model grid nonetheless this experiment shows both the potential impact of a non zero water depth in dry areas and the potential for fairly modest values of d crit to delay the propagation of the wet dry interface 3 1 6 two dimensional dam break armed with the information about the impacts of non zero water depths in dry areas and d crit from the previous sub section we now explore a 2d dam break problem that has been investigated extensively both with real laboratory experiments fraccarollo and toro 1995 and subsequent numerical studies ferrari et al 2010 warner et al 2013 the experimental domain consists of a dry region of dimensions 2 m by 2 m downstream of a reservoir of dimensions 1 m by 2 m the reservoir is initially filled to a depth of 0 6 m and a break in the dam between the reservoir and the dry region of width 0 4 m is opened instantaneously water floods over the dry region and is allowed to pour over the sides of the edge of the domain a plane view of the domain is shown in fig 12 the location of the positions of the measurements of surface height in the experiment of fraccarollo and toro 1995 which we evaluate the model against are also plotted on fig 12 analogous to the 1d case the results depend on both the initial non zero depth in the dry region dry ini and the value of d crit fig 13 shows two numerical experiments after 0 5 s both of which used d crit 1 0 4 m the simulation shown on the left has a dry ini 5 1 0 3 m and that on the right the much smaller value of 1 0 4 m the resultant bore like solution with delayed propagation of wave front in the deeper dry initial case on the left side of fig 13 can clearly be seen this can also be seen in fig 14 which shows time series of the surface height at site 13 a the orange dashed and blue solid lines show respectively simulations for the deeper and shallower initial depths with d crit 1 0 4 m the green dotted and red dot dashed lines are also for different initial depths but with d crit 5 1 0 3 m fig 15 similarly enables the dependence on d crit to be visualised for two simulations which both use dry ini 1 0 4 m on the left d crit 5 1 0 3 m and on the right d crit 1 0 4 m as in the 1d case there is a delay in the wave propagation with increased d crit as the water cannot flow into adjacent dry cells until the current cell fills up to the critical depth though the retardation due to the change in d crit is markedly smaller than that due to the corresponding change in the initial dry depth as found in the previous sub section in order to reproduce well the original 2d dam experiment of fraccarollo and toro 1995 we must use both a small initial dry depth and a small value for d crit as nemo is effectively solving the shallow water equations swe we should expect the results to be similar to the swe solutions presented in ferrari et al 2010 those authors also show the results of a numerical experiment with the full 3d non hydrostatic navier stokes equations which give better agreement with the laboratory experiments for the initial transients at longer times the full navier stokes and swe solutions converge fig 16 shows the model simulation at 6 time snapshots in time nemo exhibits the same rarefaction wave and reflections in the reservoir as in the swe simulations of ferrari et al 2010 fig 17 compares simulations made using d crit dry ini 1 0 4 m with the observations of fraccarollo and toro 1995 at four further locations c o 8 a and 5 a as noted by ferrari et al 2010 close to the dam break site where vertical accelerations are large the assumption of the hydrostatic model are invalid however further from the dam break and as the vertical gradients reduce in time the hydrostatic model results agree well with the measured data of particular interest to the w d scheme is the timing and magnitude of the flood wave in to the dry plane which can be seen at site 8 a the model solution here is in good agreement with the measured data 3 2 baroclinic velocity comparison we now investigate the effect of different treatments of the baroclinic velocities when applying the flux limiter the experiments as depicted in fig 18 are made in a simple 1d channel with a linearly sloping bathymetry whose depth is 2 5 m at the open end on the left and 0 m at the opposite end which is closed the initial condition consists of the channel filled with water at rest that has a uniform temperature domain wide and a horizontal gradient in salinity from 35 to 1 from the open end of the channel to the closed end two cases are considered differing only in the equation of state used in one case the equation of state has density only dependent on temperature so that salinity acts as a passive tracer and the vertical shear in the flow is purely a result of the bed friction in the second case both temperature and salinity are used to calculate density using the teos 10 equation of state ioc et al 2010 there is no explicit horizontal diffusion applied the bottom boundary condition consists of a manning strickler bed friction formula with a large strickler coefficient k 200 m 1 3 s 1 to enhance vertical shear in the velocity the open boundary condition linearly lowers η from the initial value 0 m to 1 m over a period of 3 h and then remains at 1 m thereafter the water drains out of the channel until the dry condition is met for the tests presented d crit is set to a relatively large value d crit 0 5 m the numerical domain is 50 points long and has 50 vertical levels the horizontal grid spacing δ x 1000 m and the time step δ t 600 s the large value of d crit is chosen in this case so that the vertical distribution of salinity through depth at the point of drying is clearly visible for each baroclinic timestep there are 50 barotropic substeps each of length 12 s as the water drains out the fresher water at the closed end of the channel is advected towards the open boundary in the passive salinity test case only the bottom friction induces vertical velocity shear and this leads to surface water advecting faster than water near the bed the salinity gradients have been chosen so that in the second case they enhance the vertical current shear in our w d scheme the default option is to scale the baroclinic velocities by the time mean sum over all the barotropic time steps of the factors α wd t that are used to calculate the barotropic velocities see sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 we defined this time averaged value as α c in eq 4 we have explored two alternative options based on algorithms described in wdha one option aint sets the baroclinic velocities to zero if for any of the n sub time steps t the cell is declared dry inside the barotropic sub cycle 16 aint α c 0 if α w d t 0 for any t 1 n 1 if all α w d t 0 t 1 n the second option anint sets the baroclinic velocity to zero if the mean number of times the cell is dry is 0 5 and retains the full baroclinic velocities otherwise 17 anint α c 0 if α c 0 5 1 if α c 0 5 fig 19 shows the salinity distribution in the water remaining in the dry zone after the channel emptied at point x 45 km near the right hand end of the channel obtained using the three options in the aint approach the vertical gradient in salinity is reduced as the baroclinic velocities are set to zero more frequently than the other two cases which are nearly coincident in fig 19 the effect is cumulative as the water flows down the slope leading to greater differences away from the closed end adding the density effect of the salinity increases the baroclinicity and amplifies the effect although the differences are small and reduce as d crit is reduced the effect could be important in estuaries where there may be large horizontal gradients in salinity and large tidal amplitudes and we recommend using the mean value approach to retain the baroclinicity of the flow 3 3 tapering test cases as described in section 2 2 1 the w d scheme may apply the limiter sharply at the value of d crit or optionally taper out the limiter from d crit to d taper the effect of the tapering option is now explored in a simple 1d channel test case the channel is closed at both ends its bathymetry see fig 20 a consists of a small shelf at its left hand end at 0 m depth a linear slope down to 10 m and a flat bottom at 10 m depth in the rest of the domain the initial values for η also shown in fig 20 a are constructed using a linear slope from a height of 1 175 m at the right hand end of the channel to 2 5 m at its left hand end where η h the initial value for η is set as η d crit h the numerical domain has 50 points along the channel with grid step δ x 1 5 km the baroclinic time step is δ t 10 s there are 50 barotropic time steps taken for every baroclinic time step there is no friction applied and the model is run calculating only the barotropic mode once the initial free surface is released it sends a wave from right to left along the channel that is reflected off the opposite end creating both initial wetting and later drying on the left hand side of the domain during the drying phase the flow over the upper part of the shelf is similar to the hydraulically controlled flow over a weir two cases are simulated one with and one without the tapering in both cases d crit 12 cm this value was chosen to ensure both experiments remained stable for the given geometry and time step we found that once d crit 5 cm or less the simulation without a tapering became unstable panels a and b of fig 21 present time series of the barotropic velocities averaged over each baroclinic time step from the simulations at a position 12 km along the channel model point 8 in the hydraulically controlled region just off the shelf when no taper is applied see panel a rapid alternations in the barotropic velocity occur as water flows off the shelf over a period p of about an hour approximately 4 h into the simulation during period p fig 21 c shows that the limiter is applied on all barotropic sub steps in some baroclinic steps but not on others in fig 21 d the tapered limiter is classified as being applied when the depth is less than 2 d crit and it is apparent that during period p the limiter is applied at every barotropic sub step panels e and f of fig 21 show the mean value over each baroclinic time step of the limiter mask and of the tapered coefficient α wd respectively after an initial adjustment at the start of period p the tapered coefficient takes a value which is only slightly smaller than 1 so during period p the tapering is being continuously applied with a value close to 1 panel e shows that in the no taper case the mean value of the flux limiter over any baroclinic step during period p is greater than 0 98 but that it fluctuates more than in the tapered case fig 22 shows output from the two simulations at the same point as before for a short segment near the start of period p on every barotropic sub step fig 22 a shows that in the no taper case the mask is typically only applied for one barotropic sub step before it switches off again whereas in the taper case the flux limiter is applied continuously on every barotropic sub step the modification of the flux by the taper is very small as α wd is only very slightly less than one fig 22 b shows the flux out of the cell minus the flux into it in both simulations the flux out is initially larger than the flux in leading to the water depth falling in the cell in the no taper case the flux is not modified until the depth of the cell is d crit the limiter is then applied so that the flux out is exactly zero and the cell immediately begins to refill as the flux into the cell is unaffected the cell water depth is then again d crit and the flux out can resume until later in time the flux out is again larger than the flux in and in time the critical depth is reached again in the tapered case the very slight reduction in flux as the water depth decreases below d taper slows the outgoing flux until the in going flux is greater and the cell depth starts to increase upon increasing the cell depth the effect of the flux limiter gradually decreases as α wd increases towards one and allows more outgoing flux the effect of this feedback between the difference of ingoing and outgoing fluxes with cell depth is that the outgoing flux is modulated through the flux limiter towards the value of incoming flux this leads to smoother time variations in the cell depth and consequently the velocity field for larger time steps or smaller values of d crit the model without the taper applied becomes unstable before that with the taper applied an additional simulation doubling the value of d crit to 24 cm with no taper also shows rapid changes between dry and wet states thus the taper can enhance the model stability by reducing fluctuations between dry and wet states that the sharp flux cut off generates 4 preliminary assessments of a 3d north west european shelf configuration 4 1 amm15 model configuration with w d we use the atlantic margins model amm15 with 1 5 km horizontal grid spacing to test the w d scheme in a realistic regional ocean configuration amm15 is the current copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems operational model for the northwest european shelf the amm15 domain and bathymetry are shown in fig 23 and graham et al 2018 describe the baseline amm15 configuration in detail only modifications of the amm15 configuration specifically related to w d are presented here the w d code we use was introduced into nemo version 4 0 so we have upgraded the configuration originally based on version 3 6 described by graham et al 2018 to 4 0 as in graham et al 2018 the high resolution emodnet bathymetry emodnet portal september 2015 release was used to derive the amm15 model bathymetry adjusting from the emodnet reference level of lowest astronomical tide lat to mean sea level msl using an estimate of tidal range from a 19 year tidal simulation of the cs3x tidal model of batstone et al 2013 we inherit all the model parameters specified in graham et al 2018 including the baroclinic timestep of 60 s the value of d crit was chosen to be 5 cm values smaller than 2 cm led to instabilities in the model at the given time step unlike graham et al 2018 however the bathymetry is not forced to take a minimum depth of 10 m and its depth is allowed to be negative we found many points in the original emodnet data that are close to the coastline provided by emodnet and that according to that coastline are sea points where the depth of the bathymetry has large negative values e g depths 20 m we have restricted the height of the bathymetry at sea points to be no higher than the tidal maximum calculated using the 2d cs3x model we made these changes to the bathymetry to improve the stability of the model configuration during its initial implementation our rationale for these changes is that only points whose height is less than the tidal maximum should be classified as sea points it is possible that the emodnet data at these high points has been contaminated by sharply sloping on shore orography e g cliffs or bathymetry our test simulations required additional pre smoothing of the bathymetry to ensure pure sigma coordinates are used instead of a mix of z and s coordinates in w d zones the pre smoothing method used is the 1d iterative method of martinho and batteen 2006 with a specified maximum slope parameter of 0 2 in this paper we do not consider the case of using a different number of levels in adjoining grids cells with w d as occurs in hybrid s z coordinates but this will be the subject of further studies it was found that to maintain stability for multi year runs some river points required both the bathymetry to be deepened and the input river flux to be distributed over all vertical levels rather than just the topmost cells these adjustments are probably required because of the very shallow water depths and model layer depths obtained in a model with w d capability there are 50 vertical levels in amm15 resulting in very thin model layers and resultant sensitivity to model time step for some of the largest rivers in the domain the input of river water was also spread over 4 neighbouring horizontal grid sea points to ensure model stability in these experiments there is no special treatment of the shortwave radiation at the seabed one consequence of this is that if the water is optically clear the remaining shortwave flux at the bed in shallow water will be unaccounted for within the model however water in tidally active areas is usually very turbid consequently the short wave flux is likely to be absorbed rapidly by suspended matter in the water column and not penetrate deeply however consideration of a seabed module to deal with fluxes at the bed could be incorporated to improve the model further particularly in the context of ocean atmosphere coupled models as there is no specific seabed module in these experiments we have augmented the treatment of atmospheric surface fluxes for very shallow layers if a cell is declared dry that is h η t d crit then all surface fluxes are set to zero however we also found that some cells with a very shallow depth just greater than d crit could be cooled or heated to excessively high or low temperatures to prevent this a user controlled weighting function that is dependent on cell depth is applied that tapers the surface fluxes towards zero as the critical depth is approached as vast majority of the amm15 domain is ice free throughout the year an ice model is not included in our configuration this omission to include an ice model is down to a trade off between computational cost and model fidelity although not implemented in the model simulations in this paper the model temperature could be constrained not to fall below the local freezing point of sea water in lieu of the more physically satisfying if costly inclusion of a sea ice model the model initial conditions are taken from the long runs of graham et al 2018 and interpolated to the modified amm15 w d model grid surface forcing and lateral boundary conditions are as in graham et al 2018 the surface forcing is derived from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis product era interim dee et al 2011 lateral boundary conditions for the atlantic are taken from the global seasonal forecast system glosea version 5 maclachlan et al 2015 boundary conditions for the baltic open boundary are taken from a regional baltic simulation gräwe et al 2015 tidal forcing at the open boundaries was derived from the topex poseidon cross over solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 tpxo7 2 atlantic ocean 2011 atlas results are presented from two model simulations one with and one without w d the only difference between the simulations is in the specification of the bathymetry at shallow points where the depth is less than 10 m in the w d simulation this shallow bathymetry is left unaltered in the simulation without w d the bathymetric depth at these shallow points is set to the minimum value of 10 m this follows the procedure of graham et al 2018 and prevents any area in the domain from drying out these model simulations cover the period from 1st january 2010 to 31st december 2015 data from the amm15 experiments is available at each tide gauge location together with python scripts to reproduce the plots in this paper in o dea 2019 with a 1 5 km grid amm15 does not resolve in much detail the complicated bathymetry characteristics of many tidal mud flats and estuaries the main advantage of w d at this resolution is that a domain wide minimum depth of 10 m is not enforced however the wadden sea indicated by the blue rectangle in fig 23 and shown in more detail in fig 24 is extensive enough for the 1 5 km grid to resolve some of the larger channels in the w d region fig 24 shows bathymetries between 3 m and 3 m depth for a the amm15 grid and b the emodnet grid whose grid spacing is 1 8 arc minute approximately 230 m much finer grain features of the narrow dendritic drainage channels can be seen in panel b which are largely unresolved by the 1 5 km grid in panel a our assessment focuses on years 2014 2015 as there are a large number of tide gauge observations at 10 minute intervals available for that period in the wadden sea from the bsh north west shelf data portal http nwsportal bsh de fig 24 shows the locations of the tide gauges against which we will compare the model there are further tide gauges available for comparison in this region however the model resolution is insufficient to resolve the fine scale channels as shown in fig 24 in which such tide gauges are located we include the nes tide gauge as a specific case study to emphasise the extra attention and care needed at sites where the bathymetry is insufficiently resolved by the model fig 25 shows in detail the bathymetry around the nes tide gauge in amm15 and the input emodnet bathymetry 4 2 model comparison with tide gauge data fig 26 compares model data from the integrations with and without w d with tide gauge data at the sites oudeschild and nes in the case of the oudeschild tide gauge the agreement between the w d model and the observations is very good and a clear improvement upon the model with no w d can be seen however in the case of the nes tide gauge the model resolution is unable to resolve the narrow channel at this site as seen in fig 25 the w d model dries out completely at the cells marked a and b in fig 25 during the ebb of the tide this prevents any outflow from the nes site and so the water level only varies during the highest point of the tidal phase in effect the water at the nes site becomes an isolated pond left unable to communicate with the rest of the ocean until the tide returns this results in the truncated curve for w d with amm15 seen in fig 26 b if we plotted a bathymetry plot for the case without w d as in fig 25 all sea points would be blue at 10 m as the colour range is only 3 m where the minimum depth is set as 10 m the model has a full tidal cycle and thus at this point gives the appearance of a much better match to the observations than the model with w d we have also computed a model integration with the cells a and b deepened to the depth of the centre of the channel seen in the emodnet bathymetry in 25 b in this integration the volume transport will be larger than it should be but the purpose of the integration is to demonstrate the blocking effect of the coarse resolution and the kind of attention to detail that is required with a model that can wet and dry note there is no alteration to the bathymetry at the nes site itself the simulations with the deepened cells corresponds to the red dot dashed line in fig 26 b as expected the opening of the channel by directly deepening cells a and b allows the water to drain from the nes site in the amm15 model grid during the ebb phase of the tide and thus gives an improved agreement with the tide gauge measurements other tide gauges in this analysis are thus selected at points where amm15 resolves the local bathymetry sufficiently so that the w d model has a full tidal cycle without drying as in the observations for the 2014 2015 period we compute a harmonic analysis of surface elevation for both the tidal observations and model data at the locations shown in fig 24 where observational data is missing in the time series we also omit it from the model data time series to ensure a like for like comparison fig 27 compares the difference from observations of the model with and without w d over one period for each constituent at the oudeschild tide gauge site at this site the model without w d has substantially larger errors for primary constituents m2 s2 and n2 and the shallow water constituents m4 ms4 and mn4 the results show that the transfer of energy from primary constituents to shallow water constituents is more consistent with the observations in the model with w d than without such a difference between the models might be expected given the imposition of the minimum depth of 10 m in the model without w d in order to concisely assess more than one location the maximum deviation over 1 period for each constituent at 6 tide gauge sites is presented in fig 28 the model with no w d is shown by the grey bars as a reference the model with w d is shown by green where the deviation is less than that of the model with no w d and red where it is larger in most cases other than at the nes site the model with w d is closer to the observational values for most constituents as discussed earlier at the nes site the w d model dries out unlike the observations and so in this assessment performs poorly for this reason similar gauges in the domain that also dry out in the model but not in the observations are omitted from the analysis the nes site is included here to illustrate the difficulty with such sites the above assessment is only a preliminary one covering a limited area of a proto amm15 domain further configuration optimisation and domain wide assessment will need to be done nevertheless it shows that within the limited area of focus of the wadden sea the inclusion of the w d process and the resultant freedom to remove the minimum depth restriction on the bathymetry yields better representation of the shallow water tides in areas of particularly shallow depth it has also highlighted the need for careful consideration of the model s representation of the bathymetry near tide gauges used to assess the model performance 5 concluding summary and discussion the wetting and drying w d scheme that has recently been implemented in nemo version 4 has been described in some detail in section 2 the scheme is based on that of warner et al 2013 which in turn built on oey 2005 and has some similarities to the flather and heaps 1975 scheme its main characteristic is that the depth mean barotropic velocity at each point and sub time step are limited set to zero when the depth of the nearest tracer cell in the upwind direction falls below a critical dry depth d crit nemo uses a c grid and a split explicit time stepping scheme carefully formulated to respect the continuity equation this allows our scheme to employ a flux form for tracer advection our scheme adjusts the baroclinic velocities i e the departures from the depth mean in the same way that it adjusts the barotropic velocities it requires a suitable choice of upwind advection scheme for both tracers and momentum to avoid undesirable oscillatory behaviour in the solutions it also allows an option for tapering out the flux limiter gradually between the depths d crit and d taper the scheme is primarily intended for use in large scale 2d storm tide predictions and 3d simulations physical and biogeochemical simulations of regions like the north west european shelf nonetheless with the aim of improving our understanding of the sensitivities limitations robustness and performance of the scheme and following other authors we have applied the scheme to a number of idealised case studies and summarised our findings in section 3 sections 3 1 1 3 1 3 show and briefly explain why our scheme does not encounter the difficulties with tidal ebb and flow in 1d channels involving simple slopes described by balzano 1998 section 3 1 4 shows that the scheme also performs well for oscillatory flow in a parabolic bowl and that the results are rather sensitive to the grid resolution used fig 9 section 3 1 5 compares our simulations of 1d dam break flows to analytical solutions for dam breaks into initially dry or wet regions it shows that our simulations depend on both the specification of d crit and the initial water depth in dry regions with suitable choices and grid resolution our scheme is able to simulate reasonably well both the bore generated by dam break into a wet region and dam break into an initially dry region figs 10 and 11 section 3 1 6 used this understanding to develop successful simulations of 2d dam break laboratory experiments furthermore test cases in sections 3 1 1 3 1 6 are shown to preserve an initially constant uniform temperature and salinity throughout the integrations this is an important result with regards to tracer conservation section 3 2 explored alternative options for limiting the baroclinic velocities as well as the barotropic velocities in a consistent manner section 3 3 showed that using a tapered flux limiter can reduce noise in the barotropic velocities and allow larger time steps to be taken in the case of hydraulically controlled flow similar to that over a weir fig 21 finally section 4 demonstrates that the scheme runs stably in a simulation of the north west european shelf without requiring a reduction in the time step a preliminary comparison of the results with tide gauges in resolved channels in the wadden sea shows significant improvement fig 28 some careful re evaluation of the model bathymetry and frictional parameters could be required to obtain full benefit from the w d scheme the w d simulations dry out at some tide gauge locations so some assessment of the model s representation of each tide gauge e g which model point s best represent the tide gauge is also required many idealised test cases have been assembled by delestre et al 2013 and it would no doubt be of value to explore them further it would be useful to attempt a more structured approach to this than has been made here for example different types of flow problems and numerical issues could be identified ideally the dependence of the performance and numerical stability of w d schemes on non dimensional parameters of the grid resolution and the flow properties e g velocities and depths would be clarified idealised test cases and parameter settings particularly relevant to operational storm surge predictions could be identified there are clearly many lines of investigation that could be pursued and despite the fact that this is not a new area of study the current paper has barely scratched their surface the scheme described in this paper could also almost certainly be further developed the characteristics of turbulence and drag in shallow water could be refined following burchard et al 2004 and the characterisation of the sea bottom e g its roughness improved in this paper we have restricted the vertical coordinate to pure σ development of the scheme to allow the use of hybrid z and s coordinates is another avenue for further investigation that may allow a reduction in the need for pre smoothing of bathymetry whilst there are many further avenues to explore this scheme provides a simple and computationally efficient method to allow w d processes in a standard structured fixed grid model with minimal intrusion into the model code the validation from simple test cases through to a proto amm15 regional configuration provides a firm foundation upon which to build a future operational system without the limitations of imposing a minimum bathymetric depth of

23943,hot spots of sea level variability along the north american east coast have been shown to shift in latitude repeatedly over the past 95 years and connections with a number of forcing phenomena including the north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc have been suggested using a barotropic 1 12 nemo model of the north american east coast to represent the upper ocean and a homogeneous shelf we investigate the coastal sea level response to remote sea surface height ssh variability along the upper continental slope hilbert transform complex eof analysis is used to investigate the responses to interannual changes in the strength of the mean winds and an idealised nao variability in the mean winds produces in phase coastal sea level variability along the entire coastline and is driven by a ssh anomaly in the subpolar gyre variability due to the nao forcing is in phase along the coast south of cape hatteras interannual coastal sea level variability at a given latitude is found to be driven by off shore ssh anomalies originating many degrees of latitude 100s km further north and linear barotropic trapped wave theory is used to explain the mechanism a comparison of the results from an analytical model with those from the numerical model is used to suggest that the boundary wave mechanism is also relevant for understanding the coastal response to interior sea level change over longer time periods nonlinear effects are found not to significantly modify the character of the linear solution keywords sea level changes shelf dynamics topographic waves teleconnections us east coast western boundary 1 introduction in recent years a spotlight has been cast over the local and remote drivers of coastal sea level variability along the north american east coast most recently volkov et al 2019 drew attention to a basin scale tripole sea surface height ssh pattern of variability linked to the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc and north atlantic oscillation nao that was a source of interannual to decadal ssh variability along the southeast coast of the united states as in a number of studies looking at these processes barotropic waves trapped against the western boundary i e the north american east coast land sea boundary are invoked as a possible mechanism for the actual adjustment that occurs between the coast and interior ocean or elsewhere on the shelf the objective of this study is to use an intermediate complexity numerical model including realistic bathymetry and nonlinear terms with analysis methods that reveal the propagation of variability to more thoroughly connect the processes identified by observational studies with the theory of coastally trapped boundary waves the focus is on the influence of the dynamics of the deep ocean interior on the coast rather than sea level changes resulting from local winds over shallow water in this section we first provide an overview of key results from existing studies that have investigated sea level variability along the north american east coast on interannual periods this is followed by a qualitative introduction to how coastal sea level can be connected to interior variability by the mechanism of boundary waves also referred to as coastally trapped waves note that here we use the term interior to refer to the interior open ocean where the effect of sloping bottom topography is small furthermore we use the term shelf to refer to depths less than about 200 m and coast to mean the inner shelf close to the shoreline the continental slope is generally taken to mean the steeply sloping region of bottom topography connecting the shelf and interior though we define this more specifically in section 2 where we describe the numerical model section 2 1 experiments section 2 2 and the method of analysis section 2 3 following this we present our results and discuss them in relation to the results of previous studies section 3 2 boundary wave theory which we explain with a specific example section 3 3 and nonlinear effects section 3 4 finally we discuss our results in a broader context and then conclude with a summary 1 1 sea level variability along the north american east coast coastal hot spots of accelerated sea level rise and variability have the potential to add to any global mean sea level rise making the adjacent coast vulnerable to shorter time scale events that can cause flooding for example storm surges the mechanisms that govern these hot spots are therefore of particular interest using observations sallenger et al 2012 identified a hot spot along 1000 km of the north american coastline north of cape hatteras where the rate of increase of sea level rise was of order 3 4 times larger than the global average during 1980 2009 while it remains debated they suggested the sea level rise might be associated with a slowdown of the amoc in addition to the amoc a number of processes both local and remote have been investigated as drivers of this hot spot and assigning causality between sea level anomalies and forcing more generally has been shown to be complex due to the coupling of driving phenomena kenigson et al 2018 suggest that changes in the local wind stress particularly alongshore linked to the nao are strongly related with sea level anomalies north of cape hatteras similarly piecuch et al 2016 show annual coastal sea level changes north of cape hatteras to be driven by wind stress over the continental shelf and slope and highlight the apparent dominance of barotropic dynamics in the adjustment of coastal sea level to forcing furthermore the anticorrelation between coastal sea level north of the cape and overturning circulation at 26n is suggested by piecuch et al 2019 not to be causal but instead driven by temporally coherent but different forcing mechanisms in the case of the former local alongshore wind and air surface pressure are responsible and in the latter zonal wind stress along 26n is responsible though they note the potential role of large scale atmospheric modes of variation linking them such as the nao in terms of remote drivers over a 50 year period of observations 1965 2014 frederikse et al 2017 found a strong correlation between coastal sea level north of the cape and decadal steric variability in the subpolar gyre the steric height showed an upward sea level trend and acceleration which is also found along the coast they suggest the variability likely originates in the labrador sea from where it propagates southward the linkage between coastal sea level and the labrador sea is also noted by andres et al 2013 with a similar correlation map though they note the mechanism of propagation onto the shelf is not clear sea level variability along the north american east coast is subject to regional differences north and south of cape hatteras where the gulf stream separates from the western boundary this has led to investigations into the connection between the gulf stream and coastal sea level in particular ezer et al 2013 and ezer 2019 suggest that changes in the strength of the gulf stream and its position relative to the middle atlantic bight north of cape hatteras affects sea level gradients they conclude that a strong gulf stream leads to lower coastal sea level in the middle atlantic bight while the effect is reduced south of the cape variability in the strength of the gulf stream can itself of course be a consequence of large scale forcing variability valle levinson et al 2017 show that between 2011 and 2015 sea level rise actually decelerated north of cape hatteras while accelerating to 3 times the global mean south of the cape the latter phenomenon also being reported by park and sweet 2015 valle levinson et al 2017 show this sea level rise hot spot to be active over the past 95 years with a shifting latitude they suggest that the existence of the hot spot is conditional upon the cumulative effects of el niño and that the latitudinal position depends on the cumulative effects of the nao the acceleration of sea level rise south of the cape has also been attributed to a 0 2 c per year warming of the florida current and the deceleration north of the cape to a combination of increased atmospheric surface pressure changing wind patterns and cooling domingues et al 2018 volkov et al 2019 suggest that sea level south of the cape is largely driven by large scale meridional heat transport influenced by the amoc stronger mean heat transport by the florida current leads to higher thermosteric sea level in the interior ocean at mid latitudes which is then coherent with coastal sea level and they show the very large scale first mode of variability of ssh steric and thermosteric sea levels to have a similar tripole spatial pattern they also point to the large scale atmospheric forcing with a positive nao also leading to higher interior sea level across the same latitude band the nao shifts the zero wind stress curl line northward and increases its zonal tilt i e the eastern portion of the zero wind stress curl is shifted farther northward the nao results in a more zonal zero wind stress curl this feature of the nao in terms of ocean circulation has been discussed by marshall et al 2001 in terms of sea level the resulting increase or decrease in interior ssh near cape hatteras appears to influence the ssh on the shelf along the florida coastline remote forcing from the interior ocean has also been put forward as an explanation for large interannual to decadal variability in the amplitude of the sea level annual cycle south of cape hatteras calafat et al 2018 they suggest that larger amplitudes in the annual cycle coherent along much of the coast from cape hatteras into the gulf of mexico are the result of density anomalies in the interior ocean travelling westward towards the western boundary they note that larger annual cycle amplitudes correspond with larger annual upper mid ocean transport which would be explained by a larger pressure gradient between eastern and western boundaries of the atlantic this latter point clearly brings into focus the connection between western boundary sea level and the amoc discussed in detail by bingham and hughes 2009 and little et al 2019 with consequences for meridional heat transport zhai et al 2011 and thereby also the climate clearly there are a number of forcing phenomena that are correlated with coastal sea level variability however in order to explain the spatial distribution of coastal sea level variability we must also consider the actual process of adjustment between the coast and interior ocean linear theory with idealised geometry and bathymetry suggests that western boundary sea level is determined by what occurs poleward of the point being considered wise et al 2018 2020 minobe et al 2017 but this neglects any possible role of advection by a boundary current this work takes the next step by considering realistic bathymetry and allowing nonlinear terms so that advection of potential vorticity is accounted for 1 2 boundary waves because the western boundary acts like a wall a flow approaching the coast must either diverge in the along shore direction or sink to become balanced by an offshore bottom ekman flow implying that the dynamics at the coast are not as they are in the interior ocean this has important consequences for how sea level variability is spatially distributed along the coastline and draws attention to the role of the continental slope in separating the shelf from the interior ocean while ssh anomalies can spread relatively slowly via advection by the current here we look at the quicker mechanism of signal propagation by waves trapped to the coast boundary huthnance 1975 1978 huthnance 1987 chapman and brink 1987 and huthnance 2004 show that in idealised experiments with stratification forcing in the interior ocean due to wind stress or density gradients elicits an essentially barotropic response along the shelf which propagates over long distances with the boundary on the right in the northern hemisphere these waves are trapped in the sense that they decay in amplitude away from the boundary for eastern boundaries clarke and van gorder 1994 show that at typical el niño southern oscillation enso frequencies on shelf sea level sea level on the shelf signals travel poleward with a reduction in amplitude as latitude increases using isopycnal models validated with altimetry roussenov et al 2008 find that changes in high latitude forcing are communicated along the western north atlantic continental slope by boundary waves over several thousand kilometres the result is coherent signals in ssh and bottom pressure variability over large distances see also hughes and meredith 2006 and hughes et al 2018 the body of literature investigating coastally trapped waves ctw in various settings is extensive see hughes et al 2019 brink 1991 huthnance et al 1986 and mysak 1980 for reviews here by assuming that the response on the shelf and upper slope is dominated by barotropic dynamics as studies noted above suggest we focus specifically on barotropic waves which can also be thought of as waves in a homogeneous upper layer of the ocean that is grounded on the sea floor between the upper slope and coast i e its lower surface is in contact with the shelf and upper slope offshore the layer represents only the upper portion of the water column and is considered to have a motionless rigid ocean beneath which does not exchange any fluid with the upper layer this simplification allows us to model the barotropic adjustment at the coast to an interior ssh anomaly regardless of which specific forcing phenomenon produced it i e wind or density induced ssh anomaly we simply relate coastal sea level to the interior sea level remote forcing for example fluctuations in wind stress in the interior ocean produce a ssh anomaly in the interior ocean that elicits a response on the shelf and slope remote forcing for annual to decadal forcing periods marshall and johnson 2013 showed for the first baroclinic mode wave and wise et al 2020 showed for barotropic topographic waves that interior ssh anomalies possibly carried westward by long rossby waves modify the amplitude and speed of southward propagating boundary waves generated by local and remote forcing farther northward as the southward propagating boundary waves dissipate energy due to friction they reduce in amplitude and the incident long rossby waves from the interior modify the amplitude of the boundary waves to a greater extent thereby allowing greater penetration of interior ssh variability importantly the rate of dissipation has been shown to depend on a number of factors steepness and width of the bottom topography friction parameter as well as latitude wise et al 2020 2018 huthnance 2004 chapman and brink 1987 brink and allen 1978 this theory will be described in more detail in section 3 3 note that while we do not explicitly cover the case of local forcing on the shelf on shelf alongshore wind stress forcing also produces topographic waves that propagate with the coast on the right 2 model and analysis method 2 1 model setup the model is based on a 2d configuration polton et al 2020 of the nemo 4 0 general ocean circulation model gurvan madec and nemo system team 2019 that we have modified to create a barotropic north atlantic western boundary the model has one active layer using a terrain following s coordinate and the horizontal grid is a 1 12 of a degree grid using the nemo orca r12 grid while the bottom topography at the western boundary is realistic we use the 15 arc second gebco compilation group 2019 gridded data set we modify it in two ways firstly we set the maximum depth for the entire domain to a constant h c 500 m i e any depth h x y greater than h c is set equal to h c this allows us to represent an idealised upper ocean layer between the upper slope and coast as a result throughout the text the slope refers to the regions where the bathymetric depth is between 200 and 500 m consequently the interior upper ocean layer is considered to begin at the 500 m depth contour recall that we define the shelf region as bathymetric depth less than 200 m and the coast to be the very inner shelf region it should be noted here that 500 m will not be the ideal upper layer thickness for all latitudes wise et al 2018 suggest that for an idealised linear barotropic ocean a thinner upper ocean layer thickness will increase the penetration of sea level anomalies from the interior to the coast and is equivalent to increasing the bottom friction parameter or decreasing the width of the shelf a second modification made to the bathymetry is a truncation to the eastern extent of the domain to roughly follow the mid atlantic ridge which retains an adequate interior ocean for subpolar and subtropical gyres to form and set up the interior ssh the lateral boundaries are closed except for the northern and southern boundaries which have flather 1994 radiation conditions imposed on the velocity normal to the boundary allowing gravity waves to exit the domain external field variables are taken to be zero the purpose of the flather condition is to minimise any artificial leakage of the interior ocean signal onto the shelf close to the boundary however we do also consider the case where the northern and southern boundaries are closed for land boundaries partial slip is imposed for bottom friction which is non linear it is sensible to assume that there is a reduced frictional effect on the upper layer of the flow in the interior ocean and we therefore use two different friction coefficients one for the shelf and slope c d s and another smaller value c d i n for greater depths i e where h h c the main effect of this is to create a more realistic boundary current since a large friction parameter in the interior ocean was found to create an unrealistically wide boundary layer in preliminary experiments to some extent the quadratic friction formulation used will also reduce bottom friction effects in the deeper open ocean ultimately our goal is to create a realistic interior ssh to relate to the on shelf ssh finally the model is set up to use a lateral bilaplacian diffusive operator and a free surface all parameter values are listed in table 1 2 2 forcing forcing of the model is provided exclusively via an idealised zonal wind stress τ u all other forcing mechanisms are turned off as previously noted from an analysis point of view it is unimportant how the interior ocean ssh is set up however using wind stress allows us to maintain extremely simple boundary conditions while selecting a wind stress magnitude that results in quite realistic ssh gradients the wind stress magnitude applied is unrealistically large i e approximately double observed values however this is also physically reasonable given the reduced domain width the model experiments have two forcing stages a spin up stage and a stage where the wind stress changes in time and space during the spin up a quasi steady state is established using a time independent zonal wind stress which we consider as the time mean wind stress τ u m x y as shown in fig 1a the spatial structure of this wind stress forcing pattern is chosen to be representative of the long period time mean zonal wind stress e g see hellerman and rosenstein 1983 note that a key feature of the wind pattern is the intersection of the zero wind stress curl contour with the western boundary and also its basin scale characteristics i e the zero curl line where τ u is maximal or minimal is not zonal in fig 1a the zero wind stress curl corresponds to the contours emanating from 35n and 20n the latitude of the zero wind stress curl relative to cape hatteras plays an important role in how the gulf stream separates from the boundary and this has been discussed in detail for a barotropic ocean e g dengo 1993 munday and marshall 2005 and for more complex settings e g chassignet and marshall 2008 and bryan et al 2007 in terms of the interior ssh this is important for creating a realistic step up in ssh where the gulf stream separates using a spin up period of 3 years fig 2a shows the model ssh across the entire domain and fig 2b shows the model ssh along the 800 m and 40 m depth contours as well as the mean dynamic sea level mdsl derived from altimetry along the same contours note that the contours are denoted in fig 2a the mdsl is the 22 year mean 1993 2014 inclusive from aviso the ssalto duacs delayed mode gridded absolute dynamic topography product using all available satellites given the relatively simple nature of the model idealised forcing and vertical structure it is surprising how well the model captures the observed ssh the main differences to note are that the model gulf stream separates slightly too far southward and some on shelf processes are obviously missing the sub polar ssh low is also slightly under represented which is probably due to the missing eddy driven recirculation gyre just north of the gulf stream between approximately 36n and 41n see fig 3 of liu et al 2018 following the spin up a wind stress anomaly τ u a x y t that varies in space and time is added to the mean field 1 τ u x y t τ u m x y τ u a x y t to isolate the relationship between interior and coastal ssh the wind stress anomaly is damped close to the continental slope of the north american mainland and set to zero on the shelf and slope this ensures that variability on the shelf and slope is due to interior ocean dynamics only defining the wind stress in this way does have the drawback of introducing an artificial wind stress curl between the interior and coast however with adequate damping i e avoiding large τ u y this contribution is found to only moderately affect the zonal integral of the wind stress curl not shown and does not materially affect the results and discussion presented specifically the wind stress anomaly τ u a is set to zero on the shelf and slope of the north american mainland i e not the various islands in the domain and a linear ramp up is applied over approximately 2 degrees of latitude from the foot of the upper continental slope at the 500 m isobath the wind stress anomaly is defined to induce two general effects on the interior ssh representative of the interior ocean variability suggested by observational studies firstly we wish to fluctuate the magnitude of the ssh north and south of the gulf stream separation latitude this is achieved by simply adding a wind stress contribution τ u a 1 x y t that modulates the mean wind stress amplitude in time but with the same spatial pattern as the mean i e as shown in fig 1a this contribution to the anomaly is periodic with a period of 4 years and amplitude 0 1 n m 2 the mean field amplitude is 0 4 n m 2 this forcing pattern is referred to in the remainder of the text as the mean forcing pattern in addition we wish to fluctuate in time the spatial structure of the interior ssh this is achieved by adding another wind stress contribution τ u a 2 y t which is zonally uniform except for the damping and differs from the mean field in its latitudinal structure see fig 1b again this contribution to the anomaly is periodic but with only a 2 year period note that τ u a 2 y t is based on the wind anomaly due to the nao specifically we have approximately represented the meridional nao profile used by zhai et al 2014 where they have regressed monthly reanalysis zonal wind stress onto the nao index for the period 1950 2010 and then zonally averaged i e multiplying this wind stress by the monthly nao index gives a zonal mean wind stress anomaly that fluctuates in time with the nao index we will refer to this forcing pattern as the nao forcing pattern in the above cases the ssh gradients result from the mounding and depression of ssh due to wind driven convergence and divergence the currents in and out of the western boundary which are associated with the ssh gradients are therefore strengthened and weakened as the gradients increase and decrease respectively for example valle levinson et al 2017 propose that la niña and el niño climate patterns result in a modulation of the wind stress magnitudes in the north atlantic via the pacific north american teleconnection producing an increase and decrease respectively of volume transport into the western boundary which they suggest is connected to a coherent sea level rise and fall along the us east coast our mean forcing pattern is similarly a modulation of mean wind stress magnitude our nao forcing pattern effectively adds a modulation in wind stress which is shifted northward relative to the mean pattern it is important to appreciate that such interior sea level gradients can also be the result of thermal expansion and contraction of the water column for example south of cape hatteras sea level gradients can increase due to variability in warming of the florida current domingues et al 2018 or due to variability in the volume transport of the florida current for example which can advect temperature and generate meridional heat transport volkov et al 2019 north of cape hatteras similar steric variability and sea level gradients can result from temperature and salinity anomalies in the southern subpolar gyre frederikse et al 2017 the coupling between heat and salt fluxes variations in circulation such as the amoc and large scale atmospheric patterns such as the nao is complex see for example volkov et al 2019 and to restate while the forcing phenomena are clearly of importance we are focusing on the relationship between an interior ssh and the on shelf ssh in order to efficiently use computer time we apply both fluctuating fields simultaneously over a 4 year model run and separate out the responses in post processing the fluctuating wind stress anomaly is therefore defined as 2 τ u a x y t d x y τ u a 1 x y t τ u a 2 y t where d x y is the damping this fluctuating forcing is used to set up ssh variability that represents the interior ssh variability described in the various observational studies discussed in the introduction 2 3 data analysis to determine the connection between the interior ocean and coastal sea level we apply a hilbert transformed complex empirical orthogonal function ceof analysis to the model ssh output unlike with correlation maps or standard eofs this approach allows us to investigate the spatial and temporal phase and amplitude of the domain wide response a full review of the method is described by hannachi et al 2007 here we give a brief overview of the method for the ssh field anomaly η t η t 1 η t 2 η t m t where m is the total number of grid points and t 1 2 n is the time index the complex field is 3 ξ t η t i h η t where h denotes the hilbert transform operator this results in an imaginary part of the time series in which each fourier component is the same as for the real part but with a 90 degree phase shift the eofs of ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n are complex and the spatial amplitude of the k th ceof p k is given by 4 a k p k where denotes the component wise absolute values of p k the spatial phase of the k th ceof is then 5 θ k arg p k where arg denotes the component wise arguments of p k similarly the temporal amplitude and phase are obtained from the complex principal components cpc q such that the temporal amplitude of the k th cpc is 6 b k q k and the k th temporal phase is 7 ϕ k arg q k the variability described by each k th mode can therefore be written as 8 a x y b t e i θ x y ϕ t with a summation of all modes returning the original signal subscript k is implicit by design virtually all variability in our experiments is attributable to the two wind stress forcing patterns that we have imposed as a result the temporal amplitude and temporal phase of the two modes of variability that the ceof analysis finds are simply close representations of the forcing patterns temporal evolution for example the temporal phases represent the 4 yr and 2 yr periods of the two forcing patterns as a result we do not present the resulting temporal amplitude and phase plots but instead normalise the spatial amplitudes by maximum temporal amplitude and present the spatial phases so that 90 is in phase with the wind forcing and 90 is out of phase with the wind forcing the reason that ceofs have been used is that while the spatial amplitude a x y is modulated in time by b t the spatial phase gives a sense of how anomalies propagate in space given the frequency of the wind forcing i e from 8 the temporal phase ϕ t ω t where ω is the frequency of the wind forcing spatial propagation can then be qualitatively captured because the spatial derivative of θ x y gives a local wavenumber 3 results and discussion in this section we will present and discuss the ceofs in context with the results from existing observational studies and boundary wave theory 3 1 ceofs modes of variability the ceof analysis of the model ssh output by design reveals two dominant modes of variability accounting for 95 of the variability with the modes associated with the two forcing patterns i e the mean forcing pattern and the nao forcing pattern note that the relative variance explained by each could be somewhat misleading given that it will depend on the amplitudes we have chosen for the two wind stress contributions with that said the two different wind stress amplitudes are comparable and it is interesting to note the similarity of the variance explained with that found for the two dominant eof modes by valle levinson et al 2017 which were suggested to be related to enso and the nao panels a and c in fig 3 show the spatial amplitude and phase respectively of the mean pattern τ u a 1 ceof which accounts for 71 of the variability note that panels b and d show the amplitude and phase on the shelf and slope in finer detail and will be considered in section 3 3 for the discussion on the propagation of variability panel a shows the amplitude of ssh variability in the interior ocean white contour denotes 500 m isobath resulting from strengthening and weakening of the subpolar and subtropical gyres as the magnitude of the zonal windstress increases and decreases along the coast there is clear leakage of interior ssh variability onto the shelf with amplitudes substantially reduced the largest coastal variability is seen between 32n and 38n around cape hatteras panel c shows the coastal variability along the entire north american east coast as far south as 25n to be coherent relative to the long 4 year period of the mode implying rapid propagation generally speaking this coastal signal is in phase with the interior signal north of 37n and mostly out of phase with the interior signal south of 37n although the signal immediately offshore of the slope is also in phase with the shelf extending to about 33n the mean pattern mode coastal ssh anomaly is therefore of reduced magnitude compared to the interior it is attenuated and there is a southward displacement i e the anomaly at the coast appears to be farther south than in the interior panels a and c in fig 4 show the spatial amplitude and phase for the nao pattern τ u a 2 ceof accounting for 22 of the variability together they show nao nao forcing a positive negative ssh anomaly across much of the interior which penetrates in phase onto the shelf most notably south of 33n the amplitude of shelf variability north of 33n is very small the on shelf variability differs from the mean pattern in that it is entirely in phase with the interior with no direct forcing on the shelf and slope the immediate implication from the two modes of variability is that phenomena increasing the interior ssh will drive a smaller increase in coastal ssh that is displaced southward along the coast relative to the interior signal in the mean pattern mode case the amplitude initially grows in the southward direction with the increasing influence of the subpolar gyre then it starts to decrease as the out of phase subtropical gyre influence penetrates in the nao pattern mode case interior sea level is in phase everywhere so the coastal sea level signal keeps increasing all the way to the tip of florida as will be discussed in the following two subsections this is consistent with observational studies and linear wave theory before discussing observations it should be noted that the radiative boundary conditions at the northern and southern boundaries of the domain can have an impact on the character of the modes of variability for example a large portion of the variability in the nao pattern mode fig 4a and b is in phase which implies that the majority of the surface elevation tends to rise and fall coherently across the domain this suggests that mass is not conserved and implies that the flather boundary conditions are playing a large role in leaking mass in and out of the domain in the real ocean mass would be able to spread north and south of the domain being modelled as occurs here but here the dynamics that are occurring in these unmodelled regions is being lost to demonstrate this issue more clearly figs 5 and 6 show the same experiment with closed northern and southern boundaries it is clear from panels a and c in fig 6 that the nao pattern mode of variability is indeed strongly influenced by the boundary conditions with the on shelf response significantly altered this can be explained as follows with mass unable to leak from the domain the surface elevation in the northern and southern portions of the domain is out of phase with the central band of the domain due to conservation this does not occur in the flather experiment this ultimately results in a very different on shelf response because variability on the shelf is strongly controlled by variability occurring at higher latitudes than the point of interest on the shelf in fact the contrast between the two experiments highlights this point quite clearly and the mechanism behind this important result is discussed in more detail in section 3 3 clearly the choice of boundary conditions is an important concern here we suspect that the reality is somewhere between the two cases flather and closed this is because some spreading of mass northward and southward of the domain should be expected in reality and this would be compensated for at other locations in the interior ocean that have also not been included in the domain but crucially that are not necessarily adjacent to the continental slope as is the case in the closed experiment 3 2 consistency with observational studies most strikingly the results of the nao pattern mode are consistent with coherent variability on the shelf south of cape hatteras being forced remotely this can occur by warming cooling of the florida current as found by domingues et al 2018 volkov et al 2019 and by the nao valle levinson et al 2017 volkov et al 2019 similarly interior ocean anomalies have been shown to modulate the amplitude of the sea level annual cycle south of the cape calafat et al 2018 the mean pattern mode is also consistent with the correlation maps in frederikse et al 2017 and andres et al 2013 depicting coherence between the coastal sea level variability north of cape hatteras and the interior sea level farther northward though their correlation maps do not show coherence extending significantly south of cape hatteras as found here perhaps most interestingly the eof modes of coastal 5 yr rates of sea level change depicted in figure 3 of valle levinson et al 2017 bear a remarkable resemblance to the two modes presented here they show their first mode as being responsible for in phase variability along the entire coastline whereas their second mode is responsible for variability along the entire coastline but in anti phase roughly about cape hatteras the combination of the two modes results in a hot spot which is highly mobile latitudinally our results support the idea that multiple modes of variability could be important for understanding north american east coast hot spots an interpretation of observations together with our modelling results are as follows a mode of variability acts coherently and in phase along the coastal zones both north and south of cape hatteras this mode is driven by a modulation of interior ssh gradients north of cape hatteras due potentially either to strengthening of the westerlies or steric variability in the southern sub polar gyre frederikse et al 2017 a second mode of variability also acts coherently along the entire coastline this can be related to the effect of the nao and in reality also to warming cooling of the florida current creating off shelf ssh highs lows in the sub tropical band of the ocean and on shelf highs lows south of cape hatteras while this mode acts coherently along the entire shelf observational studies discussed in the introduction i e piecuch et al 2019 suggest that the nao can also modulate on shelf winds north of cape hatteras which we have not included that could modify the phase of the response north of the cape 3 3 relating hot spots to boundary waves the coherence of the signal along the shelf despite the absence of direct forcing on the shelf suggests that interior variability generates a long barotropic trapped wave response at the boundary which rapidly transmits ssh information southward along the coast to understand the variability depicted by the ceofs in terms of boundary waves we will use the results of wise et al 2020 derived from an idealised model following wise et al 2020 consider an idealised barotropic case of a western boundary modelled by a rectangular domain with positive y in the direction of increasing latitude y 0 at the equator and positive x in the direction of increasing longitude the bottom topography is described by the function h x and increases in depth monotonically from zero at the western edge coast x 0 to some greater depth at the eastern edge of the domain which is hundreds of kilometres east of the coast and is taken to be the interface between the western boundary region and the interior ocean note that while the bottom topography described by h x is uniform alongshore it does include a continental shelf and slope the long wave approximation momentum equations gill and schumann 1974 including a simple representation of alongshore dissipation via bottom friction are 9 f h v g h η x 0 10 h v t f h u g h η y r v where u u x y t v x y t is the horizontal velocity η x y t is the dynamic sea level g is gravity f β y is the coriolis parameter and r is the friction parameter the continuity equation is given by h u 0 assume that variability from the interior ocean occurs between a poleward latitude y p and equatorward latitude y e in the interior ocean variability on interannual time scales of basin scale can be carried westward by long rossby waves and this can be represented by imposing a boundary condition on the eastern edge of the model domain in the form η i n y e i ω t where ω is the frequency of the variability and subscript in denotes interior for variability with a multiannual or longer period wise et al 2020 derive the solution in the form 11 η x y t η x y e i ω t where 12 η x y η i n y y y p j 1 w j x y s d s eqs 11 12 show that the solution in the western boundary region consists of the long rossby wave from the interior first term on the right of 12 modified by a second term which captures the effect of the excited boundary waves where w j is complex and describes the boundary wave modes note that marshall and johnson 2013 derive a related solution for the first mode baroclinic case with a vertical sidewall i e no continental shelf and slope eqs 11 and 12 can be written in exponential form as 13 η x y t a x y e i φ x y ω t thus describing the response on the shelf and slope for a given frequency ω by its amplitude a and phase φ note how this is in the same form as 8 which gives the variability described by each ceof mode hence each ceof mode can be thought of in terms of 11 and 12 that is in terms of the long rossby wave the interior sea level variability just offshore of the slope and the excited boundary waves that this variability generates a crucial point to note is that the effect of the boundary waves on the sea level at each latitude involves an integral of the waves between that latitude and the most poleward latitude of the variability the sea level response on the continental shelf and slope at each latitude is therefore the combined effect of the long rossby wave from the interior at that latitude and the sum of the boundary wave modes integrated over the latitudinal extent of the variability it is in this way that variability from higher latitudes is able to affect the sea level response on the slope and shelf at lower latitudes i e it propagates via the boundary waves note that wise et al 2020 showed that the effect of friction is to dampen the wave amplitudes as they propagate equatorward and dissipate energy hence regions of large dissipation reduce the extent to which boundary waves carry anomalies to lower latitudes as noted in the introduction the drivers of coastal variability are debated because it is typically difficult to determine the pathways of variability from ocean to coast i e which sections of interior variability adjacent to the slope are driving sea level variability along specific sections of coastline the phase and amplitude of the ceofs in our simplified experiments are useful for determining this figure panels 3d and 4d show the spatial phases of the ceofs on the shelf in very fine colourmap resolution the temporal phase of both modes of variability is positive and in phase with the two wind forcing components an approximate local wave number can be obtained from the spatial phase plots and the sign of the local wavenumber can be estimated by noting the direction of the phase lag for example decreasing spatial phase with increasing latitude implies a negative meridional wavenumber southward propagation on the shelf can be identified in both figs 3d and 4d from theory variability should be coherent in phase along the steepest parts of the topography such as the slope an idea supported by observations roussenov et al 2008 hughes and meredith 2006 this is difficult to see in our results due to the limited grid resolution on the upper slope nevertheless it is clear from the mean pattern mode amplitude plot fig 3b that while maximum interior variability of the same phase as on the shelf is located at 42n and 38n the maximum amplitude on the shelf is at 33n and there is a distinct southward displacement of the inner shelf amplitude relative to the outer shelf the picture presented by the fine colourbar resolution plots in conjunction with eqs 11 13 is instructive and implies the ceofs can be interpreted as follows the interior ssh variability adjacent to the slope the first term on the right in 12 excites boundary waves which propagate equatorward w j in 12 this southward propagation is evident in the phase plots on the shelf and slope though propagation is not exclusively southward which hints at possible nonlinear effects or effects of the local bathymetry not covered in idealised theory the southward displacement in the amplitude of the variability on the shelf clearly seen in the high resolution amplitude plots is then the result of the integral of the boundary waves in 12 combined with the interior ssh hence hot spots of variability adjacent to the slope can drive variability on the shelf at lower latitudes wise et al 2020 showed that the boundary waves dissipate more of their energy and decay over a shorter distance when bottom friction is larger and where the bathymetry is steeper hence the degree of southward displacement of the interior variability as it penetrates onto the shelf can depend on the local bathymetry and local dissipation friction an appreciation of how the boundary wave mechanism adjusts coastal sea level is important for example when considering modulation of sea level south of cape hatteras part of the variability will ultimately originate a number of degrees farther northward in the interior and on shelf however because the interior ocean signal may be correlated i e the variability in the interior ocean may be coherent over many degrees of latitude and because the boundary adjustment is rapid it can be difficult to identify the northern origin of the variability this point is clear when comparing the phase of the nao pattern mode in low resolution and high resolution consider also the ssh variability in the mean pattern mode south of 33 n on first inspection it appears as though the interior ssh variability offshore of the florida coastline does not influence coastal ssh however this is simply because the on shelf and interior variability are in anti phase hence the interior variability in the mean pattern mode simply acts to reduce the amplitude of the on shelf variability at these latitudes the long wave and excited boundary waves first and second terms on the right in 12 nearly cancel one another the fine colourbar resolution amplitude and phase for the nao pattern mode shown in fig 4b and d again demonstrate the interior ocean signal appearing to leak onto the shelf at lower latitudes the interior ssh signal offshore of florida is now increasing rather than decreasing the amplitude of the on shelf ssh variability because they are in phase in this case the interior long wave and the excited boundary waves no longer cancel one another at those latitudes furthermore because trapped waves are sensitive to bottom topography wise et al 2020 huthnance 1987 identifying signal origin could be particularly problematic when using coarse resolution models around areas such as the florida straits where bathymetric features can be difficult to resolve in a barotropic model the interior ocean adjusts quickly to variability in forcing which is useful here but in the real stratified interior ocean baroclinic rossby waves are slower thus amplifying the decoupling in the timescale of response between the interior ocean and upper slope or shelf for realistic damping and where changes in interior sea level occur over long time periods the variability of forcing is slow relative to the adjustment at the boundary and boundary waves effectively carry out the adjustment along the boundary instantaneously in this case a reasonable approximation to 9 and 10 is to neglect time dependence giving a steady state form of the solution 11 12 i e equation 31 of wise et al 2020 this approach is adopted in idealised studies of western boundary sea level by wise et al 2018 minobe et al 2017 and hong et al 2000 producing good qualitative agreement with model output and observations therefore even for long period sea level change in the interior it is instructive to see that there is a boundary wave contribution to the response along the boundary but it is quick relative to the time scale of change in the interior to demonstrate this we show in fig 7 the solution 12 in the steady state for three different interior sea level anomalies that correspond to the interior sea level anomalies produced by the mean and nao forcing patterns in our numerical model experiments we also show the long wave and boundary wave contributions to the solution i e the two terms in the solution note that we used the solution derived in wise et al 2020 their equation 31 the three experiments are detailed in table 2 panels 1 a c show the long wave contribution the boundary wave contribution and their sum the solution for experiment 1 of table 2 this experiment introduces an interior sea level anomaly representative of that created by the mean forcing pattern a change in the sea level associated with stronger subpolar and subtropical gyres panel 1a shows the interior sea level penetrate to the coast panel 1b shows the adjustment term due to the excited boundary waves and panel 1c shows the resulting net sea level response where sea level change here a decrease in the subpolar gyre leaks onto the shelf with reduced magnitude and southward displacement around cape hatteras further south of cape hatteras the influence of the subtropical gyre begins to cancel the effect of the subpolar gyre the solution is highly consistent with the mean pattern ceof in figs 3 and 5 panels 2 a c show the same for an interior sea level anomaly representative of that created by the nao forcing pattern an in phase change in the interior sea level experiment 2 in table 2 the net response in panel 2c shows the interior sea level change here an increase leak onto the shelf south of cape hatteras again the sea level change magnitude is reduced and it is displaced southward relative to the interior this is also highly consistent with the nao pattern ceof in fig 4 the final experiment 3 in table 2 is the same as the previous experiment 2 but by subtracting the mean over the domain from the interior anomaly we have introduced an anomaly along the northern boundary as well this constant northern anomaly extends from the coast to the interior this experiment is designed to represent the nao forcing pattern in the case where the northern boundary was closed rather than radiative despite the change from experiment 2 panel 3b shows that the boundary wave response is in fact the same in the two cases and the net response in panel 3c is different because we effectively added an anomaly across the entire domain relative to experiment 2 this is clear since we could split panel 3a into its 2 linear terms the first term is the same as in experiment 2 and the second is its mean which is uniform across the domain panel 3c is as a result consistent with the nao pattern ceof for the closed boundary in fig 6 showing that to the south the interior signal will tend to cancel the northern sea level signal on the shelf a number of conclusions can be drawn from the consistency between the results of the idealised linear analytic model and the non linear numerical model that uses more realistic bathymetry firstly the conceptual framework whereby the western boundary sea level responds to change in the interior sea level via the generation of rapid boundary waves that modify the influence of the interior sea level at the coast appears to be robust secondly this conceptual framework is instructive for explaining western boundary sea level change over interannual and longer time periods finally because friction and bathymetry exert an influence over the decay characteristics of boundary waves wise et al 2020 huthnance 2004 the modelling of boundary sea level can be sensitive to the representation of both in numerical models e g changing the friction parameter changes the boundary wave contribution panels 1 3 b in fig 7 which then changes the modelled sea level response panels 1 3 c 3 4 non linear effects the extent to which nonlinear effects added by a mean flow such as the gulf stream will be important locally for the shelf and slope response to interior variability is an open question it is possible for example that boundary wave propagation is significantly modified which would modify how variability propagates along the shelf for the barotropic case friction has previously been shown to play a dominant role in modifying boundary waves and determining the character of the response on the shelf specifically friction at the boundary results in dissipation and this has been shown in linear models to dampen boundary waves enabling interior variability to leak onto the shelf wise et al 2020 marshall and johnson 2013 huthnance 2004 1987 an important result from our non linear barotropic model is that friction appears to remain a dominant process neglecting horizontal diffusion the role of friction in the barotropic vorticity equation can be related to the potential vorticity as 14 d d t ζ f h 1 h τ b h where d d t t u u are horizontal velocities is the horizontal derivative f is the coriolis parameter h is the depth h plus free surface and τ b is bottom friction without friction and with no mean flow u u v are now anomalous velocities potential vorticity ζ f h is conserved and the flow follows f h contours salmon 1998a when the problem is framed in terms of dynamic sea level η wise et al 2018 showed that it is natural to consider sea level contours following h f contours similarly for bottom pressure salmon 1998b the inclusion of friction enables the flow to deviate and in the linear case has been shown to enable sea level to penetrate from the interior onto the shelf crossing h f contours wise et al 2018 the inclusion of a mean flow clearly a consideration at western boundaries will modify the background potential vorticity for example ζ v x u y v x where v is the shear of a meridional mean flow as noted by mysak 1980 when the shear is comparable to f shelf waves can be significantly advected by the current it is not clear however to what extent this affects sea level penetration onto the shelf for the case without fluctuating forcing with the model in a quasi steady state such that t 0 fig 8a shows the frictional contribution to 14 i e the term on the right the figure shows a larger friction term on the slope and shelf and note also the enhanced off shelf friction contribution between 31 n and 34 n where the upper slope widens and narrows i e as the slope becomes narrow friction increases see hill 1995 for a linear discussion of leakage due to a narrowing slope fig 8b shows the non linear relative vorticity contribution u ζ h while both terms are noisy the important point is that the non linear term is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the friction contribution this suggests that even a strong mean flow does not significantly change the character of the frictional balance found in the linear case and therefore it does not prevent the low frequency on shelf sea level being determined by the dynamics poleward of the point in question i e the waves are not completely arrested by the mean current 3 5 stratification and other sources of variability the consistency of the results with theory and observational studies is convincing nevertheless by assuming a barotropic ocean we have neglected certain processes that could modify our results for example février et al 2007 showed that variation in the thickness of the active subsurface layer of a 2 5 layer model as a result of kelvin wave propagation could induce a thickness anomaly in the upper layer this forcing is proportional to the mean vorticity gradient and therefore can be large at the gulf stream separation area this forcing on the upper layer does not prevent the kelvin wave from propagating southward but does result in the appearance of a new coastal sea level anomaly with opposite sign in the vicinity of the gulf stream separation point in addition dewar and hogg 2010 and deremble et al 2017 discuss the role of non viscous energy dissipation from the mesoscale at boundaries they show that in a stratified flow kelvin and topographic waves trapped at the boundary can be arrested by an opposing balanced flow potentially important along the us east coast where the gulf stream could arrest trapped boundary waves it is worth speculating that the combined effects of stratification topography and mean flow could for example be an alternative explanation for greater de coherence between the regions north and south of cape hatteras than our results suggest furthermore it should be noted that the adjustment in the interior ocean will be slower and more latitude dependent in reality than in our model due to the fact that adjustment will take place via baroclinic rossby waves rather than the faster barotropic rossby waves even in a 500 m depth layer this implies that the temporal decoupling between deep ocean and coastal zone is more pronounced than our results suggest our results should be interpreted as the coastal response to the nearby ocean finally the choice of a 500 m layer depth was chosen partly to generate a realistic gulf stream however this will not be the best choice for all latitudes early idealised models suggested that the coast is insulated from interior ocean variability by the steep continental slope wang 1982 csanady and shaw 1983 our results and analysis add detail to this interpretation and show that the amplitude of interior variability is attenuated on the shelf for both forcing patterns considered here maximum interior variability is reduced in amplitude by approximately 80 on the shelf giving for example centimetre order elevations for tens of centimetres anomalies in the interior for comparison changes in atmospheric pressure lead to similar order changes in sea level via the inverse barometer effect where a 1 mbar decrease corresponds to a 1 cm increase in sea level on shelf wind stress is also a local driver of sea level change with order mm per year changes commonly resulting from interannual fluctuations domingues et al 2018 local interannual pressure and alongshore wind stress variability can therefore be important sources of centimetre scale sea level variability piecuch et al 2019 2016 piecuch and ponte 2015 another source of variability is the sea level annual cycle which typically has an amplitude of centimetre order calafat et al 2018 while these processes are important for setting the background sea level which increases the likelihood of nuisance flooding shorter time scale events such as storm surges due to hurricanes can act in addition to increased background sea level and can produce highly localised sea level anomalies measured in metres little et al 2015 in this context it is clear that interior ocean variability is not the only relevant source of variability nevertheless it is clearly important to understand how large scale changes in the oceans over many years might be communicated to the coast 4 summary observations have shown that sea level rise hot spots along the north american east coast are correlated with a number of forcing phenomena and can appear at different latitudes an understanding of the mechanisms by which the coast adjusts to forcing is important when explaining how hot spots of variability are distributed along the coast using a barotropic general circulation model of the north american east coast that includes realistic coastal bathymetry and nonlinear terms we have shown that there is good agreement with linear theory in modelling the coastal sea level response to ssh variability on the upper slope using a hilbert transform complex eof method we examine the propagation and amplitude of two modes of variability generated by interior ocean ssh anomalies that are characteristic of the remote ssh anomalies described by observational studies the mean forcing pattern mode of variability describes in phase variability along the entire coastline and is driven by a ssh anomaly in the subpolar gyre the nao forcing pattern mode of variability describes in phase variability along the coast south of cape hatteras and is driven by an interior ocean ssh anomaly consistent with the nao observations suggest that nao linked on shelf wind and pressure forcing would drive an anomaly of opposite phase north of cape hatteras though we have not tested this here the results presented are shown to be consistent with linear barotropic trapped wave theory such that boundary waves propagate with the coast on the right carrying ssh anomaly information equatorward along the shelf and slope the role of boundary waves in the adjustment process is used to explain how coastal sea level variability can be sensitive to interior ocean variability many degrees of latitude further north such that a hot spot of sea level variability in the subpolar gyre can drive a sea level anomaly to the north and south of cape hatteras indications from theory are that this southward displacement of variability is highly sensitive to the friction parameter on the shelf and slope as well as local shelf width wise et al 2018 2020 implying that an order of magnitude decrease in the friction parameter for example could increase the displacement further south of cape hatteras the decay of topographic waves due to bottom friction as described by linear theory appears to be the key barotropic process determining the degree to which anomalies on the shelf are attenuated and displaced relative to the interior this highlights the importance of accurately representing dissipation in numerical models the inclusion of non linear effects that enable advection of potential vorticity does not appear to significantly alter the dependence of coastal sea level on higher latitudes and this ultimately suggests that the gulf stream does not stop the lower mode coastally trapped waves from propagating acknowledging the limits of the barotropic assumption the analysis presented here fits in with the view that baroclinic variability might be strongly suppressed on western boundary shelves due to the rapid decay of higher wave modes as a result of the sloping topography and friction hughes et al 2018 furthermore it better ties in coastal sea level variability with the growing theory of how anomalies propagate about ocean basins e g hughes et al 2019 marshall and johnson 2013 johnson and marshall

23943,hot spots of sea level variability along the north american east coast have been shown to shift in latitude repeatedly over the past 95 years and connections with a number of forcing phenomena including the north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc have been suggested using a barotropic 1 12 nemo model of the north american east coast to represent the upper ocean and a homogeneous shelf we investigate the coastal sea level response to remote sea surface height ssh variability along the upper continental slope hilbert transform complex eof analysis is used to investigate the responses to interannual changes in the strength of the mean winds and an idealised nao variability in the mean winds produces in phase coastal sea level variability along the entire coastline and is driven by a ssh anomaly in the subpolar gyre variability due to the nao forcing is in phase along the coast south of cape hatteras interannual coastal sea level variability at a given latitude is found to be driven by off shore ssh anomalies originating many degrees of latitude 100s km further north and linear barotropic trapped wave theory is used to explain the mechanism a comparison of the results from an analytical model with those from the numerical model is used to suggest that the boundary wave mechanism is also relevant for understanding the coastal response to interior sea level change over longer time periods nonlinear effects are found not to significantly modify the character of the linear solution keywords sea level changes shelf dynamics topographic waves teleconnections us east coast western boundary 1 introduction in recent years a spotlight has been cast over the local and remote drivers of coastal sea level variability along the north american east coast most recently volkov et al 2019 drew attention to a basin scale tripole sea surface height ssh pattern of variability linked to the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc and north atlantic oscillation nao that was a source of interannual to decadal ssh variability along the southeast coast of the united states as in a number of studies looking at these processes barotropic waves trapped against the western boundary i e the north american east coast land sea boundary are invoked as a possible mechanism for the actual adjustment that occurs between the coast and interior ocean or elsewhere on the shelf the objective of this study is to use an intermediate complexity numerical model including realistic bathymetry and nonlinear terms with analysis methods that reveal the propagation of variability to more thoroughly connect the processes identified by observational studies with the theory of coastally trapped boundary waves the focus is on the influence of the dynamics of the deep ocean interior on the coast rather than sea level changes resulting from local winds over shallow water in this section we first provide an overview of key results from existing studies that have investigated sea level variability along the north american east coast on interannual periods this is followed by a qualitative introduction to how coastal sea level can be connected to interior variability by the mechanism of boundary waves also referred to as coastally trapped waves note that here we use the term interior to refer to the interior open ocean where the effect of sloping bottom topography is small furthermore we use the term shelf to refer to depths less than about 200 m and coast to mean the inner shelf close to the shoreline the continental slope is generally taken to mean the steeply sloping region of bottom topography connecting the shelf and interior though we define this more specifically in section 2 where we describe the numerical model section 2 1 experiments section 2 2 and the method of analysis section 2 3 following this we present our results and discuss them in relation to the results of previous studies section 3 2 boundary wave theory which we explain with a specific example section 3 3 and nonlinear effects section 3 4 finally we discuss our results in a broader context and then conclude with a summary 1 1 sea level variability along the north american east coast coastal hot spots of accelerated sea level rise and variability have the potential to add to any global mean sea level rise making the adjacent coast vulnerable to shorter time scale events that can cause flooding for example storm surges the mechanisms that govern these hot spots are therefore of particular interest using observations sallenger et al 2012 identified a hot spot along 1000 km of the north american coastline north of cape hatteras where the rate of increase of sea level rise was of order 3 4 times larger than the global average during 1980 2009 while it remains debated they suggested the sea level rise might be associated with a slowdown of the amoc in addition to the amoc a number of processes both local and remote have been investigated as drivers of this hot spot and assigning causality between sea level anomalies and forcing more generally has been shown to be complex due to the coupling of driving phenomena kenigson et al 2018 suggest that changes in the local wind stress particularly alongshore linked to the nao are strongly related with sea level anomalies north of cape hatteras similarly piecuch et al 2016 show annual coastal sea level changes north of cape hatteras to be driven by wind stress over the continental shelf and slope and highlight the apparent dominance of barotropic dynamics in the adjustment of coastal sea level to forcing furthermore the anticorrelation between coastal sea level north of the cape and overturning circulation at 26n is suggested by piecuch et al 2019 not to be causal but instead driven by temporally coherent but different forcing mechanisms in the case of the former local alongshore wind and air surface pressure are responsible and in the latter zonal wind stress along 26n is responsible though they note the potential role of large scale atmospheric modes of variation linking them such as the nao in terms of remote drivers over a 50 year period of observations 1965 2014 frederikse et al 2017 found a strong correlation between coastal sea level north of the cape and decadal steric variability in the subpolar gyre the steric height showed an upward sea level trend and acceleration which is also found along the coast they suggest the variability likely originates in the labrador sea from where it propagates southward the linkage between coastal sea level and the labrador sea is also noted by andres et al 2013 with a similar correlation map though they note the mechanism of propagation onto the shelf is not clear sea level variability along the north american east coast is subject to regional differences north and south of cape hatteras where the gulf stream separates from the western boundary this has led to investigations into the connection between the gulf stream and coastal sea level in particular ezer et al 2013 and ezer 2019 suggest that changes in the strength of the gulf stream and its position relative to the middle atlantic bight north of cape hatteras affects sea level gradients they conclude that a strong gulf stream leads to lower coastal sea level in the middle atlantic bight while the effect is reduced south of the cape variability in the strength of the gulf stream can itself of course be a consequence of large scale forcing variability valle levinson et al 2017 show that between 2011 and 2015 sea level rise actually decelerated north of cape hatteras while accelerating to 3 times the global mean south of the cape the latter phenomenon also being reported by park and sweet 2015 valle levinson et al 2017 show this sea level rise hot spot to be active over the past 95 years with a shifting latitude they suggest that the existence of the hot spot is conditional upon the cumulative effects of el niño and that the latitudinal position depends on the cumulative effects of the nao the acceleration of sea level rise south of the cape has also been attributed to a 0 2 c per year warming of the florida current and the deceleration north of the cape to a combination of increased atmospheric surface pressure changing wind patterns and cooling domingues et al 2018 volkov et al 2019 suggest that sea level south of the cape is largely driven by large scale meridional heat transport influenced by the amoc stronger mean heat transport by the florida current leads to higher thermosteric sea level in the interior ocean at mid latitudes which is then coherent with coastal sea level and they show the very large scale first mode of variability of ssh steric and thermosteric sea levels to have a similar tripole spatial pattern they also point to the large scale atmospheric forcing with a positive nao also leading to higher interior sea level across the same latitude band the nao shifts the zero wind stress curl line northward and increases its zonal tilt i e the eastern portion of the zero wind stress curl is shifted farther northward the nao results in a more zonal zero wind stress curl this feature of the nao in terms of ocean circulation has been discussed by marshall et al 2001 in terms of sea level the resulting increase or decrease in interior ssh near cape hatteras appears to influence the ssh on the shelf along the florida coastline remote forcing from the interior ocean has also been put forward as an explanation for large interannual to decadal variability in the amplitude of the sea level annual cycle south of cape hatteras calafat et al 2018 they suggest that larger amplitudes in the annual cycle coherent along much of the coast from cape hatteras into the gulf of mexico are the result of density anomalies in the interior ocean travelling westward towards the western boundary they note that larger annual cycle amplitudes correspond with larger annual upper mid ocean transport which would be explained by a larger pressure gradient between eastern and western boundaries of the atlantic this latter point clearly brings into focus the connection between western boundary sea level and the amoc discussed in detail by bingham and hughes 2009 and little et al 2019 with consequences for meridional heat transport zhai et al 2011 and thereby also the climate clearly there are a number of forcing phenomena that are correlated with coastal sea level variability however in order to explain the spatial distribution of coastal sea level variability we must also consider the actual process of adjustment between the coast and interior ocean linear theory with idealised geometry and bathymetry suggests that western boundary sea level is determined by what occurs poleward of the point being considered wise et al 2018 2020 minobe et al 2017 but this neglects any possible role of advection by a boundary current this work takes the next step by considering realistic bathymetry and allowing nonlinear terms so that advection of potential vorticity is accounted for 1 2 boundary waves because the western boundary acts like a wall a flow approaching the coast must either diverge in the along shore direction or sink to become balanced by an offshore bottom ekman flow implying that the dynamics at the coast are not as they are in the interior ocean this has important consequences for how sea level variability is spatially distributed along the coastline and draws attention to the role of the continental slope in separating the shelf from the interior ocean while ssh anomalies can spread relatively slowly via advection by the current here we look at the quicker mechanism of signal propagation by waves trapped to the coast boundary huthnance 1975 1978 huthnance 1987 chapman and brink 1987 and huthnance 2004 show that in idealised experiments with stratification forcing in the interior ocean due to wind stress or density gradients elicits an essentially barotropic response along the shelf which propagates over long distances with the boundary on the right in the northern hemisphere these waves are trapped in the sense that they decay in amplitude away from the boundary for eastern boundaries clarke and van gorder 1994 show that at typical el niño southern oscillation enso frequencies on shelf sea level sea level on the shelf signals travel poleward with a reduction in amplitude as latitude increases using isopycnal models validated with altimetry roussenov et al 2008 find that changes in high latitude forcing are communicated along the western north atlantic continental slope by boundary waves over several thousand kilometres the result is coherent signals in ssh and bottom pressure variability over large distances see also hughes and meredith 2006 and hughes et al 2018 the body of literature investigating coastally trapped waves ctw in various settings is extensive see hughes et al 2019 brink 1991 huthnance et al 1986 and mysak 1980 for reviews here by assuming that the response on the shelf and upper slope is dominated by barotropic dynamics as studies noted above suggest we focus specifically on barotropic waves which can also be thought of as waves in a homogeneous upper layer of the ocean that is grounded on the sea floor between the upper slope and coast i e its lower surface is in contact with the shelf and upper slope offshore the layer represents only the upper portion of the water column and is considered to have a motionless rigid ocean beneath which does not exchange any fluid with the upper layer this simplification allows us to model the barotropic adjustment at the coast to an interior ssh anomaly regardless of which specific forcing phenomenon produced it i e wind or density induced ssh anomaly we simply relate coastal sea level to the interior sea level remote forcing for example fluctuations in wind stress in the interior ocean produce a ssh anomaly in the interior ocean that elicits a response on the shelf and slope remote forcing for annual to decadal forcing periods marshall and johnson 2013 showed for the first baroclinic mode wave and wise et al 2020 showed for barotropic topographic waves that interior ssh anomalies possibly carried westward by long rossby waves modify the amplitude and speed of southward propagating boundary waves generated by local and remote forcing farther northward as the southward propagating boundary waves dissipate energy due to friction they reduce in amplitude and the incident long rossby waves from the interior modify the amplitude of the boundary waves to a greater extent thereby allowing greater penetration of interior ssh variability importantly the rate of dissipation has been shown to depend on a number of factors steepness and width of the bottom topography friction parameter as well as latitude wise et al 2020 2018 huthnance 2004 chapman and brink 1987 brink and allen 1978 this theory will be described in more detail in section 3 3 note that while we do not explicitly cover the case of local forcing on the shelf on shelf alongshore wind stress forcing also produces topographic waves that propagate with the coast on the right 2 model and analysis method 2 1 model setup the model is based on a 2d configuration polton et al 2020 of the nemo 4 0 general ocean circulation model gurvan madec and nemo system team 2019 that we have modified to create a barotropic north atlantic western boundary the model has one active layer using a terrain following s coordinate and the horizontal grid is a 1 12 of a degree grid using the nemo orca r12 grid while the bottom topography at the western boundary is realistic we use the 15 arc second gebco compilation group 2019 gridded data set we modify it in two ways firstly we set the maximum depth for the entire domain to a constant h c 500 m i e any depth h x y greater than h c is set equal to h c this allows us to represent an idealised upper ocean layer between the upper slope and coast as a result throughout the text the slope refers to the regions where the bathymetric depth is between 200 and 500 m consequently the interior upper ocean layer is considered to begin at the 500 m depth contour recall that we define the shelf region as bathymetric depth less than 200 m and the coast to be the very inner shelf region it should be noted here that 500 m will not be the ideal upper layer thickness for all latitudes wise et al 2018 suggest that for an idealised linear barotropic ocean a thinner upper ocean layer thickness will increase the penetration of sea level anomalies from the interior to the coast and is equivalent to increasing the bottom friction parameter or decreasing the width of the shelf a second modification made to the bathymetry is a truncation to the eastern extent of the domain to roughly follow the mid atlantic ridge which retains an adequate interior ocean for subpolar and subtropical gyres to form and set up the interior ssh the lateral boundaries are closed except for the northern and southern boundaries which have flather 1994 radiation conditions imposed on the velocity normal to the boundary allowing gravity waves to exit the domain external field variables are taken to be zero the purpose of the flather condition is to minimise any artificial leakage of the interior ocean signal onto the shelf close to the boundary however we do also consider the case where the northern and southern boundaries are closed for land boundaries partial slip is imposed for bottom friction which is non linear it is sensible to assume that there is a reduced frictional effect on the upper layer of the flow in the interior ocean and we therefore use two different friction coefficients one for the shelf and slope c d s and another smaller value c d i n for greater depths i e where h h c the main effect of this is to create a more realistic boundary current since a large friction parameter in the interior ocean was found to create an unrealistically wide boundary layer in preliminary experiments to some extent the quadratic friction formulation used will also reduce bottom friction effects in the deeper open ocean ultimately our goal is to create a realistic interior ssh to relate to the on shelf ssh finally the model is set up to use a lateral bilaplacian diffusive operator and a free surface all parameter values are listed in table 1 2 2 forcing forcing of the model is provided exclusively via an idealised zonal wind stress τ u all other forcing mechanisms are turned off as previously noted from an analysis point of view it is unimportant how the interior ocean ssh is set up however using wind stress allows us to maintain extremely simple boundary conditions while selecting a wind stress magnitude that results in quite realistic ssh gradients the wind stress magnitude applied is unrealistically large i e approximately double observed values however this is also physically reasonable given the reduced domain width the model experiments have two forcing stages a spin up stage and a stage where the wind stress changes in time and space during the spin up a quasi steady state is established using a time independent zonal wind stress which we consider as the time mean wind stress τ u m x y as shown in fig 1a the spatial structure of this wind stress forcing pattern is chosen to be representative of the long period time mean zonal wind stress e g see hellerman and rosenstein 1983 note that a key feature of the wind pattern is the intersection of the zero wind stress curl contour with the western boundary and also its basin scale characteristics i e the zero curl line where τ u is maximal or minimal is not zonal in fig 1a the zero wind stress curl corresponds to the contours emanating from 35n and 20n the latitude of the zero wind stress curl relative to cape hatteras plays an important role in how the gulf stream separates from the boundary and this has been discussed in detail for a barotropic ocean e g dengo 1993 munday and marshall 2005 and for more complex settings e g chassignet and marshall 2008 and bryan et al 2007 in terms of the interior ssh this is important for creating a realistic step up in ssh where the gulf stream separates using a spin up period of 3 years fig 2a shows the model ssh across the entire domain and fig 2b shows the model ssh along the 800 m and 40 m depth contours as well as the mean dynamic sea level mdsl derived from altimetry along the same contours note that the contours are denoted in fig 2a the mdsl is the 22 year mean 1993 2014 inclusive from aviso the ssalto duacs delayed mode gridded absolute dynamic topography product using all available satellites given the relatively simple nature of the model idealised forcing and vertical structure it is surprising how well the model captures the observed ssh the main differences to note are that the model gulf stream separates slightly too far southward and some on shelf processes are obviously missing the sub polar ssh low is also slightly under represented which is probably due to the missing eddy driven recirculation gyre just north of the gulf stream between approximately 36n and 41n see fig 3 of liu et al 2018 following the spin up a wind stress anomaly τ u a x y t that varies in space and time is added to the mean field 1 τ u x y t τ u m x y τ u a x y t to isolate the relationship between interior and coastal ssh the wind stress anomaly is damped close to the continental slope of the north american mainland and set to zero on the shelf and slope this ensures that variability on the shelf and slope is due to interior ocean dynamics only defining the wind stress in this way does have the drawback of introducing an artificial wind stress curl between the interior and coast however with adequate damping i e avoiding large τ u y this contribution is found to only moderately affect the zonal integral of the wind stress curl not shown and does not materially affect the results and discussion presented specifically the wind stress anomaly τ u a is set to zero on the shelf and slope of the north american mainland i e not the various islands in the domain and a linear ramp up is applied over approximately 2 degrees of latitude from the foot of the upper continental slope at the 500 m isobath the wind stress anomaly is defined to induce two general effects on the interior ssh representative of the interior ocean variability suggested by observational studies firstly we wish to fluctuate the magnitude of the ssh north and south of the gulf stream separation latitude this is achieved by simply adding a wind stress contribution τ u a 1 x y t that modulates the mean wind stress amplitude in time but with the same spatial pattern as the mean i e as shown in fig 1a this contribution to the anomaly is periodic with a period of 4 years and amplitude 0 1 n m 2 the mean field amplitude is 0 4 n m 2 this forcing pattern is referred to in the remainder of the text as the mean forcing pattern in addition we wish to fluctuate in time the spatial structure of the interior ssh this is achieved by adding another wind stress contribution τ u a 2 y t which is zonally uniform except for the damping and differs from the mean field in its latitudinal structure see fig 1b again this contribution to the anomaly is periodic but with only a 2 year period note that τ u a 2 y t is based on the wind anomaly due to the nao specifically we have approximately represented the meridional nao profile used by zhai et al 2014 where they have regressed monthly reanalysis zonal wind stress onto the nao index for the period 1950 2010 and then zonally averaged i e multiplying this wind stress by the monthly nao index gives a zonal mean wind stress anomaly that fluctuates in time with the nao index we will refer to this forcing pattern as the nao forcing pattern in the above cases the ssh gradients result from the mounding and depression of ssh due to wind driven convergence and divergence the currents in and out of the western boundary which are associated with the ssh gradients are therefore strengthened and weakened as the gradients increase and decrease respectively for example valle levinson et al 2017 propose that la niña and el niño climate patterns result in a modulation of the wind stress magnitudes in the north atlantic via the pacific north american teleconnection producing an increase and decrease respectively of volume transport into the western boundary which they suggest is connected to a coherent sea level rise and fall along the us east coast our mean forcing pattern is similarly a modulation of mean wind stress magnitude our nao forcing pattern effectively adds a modulation in wind stress which is shifted northward relative to the mean pattern it is important to appreciate that such interior sea level gradients can also be the result of thermal expansion and contraction of the water column for example south of cape hatteras sea level gradients can increase due to variability in warming of the florida current domingues et al 2018 or due to variability in the volume transport of the florida current for example which can advect temperature and generate meridional heat transport volkov et al 2019 north of cape hatteras similar steric variability and sea level gradients can result from temperature and salinity anomalies in the southern subpolar gyre frederikse et al 2017 the coupling between heat and salt fluxes variations in circulation such as the amoc and large scale atmospheric patterns such as the nao is complex see for example volkov et al 2019 and to restate while the forcing phenomena are clearly of importance we are focusing on the relationship between an interior ssh and the on shelf ssh in order to efficiently use computer time we apply both fluctuating fields simultaneously over a 4 year model run and separate out the responses in post processing the fluctuating wind stress anomaly is therefore defined as 2 τ u a x y t d x y τ u a 1 x y t τ u a 2 y t where d x y is the damping this fluctuating forcing is used to set up ssh variability that represents the interior ssh variability described in the various observational studies discussed in the introduction 2 3 data analysis to determine the connection between the interior ocean and coastal sea level we apply a hilbert transformed complex empirical orthogonal function ceof analysis to the model ssh output unlike with correlation maps or standard eofs this approach allows us to investigate the spatial and temporal phase and amplitude of the domain wide response a full review of the method is described by hannachi et al 2007 here we give a brief overview of the method for the ssh field anomaly η t η t 1 η t 2 η t m t where m is the total number of grid points and t 1 2 n is the time index the complex field is 3 ξ t η t i h η t where h denotes the hilbert transform operator this results in an imaginary part of the time series in which each fourier component is the same as for the real part but with a 90 degree phase shift the eofs of ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n are complex and the spatial amplitude of the k th ceof p k is given by 4 a k p k where denotes the component wise absolute values of p k the spatial phase of the k th ceof is then 5 θ k arg p k where arg denotes the component wise arguments of p k similarly the temporal amplitude and phase are obtained from the complex principal components cpc q such that the temporal amplitude of the k th cpc is 6 b k q k and the k th temporal phase is 7 ϕ k arg q k the variability described by each k th mode can therefore be written as 8 a x y b t e i θ x y ϕ t with a summation of all modes returning the original signal subscript k is implicit by design virtually all variability in our experiments is attributable to the two wind stress forcing patterns that we have imposed as a result the temporal amplitude and temporal phase of the two modes of variability that the ceof analysis finds are simply close representations of the forcing patterns temporal evolution for example the temporal phases represent the 4 yr and 2 yr periods of the two forcing patterns as a result we do not present the resulting temporal amplitude and phase plots but instead normalise the spatial amplitudes by maximum temporal amplitude and present the spatial phases so that 90 is in phase with the wind forcing and 90 is out of phase with the wind forcing the reason that ceofs have been used is that while the spatial amplitude a x y is modulated in time by b t the spatial phase gives a sense of how anomalies propagate in space given the frequency of the wind forcing i e from 8 the temporal phase ϕ t ω t where ω is the frequency of the wind forcing spatial propagation can then be qualitatively captured because the spatial derivative of θ x y gives a local wavenumber 3 results and discussion in this section we will present and discuss the ceofs in context with the results from existing observational studies and boundary wave theory 3 1 ceofs modes of variability the ceof analysis of the model ssh output by design reveals two dominant modes of variability accounting for 95 of the variability with the modes associated with the two forcing patterns i e the mean forcing pattern and the nao forcing pattern note that the relative variance explained by each could be somewhat misleading given that it will depend on the amplitudes we have chosen for the two wind stress contributions with that said the two different wind stress amplitudes are comparable and it is interesting to note the similarity of the variance explained with that found for the two dominant eof modes by valle levinson et al 2017 which were suggested to be related to enso and the nao panels a and c in fig 3 show the spatial amplitude and phase respectively of the mean pattern τ u a 1 ceof which accounts for 71 of the variability note that panels b and d show the amplitude and phase on the shelf and slope in finer detail and will be considered in section 3 3 for the discussion on the propagation of variability panel a shows the amplitude of ssh variability in the interior ocean white contour denotes 500 m isobath resulting from strengthening and weakening of the subpolar and subtropical gyres as the magnitude of the zonal windstress increases and decreases along the coast there is clear leakage of interior ssh variability onto the shelf with amplitudes substantially reduced the largest coastal variability is seen between 32n and 38n around cape hatteras panel c shows the coastal variability along the entire north american east coast as far south as 25n to be coherent relative to the long 4 year period of the mode implying rapid propagation generally speaking this coastal signal is in phase with the interior signal north of 37n and mostly out of phase with the interior signal south of 37n although the signal immediately offshore of the slope is also in phase with the shelf extending to about 33n the mean pattern mode coastal ssh anomaly is therefore of reduced magnitude compared to the interior it is attenuated and there is a southward displacement i e the anomaly at the coast appears to be farther south than in the interior panels a and c in fig 4 show the spatial amplitude and phase for the nao pattern τ u a 2 ceof accounting for 22 of the variability together they show nao nao forcing a positive negative ssh anomaly across much of the interior which penetrates in phase onto the shelf most notably south of 33n the amplitude of shelf variability north of 33n is very small the on shelf variability differs from the mean pattern in that it is entirely in phase with the interior with no direct forcing on the shelf and slope the immediate implication from the two modes of variability is that phenomena increasing the interior ssh will drive a smaller increase in coastal ssh that is displaced southward along the coast relative to the interior signal in the mean pattern mode case the amplitude initially grows in the southward direction with the increasing influence of the subpolar gyre then it starts to decrease as the out of phase subtropical gyre influence penetrates in the nao pattern mode case interior sea level is in phase everywhere so the coastal sea level signal keeps increasing all the way to the tip of florida as will be discussed in the following two subsections this is consistent with observational studies and linear wave theory before discussing observations it should be noted that the radiative boundary conditions at the northern and southern boundaries of the domain can have an impact on the character of the modes of variability for example a large portion of the variability in the nao pattern mode fig 4a and b is in phase which implies that the majority of the surface elevation tends to rise and fall coherently across the domain this suggests that mass is not conserved and implies that the flather boundary conditions are playing a large role in leaking mass in and out of the domain in the real ocean mass would be able to spread north and south of the domain being modelled as occurs here but here the dynamics that are occurring in these unmodelled regions is being lost to demonstrate this issue more clearly figs 5 and 6 show the same experiment with closed northern and southern boundaries it is clear from panels a and c in fig 6 that the nao pattern mode of variability is indeed strongly influenced by the boundary conditions with the on shelf response significantly altered this can be explained as follows with mass unable to leak from the domain the surface elevation in the northern and southern portions of the domain is out of phase with the central band of the domain due to conservation this does not occur in the flather experiment this ultimately results in a very different on shelf response because variability on the shelf is strongly controlled by variability occurring at higher latitudes than the point of interest on the shelf in fact the contrast between the two experiments highlights this point quite clearly and the mechanism behind this important result is discussed in more detail in section 3 3 clearly the choice of boundary conditions is an important concern here we suspect that the reality is somewhere between the two cases flather and closed this is because some spreading of mass northward and southward of the domain should be expected in reality and this would be compensated for at other locations in the interior ocean that have also not been included in the domain but crucially that are not necessarily adjacent to the continental slope as is the case in the closed experiment 3 2 consistency with observational studies most strikingly the results of the nao pattern mode are consistent with coherent variability on the shelf south of cape hatteras being forced remotely this can occur by warming cooling of the florida current as found by domingues et al 2018 volkov et al 2019 and by the nao valle levinson et al 2017 volkov et al 2019 similarly interior ocean anomalies have been shown to modulate the amplitude of the sea level annual cycle south of the cape calafat et al 2018 the mean pattern mode is also consistent with the correlation maps in frederikse et al 2017 and andres et al 2013 depicting coherence between the coastal sea level variability north of cape hatteras and the interior sea level farther northward though their correlation maps do not show coherence extending significantly south of cape hatteras as found here perhaps most interestingly the eof modes of coastal 5 yr rates of sea level change depicted in figure 3 of valle levinson et al 2017 bear a remarkable resemblance to the two modes presented here they show their first mode as being responsible for in phase variability along the entire coastline whereas their second mode is responsible for variability along the entire coastline but in anti phase roughly about cape hatteras the combination of the two modes results in a hot spot which is highly mobile latitudinally our results support the idea that multiple modes of variability could be important for understanding north american east coast hot spots an interpretation of observations together with our modelling results are as follows a mode of variability acts coherently and in phase along the coastal zones both north and south of cape hatteras this mode is driven by a modulation of interior ssh gradients north of cape hatteras due potentially either to strengthening of the westerlies or steric variability in the southern sub polar gyre frederikse et al 2017 a second mode of variability also acts coherently along the entire coastline this can be related to the effect of the nao and in reality also to warming cooling of the florida current creating off shelf ssh highs lows in the sub tropical band of the ocean and on shelf highs lows south of cape hatteras while this mode acts coherently along the entire shelf observational studies discussed in the introduction i e piecuch et al 2019 suggest that the nao can also modulate on shelf winds north of cape hatteras which we have not included that could modify the phase of the response north of the cape 3 3 relating hot spots to boundary waves the coherence of the signal along the shelf despite the absence of direct forcing on the shelf suggests that interior variability generates a long barotropic trapped wave response at the boundary which rapidly transmits ssh information southward along the coast to understand the variability depicted by the ceofs in terms of boundary waves we will use the results of wise et al 2020 derived from an idealised model following wise et al 2020 consider an idealised barotropic case of a western boundary modelled by a rectangular domain with positive y in the direction of increasing latitude y 0 at the equator and positive x in the direction of increasing longitude the bottom topography is described by the function h x and increases in depth monotonically from zero at the western edge coast x 0 to some greater depth at the eastern edge of the domain which is hundreds of kilometres east of the coast and is taken to be the interface between the western boundary region and the interior ocean note that while the bottom topography described by h x is uniform alongshore it does include a continental shelf and slope the long wave approximation momentum equations gill and schumann 1974 including a simple representation of alongshore dissipation via bottom friction are 9 f h v g h η x 0 10 h v t f h u g h η y r v where u u x y t v x y t is the horizontal velocity η x y t is the dynamic sea level g is gravity f β y is the coriolis parameter and r is the friction parameter the continuity equation is given by h u 0 assume that variability from the interior ocean occurs between a poleward latitude y p and equatorward latitude y e in the interior ocean variability on interannual time scales of basin scale can be carried westward by long rossby waves and this can be represented by imposing a boundary condition on the eastern edge of the model domain in the form η i n y e i ω t where ω is the frequency of the variability and subscript in denotes interior for variability with a multiannual or longer period wise et al 2020 derive the solution in the form 11 η x y t η x y e i ω t where 12 η x y η i n y y y p j 1 w j x y s d s eqs 11 12 show that the solution in the western boundary region consists of the long rossby wave from the interior first term on the right of 12 modified by a second term which captures the effect of the excited boundary waves where w j is complex and describes the boundary wave modes note that marshall and johnson 2013 derive a related solution for the first mode baroclinic case with a vertical sidewall i e no continental shelf and slope eqs 11 and 12 can be written in exponential form as 13 η x y t a x y e i φ x y ω t thus describing the response on the shelf and slope for a given frequency ω by its amplitude a and phase φ note how this is in the same form as 8 which gives the variability described by each ceof mode hence each ceof mode can be thought of in terms of 11 and 12 that is in terms of the long rossby wave the interior sea level variability just offshore of the slope and the excited boundary waves that this variability generates a crucial point to note is that the effect of the boundary waves on the sea level at each latitude involves an integral of the waves between that latitude and the most poleward latitude of the variability the sea level response on the continental shelf and slope at each latitude is therefore the combined effect of the long rossby wave from the interior at that latitude and the sum of the boundary wave modes integrated over the latitudinal extent of the variability it is in this way that variability from higher latitudes is able to affect the sea level response on the slope and shelf at lower latitudes i e it propagates via the boundary waves note that wise et al 2020 showed that the effect of friction is to dampen the wave amplitudes as they propagate equatorward and dissipate energy hence regions of large dissipation reduce the extent to which boundary waves carry anomalies to lower latitudes as noted in the introduction the drivers of coastal variability are debated because it is typically difficult to determine the pathways of variability from ocean to coast i e which sections of interior variability adjacent to the slope are driving sea level variability along specific sections of coastline the phase and amplitude of the ceofs in our simplified experiments are useful for determining this figure panels 3d and 4d show the spatial phases of the ceofs on the shelf in very fine colourmap resolution the temporal phase of both modes of variability is positive and in phase with the two wind forcing components an approximate local wave number can be obtained from the spatial phase plots and the sign of the local wavenumber can be estimated by noting the direction of the phase lag for example decreasing spatial phase with increasing latitude implies a negative meridional wavenumber southward propagation on the shelf can be identified in both figs 3d and 4d from theory variability should be coherent in phase along the steepest parts of the topography such as the slope an idea supported by observations roussenov et al 2008 hughes and meredith 2006 this is difficult to see in our results due to the limited grid resolution on the upper slope nevertheless it is clear from the mean pattern mode amplitude plot fig 3b that while maximum interior variability of the same phase as on the shelf is located at 42n and 38n the maximum amplitude on the shelf is at 33n and there is a distinct southward displacement of the inner shelf amplitude relative to the outer shelf the picture presented by the fine colourbar resolution plots in conjunction with eqs 11 13 is instructive and implies the ceofs can be interpreted as follows the interior ssh variability adjacent to the slope the first term on the right in 12 excites boundary waves which propagate equatorward w j in 12 this southward propagation is evident in the phase plots on the shelf and slope though propagation is not exclusively southward which hints at possible nonlinear effects or effects of the local bathymetry not covered in idealised theory the southward displacement in the amplitude of the variability on the shelf clearly seen in the high resolution amplitude plots is then the result of the integral of the boundary waves in 12 combined with the interior ssh hence hot spots of variability adjacent to the slope can drive variability on the shelf at lower latitudes wise et al 2020 showed that the boundary waves dissipate more of their energy and decay over a shorter distance when bottom friction is larger and where the bathymetry is steeper hence the degree of southward displacement of the interior variability as it penetrates onto the shelf can depend on the local bathymetry and local dissipation friction an appreciation of how the boundary wave mechanism adjusts coastal sea level is important for example when considering modulation of sea level south of cape hatteras part of the variability will ultimately originate a number of degrees farther northward in the interior and on shelf however because the interior ocean signal may be correlated i e the variability in the interior ocean may be coherent over many degrees of latitude and because the boundary adjustment is rapid it can be difficult to identify the northern origin of the variability this point is clear when comparing the phase of the nao pattern mode in low resolution and high resolution consider also the ssh variability in the mean pattern mode south of 33 n on first inspection it appears as though the interior ssh variability offshore of the florida coastline does not influence coastal ssh however this is simply because the on shelf and interior variability are in anti phase hence the interior variability in the mean pattern mode simply acts to reduce the amplitude of the on shelf variability at these latitudes the long wave and excited boundary waves first and second terms on the right in 12 nearly cancel one another the fine colourbar resolution amplitude and phase for the nao pattern mode shown in fig 4b and d again demonstrate the interior ocean signal appearing to leak onto the shelf at lower latitudes the interior ssh signal offshore of florida is now increasing rather than decreasing the amplitude of the on shelf ssh variability because they are in phase in this case the interior long wave and the excited boundary waves no longer cancel one another at those latitudes furthermore because trapped waves are sensitive to bottom topography wise et al 2020 huthnance 1987 identifying signal origin could be particularly problematic when using coarse resolution models around areas such as the florida straits where bathymetric features can be difficult to resolve in a barotropic model the interior ocean adjusts quickly to variability in forcing which is useful here but in the real stratified interior ocean baroclinic rossby waves are slower thus amplifying the decoupling in the timescale of response between the interior ocean and upper slope or shelf for realistic damping and where changes in interior sea level occur over long time periods the variability of forcing is slow relative to the adjustment at the boundary and boundary waves effectively carry out the adjustment along the boundary instantaneously in this case a reasonable approximation to 9 and 10 is to neglect time dependence giving a steady state form of the solution 11 12 i e equation 31 of wise et al 2020 this approach is adopted in idealised studies of western boundary sea level by wise et al 2018 minobe et al 2017 and hong et al 2000 producing good qualitative agreement with model output and observations therefore even for long period sea level change in the interior it is instructive to see that there is a boundary wave contribution to the response along the boundary but it is quick relative to the time scale of change in the interior to demonstrate this we show in fig 7 the solution 12 in the steady state for three different interior sea level anomalies that correspond to the interior sea level anomalies produced by the mean and nao forcing patterns in our numerical model experiments we also show the long wave and boundary wave contributions to the solution i e the two terms in the solution note that we used the solution derived in wise et al 2020 their equation 31 the three experiments are detailed in table 2 panels 1 a c show the long wave contribution the boundary wave contribution and their sum the solution for experiment 1 of table 2 this experiment introduces an interior sea level anomaly representative of that created by the mean forcing pattern a change in the sea level associated with stronger subpolar and subtropical gyres panel 1a shows the interior sea level penetrate to the coast panel 1b shows the adjustment term due to the excited boundary waves and panel 1c shows the resulting net sea level response where sea level change here a decrease in the subpolar gyre leaks onto the shelf with reduced magnitude and southward displacement around cape hatteras further south of cape hatteras the influence of the subtropical gyre begins to cancel the effect of the subpolar gyre the solution is highly consistent with the mean pattern ceof in figs 3 and 5 panels 2 a c show the same for an interior sea level anomaly representative of that created by the nao forcing pattern an in phase change in the interior sea level experiment 2 in table 2 the net response in panel 2c shows the interior sea level change here an increase leak onto the shelf south of cape hatteras again the sea level change magnitude is reduced and it is displaced southward relative to the interior this is also highly consistent with the nao pattern ceof in fig 4 the final experiment 3 in table 2 is the same as the previous experiment 2 but by subtracting the mean over the domain from the interior anomaly we have introduced an anomaly along the northern boundary as well this constant northern anomaly extends from the coast to the interior this experiment is designed to represent the nao forcing pattern in the case where the northern boundary was closed rather than radiative despite the change from experiment 2 panel 3b shows that the boundary wave response is in fact the same in the two cases and the net response in panel 3c is different because we effectively added an anomaly across the entire domain relative to experiment 2 this is clear since we could split panel 3a into its 2 linear terms the first term is the same as in experiment 2 and the second is its mean which is uniform across the domain panel 3c is as a result consistent with the nao pattern ceof for the closed boundary in fig 6 showing that to the south the interior signal will tend to cancel the northern sea level signal on the shelf a number of conclusions can be drawn from the consistency between the results of the idealised linear analytic model and the non linear numerical model that uses more realistic bathymetry firstly the conceptual framework whereby the western boundary sea level responds to change in the interior sea level via the generation of rapid boundary waves that modify the influence of the interior sea level at the coast appears to be robust secondly this conceptual framework is instructive for explaining western boundary sea level change over interannual and longer time periods finally because friction and bathymetry exert an influence over the decay characteristics of boundary waves wise et al 2020 huthnance 2004 the modelling of boundary sea level can be sensitive to the representation of both in numerical models e g changing the friction parameter changes the boundary wave contribution panels 1 3 b in fig 7 which then changes the modelled sea level response panels 1 3 c 3 4 non linear effects the extent to which nonlinear effects added by a mean flow such as the gulf stream will be important locally for the shelf and slope response to interior variability is an open question it is possible for example that boundary wave propagation is significantly modified which would modify how variability propagates along the shelf for the barotropic case friction has previously been shown to play a dominant role in modifying boundary waves and determining the character of the response on the shelf specifically friction at the boundary results in dissipation and this has been shown in linear models to dampen boundary waves enabling interior variability to leak onto the shelf wise et al 2020 marshall and johnson 2013 huthnance 2004 1987 an important result from our non linear barotropic model is that friction appears to remain a dominant process neglecting horizontal diffusion the role of friction in the barotropic vorticity equation can be related to the potential vorticity as 14 d d t ζ f h 1 h τ b h where d d t t u u are horizontal velocities is the horizontal derivative f is the coriolis parameter h is the depth h plus free surface and τ b is bottom friction without friction and with no mean flow u u v are now anomalous velocities potential vorticity ζ f h is conserved and the flow follows f h contours salmon 1998a when the problem is framed in terms of dynamic sea level η wise et al 2018 showed that it is natural to consider sea level contours following h f contours similarly for bottom pressure salmon 1998b the inclusion of friction enables the flow to deviate and in the linear case has been shown to enable sea level to penetrate from the interior onto the shelf crossing h f contours wise et al 2018 the inclusion of a mean flow clearly a consideration at western boundaries will modify the background potential vorticity for example ζ v x u y v x where v is the shear of a meridional mean flow as noted by mysak 1980 when the shear is comparable to f shelf waves can be significantly advected by the current it is not clear however to what extent this affects sea level penetration onto the shelf for the case without fluctuating forcing with the model in a quasi steady state such that t 0 fig 8a shows the frictional contribution to 14 i e the term on the right the figure shows a larger friction term on the slope and shelf and note also the enhanced off shelf friction contribution between 31 n and 34 n where the upper slope widens and narrows i e as the slope becomes narrow friction increases see hill 1995 for a linear discussion of leakage due to a narrowing slope fig 8b shows the non linear relative vorticity contribution u ζ h while both terms are noisy the important point is that the non linear term is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the friction contribution this suggests that even a strong mean flow does not significantly change the character of the frictional balance found in the linear case and therefore it does not prevent the low frequency on shelf sea level being determined by the dynamics poleward of the point in question i e the waves are not completely arrested by the mean current 3 5 stratification and other sources of variability the consistency of the results with theory and observational studies is convincing nevertheless by assuming a barotropic ocean we have neglected certain processes that could modify our results for example février et al 2007 showed that variation in the thickness of the active subsurface layer of a 2 5 layer model as a result of kelvin wave propagation could induce a thickness anomaly in the upper layer this forcing is proportional to the mean vorticity gradient and therefore can be large at the gulf stream separation area this forcing on the upper layer does not prevent the kelvin wave from propagating southward but does result in the appearance of a new coastal sea level anomaly with opposite sign in the vicinity of the gulf stream separation point in addition dewar and hogg 2010 and deremble et al 2017 discuss the role of non viscous energy dissipation from the mesoscale at boundaries they show that in a stratified flow kelvin and topographic waves trapped at the boundary can be arrested by an opposing balanced flow potentially important along the us east coast where the gulf stream could arrest trapped boundary waves it is worth speculating that the combined effects of stratification topography and mean flow could for example be an alternative explanation for greater de coherence between the regions north and south of cape hatteras than our results suggest furthermore it should be noted that the adjustment in the interior ocean will be slower and more latitude dependent in reality than in our model due to the fact that adjustment will take place via baroclinic rossby waves rather than the faster barotropic rossby waves even in a 500 m depth layer this implies that the temporal decoupling between deep ocean and coastal zone is more pronounced than our results suggest our results should be interpreted as the coastal response to the nearby ocean finally the choice of a 500 m layer depth was chosen partly to generate a realistic gulf stream however this will not be the best choice for all latitudes early idealised models suggested that the coast is insulated from interior ocean variability by the steep continental slope wang 1982 csanady and shaw 1983 our results and analysis add detail to this interpretation and show that the amplitude of interior variability is attenuated on the shelf for both forcing patterns considered here maximum interior variability is reduced in amplitude by approximately 80 on the shelf giving for example centimetre order elevations for tens of centimetres anomalies in the interior for comparison changes in atmospheric pressure lead to similar order changes in sea level via the inverse barometer effect where a 1 mbar decrease corresponds to a 1 cm increase in sea level on shelf wind stress is also a local driver of sea level change with order mm per year changes commonly resulting from interannual fluctuations domingues et al 2018 local interannual pressure and alongshore wind stress variability can therefore be important sources of centimetre scale sea level variability piecuch et al 2019 2016 piecuch and ponte 2015 another source of variability is the sea level annual cycle which typically has an amplitude of centimetre order calafat et al 2018 while these processes are important for setting the background sea level which increases the likelihood of nuisance flooding shorter time scale events such as storm surges due to hurricanes can act in addition to increased background sea level and can produce highly localised sea level anomalies measured in metres little et al 2015 in this context it is clear that interior ocean variability is not the only relevant source of variability nevertheless it is clearly important to understand how large scale changes in the oceans over many years might be communicated to the coast 4 summary observations have shown that sea level rise hot spots along the north american east coast are correlated with a number of forcing phenomena and can appear at different latitudes an understanding of the mechanisms by which the coast adjusts to forcing is important when explaining how hot spots of variability are distributed along the coast using a barotropic general circulation model of the north american east coast that includes realistic coastal bathymetry and nonlinear terms we have shown that there is good agreement with linear theory in modelling the coastal sea level response to ssh variability on the upper slope using a hilbert transform complex eof method we examine the propagation and amplitude of two modes of variability generated by interior ocean ssh anomalies that are characteristic of the remote ssh anomalies described by observational studies the mean forcing pattern mode of variability describes in phase variability along the entire coastline and is driven by a ssh anomaly in the subpolar gyre the nao forcing pattern mode of variability describes in phase variability along the coast south of cape hatteras and is driven by an interior ocean ssh anomaly consistent with the nao observations suggest that nao linked on shelf wind and pressure forcing would drive an anomaly of opposite phase north of cape hatteras though we have not tested this here the results presented are shown to be consistent with linear barotropic trapped wave theory such that boundary waves propagate with the coast on the right carrying ssh anomaly information equatorward along the shelf and slope the role of boundary waves in the adjustment process is used to explain how coastal sea level variability can be sensitive to interior ocean variability many degrees of latitude further north such that a hot spot of sea level variability in the subpolar gyre can drive a sea level anomaly to the north and south of cape hatteras indications from theory are that this southward displacement of variability is highly sensitive to the friction parameter on the shelf and slope as well as local shelf width wise et al 2018 2020 implying that an order of magnitude decrease in the friction parameter for example could increase the displacement further south of cape hatteras the decay of topographic waves due to bottom friction as described by linear theory appears to be the key barotropic process determining the degree to which anomalies on the shelf are attenuated and displaced relative to the interior this highlights the importance of accurately representing dissipation in numerical models the inclusion of non linear effects that enable advection of potential vorticity does not appear to significantly alter the dependence of coastal sea level on higher latitudes and this ultimately suggests that the gulf stream does not stop the lower mode coastally trapped waves from propagating acknowledging the limits of the barotropic assumption the analysis presented here fits in with the view that baroclinic variability might be strongly suppressed on western boundary shelves due to the rapid decay of higher wave modes as a result of the sloping topography and friction hughes et al 2018 furthermore it better ties in coastal sea level variability with the growing theory of how anomalies propagate about ocean basins e g hughes et al 2019 marshall and johnson 2013 johnson and marshall

23944,a set of realistic coastal coupled ocean wave numerical simulations is used to study the impact of surface gravity waves on a tidal temperature front and surface currents the processes at play are elucidated through analyses of the budgets of the horizontal momentum the temperature and the turbulence closure equations the numerical system consists of a 3d coastal hydrodynamic circulation model model for applications at regional scale mars3d and the third generation wave model wavewatch iii ww3 coupled with oasis mct at horizontal resolutions of 500 and 1500 m respectively the models were run for a period of low to moderate southwesterly winds as observed during the front de marée variable fromvar field campaign in the iroise sea where a seasonal small scale tidal sea surface temperature front is present over the 2 day period considered long fetch waves grow gradually propagating north east and east contrasting a stand alone ocean run with a coupled ocean wave run shows that waves move the ushant front offshore by up to 4 kilometres and cool the offshore stratified side of the front by up to 1 5 c the analysis of the temperature budget shows that the change in advection is the dominant factor contributing to the frontal shift while the contribution of wave enhanced vertical temperature diffusion is secondary temperature considered to be a tracer is advected in the coupled run by the lagrangian current resulting from the quasi eulerian and stokes drift although the stokes drift is directed shorewards changes in the quasi eulerian current lead to a more offshore advection in the coupled than the stand alone run the quasi eulerian current is reduced enhanced during the ebb flood flow which correspond to periods of wave following opposing currents this is due to wave breaking enhanced vertical mixing acting on the positive vertical gradient present in the quasi eulerian current during both ebb and flood tides partially coupled runs reveal that it is the surface flux of tke associated to wave breaking that is key rather than the changes in the surface stress they further elucidate the role of other modelled wave related processes although the contribution of the stokes coriolis force and the wave breaking induced enhancement in vertical mixing to the quasi eulerian current are of similar magnitude and sign it does not contribute significantly to the frontal shift this is because it partially counters the stokes drift advection which pushes the front shorewards all stokes drift related processes combined thus only lead to a very slight displacement of the front keywords ocean wave coupling coastal coupled modelling current wave interactions tidal front iroise sea 1 introduction in recent years much effort has been dedicated to understanding and quantifying the impacts of surface gravity waves on upper ocean currents and mixing as these can have significant physical and bio geochemical consequences see sullivan and mcwilliams 2010 cavaleri et al 2012 villas boâs et al 2019 and references therein the impacts in coastal seas are particularly relevant to a wide range of scientific questions and applications cavaleri et al 2018 modelling wave current interactions in coastal environments presents many challenges since they are governed by the interplay of multiple phenomena spanning a wide range of spatio temporal scales waves alter the momentum and energy input to the upper ocean they take up a portion of the wind input as they grow and release some to the ocean as they break they generate a mean lagrangian current in the direction of wave propagation known as the stokes drift on the rotating earth the stokes drift is affected by the coriolis force inducing a current perpendicular to wave propagation and a transport that compensates the stokes drift over an inertial period hasselmann 1970 xu and bowen 1994 interaction between the stokes drift velocity and the mean flow vorticity results in the stokes vortex force craik and leibovich 1976 lane et al 2007 the persistent vertical shear of the stokes drift tilts the vertical component of the vorticity that is perpendicular to the wind into the wind direction this promotes the generation of rolls aligned with the wind known as langmuir circulations langmuir 1938 a thorough overview of the effects of the stokes drift on currents can be found in suzuki and fox kemper 2016 wave breaking langmuir circulations stokes drift interaction with the coriolis force and stirring by non breaking waves all contribute to upper ocean mixing and turbulence wu et al 2015 as shown from measurements of the dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy agrawal et al 1992 terray et al 1996 a common and highly predictable feature of coastal oceans are tidal fronts these surface temperature fronts separate cold shallow waters nearshore where tidal friction produces enough turbulence to constantly mix the entire water column and warm waters offshore over depths where tidal mixing is not sufficient to erode the seasonal thermocline they appear in the spring and erode at the end of autumn such fronts present convergence zones associated with wave steepening and breaking baschek et al 2006 how in turn waves alter ocean currents temperatures and mixing around tidal fronts has not been studied in great detail because wave forcing is secondary to tidal forcing the wave adjustment of geostrophic fronts was studied by mcwilliams and fox kemper 2013 and suzuki et al 2016 showed the importance of the stokes shear in frontogenesis as they found it to energize the ageostrophic secondary circulations in these studies the stokes drift is of the same order of magnitude as the frontal circulation and both are of the order or larger than the background flow this is not the case around tidal fronts where the background tidal flow can be an order of magnitude larger than the frontal circulation and the stokes drift the setup of tidal fronts depends on the competing stratifying effect of solar radiation and tide driven mixing their location is largely determined by the magnitude of the tidal current and the water depth simpson 1981 however wave driven currents and mixing could alter the frontal position as this paper aims to elucidate distinguishing wave effects in current measurements is not a straightforward exercise polton et al 2005 rascle and ardhuin 2009 ardhuin et al 2009 and often does not allow for much more than qualitative inferences laboratory experiments kemp and simons 1982 1983 klopman 1993 1994 provided insights on how surface waves alter currents the dynamics they imply have yet to be verified in the field which may be in a different parameter regime their existence in the real or modelled ocean needs to be assessed theoretical frameworks provide insights into key physical processes but the high complexity of the system does not allow to go much beyond asymptotic behaviour mcwilliams et al 2004 and specific equilibria mcwilliams and fox kemper 2013 song 2009 numerical methods allow to better understand the processes at play however asymptotic approaches and parameterizations remain necessary in models one dimensional vertical models have been used to study wave modification to the ekman current trying to reproduce in situ current shear measurements rascle et al 2006 rascle and ardhuin 2009 large eddy simulations polton et al 2005 mcwilliams and fox kemper 2013 sullivan et al 2007 suzuki et al 2016 and direct numerical simulations sullivan et al 2004 remain idealistic and only represent a subset of wave related processes to investigate the multitude and complexity of processes at play in the coastal oceans realistic fully coupled ocean wave simulations are needed in coupled modelling the inclusion of wave processes heavily relies on parameterizations also the representation of wave current interactions is simpler than in the above mentioned theoretical work they are however largely based on assumptions supported by those idealized approaches and coupled simulations can provide a broader view of the processes at play to date several coupled model frameworks have been developed and exploited to study the impact of waves on currents in coastal seas osuna and wolf 2005 bolaños et al 2014 ràfols et al 2019 while bolaños et al 2014 concluded that waves do not significantly alter the tidally dominated component of the current but improved the transverse current component osuna and wolf 2005 showed large effects of waves on currents especially where the currents are strong and sheared ràfols et al 2019 reported no substantial differences in the water current field between coupled and uncoupled simulations it is important to note here that to date the majority of studies be it theoretical numerical or experimental have focused on cases where the stokes drift is comparable or stronger than the background flow filling this gap a new set of coupled model experiments were undertaken focusing on the iroise sea which provides an excellent natural laboratory to study interactions between the waves the ocean and the atmosphere in strongly tidally forced conditions located in the north atlantic off the coast of brittany france the iroise sea is subject to long fetch waves and features an intense seasonal surface thermal front the ushant tidal front fig 1 it is characterized by a strong surface temperature gradient separating the homogeneous waters of moderate temperatures 14 c close to the coast and the warm surface 16 c stratified waters offshore a second temperature front exists at the bottom separating the waters of the cold tongue which covers the continental shelf and the homogeneous waters close to the coast le boyer et al 2009 noted that the two fronts are governed by different dynamics meaning that the two fronts are not always co located the position of the surface front varies with the tidal current it is pushed towards the coast during the flood tide and towards the open sea by the ebb tide this paper provides a detailed study of the wave ocean coupling in the iroise sea with a focus on the impacts on the currents and surface temperatures around the ushant front based on a set of realistic forced and coupled coastal model runs these are described in section 2 along with an outline of the coupling framework key results are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 the conclusion section summarizes the results and processes at play finally it highlights the interest of the proposed model and analysis framework 2 model experiments in this section the equations at the heart of the stand alone ocean model are presented first followed by those used in the coupled configuration relevant aspects of the coupling between the ocean and the wave models are detailed exposing how wave related processes are taken into account these include stokes drift advection of tracers stokes coriolis and stokes vortex forces on the horizontal currents wave altered surface stress wave breaking induced turbulence and wave orbital velocity driven bottom stress configurations used for the ocean and wave models are then summarized along with the description of the simulations setup the equations of the wave model with currents are not recalled herein as the focus of the paper is on the ocean response to waves these can be found in ardhuin et al 2017 2 1 uncoupled ocean model the ocean model used in this study is the 3d coastal hydrodynamic circulation model mars3d model for applications at regional scale lazure and dumas 2008 and lazure et al 2009 mars3d resolves the primitive equations for an in compressible hydrostatic fluid under the boussinesq hypothesis the temporal evolution of a horizontal current u u i v in x x i y is modelled as 1 u t l u i f u z k u u z d d x k x d u d x 1 ρ 0 d p i d x g d ζ d x 1 ρ 0 d p a d x with the operator l u x v y w z and the complex derivative d d x x i y l u represents the non linear advection terms g the acceleration due to gravity ρ 0 1027 34 kg m 3 the reference water density f the coriolis parameter k u the vertical eddy viscosity and k x the horizontal ones ζ the sea surface height and p a and p i the surface atmospheric and internal pressures respectively since the model assumes the ocean to be hydrostatic p i is derived from p z ρ 0 b with the buoyancy given by b g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 and ρ the water density the vertical velocity follows from continuity the surface boundary conditions are given by the zonal and meridional wind stress τ a computed from the 10 m wind u 10 forcing using 2 τ a ρ a c d u 10 2 where c d is the drag coefficient based on charnock 1955 and ρ a the surface air density the evolution of a tracer c is given by the advection diffusion equation 3 c t x u c y v c z w c z k c c z f where k c is the vertical diffusivity the horizontal ones are set to 0 the source term f consists of the solar irradiance and long wave radiation for temperature the salinity evolves with water fluxes induced by precipitation minus evaporation as well as river outflows the surface boundary condition for temperature diffusion is the latent and sensible turbulent fluxes the eddy viscosity k u c μ k 2 ε and vertical diffusivity for temperature k c c μ k 2 ε are obtained from the two equation k ε model burchard 1998 burchard and bolding 2001 which was chosen in this study for turbulence closure the canuto et al 2001 version a ca stability functions c μ and c μ based on the non dimensional shear and buoyancy numbers as described in umlauf and burchard 2005 are used to damp enhance turbulence in stably unstably stratified conditions the turbulent kinetic energy tke k is modelled as 4 k t l k z ν k k z p d ε where the shear p and the buoyancy d contributions are functions of the vertical shear and the brunt väisäla frequency respectively in the configuration used here the advection term l k is neglected the equation of the tke dissipation rate ε is given by 5 ε t ε k c ε 1 p c ε 3 d c ε 2 ε z ν ε ε z the empirical constants c ε i 1 44 1 92 0 63 or 1 are taken from burchard and bolding 2001 and umlauf 2003 a positive negative c ε 3 is taken for unstable stable stratified flows canuto et al 2001 the eddy viscosities ν k and ν ε are computed through constant schmidt numbers as ν k ε k u σ k ε with σ k 1 and σ ε 1 3 a constant flux condition is used at the sea surface for eq 4 6 k z 0 for eq 5 the neumann type surface boundary condition is 7 ε z c μ 0 3 4 k 3 2 κ z 0 z 2 where c μ 0 0 077 ca z 0 is the surface roughness length z the distance to the surface boundary and κ 0 4 the von karman constant 2 2 coupled wave ocean model framework the mars3d has been coupled with the 3rd generation wave model wavewatchiii ww3 tolman 2014 through oasis mct voldoire et al 2017 as listed on the diagram fig 2 mars3d sends 3 fields to ww3 and receives 17 fields from ww3 the framework was developed in a way to minimize the parameterizations of wave dependent variables within the ocean model thus coupling as many fields directly computed from the source function of ww3 and the model wave spectra as possible rather than relying on say wave height dependent parameterizations the coupling between ww3 and mars3d occurs every 100 s the coupling module performs distance weighted nearest neighbour interpolations from one regular model grid to the other based on 4 points using the los alamos national laboratory scrip1 4 library jones 1999 the impact of waves on the ocean is modelled following the quasi eulerian framework ardhuin et al 2008 bennis et al 2011 based on wave averaged primitive equation limited to second order wave theory in the coupled ocean wave configuration eq 1 becomes 8 u ˆ t l ˆ u ˆ i f u ˆ z k u u ˆ z d d x k x d u ˆ d x 1 ρ 0 d p i d x g d ζ d x 1 ρ 0 d p a d x i f u s i v ˆ x u ˆ y u s u ˆ z w s j x where u ˆ is the quasi eulerian velocity defined as the difference between the lagrangian velocity u l and the horizontal stokes drift u s 9 u ˆ u l u s both u ˆ and u s satisfy continuity in eq 8 l ˆ u ˆ x v ˆ y w ˆ z and w s is the vertical component of the stokes drift new wave dependent terms appear on the right hand side terms of eq 8 the stokes coriolis force i f u s the stokes vortex force i u ˆ x u ˆ y u s u ˆ z w s and the wave induced bernoulli head pressure j smith 2006 in this configuration the model remains hydrostatic and the impact of the stokes shear on the pressure gradient see suzuki and fox kemper 2016 is not taken into account note that only surface stokes drift fields are sent by the wave model to the ocean model along with the stokes transport these are then used to approximate vertical stokes profiles based on breivik et al 2014 in addition to these modifications in current equations the boundary conditions are changed the surface stress felt by the ocean is no longer τ a but 10 τ surf τ a τ aw τ wo where τ aw corresponds to the amount of momentum used by wave formation and τ wo to the breaking wave induced stress transferred to the ocean these fields provided by ww3 are derived from the input and dissipation source functions tolman 2014 at the bottom boundary the stress due to the waves is added to the bottom friction it is computed from the bottom orbital velocities u bw and a wave friction factor following soulsby et al 1993 for the wave friction factor the parameterization of soulsby 1997 their eq 62a is used waves impact the advection of tracers which is done by the lagrangian velocity thus with waves eq 3 becomes 11 c t x u ˆ u s c y v ˆ v s c z w ˆ w s c z k c c z waves effects have also to be considered as impacting eddy viscosity and diffusion terms in eqs 8 and 11 this is achieved by modifying the surface boundary conditions of the turbulent closure equations and adding a new source terms within the bottom boundary layer the tke production term added to the right hand sides of eqs 4 and 5 is taken from walstra et al 2000 for k it stands as 12 p w b o t z 2 φ b b l δ 1 d ζ z δ for d ζ z δ where φ b b l is the wave energy dissipation due to bottom friction sent by ww3 to mars3d and d the topography the bottom wave boundary layer thickness δ is derived following grant and madsen 1982 their eqs 5 and 6 based on the wave friction factor these depend on the bottom orbital velocities u bw and the mean wave period t m 1 provided by ww3 thus eqs 4 and 5 become 13 k t l k z ν k k z p d ε p w b o t 14 ε t ε k c ε 1 p c ε 3 d c ε 2 ε z ν ε ε z ε k c ε 1 p w b o t for these two equations the neumann type boundary conditions taking the waves into account at the sea surface are given by 15 k z φ o c 16 ε z c μ 0 3 4 k 3 2 κ z z 0 2 c μ 0 3 4 3 2 σ k φ o c c μ κ 2 z z 0 2 with c μ 0 09 burchard 2001 and φ o c the wave to ocean energy flux provided by ww3 accounting for the injection of tke from breaking waves similarly to τ w o φ o c is derived from the parameterization chosen for the dissipation source function in ww3 note that φ o c replaces c w u 3 from the craig and banner 1994 model for the wave enhanced layer in the boundary conditions reported in burchard 2002 rather than considering the surface wave tke contribution as a flux it could be input as a vertically distributed at the scale of the heights of breaking waves production term similar to p w b o t given the very high mixing there is very little difference between these approaches rascle et al 2013 2 3 case study a realistic case study was devised to evaluate the impact of waves on the ushant tidal front under low to moderate winds given the relatively short period over which consistent wind and wave conditions prevail the simulations were run only for a couple of days this does not allow for a full tidal decomposition of the results however choosing a period in which waves propagate consistently in one direction allows straightforward contrasting of different wave tide alignments models mars3d ww3 were set up to best represent the conditions measured during the fromvar front de marée variable field campaign between the 02 and 04 september 2011 an anticyclonic circulation was present at the beginning of the campaign with very weak winds and calm seas with the arrival of an atmospheric front around 1700 utc on 02 september southwesterly winds gradually intensified to reach a local maximum of 14 m s 1 on 03 september around 1600 utc the coupled simulations were started on 02 september at 0600 utc but in the following analysis model outputs are only considered starting at 1200 utc allowing for adequate wave spin up from calm conditions 2 4 model configurations the models were run at high horizontal resolution 500 m for mars3d and 1500 m for ww3 over a domain spanning about 160 by 160 km2 fig 1 with hourly outputs the model configurations chosen are those used for operational purposes as part of the modelling and analysis for coastal research marc project https marc ifremer fr a stand alone mars3d run version v11 0 oaw01 was spun up starting january 2011 using a bay of biscay configuration with a horizontal resolution of 2 5 km similar to that used operationally for prévimer lazure et al 2009 precursor to the marc project a fine resolution zoom 500 m over the iroise sea was embedded into the regional grid and integrated through 2 way agrif nesting debreu et al 2008 this zoom provided the initial and lateral boundary conditions for the mars3d simulations used in the present study run from 0600 utc on 02 september 2011 to 0000 utc on 04 september 2011 the stand alone mars3d simulation analysed herein gives almost identical outputs to the zoom the chosen model configuration and forcing were shown to best reproduce the front choice of the turbulence scheme was motivated by previous model development bennis et al 2011 mars3d was forced with tidal components taken from the global finite element solution tide model fes2004 lyard et al 2006 and atmospheric forcing fields consistent with those used to force the bay of biscay run these atmospheric forcing fields come from the operational french forecast model arome with a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 0 025 2 5 km arome provides the following variables to mars3d 2 metre air temperature atmospheric pressure relative humidity 10 m zonal and meridional wind components and cloud cover heat fluxes are internally computed based on the nomads 2 parameterization for solar fluxes proposed by gill 1982 the edf parameterization for thermal fluxes described in dumas and langlois 2009 and coare 3 0 fairall et al 2003 for the turbulent fluxes mars3d operates on an arakawa c grid with topographically conformal vertical coordinate σ system the vertical resolution was set to 40 σ levels fig 3 shows the mean surface 0 30 m vertical resolution over a tidal cycle the top sigma level is about 15 cm below the sea surface each subsequent sigma level is about 30 cm deep over the top 2 4 m of the water column then gradually increase in thickness to be around 0 5 m at 5 m below the water line surface diagnostics of the current and temperature equations shown in the results section are from the top sigma level while near surface k ε diagnostics are from the top mid level the model automatically controls the timestep starting from a maximum timestep of 20 s and a critical courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition set to 0 6 the quick kowalik and murty 1993 numerical scheme is used for the advection of currents for tracer temperature and salinity a fifth order upwind scheme is used for horizontal advection and an upwind compact and conservative scheme is used for vertical advection debreu and duhaut 2011 these are employed in a three dimensional two step macho method leonard et al 1996 an implicit scheme is used for vertical diffusion of currents and tracers the forcing parameterizations and numerical schemes chosen correspond to those used in the bay of biscay configuration which combined with the agrif downscaling method allow for the best representation of the ushant front in ww3 adapted from v5 16 the spectral space was discretized using 32 frequencies ranging from 0 0373 to 0 7159 hz in 10 steps f i 1 1 1 f i where i is a discrete grid counter and f the frequency with 24 directions δ θ 15 the overall timestep was set to 100 s the spatial cfl without currents and spectral refraction propagation timesteps to 25 s and the integration of the source function to 10 s the physics package used is st3 which prescribes an f 5 spectral tail outside the model frequency range bidlot et al 2005 tolman et al 2014 this set of source function parameterizations was chosen for their ability to reproduce the variability in the drag coefficient for a review of the performances of the different physics packages available see stopa et al 2016 the model was started from calm conditions h s 0 and forced at the boundaries by 3 hourly energy spectra produced by the homere reanalysis boudière et al 2013 at the open boundaries the atmospheric forcing for ww3 zonal and meridional components of the 10m wind are taken from the arome fields used to force mars3d 3 results the wave impact onto the ocean is analysed by contrasting results of the coupled mars3d ww3 run with those of the stand alone mars3d run the following paragraphs focus on the northern extension of the front around a longitudinal transect at 48 8 n as well as the two nearly homogeneous areas z1 and z2 located on each side of the ushant front see fig 1 where the water depth is 116 2 0 97 m and 98 2 2 m respectively 3 1 environmental conditions simulated fig 4 shows time series of the key variables describing the environmental conditions over the simulated period average conditions are plotted for the whole domain black curves as well as for two equal sized zones one on either side of the front z1 stratified red curve and z2 well mixed blue curve cf fig 1 as shown below the tidal signal of the current rather than the sea level is central to understand the impact of waves on the front throughout the paper particular attention will be drawn to the relative alignment between current and wave propagation directions therefore periods when waves propagate with against the tide roughly corresponding to flood ebb or northeastwards southwestwards flow are highlighted with coral blue shadings on the figures the mean winds grow gradually from 3 to 8 m s 1 between 1200 utc on 02 september and 1800 utc on 03 september before decreasing shortly until 2100 utc and increasing again up to 9 m s 1 at the end of the simulation fig 4c a similar pattern is observed in z1 and z2 though winds reach a maximum on 03 september of 9 6 m s 1 at 1300 utc in z1 and of 8 4 m s 1 at 1800 utc in z2 also unlike in z1 or when averaged over the whole domain winds in z2 do not increase again after 2100 utc on 03 september they blow to the north northeast throughout the majority of the simulation but for the first and last few hours when average directions display more variability fig 4d the tidal cycle as described by the sea level fig 4a current intensity fig 4e and direction fig 4f is semi diurnal three tidal cycles with a tidal range of about 6 m are resolved over the study period starting at low water the magnitude of the tidal current fig 4e varies between 0 4 and 0 8 m s 1 on average over the whole domain and z1 this range is intensified near the coast as shown by the temporal averages in z2 that vary between 0 2 and 1 2 m s 1 currents are the strongest around times of high and low water as is the case for progressive tidal waves from 2000 utc on 02 september the significant wave height increases from 1 m to 2 m fig 4b and its temporal evolution follows that of the wind fig 4c the main spectral wave peak corresponds to a swell system see wave periods in fig 4b waves propagate to the northeast fig 4h and are roughly aligned with the wind fig 4d the intensity of the stokes drift fig 4g increases as the wind and the waves grow the wave period is seen to decrease smoothly over time it does not appear to be influenced by the tide however the stokes drift presents two maxima 0 053 0 076 m s 1 and 0 073 0 1 m s 1 around 0200 and 1300 utc on 03 september respectively the stokes drift appears to be intensified during ebb flow when waves roughly oppose the tidal current blue shaded periods the significant wave height also displays local maxima around these times a decrease in the stokes drift and in the significant wave height is observed during the two last flood tides of the study period this aligns with the concept that a wave opposing current steepens decrease in mean wavelength increase in amplitude a wave opposing current compresses the wave field while a wave following current stretches thus flattens it ardhuin et al 2017 phillips 1984 as the stokes drift is proportional to the square of the steepness of the waves it increases 3 2 frontal displacement and the temperature equation the sea surface temperature sst front is well represented in both mars3d runs it is characterized by a strong sst gradient between 4 9 w and 5 1 w with warm sst 15 5 c stratified waters offshore and cold sst 14 c well mixed waters close to the coast fig 1a the mixed layer whose depth is computed based on a temperature criterion of 0 2 c absolute difference from surface is around 10 20 m deep on the stratified side and reaches the sea floor on the mixed side fig 1b note that computing the mixed layer depth based on a density criterion does not significantly alter the results looking at longitude time hovmöller diagrams of the sst along the transect at 48 8 n clearly shows the zonal displacement of the ushant front with the tidal flow fig 5b as expected it is seen to advance towards the shore with the flood and retreat offshore with the ebb flow in both the stand alone and coupled simulations as illustrated in fig 5b the zonal displacement at 48 8 n is not in phase with the mean sea level msl fig 5a but rather with the zonal surface current fig 5d showing how tidal advection drives the front s position a surface negative temperature anomaly of up to 1 5 c in the stratified side fig 5c is visible in the coupled run compared to the stand alone run this cooling is pronounced 1 c within 2 to 4 km west of the front location in the stand alone mars3d run between 0100 and 1800 utc on 03 september but extends over 10 kilometres further the differences in temperature and displacement intensify during the simulated period as the waves grow no clear link is observed between the intensity of the sst response and the tidal cycle a wave induced cooling can be expected due to wave surface breaking induced mixing eqs 15 16 which would only have visible impacts on the temperature on the stratified part however the analysis of the location of the maximum sst gradient along 48 8 n reveals that this cooling is associated with a westward displacement of the ushant front differences in the surface tracer advecting velocities between the coupled and stand alone runs are mostly negative around the position of the front fig 5e this indicates a reduction of the eastward advection and an increase of the westward advection on the mixed side of the front the differences are positive indicating an increased advection to the east in line with the stokes drift and regardless of tidal phase on the stratified side of the front changes in tracer advection are more variable with both positive and negative regions and periods without a clear relation to the tidal phase the mixed layer depth is seen to reach the sea bottom within a few kilometres west of the sst front as detected in the uncoupled run further hinting at the westward displacement of the front due to waves fig 5f a deepening of the mixed layer of 5 10 m is also seen throughout the stratified side outside of the frontal region it intensifies over time and with proximity to the front the location of the sst front is obtained based on the maximum values of the sst gradient or mixed layer depth mld obtained by a sobel filter pringle 1969 its temporal evolution at 48 8 n is shown in fig 6a both types of estimation are consistent between them the one based on the mld gives a more regular forehead position that clearly follows the tidal flows the sst based one appears noisier when wave current interactions coupled run are modelled the position deduced from the sst gradient is up to 4 km further west than in the stand alone run fig 6b tracking a specific isotherm such as 14 7 c gives comparable results not shown the offset of the position deduced from the maximum gradient of mld deduced from the coupled and stand alone runs reaches 3 5 km at the end of the simulation tracking the sst offset fig 6b although results are shown for a specific latitude the impact of waves is clearly visible all along the ushant front as illustrated in fig 7 the front has similar meanders in the stand alone panel a and coupled panel b runs mapping the difference in sst between the coupled and the stand alone run fig 7c clearly reveals cooling on the stratified side of the front some positive differences in sst are visible in the southern extension of the front where meanders are stronger particularly near the ushant island presence of the island and shallow bathymetry there complicates the dynamics and wave interactions positive salinity and density anomalies accompany the negative surface temperature anomaly on the west side of the front fig 8 the anomalies extend to the mld on the stratified side of the front without any clear variation of magnitude with depth up to 5 m beneath the mld of the stand alone run the anomalies are of opposite sign as can be expected from enhanced mixing this is accompanied with a deepening of the mld of 2 3 m no significant differences in temperature and salinity hence neither in density are found at depth between the run with or without waves a full depth version of fig 8 can be found in supplementary materials cf s1 this suggests that only the surface front is impacted by waves under the forcing considered here the waves impact on the tracer fields is however clearly seen several metres below the mixed layer three physical processes could explain the sst cooling and the westward shift of the sst front in the coupled mars3d ww3 compared to the stand alone mars3d run 1 horizontal advection of sst gradient to the west replacing warm stratified waters by cold waters from the mixed side of the front 2 increase of the vertical mixing through additional injection of tke in ocean due to the presence of waves 3 changes in vertical entrainment at the mld bottom bringing cold water up due to wave induced changes in mean vertical velocities changes of vertical entrainment as computed from the vertical velocity using the continuity equation are not significant the leading order processes driving the temperature evolution are advection and vertical diffusion contrasting the budget of the temperature equation of the coupled and stand alone runs eqs 3 and 11 respectively allows to determine which of these two processes changes more in response to wave coupling fig 9 shows hovmöller plots at 48 8 n of the different terms of the temperature equation for the stand alone mars3d run panels a and b and the difference between the coupled wave ocean and the stand alone mars3d runs panels c to e the temporal trend term of the stand alone run is not shown because it is very close to the total advection term as expected in a tidally dominated environment note also that budget terms are hourly averaged rather than instantaneous as in previous figures the semi diurnal tidal signal is clearly visible in the total advection fig 9a but not in the vertical diffusion term fig 9b which is negative on the well mixed side of the front and positive on the stratified side the plots of differences reveal that the changes in the advective terms fig 9d are larger around the front than the changes in the vertical diffusion fig 9e indeed the difference in the temperature trend fig 9c follows that of the total advection revealing cooling near the front particularly during flood tide fig 9e does however clearly show an increase in vertical diffusion on the warm side of the front at times 3 3 current and k ε equations to further explore the dynamics and energetics responsible for the wave induced changes described above current and k ε equation budgets computed from the coupled and stand alone runs are compared fig 10a b d and e show vertical profiles of the horizontal components of the eulerian and quasi eulerian velocities averaged in z1 red and z2 blue for two instants one when waves and currents are opposed 1200 utc on 03 september top row and one when they follow each other 1800 utc on 03 september bottom row the general behaviour on both the stratified z1 and mixed z2 sides of the front is similar currents opposing following to wave propagation are found to increase decrease the vertical profiles all clearly feature a near surface gradient although the mean flow is driven largely by barotropic tides the impact of waves on currents is clearly enhanced near surface but reaches below the mld which is around 15 3 m and 15 8 m at 1200 utc and 13 8 m and 14 1 m at 1800 utc in z1 in the stand alone and coupled run respectively the vertical eddy viscosities fig 10c and f are seen to increase within the top 10 15 m of the water column in both cases on either side of the front the increased mixing leading to reduced vertical gradients can explain the increased decreased quasi eulerian velocities in condition of wave opposing following currents a positive vertical gradient shear likely due to ekman dynamics exists at all times in both the zonal and meridional velocity components the resulting down gradient turbulent diffusion leads to an increase in magnitude of the upper ocean velocity when negative and a decrease in the magnitude when positive the impact of waves on the magnitude of the near surface tidal current is further analysed through time series of differences between the magnitude of the quasi eulerian current in the coupled run and that of the eulerian current in the stand alone run fig 11a the differences of the current magnitudes averaged over z1 reach 0 080 0 007 m s 1 during the ebb flow on 03 september at 1200 utc and 0 073 0 010 m s 1 during the rising tide at 1800 utc on 03 september this equates to changes in the quasi eulerian surface current magnitude of up to 17 5 relative to the eulerian current magnitude of the stand alone run in z1 changes on the mixed side of the front z2 are relatively smaller amounting to 11 and 16 7 the differences in the zonal meridional quasi eulerian current components see supplementary materials s2 and s3 are for the most part negative indicating that east north ward flows are reduced and west south ward flows are enhanced note that the magnitude of the differences in quasi eulerian currents is for the most part smaller than the magnitude of the stokes drift see fig 4g indeed comparing the lagrangian velocity of the coupled run to the eulerian velocity of the stand alone run suggests the stokes drift tends to compensate the changes in quasi eulerian currents it increases decreases the wave following opposing currents by 3 outside of the frontal region accounting for the positive δ u l on the well mixed side in fig 5e however as shown in fig 5e this is not the case in close proximity of the temperature front where the lagrangian velocity in the coupled run is smaller than the eulerian velocity of the stand alone run during flood tides and larger during ebb flow the analysis of the current equation budget allows to evaluate the main physical balances at play given the budget of zonal and meridional currents it is easy to derive that of the current magnitude the evolution of the horizontal current follows from eqs 1 and 8 17 u 2 v 2 t 1 u 2 v 2 u u t v v t note that doing so eliminates the quasi eulerian coriolis terms meaning that the temporal evolution of the current magnitude follows the pressure gradient term at first order fig 11b plotting the terms of the equations for the zonal and meridional components see supplementary material s2 and s3 rather than the module clearly shows that the main evolution of the currents is driven from a balance between the pressure gradient and the coriolis force i e tides fig 11b shows the time series of the domain averaged terms contributing to the evolution of current magnitude starting around 2000 utc on 02 september a separation is visible between the terms of the stand alone solid curves and the coupled dashed curves mars3d outputs in both the temporal trend black curves the pressure terms purple curves and the vertical diffusion term light blue curves note that the addition of the wave induced pressure j does not significantly alter the pressure gradient terms the observed offset between the solid and dashed purple curves reflects differences between the eulerian current of the stand alone run and the quasi eulerian current of the coupled run when looking at the zonal and meridional components supplementary material s2 and s3 the change in quasi eulerian currents is reflected in the quasi eulerian coriolis terms i f u time series of the difference between the coupled and the stand alone mars3d fields fig 11c clearly show that as the waves start to grow the stokes coriolis term grows the difference in trend of the quasi eulerian velocity in the coupled run and the eulerian velocity in the stand alone run arises from changes in the vertical diffusion term and the coriolis terms which evolve in opposite phase the balance described above was verified to hold in average not only over the whole domain but also in z1 and z2 changes in the vertical diffusion term arise from changes in the surface stress the vertical shear and the eddy viscosity see eqs 1 and 8 the surface stress acting upon the ocean eq 10 vs eq 2 is reduced when waves and currents are aligned but enhanced when opposed with changes of the order of 10 relative to τ a the near surface shear is reduced regardless of wave current alignment the near surface eddy viscosity is enhanced on average by a factor of o 10 in the coupled run compared to the stand alone run due to changes in the k ε equations eqs 12 16 vs eqs 4 7 as discussed in section 2 2 the surface boundary conditions are modified when wave effects as derived from ww3 model are taken into account consequently the near surface tke fig 12a and the dissipation ε not shown are seen to increase as the waves grow displaying two maxima similar to the stokes drift magnitude and h s as variations of the tke dissipation rate largely reflect those of tke more insights may be gained by looking at the evolution of the dissipation length scale l derived via the taylor 1935 scaling 18 l c l k 3 2 ε where the proportionality constant c l c μ 0 3 4 0 146 is derived from the stability function c μ for d 0 and p ε see burchard 2002 while the near surface l in the stand alone run is nearly constant and equal to 0 24 0 031 m it increases from 0 23 to 0 48 m when averaged over the whole domain in the coupled run fig 12b mimicking the evolution of the h s and the stokes drift note that l in the stand alone run is directly proportional to z 0 which was set to 0 4 m this is equivalent to conditions with h s equal to 0 67 m z 0 0 6 h s following the scaling law proposed by terray et al 1996 with the proportionality coefficient of soloviev and lukas 2003 which roughly corresponds to the wave heights at the beginning of the coupled simulation note that other scalings of z 0 as a function of h s can be found in the literature rascle et al 2006 particularly z 0 1 6 h s terray et al 2000 which unlike the scaling proposed by soloviev and lukas 2003 includes the contribution of swell taking z 0 1 6 h s increases mixing in the coupled run leading to an unrealistically flat temperature front at the end of the 2 5 days simulation it does however have no substantial impact on the stand alone run as z 0 appears in the denominator of the surface boundary condition for ε eq 16 increasing it leads to a reduction in ε and thus an increase in k and l this in turn further increases the diffusivities leading to a further deepening of the mixed layer and cooling of the surface the leading order terms of the near surface tke budget in both the stand alone and coupled runs are the vertical diffusion and the tke dissipation rate fig 13b these are substantially enhanced in the coupled run the vertical diffusion term displays a clear tidal variation in the stand alone run not shown varying with current magnitude being minimum maximum an hour before the current maximum minimum the tidal signature in the vertical diffusion term is no longer visible in the coupled run rather like the tke dissipation rate it increases as the waves growth and the two periods of enhancement are clearly seen in the domain mean time series the shear production term is seen to be dampened by waves in the near surface k equation fig 13a as expected from the increased mixing 3 4 analysis of partially coupled runs in order to better identify the different processes at play a series of partially coupled model experiments were run four partially coupled runs are considered in this section a run in which all stokes drift related processes are included in the current and tracer equations stokesallonly a run where only the stokes advection terms are included in the tracer equations stokesadvonly a run where only the stokes coriolis terms are included in the current equations stokescoronly and a run where waves are only taken into account in the turbulence closure model waveturbonly for the first three partially coupled runs the turbulence equations and surface boundary conditions remain unchanged i e there is no increase in k u or k c and the vertical diffusion terms are the same as in the stand alone mars3d run in all the above mentioned runs the vertical boundary condition of the current equations is that of the stand alone run i e the impact of the waves on the surface stress is ignored partially coupled runs where only the stress was changed not shown revealed that it does not alter the front position significantly fig 14b shows the cross front sst at 48 8 n for the partially coupled runs as well as the stand alone and the fully coupled runs the sst curves are centred on the position of the 14 7 c isotherm in the stand alone run this snapshot illustrates the relative frontal displacement between the runs once the wave impact is visible as expected including only the stokes advection terms stokesadvonly leads to an eastward shift of the front in the direction of the wave propagation only including the stokes coriolis terms stokescoronly can have the opposite effect displacing the front westwards as shown for the considered instant the front remains however to the east of that in the fully coupled run as mentioned in the previous section the stokes vortex force has minimal impact the run stokesallonly shows the combined effect of the stokes coriolis force on the current and of the stokes advection on tracers it leads to a slight eastward displacement of the front relative to the stand alone position the stokes coriolis force can act to increase the eastward displacement along with the stokes drift depending on the relative alignment between the currents and wave propagation these partially coupled experiments suggest that the wave induced mixing is largely responsible for the frontal displacement indeed the frontal position of the waveturbonly run follows that of the fully coupled run very closely and is at times even further to the west than in the fully coupled run although results in section 3 1 suggest that for temperature wave induced changes in mixing are less important than wave induced changes in advection this is not the case for currents thus it is the impact of wave mixing on currents rather than on temperature that is the key process explaining the main difference between stand alone and coupled runs vertical profiles of the quasi eulerian and lagrangian velocities along the front fig 14 clearly show strong baroclinicity on the stratified side of the front profiles of the zonal and meridional current components display a positive vertical gradient which is more pronounced on the stratified side of the front thus when the flow is positive negative north eastwards south westwards the flow is stronger weaker on the stratified side of the front than on the mixed side consequentially once the front is displaced westwards due to mixing the surface velocities within several kilometres of the front as identified by the 14 7 c isotherm are homogenized their intensities have increased when negative and decreased when positive this shift of regime induced by wave mixing within the frontal area has a greater impact than the changes related to the stokes drift 4 discussion the realistic model simulations described above reveal the role of gravity waves in modifying the position of a surface thermal tidal front waves propagating shore ward roughly perpendicularly to the front result in a displacement of the front in the opposite direction of the wave propagation and stokes drift this is due to an increase decrease of the quasi eulerian currents when waves oppose follow them which is more important than the stokes drift around the front the following paragraphs draw parallels between these results and previous work before exposing avenues for future development and discussing broader implications 4 1 comparison to laboratory experiments the simulated quasi eulerian current response to waves is in line with early laboratory measurements bakker and van doorn 1978 kemp and simons 1982 1983 klopman 1994 1993 umeyama 2005 full depth eulerian mean current records show an increase reduction in surface currents when opposed following to waves compared to the classic logarithmic law of the wall current profiles without waves these flume experiments were geared mainly towards analysing how waves alter currents in the bottom boundary for different bed roughness nevertheless they show systematic changes in the surface currents they are regularly considered as the truth for wave current interaction model developments although being based on paddle generated non breaking wave trains which do not have the three dimensionality and spectral spread comparable to real wave fields it had been argued that the observed wave impact was due to the presence of lateral boundaries which induce langmuir circulations dingemans et al 1996 however transverse circulations due to sidewalls were shown to only weakly impact velocity profiles groeneweg and battjes 2003 the mean velocity shear was also observed to be altered by waves in the aforementioned laboratory records it increased when waves propagated against the current and decreased or even changed sign when waves and currents propagated in the same direction turbulent intensity measurements from umeyama 2005 suggest that changes in shear were due to the wave current reynolds stresses which arise from the phase averaged correlation between the horizontal and vertical particle motion the sign of the wave current reynolds stress always opposes that of wave propagation thus for wave following opposing the current it is of the opposite same sign to the current shear leading to a reduced enhanced shear wave current reynolds stresses are not directly included as it stands the coupled framework presented here leads to a reduction of the vertical velocity shear in the surface layer due to the increased wave mixing regardless of the relative alignment between currents and waves yet the expected enhancement of the quasi eulerian current is reproduced during wave opposing periods this is only because mixing homogenizes the positive background surface current gradient which exists regardless of waves under the simulated wind conditions 4 2 comparison to wave current models and boundary layer theories several analytical 1d wave current models and boundary layer theories have been proposed to reproduce the quasi eulerian current response observed in the laboratory experiments detailed above relying on either the surface distortion of the depth dependent eddy viscosities huang and mei 2003 parameterization of wave induced second order stresses you 1996 or a mixing length hypothesis yang et al 2006 they are capable of roughly replicating measured vertical velocity profiles more recently olabarrieta et al 2010 proposed a 3d non hydrostatic eulerian wave current model using a one equation eddy viscosity turbulence closure able to mimic the current response to waves from the laboratory experiments they used it to study different wave current alignments for shallow to deep water waves teles et al 2013 used 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes to evaluate how well three turbulent closure schemes could reproduce the conditions measured in laboratory by umeyama 2005 and klopman 1994 they concluded that the two first order models k ε and k w which rely on the eddy viscosity hypothesis do not reproduce laboratory results as well as the reynolds stress transport model rsm teles et al 2013 however imposed a surface boundary condition to their first order models which forces the eddy viscosity to decrease towards the surface this is contrary to what is imposed in the realistic simulations presented here where wave coupling leads to a surface enhancement of the eddy viscosity due to the input of wave induced tke a fundamental discrepancy between the current work and the laboratory experiments the theoretical work and numerical studies discussed so far is in the relative magnitude of the currents and stokes drift while in the present study the tidal currents are much faster than the waves they are of the same order of magnitude in the aforementioned studies furthermore the current work focuses on deep water waves by contrast the laboratory experiments which the previous studies aim to reproduce featured intermediate depth waves with a ratio of wave height over depth of 0 24 and 0 1 respectively for klopman 1994 and umeyama 2005 consequently only limited comparisons to previous laboratory and analytical works are possible numerical development may be necessary to improve the dynamics and kinematics of surface wave current interactions but dedicated in situ surface current and turbulence profile measurements are also needed for validation 4 3 comparison to regional coupled modelling studies previous realistic coupled modelling studies which do not include an rsm reported no substantial impact of waves on currents closer inspection of published figures however reveals a wave induced change in currents of about 10 in two of them which is of the same order as those reported herein these studies were conducted under much stronger wind conditions and weaker currents than those simulated here one during wind jet events with wind induced currents ràfols et al 2019 the other in a tidal estuary osuna and wolf 2005 using the coawst modelling system for the north ebro shelf ràfols et al 2019 showed that the main impact of waves was on the water column stratification as waves inject turbulent kinetic energy and enhance surface stress thus deepening the mixed layer their results indicate differences in surface currents of up to 20 cm s 1 for currents ranging between 20 to less than 80 cm s 1 under winds from 10 to 20 m s 1 osuna and wolf 2005 reported a daily mean differences of up to 10 cm s 1 during a strong west southwesterly wave event under winds of 15 20 m s 1 in the shallow coastal areas with depth around 50 m of the eastern irish sea where the current magnitude is around 1 m s 1 this is based on output from the coupled proudman oceanographic laboratory coastal ocean modelling system prowam framework it is not possible to determine from the article how the observed enhancement relates to the relative alignment between the tidal currents and the waves the wave related processes found to be important in the iroise sea numerical experiments presented here are the stokes coriolis force which along with changes in vertical diffusion due to wave injection of tke and surface stress alter surface currents in the irish sea estuary only the wave induced surface stress was reported to be key osuna and wolf 2005 analysis of the cross shelf momentum equation in the ebro simulations revealed a main balance between the pressure gradient and the coriolis term before wind events although with wind speeds of 10 m s 1 with all other terms being an order of magnitude smaller ràfols et al 2019 during wind jet events in the ebro region the vortex force pressure gradient surface stress and horizontal advection were found to be of the same order 4 km offshore where the water is about 50 m deep further offshore up to tens of kilometres the vortex force and surface stress were shown to mostly balance the pressure gradient in the macro tidal regime simulated in the iroise sea the wave effect on the horizontal advection and pressure gradient are negligible and under low wind conditions the vortex force is found to be secondary to other wave processes its role in altering the currents and front position under stronger winds has yet to be investigated 4 4 comparison to remotely sensed measurements the partially coupled simulations reveal that advecting the temperature with the lagrangian velocity without allowing feedback of wave mixing and the stokes coriolis force leads to an eastward bias of the frontal position the erosion of the temperature front associated with the wave mixing is also shown to be key and explains the westward shift of the front joint analysis of hourly satellite derived sst and hf radar derived currents at 48 75 n suggested that the ushant front is not advected by the stokes drift chevallier et al 2014 estimating the front position from advection based on hf radar derived currents during a period of moderate easterly winds 5 10 m s 1 led to a westward bias of tens of kilometres after a couple of days a closer to real estimate of the temporal evolution of the front position by advection was only possible after removal of the stokes bias ardhuin et al 2009 from the current measurements a small westward bias is still visible after the stokes drift correction which may hint the fact that it does not take into account the impact of surface gravity waves on the quasi eulerian currents the present study suggests that for a more complete correction of the stokes drift effect in hf radar measurements the knowledge of the vertical gradients of the horizontal velocity is necessary as well as an estimate of the wave induced mixing while the finding of chevallier et al 2014 may suggest that the surface temperature should be advected by the quasi eulerian velocity only the authors ignore the impact of local tidally induced adiabatic mixing which maintains the frontal dynamics as the tidal residual current in the region is to the north east pure advection would lead to an eastward drift of the front which overtime would end up on the coast this is clearly not observed the hf radar measurements give the currents within the top tens of centimetres of the water column while the surface frontal signature results from the dynamics of the top tens of metres advecting the front by lagrangian hf radar observations thus overestimates the relative importance of the stokes drift compared to other wave impacts mixing and leads to a front displacement disconnected from mixed layer dynamics 4 5 limitations and avenues to improve the coupled framework the impacts of tke production by stokes drift and langmuir turbulence were not included in the present study nor the previously mentioned coastal coupled modelling efforts as the current horizontal resolution is too coarse to resolve langmuir circulations 100 m 1 km a parameterization would need to be included in the energy equations to take them into account several approaches can be envisioned based on previous studies e g kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2013 langmuir turbulence has the potential to impact the water column deeper than wave breaking thus including it could lead to erosion of the temperature stratification on the offshore side of the front further contribution to a offshore shift in its location another avenue for improving the current framework is to lift the hydrostatic constraint or to include the effects of the stokes shear force on the pressure term see suzuki and fox kemper 2016 a higher vertical resolution would also be needed to properly resolve the stokes shear as it stands using the breivik et al 2014 parameterization for the vertical stokes drift profiles the surface stokes shear is underestimated in the current framework the surface current fed to the wave model is that of the top vertical mode in situations of strong surface current shear it may be more appropriate to consider a vertically integrated current suzuki 2019 the integration depth considered could further be wavelength dependent this however would add considerable computations improving this parameterization increasing the resolution and applying the quasi hydrostatic approach suzuki and fox kemper 2016 would increase the impact of the stokes vortex force many uncertainties still surround the other parameterizations on which the framework relies these include the source functions of the wave model which are used to derive the surface stress felt by the ocean τ s u r f and wave to ocean energy flux φ o c as well as the boundary conditions of the turbulence closure scheme 4 6 broader implications the frontal displacement reaches up to 4 km within 1 5 days as waves propagating into the region grow under steady wave forcing one can expect the front to shift until a new equilibrium is reached and wave breaking induced mixing has eroded the surface velocity and temperature gradients frontal displacements can be observed repeatedly over periods of a couple of days in a 14 day run with realistic forcing note that for the conditions simulated in the present study low wind and tidal dominated dynamics the two way coupling between ocean and waves does not give significantly different results than when forcing the ocean by wave model fields as long as tidal currents were used to produce the wave fields this was tested by running the coupled framework allowing only wave fields from a stand alone ww3 run to be sent to the ocean model hourly indeed in the studied situation the described changes in the quasi eulerian currents are too small to significantly alter the properties of the swell thus in this particular case coupling is not necessary for either the wave or the ocean components this may however not be the case in non tidally dominated environments where currents are weaker or under stronger winds or under short fetches as wind seas are more sensitive to currents 5 conclusions the current study shows how surface gravity waves alter the location of a surface tidal temperature front in accordance to previous theoretical and laboratory works the coupled modelling framework reproduces a reduction increase of the surface quasi eulerian currents when they follow oppose waves in a situation of mainly eastward propagating waves as in the present case study the front is advected westwards by up to 4 km due to a reduction in the flooding tide and an increase in the ebb flow this counter intuitive impact opposes and over compensates the advection effect of stokes drift around the front note that the situation studied here is not strongly forced by winds and tidal currents are much stronger than the wave induced drift yet the impact of waves is clearly detectable the processes at play are summarized in the diagram in fig 15 here horizontal ocean and wave variability on either side of the front are neglected as the resolution is not yet sufficient to properly reproduce them in the current coupled framework the main wave dynamics behind the changes in currents are the vertical mixing and the stokes coriolis force which leads to a transport that opposes the stokes drift including wave physics is seen to increase the vertical mixing at the sea surface due to the tke injection related to wave breaking this increase in vertical mixing results in a reduction of the surface vertical gradient of the current which is positive for both flood and ebb tides leading to the observed changes in quasi eulerian currents within the studied environmental setting strong tidal currents moderate waves and winds it appears that only forcing the turbulence closure with a surface wave breaking energy flux is sufficient to reproduce the wave impact produced by the fully coupled framework in environments which are much more sensitive to the local wind conditions such as upwelling systems or under extreme conditions feedback between the ocean and the waves will have to be taken into account before a definite conclusion can be reached on which coupling aspects are necessary for operational use in coastal seas the coupled model framework will have to be improved further both the horizontal and vertical resolutions need to be increased and further development is needed to improve the representation of the stokes shear and stokes vortex force and include langmuir turbulence nevertheless the present study highlights the importance of taking wave current interactions into account even in environments where the background flow is an order of magnitude stronger than the stokes drift thus waves should be considered in dispersion studies even in tidally forced coastal seas the enhanced surface mixing resulting of injection of tke from wave breaking can significantly vertically homogenize surface tidal currents even under moderate winds in altering the surface advection waves can lead to displacements of fronts valid in a tidally forced environment the processes described herein are likely more important where surface currents are weaker susceptible to influence the position of any surface temperature front wave current interactions could be important in dictating the offshore extent of upwelling systems the coupled model framework exploited herein would allow studying coupling dynamics and energetics in a wide variety of coastal settings through analysis not only of state variables but also of the terms of the temperature current and energy equations

23944,a set of realistic coastal coupled ocean wave numerical simulations is used to study the impact of surface gravity waves on a tidal temperature front and surface currents the processes at play are elucidated through analyses of the budgets of the horizontal momentum the temperature and the turbulence closure equations the numerical system consists of a 3d coastal hydrodynamic circulation model model for applications at regional scale mars3d and the third generation wave model wavewatch iii ww3 coupled with oasis mct at horizontal resolutions of 500 and 1500 m respectively the models were run for a period of low to moderate southwesterly winds as observed during the front de marée variable fromvar field campaign in the iroise sea where a seasonal small scale tidal sea surface temperature front is present over the 2 day period considered long fetch waves grow gradually propagating north east and east contrasting a stand alone ocean run with a coupled ocean wave run shows that waves move the ushant front offshore by up to 4 kilometres and cool the offshore stratified side of the front by up to 1 5 c the analysis of the temperature budget shows that the change in advection is the dominant factor contributing to the frontal shift while the contribution of wave enhanced vertical temperature diffusion is secondary temperature considered to be a tracer is advected in the coupled run by the lagrangian current resulting from the quasi eulerian and stokes drift although the stokes drift is directed shorewards changes in the quasi eulerian current lead to a more offshore advection in the coupled than the stand alone run the quasi eulerian current is reduced enhanced during the ebb flood flow which correspond to periods of wave following opposing currents this is due to wave breaking enhanced vertical mixing acting on the positive vertical gradient present in the quasi eulerian current during both ebb and flood tides partially coupled runs reveal that it is the surface flux of tke associated to wave breaking that is key rather than the changes in the surface stress they further elucidate the role of other modelled wave related processes although the contribution of the stokes coriolis force and the wave breaking induced enhancement in vertical mixing to the quasi eulerian current are of similar magnitude and sign it does not contribute significantly to the frontal shift this is because it partially counters the stokes drift advection which pushes the front shorewards all stokes drift related processes combined thus only lead to a very slight displacement of the front keywords ocean wave coupling coastal coupled modelling current wave interactions tidal front iroise sea 1 introduction in recent years much effort has been dedicated to understanding and quantifying the impacts of surface gravity waves on upper ocean currents and mixing as these can have significant physical and bio geochemical consequences see sullivan and mcwilliams 2010 cavaleri et al 2012 villas boâs et al 2019 and references therein the impacts in coastal seas are particularly relevant to a wide range of scientific questions and applications cavaleri et al 2018 modelling wave current interactions in coastal environments presents many challenges since they are governed by the interplay of multiple phenomena spanning a wide range of spatio temporal scales waves alter the momentum and energy input to the upper ocean they take up a portion of the wind input as they grow and release some to the ocean as they break they generate a mean lagrangian current in the direction of wave propagation known as the stokes drift on the rotating earth the stokes drift is affected by the coriolis force inducing a current perpendicular to wave propagation and a transport that compensates the stokes drift over an inertial period hasselmann 1970 xu and bowen 1994 interaction between the stokes drift velocity and the mean flow vorticity results in the stokes vortex force craik and leibovich 1976 lane et al 2007 the persistent vertical shear of the stokes drift tilts the vertical component of the vorticity that is perpendicular to the wind into the wind direction this promotes the generation of rolls aligned with the wind known as langmuir circulations langmuir 1938 a thorough overview of the effects of the stokes drift on currents can be found in suzuki and fox kemper 2016 wave breaking langmuir circulations stokes drift interaction with the coriolis force and stirring by non breaking waves all contribute to upper ocean mixing and turbulence wu et al 2015 as shown from measurements of the dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy agrawal et al 1992 terray et al 1996 a common and highly predictable feature of coastal oceans are tidal fronts these surface temperature fronts separate cold shallow waters nearshore where tidal friction produces enough turbulence to constantly mix the entire water column and warm waters offshore over depths where tidal mixing is not sufficient to erode the seasonal thermocline they appear in the spring and erode at the end of autumn such fronts present convergence zones associated with wave steepening and breaking baschek et al 2006 how in turn waves alter ocean currents temperatures and mixing around tidal fronts has not been studied in great detail because wave forcing is secondary to tidal forcing the wave adjustment of geostrophic fronts was studied by mcwilliams and fox kemper 2013 and suzuki et al 2016 showed the importance of the stokes shear in frontogenesis as they found it to energize the ageostrophic secondary circulations in these studies the stokes drift is of the same order of magnitude as the frontal circulation and both are of the order or larger than the background flow this is not the case around tidal fronts where the background tidal flow can be an order of magnitude larger than the frontal circulation and the stokes drift the setup of tidal fronts depends on the competing stratifying effect of solar radiation and tide driven mixing their location is largely determined by the magnitude of the tidal current and the water depth simpson 1981 however wave driven currents and mixing could alter the frontal position as this paper aims to elucidate distinguishing wave effects in current measurements is not a straightforward exercise polton et al 2005 rascle and ardhuin 2009 ardhuin et al 2009 and often does not allow for much more than qualitative inferences laboratory experiments kemp and simons 1982 1983 klopman 1993 1994 provided insights on how surface waves alter currents the dynamics they imply have yet to be verified in the field which may be in a different parameter regime their existence in the real or modelled ocean needs to be assessed theoretical frameworks provide insights into key physical processes but the high complexity of the system does not allow to go much beyond asymptotic behaviour mcwilliams et al 2004 and specific equilibria mcwilliams and fox kemper 2013 song 2009 numerical methods allow to better understand the processes at play however asymptotic approaches and parameterizations remain necessary in models one dimensional vertical models have been used to study wave modification to the ekman current trying to reproduce in situ current shear measurements rascle et al 2006 rascle and ardhuin 2009 large eddy simulations polton et al 2005 mcwilliams and fox kemper 2013 sullivan et al 2007 suzuki et al 2016 and direct numerical simulations sullivan et al 2004 remain idealistic and only represent a subset of wave related processes to investigate the multitude and complexity of processes at play in the coastal oceans realistic fully coupled ocean wave simulations are needed in coupled modelling the inclusion of wave processes heavily relies on parameterizations also the representation of wave current interactions is simpler than in the above mentioned theoretical work they are however largely based on assumptions supported by those idealized approaches and coupled simulations can provide a broader view of the processes at play to date several coupled model frameworks have been developed and exploited to study the impact of waves on currents in coastal seas osuna and wolf 2005 bolaños et al 2014 ràfols et al 2019 while bolaños et al 2014 concluded that waves do not significantly alter the tidally dominated component of the current but improved the transverse current component osuna and wolf 2005 showed large effects of waves on currents especially where the currents are strong and sheared ràfols et al 2019 reported no substantial differences in the water current field between coupled and uncoupled simulations it is important to note here that to date the majority of studies be it theoretical numerical or experimental have focused on cases where the stokes drift is comparable or stronger than the background flow filling this gap a new set of coupled model experiments were undertaken focusing on the iroise sea which provides an excellent natural laboratory to study interactions between the waves the ocean and the atmosphere in strongly tidally forced conditions located in the north atlantic off the coast of brittany france the iroise sea is subject to long fetch waves and features an intense seasonal surface thermal front the ushant tidal front fig 1 it is characterized by a strong surface temperature gradient separating the homogeneous waters of moderate temperatures 14 c close to the coast and the warm surface 16 c stratified waters offshore a second temperature front exists at the bottom separating the waters of the cold tongue which covers the continental shelf and the homogeneous waters close to the coast le boyer et al 2009 noted that the two fronts are governed by different dynamics meaning that the two fronts are not always co located the position of the surface front varies with the tidal current it is pushed towards the coast during the flood tide and towards the open sea by the ebb tide this paper provides a detailed study of the wave ocean coupling in the iroise sea with a focus on the impacts on the currents and surface temperatures around the ushant front based on a set of realistic forced and coupled coastal model runs these are described in section 2 along with an outline of the coupling framework key results are presented in section 3 and discussed in section 4 the conclusion section summarizes the results and processes at play finally it highlights the interest of the proposed model and analysis framework 2 model experiments in this section the equations at the heart of the stand alone ocean model are presented first followed by those used in the coupled configuration relevant aspects of the coupling between the ocean and the wave models are detailed exposing how wave related processes are taken into account these include stokes drift advection of tracers stokes coriolis and stokes vortex forces on the horizontal currents wave altered surface stress wave breaking induced turbulence and wave orbital velocity driven bottom stress configurations used for the ocean and wave models are then summarized along with the description of the simulations setup the equations of the wave model with currents are not recalled herein as the focus of the paper is on the ocean response to waves these can be found in ardhuin et al 2017 2 1 uncoupled ocean model the ocean model used in this study is the 3d coastal hydrodynamic circulation model mars3d model for applications at regional scale lazure and dumas 2008 and lazure et al 2009 mars3d resolves the primitive equations for an in compressible hydrostatic fluid under the boussinesq hypothesis the temporal evolution of a horizontal current u u i v in x x i y is modelled as 1 u t l u i f u z k u u z d d x k x d u d x 1 ρ 0 d p i d x g d ζ d x 1 ρ 0 d p a d x with the operator l u x v y w z and the complex derivative d d x x i y l u represents the non linear advection terms g the acceleration due to gravity ρ 0 1027 34 kg m 3 the reference water density f the coriolis parameter k u the vertical eddy viscosity and k x the horizontal ones ζ the sea surface height and p a and p i the surface atmospheric and internal pressures respectively since the model assumes the ocean to be hydrostatic p i is derived from p z ρ 0 b with the buoyancy given by b g ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 and ρ the water density the vertical velocity follows from continuity the surface boundary conditions are given by the zonal and meridional wind stress τ a computed from the 10 m wind u 10 forcing using 2 τ a ρ a c d u 10 2 where c d is the drag coefficient based on charnock 1955 and ρ a the surface air density the evolution of a tracer c is given by the advection diffusion equation 3 c t x u c y v c z w c z k c c z f where k c is the vertical diffusivity the horizontal ones are set to 0 the source term f consists of the solar irradiance and long wave radiation for temperature the salinity evolves with water fluxes induced by precipitation minus evaporation as well as river outflows the surface boundary condition for temperature diffusion is the latent and sensible turbulent fluxes the eddy viscosity k u c μ k 2 ε and vertical diffusivity for temperature k c c μ k 2 ε are obtained from the two equation k ε model burchard 1998 burchard and bolding 2001 which was chosen in this study for turbulence closure the canuto et al 2001 version a ca stability functions c μ and c μ based on the non dimensional shear and buoyancy numbers as described in umlauf and burchard 2005 are used to damp enhance turbulence in stably unstably stratified conditions the turbulent kinetic energy tke k is modelled as 4 k t l k z ν k k z p d ε where the shear p and the buoyancy d contributions are functions of the vertical shear and the brunt väisäla frequency respectively in the configuration used here the advection term l k is neglected the equation of the tke dissipation rate ε is given by 5 ε t ε k c ε 1 p c ε 3 d c ε 2 ε z ν ε ε z the empirical constants c ε i 1 44 1 92 0 63 or 1 are taken from

been coupled with the 3rd generation wave model wavewatchiii ww3 tolman 2014 through oasis mct voldoire et al 2017 as listed on the diagram fig 2 mars3d sends 3 fields to ww3 and receives 17 fields from ww3 the framework was developed in a way to minimize the parameterizations of wave dependent variables within the ocean model thus coupling as many fields directly computed from the source function of ww3 and the model wave spectra as possible rather than relying on say wave height dependent parameterizations the coupling between ww3 and mars3d occurs every 100 s the coupling module performs distance weighted nearest neighbour interpolations from one regular model grid to the other based on 4 points using the los alamos national laboratory scrip1 4 library jones 1999 the impact of waves on the ocean is modelled following the quasi eulerian framework ardhuin et al 2008 bennis et al 2011 based on wave averaged primitive equation limited to second order wave theory in the coupled ocean wave configuration eq 1 becomes 8 u ˆ t l ˆ u ˆ i f u ˆ z k u u ˆ z d d x k x d u ˆ d x 1 ρ 0 d p i d x g d ζ d x 1 ρ 0 d p a d x i f u s i v ˆ x u ˆ y u s u ˆ z w s j x where u ˆ is the quasi eulerian velocity defined as the difference between the lagrangian velocity u l and the horizontal stokes drift u s 9 u ˆ u l u s both u ˆ and u s satisfy continuity in eq 8 l ˆ u ˆ x v ˆ y w ˆ z and w s is the vertical component of the stokes drift new wave dependent terms appear on the right hand side terms of eq 8 the stokes coriolis force i f u s the stokes vortex force i u ˆ x u ˆ y u s u ˆ z w s and the wave induced bernoulli head pressure j smith 2006 in this configuration the model remains hydrostatic and the impact of the stokes shear on the pressure gradient see suzuki and fox kemper 2016 is not taken into account note that only surface stokes drift fields are sent by the wave model to the ocean model along with the stokes transport these are then used to approximate vertical stokes profiles based on breivik et al 2014 in addition to these modifications in current equations the boundary conditions are changed the surface stress felt by the ocean is no longer τ a but 10 τ surf τ a τ aw τ wo where τ aw corresponds to the amount of momentum used by wave formation and τ wo to the breaking wave induced stress transferred to the ocean these fields provided by ww3 are derived from the input and dissipation source functions tolman 2014 at the bottom boundary the stress due to the waves is added to the bottom friction it is computed from the bottom orbital velocities u bw and a wave friction factor following soulsby et al 1993 for the wave friction factor the parameterization of soulsby 1997 their eq 62a is used waves impact the advection of tracers which is done by the lagrangian velocity thus with waves eq 3 becomes 11 c t x u ˆ u s c y v ˆ v s c z w ˆ w s c z k c c z waves effects have also to be considered as impacting eddy viscosity and diffusion terms in eqs 8 and 11 this is achieved by modifying the surface boundary conditions of the turbulent closure equations and adding a new source terms within the bottom boundary layer the tke production term added to the right hand sides of eqs 4 and 5 is taken from walstra et al 2000 for k it stands as 12 p w b o t z 2 φ b b l δ 1 d ζ z δ for d ζ z δ where φ b b l is the wave energy dissipation due to bottom friction sent by ww3 to mars3d and d the topography the bottom wave boundary layer thickness δ is derived following grant and madsen 1982 their eqs 5 and 6 based on the wave friction factor these depend on the bottom orbital velocities u bw and the mean wave period t m 1 provided by ww3 thus eqs 4 and 5 become 13 k t l k z ν k k z p d ε p w b o t 14 ε t ε k c ε 1 p c ε 3 d c ε 2 ε z ν ε ε z ε k c ε 1 p w b o t for these two equations the neumann type boundary conditions taking the waves into account at the sea surface are given by 15 k z φ o c 16 ε z c μ 0 3 4 k 3 2 κ z z 0 2 c μ 0 3 4 3 2 σ k φ o c c μ κ 2 z z 0 2 with c μ 0 09 burchard 2001 and φ o c the wave to ocean energy flux provided by ww3 accounting for the injection of tke from breaking waves similarly to τ w o φ o c is derived from the parameterization chosen for the dissipation source function in ww3 note that φ o c replaces c w u 3 from the craig and banner 1994 model for the wave enhanced layer in the boundary conditions reported in burchard 2002 rather than considering the surface wave tke contribution as a flux it could be input as a vertically distributed at the scale of the heights of breaking waves production term similar to p w b o t given the very high mixing there is very little difference between these approaches rascle et al 2013 2 3 case study a realistic case study was devised to evaluate the impact of waves on the ushant tidal front under low to moderate winds given the relatively short period over which consistent wind and wave conditions prevail the simulations were run only for a couple of days this does not allow for a full tidal decomposition of the results however choosing a period in which waves propagate consistently in one direction allows straightforward contrasting of different wave tide alignments models mars3d ww3 were set up to best represent the conditions measured during the fromvar front de marée variable field campaign between the 02 and 04 september 2011 an anticyclonic circulation was present at the beginning of the campaign with very weak winds and calm seas with the arrival of an atmospheric front around 1700 utc on 02 september southwesterly winds gradually intensified to reach a local maximum of 14 m s 1 on 03 september around 1600 utc the coupled simulations were started on 02 september at 0600 utc but in the following analysis model outputs are only considered starting at 1200 utc allowing for adequate wave spin up from calm conditions 2 4 model configurations the models were run at high horizontal resolution 500 m for mars3d and 1500 m for ww3 over a domain spanning about 160 by 160 km2 fig 1 with hourly outputs the model configurations chosen are those used for operational purposes as part of the modelling and analysis for coastal research marc project https marc ifremer fr a stand alone mars3d run version v11 0 oaw01 was spun up starting january 2011 using a bay of biscay configuration with a horizontal resolution of 2 5 km similar to that used operationally for prévimer lazure et al 2009 precursor to the marc project a fine resolution zoom 500 m over the iroise sea was embedded into the regional grid and integrated through 2 way agrif nesting debreu et al 2008 this zoom provided the initial and lateral boundary conditions for the mars3d simulations used in the present study run from 0600 utc on 02 september 2011 to 0000 utc on 04 september 2011 the stand alone mars3d simulation analysed herein gives almost identical outputs to the zoom the chosen model configuration and forcing were shown to best reproduce the front choice of the turbulence scheme was motivated by previous model development bennis et al 2011 mars3d was forced with tidal components taken from the global finite element solution tide model fes2004 lyard et al 2006 and atmospheric forcing fields consistent with those used to force the bay of biscay run these atmospheric forcing fields come from the operational french forecast model arome with a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 0 025 2 5 km arome provides the following variables to mars3d 2 metre air temperature atmospheric pressure relative humidity 10 m zonal and meridional wind components and cloud cover heat fluxes are internally computed based on the nomads 2 parameterization for solar fluxes proposed by gill 1982 the edf parameterization for thermal fluxes described in dumas and langlois 2009 and coare 3 0 fairall et al 2003 for the turbulent fluxes mars3d operates on an arakawa c grid with topographically conformal vertical coordinate σ system the vertical resolution was set to 40 σ levels fig 3 shows the mean surface 0 30 m vertical resolution over a tidal cycle the top sigma level is about 15 cm below the sea surface each subsequent sigma level is about 30 cm deep over the top 2 4 m of the water column then gradually increase in thickness to be around 0 5 m at 5 m below the water line surface diagnostics of the current and temperature equations shown in the results section are from the top sigma level while near surface k ε diagnostics are from the top mid level the model automatically controls the timestep starting from a maximum timestep of 20 s and a critical courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition set to 0 6 the quick kowalik and murty 1993 numerical scheme is used for the advection of currents for tracer temperature and salinity a fifth order upwind scheme is used for horizontal advection and an upwind compact and conservative scheme is used for vertical advection debreu and duhaut 2011 these are employed in a three dimensional two step macho method leonard et al 1996 an implicit scheme is used for vertical diffusion of currents and tracers the forcing parameterizations and numerical schemes chosen correspond to those used in the bay of biscay configuration which combined with the agrif downscaling method allow for the best representation of the ushant front in ww3 adapted from v5 16 the spectral space was discretized using 32 frequencies ranging from 0 0373 to 0 7159 hz in 10 steps f i 1 1 1 f i where i is a discrete grid counter and f the frequency with 24 directions δ θ 15 the overall timestep was set to 100 s the spatial cfl without currents and spectral refraction propagation timesteps to 25 s and the integration of the source function to 10 s the physics package used is st3 which prescribes an f 5 spectral tail outside the model frequency range bidlot et al 2005 tolman et al 2014 this set of source function parameterizations was chosen for their ability to reproduce the variability in the drag coefficient for a review of the performances of the different physics packages available see stopa et al 2016 the model was started from calm conditions h s 0 and forced at the boundaries by 3 hourly energy spectra produced by the homere reanalysis boudière et al 2013 at the open boundaries the atmospheric forcing for ww3 zonal and meridional components of the 10m wind are taken from the arome fields used to force mars3d 3 results the wave impact onto the ocean is analysed by contrasting results of the coupled mars3d ww3 run with those of the stand alone mars3d run the following paragraphs focus on the northern extension of the front around a longitudinal transect at 48 8 n as well as the two nearly homogeneous areas z1 and z2 located on each side of the ushant front see fig 1 where the water depth is 116 2 0 97 m and 98 2 2 m respectively 3 1 environmental conditions simulated fig 4 shows time series of the key variables describing the environmental conditions over the simulated period average conditions are plotted for the whole domain black curves as well as for two equal sized zones one on either side of the front z1 stratified red curve and z2 well mixed blue curve cf fig 1 as shown below the tidal signal of the current rather than the sea level is central to understand the impact of waves on the front throughout the paper particular attention will be drawn to the relative alignment between current and wave propagation directions therefore periods when waves propagate with against the tide roughly corresponding to flood ebb or northeastwards southwestwards flow are highlighted with coral blue shadings on the figures the mean winds grow gradually from 3 to 8 m s 1 between 1200 utc on 02 september and 1800 utc on 03 september before decreasing shortly until 2100 utc and increasing again up to 9 m s 1 at the end of the simulation fig 4c a similar pattern is observed in z1 and z2 though winds reach a maximum on 03 september of 9 6 m s 1 at 1300 utc in z1 and of 8 4 m s 1 at 1800 utc in z2 also unlike in z1 or when averaged over the whole domain winds in z2 do not increase again after 2100 utc on 03 september they blow to the north northeast throughout the majority of the simulation but for the first and last few hours when average directions display more variability fig 4d the tidal cycle as described by the sea level fig 4a current intensity fig 4e and direction fig 4f is semi diurnal three tidal cycles with a tidal range of about 6 m are resolved over the study period starting at low water the magnitude of the tidal current fig 4e varies between 0 4 and 0 8 m s 1 on average over the whole domain and z1 this range is intensified near the coast as shown by the temporal averages in z2 that vary between 0 2 and 1 2 m s 1 currents are the strongest around times of high and low water as is the case for progressive tidal waves from 2000 utc on 02 september the significant wave height increases from 1 m to 2 m fig 4b and its temporal evolution follows that of the wind fig 4c the main spectral wave peak corresponds to a swell system see wave periods in fig 4b waves propagate to the northeast fig 4h and are roughly aligned with the wind fig 4d the intensity of the stokes drift fig 4g increases as the wind and the waves grow the wave period is seen to decrease smoothly over time it does not appear to be influenced by the tide however the stokes drift presents two maxima 0 053 0 076 m s 1 and 0 073 0 1 m s 1 around 0200 and 1300 utc on 03 september respectively the stokes drift appears to be intensified during ebb flow when waves roughly oppose the tidal current blue shaded periods the significant wave height also displays local maxima around these times a decrease in the stokes drift and in the significant wave height is observed during the two last flood tides of the study period this aligns with the concept that a wave opposing current steepens decrease in mean wavelength increase in amplitude a wave opposing current compresses the wave field while a wave following current stretches thus flattens it ardhuin et al 2017 phillips 1984 as the stokes drift is proportional to the square of the steepness of the waves it increases 3 2 frontal displacement and the temperature equation the sea surface temperature sst front is well represented in both mars3d runs it is characterized by a strong sst gradient between 4 9 w and 5 1 w with warm sst 15 5 c stratified waters offshore and cold sst 14 c well mixed waters close to the coast fig 1a the mixed layer whose depth is computed based on a temperature criterion of 0 2 c absolute difference from surface is around 10 20 m deep on the stratified side and reaches the sea floor on the mixed side fig 1b note that computing the mixed layer depth based on a density criterion does not significantly alter the results looking at longitude time hovmöller diagrams of the sst along the transect at 48 8 n clearly shows the zonal displacement of the ushant front with the tidal flow fig 5b as expected it is seen to advance towards the shore with the flood and retreat offshore with the ebb flow in both the stand alone and coupled simulations as illustrated in fig 5b the zonal displacement at 48 8 n is not in phase with the mean sea level msl fig 5a but rather with the zonal surface current fig 5d showing how tidal advection drives the front s position a surface negative temperature anomaly of up to 1 5 c in the stratified side fig 5c is visible in the coupled run compared to the stand alone run this cooling is pronounced 1 c within 2 to 4 km west of the front location in the stand alone mars3d run between 0100 and 1800 utc on 03 september but extends over 10 kilometres further the differences in temperature and displacement intensify during the simulated period as the waves grow no clear link is observed between the intensity of the sst response and the tidal cycle a wave induced cooling can be expected due to wave surface breaking induced mixing eqs 15 16 which would only have visible impacts on the temperature on the stratified part however the analysis of the location of the maximum sst gradient along 48 8 n reveals that this cooling is associated with a westward displacement of the ushant front differences in the surface tracer advecting velocities between the coupled and stand alone runs are mostly negative around the position of the front fig 5e this indicates a reduction of the eastward advection and an increase of the westward advection on the mixed side of the front the differences are positive indicating an increased advection to the east in line with the stokes drift and regardless of tidal phase on the stratified side of the front changes in tracer advection are more variable with both positive and negative regions and periods without a clear relation to the tidal phase the mixed layer depth is seen to reach the sea bottom within a few kilometres west of the sst front as detected in the uncoupled run further hinting at the westward displacement of the front due to waves fig 5f a deepening of the mixed layer of 5 10 m is also seen throughout the stratified side outside of the frontal region it intensifies over time and with proximity to the front the location of the sst front is obtained based on the maximum values of the sst gradient or mixed layer depth mld obtained by a sobel filter pringle 1969 its temporal evolution at 48 8 n is shown in fig 6a both types of estimation are consistent between them the one based on the mld gives a more regular forehead position that clearly follows the tidal flows the sst based one appears noisier when wave current interactions coupled run are modelled the position deduced from the sst gradient is up to 4 km further west than in the stand alone run fig 6b tracking a specific isotherm such as 14 7 c gives comparable results not shown the offset of the position deduced from the maximum gradient of mld deduced from the coupled and stand alone runs reaches 3 5 km at the end of the simulation tracking the sst offset fig 6b although results are shown for a specific latitude the impact of waves is clearly visible all along the ushant front as illustrated in fig 7 the front has similar meanders in the stand alone panel a and coupled panel b runs mapping the difference in sst between the coupled and the stand alone run fig 7c clearly reveals cooling on the stratified side of the front some positive differences in sst are visible in the southern extension of the front where meanders are stronger particularly near the ushant island presence of the island and shallow bathymetry there complicates the dynamics and wave interactions positive salinity and density anomalies accompany the negative surface temperature anomaly on the west side of the front fig 8 the anomalies extend to the mld on the stratified side of the front without any clear variation of magnitude with depth up to 5 m beneath the mld of the stand alone run the anomalies are of opposite sign as can be expected from enhanced mixing this is accompanied with a deepening of the mld of 2 3 m no significant differences in temperature and salinity hence neither in density are found at depth between the run with or without waves a full depth version of fig 8 can be found in supplementary materials cf s1 this suggests that only the surface front is impacted by waves under the forcing considered here the waves impact on the tracer fields is however clearly seen several metres below the mixed layer three physical processes could explain the sst cooling and the westward shift of the sst front in the coupled mars3d ww3 compared to the stand alone mars3d run 1 horizontal advection of sst gradient to the west replacing warm stratified waters by cold waters from the mixed side of the front 2 increase of the vertical mixing through additional injection of tke in ocean due to the presence of waves 3 changes in vertical entrainment at the mld bottom bringing cold water up due to wave induced changes in mean vertical velocities changes of vertical entrainment as computed from the vertical velocity using the continuity equation are not significant the leading order processes driving the temperature evolution are advection and vertical diffusion contrasting the budget of the temperature equation of the coupled and stand alone runs eqs 3 and 11 respectively allows to determine which of these two processes changes more in response to wave coupling fig 9 shows hovmöller plots at 48 8 n of the different terms of the temperature equation for the stand alone mars3d run panels a and b and the difference between the coupled wave ocean and the stand alone mars3d runs panels c to e the temporal trend term of the stand alone run is not shown because it is very close to the total advection term as expected in a tidally dominated environment note also that budget terms are hourly averaged rather than instantaneous as in previous figures the semi diurnal tidal signal is clearly visible in the total advection fig 9a but not in the vertical diffusion term fig 9b which is negative on the well mixed side of the front and positive on the stratified side the plots of differences reveal that the changes in the advective terms fig 9d are larger around the front than the changes in the vertical diffusion fig 9e indeed the difference in the temperature trend fig 9c follows that of the total advection revealing cooling near the front particularly during flood tide fig 9e does however clearly show an increase in vertical diffusion on the warm side of the front at times 3 3 current and k ε equations to further explore the dynamics and energetics responsible for the wave induced changes described above current and k ε equation budgets computed from the coupled and stand alone runs are compared fig 10a b d and e show vertical profiles of the horizontal components of the eulerian and quasi eulerian velocities averaged in z1 red and z2 blue for two instants one when waves and currents are opposed 1200 utc on 03 september top row and one when they follow each other 1800 utc on 03 september bottom row the general behaviour on both the stratified z1 and mixed z2 sides of the front is similar currents opposing following to wave propagation are found to increase decrease the vertical profiles all clearly feature a near surface gradient although the mean flow is driven largely by barotropic tides the impact of waves on currents is clearly enhanced near surface but reaches below the mld which is around 15 3 m and 15 8 m at 1200 utc and 13 8 m and 14 1 m at 1800 utc in z1 in the stand alone and coupled run respectively the vertical eddy viscosities fig 10c and f are seen to increase within the top 10 15 m of the water column in both cases on either side of the front the increased mixing leading to reduced vertical gradients can explain the increased decreased quasi eulerian velocities in condition of wave opposing following currents a positive vertical gradient shear likely due to ekman dynamics exists at all times in both the zonal and meridional velocity components the resulting down gradient turbulent diffusion leads to an increase in magnitude of the upper ocean velocity when negative and a decrease in the magnitude when positive the impact of waves on the magnitude of the near surface tidal current is further analysed through time series of differences between the magnitude of the quasi eulerian current in the coupled run and that of the eulerian current in the stand alone run fig 11a the differences of the current magnitudes averaged over z1 reach 0 080 0 007 m s 1 during the ebb flow on 03 september at 1200 utc and 0 073 0 010 m s 1 during the rising tide at 1800 utc on 03 september this equates to changes in the quasi eulerian surface current magnitude of up to 17 5 relative to the eulerian current magnitude of the stand alone run in z1 changes on the mixed side of the front z2 are relatively smaller amounting to 11 and 16 7 the differences in the zonal meridional quasi eulerian current components see supplementary materials s2 and s3 are for the most part negative indicating that east north ward flows are reduced and west south ward flows are enhanced note that the magnitude of the differences in quasi eulerian currents is for the most part smaller than the magnitude of the stokes drift see fig 4g indeed comparing the lagrangian velocity of the coupled run to the eulerian velocity of the stand alone run suggests the stokes drift tends to compensate the changes in quasi eulerian currents it increases decreases the wave following opposing currents by 3 outside of the frontal region accounting for the positive δ u l on the well mixed side in fig 5e however as shown in fig 5e this is not the case in close proximity of the temperature front where the lagrangian velocity in the coupled run is smaller than the eulerian velocity of the stand alone run during flood tides and larger during ebb flow the analysis of the current equation budget allows to evaluate the main physical balances at play given the budget of zonal and meridional currents it is easy to derive that of the current magnitude the evolution of the horizontal current follows from eqs 1 and 8 17 u 2 v 2 t 1 u 2 v 2 u u t v v t note that doing so eliminates the quasi eulerian coriolis terms meaning that the temporal evolution of the current magnitude follows the pressure gradient term at first order fig 11b plotting the terms of the equations for the zonal and meridional components see supplementary material s2 and s3 rather than the module clearly shows that the main evolution of the currents is driven from a balance between the pressure gradient and the coriolis force i e tides fig 11b shows the time series of the domain averaged terms contributing to the evolution of current magnitude starting around 2000 utc on 02 september a separation is visible between the terms of the stand alone solid curves and the coupled dashed curves mars3d outputs in both the temporal trend black curves the pressure terms purple curves and the vertical diffusion term light blue curves note that the addition of the wave induced pressure j does not significantly alter the pressure gradient terms the observed offset between the solid and dashed purple curves reflects differences between the eulerian current of the stand alone run and the quasi eulerian current of the coupled run when looking at the zonal and meridional components supplementary material s2 and s3 the change in quasi eulerian currents is reflected in the quasi eulerian coriolis terms i f u time series of the difference between the coupled and the stand alone mars3d fields fig 11c clearly show that as the waves start to grow the stokes coriolis term grows the difference in trend of the quasi eulerian velocity in the coupled run and the eulerian velocity in the stand alone run arises from changes in the vertical diffusion term and the coriolis terms which evolve in opposite phase the balance described above was verified to hold in average not only over the whole domain but also in z1 and z2 changes in the vertical diffusion term arise from changes in the surface stress the vertical shear and the eddy viscosity see eqs 1 and 8 the surface stress acting upon the ocean eq 10 vs eq 2 is reduced when waves and currents are aligned but enhanced when opposed with changes of the order of 10 relative to τ a the near surface shear is reduced regardless of wave current alignment the near surface eddy viscosity is enhanced on average by a factor of o 10 in the coupled run compared to the stand alone run due to changes in the k ε equations eqs 12 16 vs eqs 4 7 as discussed in section 2 2 the surface boundary conditions are modified when wave effects as derived from ww3 model are taken into account consequently the near surface tke fig 12a and the dissipation ε not shown are seen to increase as the waves grow displaying two maxima similar to the stokes drift magnitude and h s as variations of the tke dissipation rate largely reflect those of tke more insights may be gained by looking at the evolution of the dissipation length scale l derived via the taylor 1935 scaling 18 l c l k 3 2 ε where the proportionality constant c l c μ 0 3 4 0 146 is derived from the stability function c μ for d 0 and p ε see burchard 2002 while the near surface l in the stand alone run is nearly constant and equal to 0 24 0 031 m it increases from 0 23 to 0 48 m when averaged over the whole domain in the coupled run fig 12b mimicking the evolution of the h s and the stokes drift note that l in the stand alone run is directly proportional to z 0 which was set to 0 4 m this is equivalent to conditions with h s equal to 0 67 m z 0 0 6 h s following the scaling law proposed by terray et al 1996 with the proportionality coefficient of soloviev and lukas 2003 which roughly corresponds to the wave heights at the beginning of the coupled simulation note that other scalings of z 0 as a function of h s can be found in the literature rascle et al 2006 particularly z 0 1 6 h s terray et al 2000 which unlike the scaling proposed by soloviev and lukas 2003 includes the contribution of swell taking z 0 1 6 h s increases mixing in the coupled run leading to an unrealistically flat temperature front at the end of the 2 5 days simulation it does however have no substantial impact on the stand alone run as z 0 appears in the denominator of the surface boundary condition for ε eq 16 increasing it leads to a reduction in ε and thus an increase in k and l this in turn further increases the diffusivities leading to a further deepening of the mixed layer and cooling of the surface the leading order terms of the near surface tke budget in both the stand alone and coupled runs are the vertical diffusion and the tke dissipation rate fig 13b these are substantially enhanced in the coupled run the vertical diffusion term displays a clear tidal variation in the stand alone run not shown varying with current magnitude being minimum maximum an hour before the current maximum minimum the tidal signature in the vertical diffusion term is no longer visible in the coupled run rather like the tke dissipation rate it increases as the waves growth and the two periods of enhancement are clearly seen in the domain mean time series the shear production term is seen to be dampened by waves in the near surface k equation fig 13a as expected from the increased mixing 3 4 analysis of partially coupled runs in order to better identify the different processes at play a series of partially coupled model experiments were run four partially coupled runs are considered in this section a run in which all stokes drift related processes are included in the current and tracer equations stokesallonly a run where only the stokes advection terms are included in the tracer equations stokesadvonly a run where only the stokes coriolis terms are included in the current equations stokescoronly and a run where waves are only taken into account in the turbulence closure model waveturbonly for the first three partially coupled runs the turbulence equations and surface boundary conditions remain unchanged i e there is no increase in k u or k c and the vertical diffusion terms are the same as in the stand alone mars3d run in all the above mentioned runs the vertical boundary condition of the current equations is that of the stand alone run i e the impact of the waves on the surface stress is ignored partially coupled runs where only the stress was changed not shown revealed that it does not alter the front position significantly fig 14b shows the cross front sst at 48 8 n for the partially coupled runs as well as the stand alone and the fully coupled runs the sst curves are centred on the position of the 14 7 c isotherm in the stand alone run this snapshot illustrates the relative frontal displacement between the runs once the wave impact is visible as expected including only the stokes advection terms stokesadvonly leads to an eastward shift of the front in the direction of the wave propagation only including the stokes coriolis terms stokescoronly can have the opposite effect displacing the front westwards as shown for the considered instant the front remains however to the east of that in the fully coupled run as mentioned in the previous section the stokes vortex force has minimal impact the run stokesallonly shows the combined effect of the stokes coriolis force on the current and of the stokes advection on tracers it leads to a slight eastward displacement of the front relative to the stand alone position the stokes coriolis force can act to increase the eastward displacement along with the stokes drift depending on the relative alignment between the currents and wave propagation these partially coupled experiments suggest that the wave induced mixing is largely responsible for the frontal displacement indeed the frontal position of the waveturbonly run follows that of the fully coupled run very closely and is at times even further to the west than in the fully coupled run although results in section 3 1 suggest that for temperature wave induced changes in mixing are less important than wave induced changes in advection this is not the case for currents thus it is the impact of wave mixing on currents rather than on temperature that is the key process explaining the main difference between stand alone and coupled runs vertical profiles of the quasi eulerian and lagrangian velocities along the front fig 14 clearly show strong baroclinicity on the stratified side of the front profiles of the zonal and meridional current components display a positive vertical gradient which is more pronounced on the stratified side of the front thus when the flow is positive negative north eastwards south westwards the flow is stronger weaker on the stratified side of the front than on the mixed side consequentially once the front is displaced westwards due to mixing the surface velocities within several kilometres of the front as identified by the 14 7 c isotherm are homogenized their intensities have increased when negative and decreased when positive this shift of regime induced by wave mixing within the frontal area has a greater impact than the changes related to the stokes drift 4 discussion the realistic model simulations described above reveal the role of gravity waves in modifying the position of a surface thermal tidal front waves propagating shore ward roughly perpendicularly to the front result in a displacement of the front in the opposite direction of the wave propagation and stokes drift this is due to an increase decrease of the quasi eulerian currents when waves oppose follow them which is more important than the stokes drift around the front the following paragraphs draw parallels between these results and previous work before exposing avenues for future development and discussing broader implications 4 1 comparison to laboratory experiments the simulated quasi eulerian current response to waves is in line with early laboratory measurements bakker and van doorn 1978 kemp and simons 1982 1983 klopman 1994 1993 umeyama 2005 full depth eulerian mean current records show an increase reduction in surface currents when opposed following to waves compared to the classic logarithmic law of the wall current profiles without waves these flume experiments were geared mainly towards analysing how waves alter currents in the bottom boundary for different bed roughness nevertheless they show systematic changes in the surface currents they are regularly considered as the truth for wave current interaction model developments although being based on paddle generated non breaking wave trains which do not have the three dimensionality and spectral spread comparable to real wave fields it had been argued that the observed wave impact was due to the presence of lateral boundaries which induce langmuir circulations dingemans et al 1996 however transverse circulations due to sidewalls were shown to only weakly impact velocity profiles groeneweg and battjes 2003 the mean velocity shear was also observed to be altered by waves in the aforementioned laboratory records it increased when waves propagated against the current and decreased or even changed sign when waves and currents propagated in the same direction turbulent intensity measurements from umeyama 2005 suggest that changes in shear were due to the wave current reynolds stresses which arise from the phase averaged correlation between the horizontal and vertical particle motion the sign of the wave current reynolds stress always opposes that of wave propagation thus for wave following opposing the current it is of the opposite same sign to the current shear leading to a reduced enhanced shear wave current reynolds stresses are not directly included as it stands the coupled framework presented here leads to a reduction of the vertical velocity shear in the surface layer due to the increased wave mixing regardless of the relative alignment between currents and waves yet the expected enhancement of the quasi eulerian current is reproduced during wave opposing periods this is only because mixing homogenizes the positive background surface current gradient which exists regardless of waves under the simulated wind conditions 4 2 comparison to wave current models and boundary layer theories several analytical 1d wave current models and boundary layer theories have been proposed to reproduce the quasi eulerian current response observed in the laboratory experiments detailed above relying on either the surface distortion of the depth dependent eddy viscosities huang and mei 2003 parameterization of wave induced second order stresses you 1996 or a mixing length hypothesis yang et al 2006 they are capable of roughly replicating measured vertical velocity profiles more recently olabarrieta et al 2010 proposed a 3d non hydrostatic eulerian wave current model using a one equation eddy viscosity turbulence closure able to mimic the current response to waves from the laboratory experiments they used it to study different wave current alignments for shallow to deep water waves teles et al 2013 used 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes to evaluate how well three turbulent closure schemes could reproduce the conditions measured in laboratory by umeyama 2005 and klopman 1994 they concluded that the two first order models k ε and k w which rely on the eddy viscosity hypothesis do not reproduce laboratory results as well as the reynolds stress transport model rsm teles et al 2013 however imposed a surface boundary condition to their first order models which forces the eddy viscosity to decrease towards the surface this is contrary to what is imposed in the realistic simulations presented here where wave coupling leads to a surface enhancement of the eddy viscosity due to the input of wave induced tke a fundamental discrepancy between the current work and the laboratory experiments the theoretical work and numerical studies discussed so far is in the relative magnitude of the currents and stokes drift while in the present study the tidal currents are much faster than the waves they are of the same order of magnitude in the aforementioned studies furthermore the current work focuses on deep water waves by contrast the laboratory experiments which the previous studies aim to reproduce featured intermediate depth waves with a ratio of wave height over depth of 0 24 and 0 1 respectively for klopman 1994 and umeyama 2005 consequently only limited comparisons to previous laboratory and analytical works are possible numerical development may be necessary to improve the dynamics and kinematics of surface wave current interactions but dedicated in situ surface current and turbulence profile measurements are also needed for validation 4 3 comparison to regional coupled modelling studies previous realistic coupled modelling studies which do not include an rsm reported no substantial impact of waves on currents closer inspection of published figures however reveals a wave induced change in currents of about 10 in two of them which is of the same order as those reported herein these studies were conducted under much stronger wind conditions and weaker currents than those simulated here one during wind jet events with wind induced currents ràfols et al 2019 the other in a tidal estuary osuna and wolf 2005 using the coawst modelling system for the north ebro shelf ràfols et al 2019 showed that the main impact of waves was on the water column stratification as waves inject turbulent kinetic energy and enhance surface stress thus deepening the mixed layer their results indicate differences in surface currents of up to 20 cm s 1 for currents ranging between 20 to less than 80 cm s 1 under winds from 10 to 20 m s 1 osuna and wolf 2005 reported a daily mean differences of up to 10 cm s 1 during a strong west southwesterly wave event under winds of 15 20 m s 1 in the shallow coastal areas with depth around 50 m of the eastern irish sea where the current magnitude is around 1 m s 1 this is based on output from the coupled proudman oceanographic laboratory coastal ocean modelling system prowam framework it is not possible to determine from the article how the observed enhancement relates to the relative alignment between the tidal currents and the waves the wave related processes found to be important in the iroise sea numerical experiments presented here are the stokes coriolis force which along with changes in vertical diffusion due to wave injection of tke and surface stress alter surface currents in the irish sea estuary only the wave induced surface stress was reported to be key osuna and wolf 2005 analysis of the cross shelf momentum equation in the ebro simulations revealed a main balance between the pressure gradient and the coriolis term before wind events although with wind speeds of 10 m s 1 with all other terms being an order of magnitude smaller ràfols et al 2019 during wind jet events in the ebro region the vortex force pressure gradient surface stress and horizontal advection were found to be of the same order 4 km offshore where the water is about 50 m deep further offshore up to tens of kilometres the vortex force and surface stress were shown to mostly balance the pressure gradient in the macro tidal regime simulated in the iroise sea the wave effect on the horizontal advection and pressure gradient are negligible and under low wind conditions the vortex force is found to be secondary to other wave processes its role in altering the currents and front position under stronger winds has yet to be investigated 4 4 comparison to remotely sensed measurements the partially coupled simulations reveal that advecting the temperature with the lagrangian velocity without allowing feedback of wave mixing and the stokes coriolis force leads to an eastward bias of the frontal position the erosion of the temperature front associated with the wave mixing is also shown to be key and explains the westward shift of the front joint analysis of hourly satellite derived sst and hf radar derived currents at 48 75 n suggested that the ushant front is not advected by the stokes drift chevallier et al 2014 estimating the front position from advection based on hf radar derived currents during a period of moderate easterly winds 5 10 m s 1 led to a westward bias of tens of kilometres after a couple of days a closer to real estimate of the temporal evolution of the front position by advection was only possible after removal of the stokes bias ardhuin et al 2009 from the current measurements a small westward bias is still visible after the stokes drift correction which may hint the fact that it does not take into account the impact of surface gravity waves on the quasi eulerian currents the present study suggests that for a more complete correction of the stokes drift effect in hf radar measurements the knowledge of the vertical gradients of the horizontal velocity is necessary as well as an estimate of the wave induced mixing while the finding of chevallier et al 2014 may suggest that the surface temperature should be advected by the quasi eulerian velocity only the authors ignore the impact of local tidally induced adiabatic mixing which maintains the frontal dynamics as the tidal residual current in the region is to the north east pure advection would lead to an eastward drift of the front which overtime would end up on the coast this is clearly not observed the hf radar measurements give the currents within the top tens of centimetres of the water column while the surface frontal signature results from the dynamics of the top tens of metres advecting the front by lagrangian hf radar observations thus overestimates the relative importance of the stokes drift compared to other wave impacts mixing and leads to a front displacement disconnected from mixed layer dynamics 4 5 limitations and avenues to improve the coupled framework the impacts of tke production by stokes drift and langmuir turbulence were not included in the present study nor the previously mentioned coastal coupled modelling efforts as the current horizontal resolution is too coarse to resolve langmuir circulations 100 m 1 km a parameterization would need to be included in the energy equations to take them into account several approaches can be envisioned based on previous studies e g kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2013 langmuir turbulence has the potential to impact the water column deeper than wave breaking thus including it could lead to erosion of the temperature stratification on the offshore side of the front further contribution to a offshore shift in its location another avenue for improving the current framework is to lift the hydrostatic constraint or to include the effects of the stokes shear force on the pressure term see suzuki and fox kemper 2016 a higher vertical resolution would also be needed to properly resolve the stokes shear as it stands using the breivik et al 2014 parameterization for the vertical stokes drift profiles the surface stokes shear is underestimated in the current framework the surface current fed to the wave model is that of the top vertical mode in situations of strong surface current shear it may be more appropriate to consider a vertically integrated current suzuki 2019 the integration depth considered could further be wavelength dependent this however would add considerable computations improving this parameterization increasing the resolution and applying the quasi hydrostatic approach suzuki and fox kemper 2016 would increase the impact of the stokes vortex force many uncertainties still surround the other parameterizations on which the framework relies these include the source functions of the wave model which are used to derive the surface stress felt by the ocean τ s u r f and wave to ocean energy flux φ o c as well as the boundary conditions of the turbulence closure scheme 4 6 broader implications the frontal displacement reaches up to 4 km within 1 5 days as waves propagating into the region grow under steady wave forcing one can expect the front to shift until a new equilibrium is reached and wave breaking induced mixing has eroded the surface velocity and temperature gradients frontal displacements can be observed repeatedly over periods of a couple of days in a 14 day run with realistic forcing note that for the conditions simulated in the present study low wind and tidal dominated dynamics the two way coupling between ocean and waves does not give significantly different results than when forcing the ocean by wave model fields as long as tidal currents were used to produce the wave fields this was tested by running the coupled framework allowing only wave fields from a stand alone ww3 run to be sent to the ocean model hourly indeed in the studied situation the described changes in the quasi eulerian currents are too small to significantly alter the properties of the swell thus in this particular case coupling is not necessary for either the wave or the ocean components this may however not be the case in non tidally dominated environments where currents are weaker or under stronger winds or under short fetches as wind seas are more sensitive to currents 5 conclusions the current study shows how surface gravity waves alter the location of a surface tidal temperature front in accordance to previous theoretical and laboratory works the coupled modelling framework reproduces a reduction increase of the surface quasi eulerian currents when they follow oppose waves in a situation of mainly eastward propagating waves as in the present case study the front is advected westwards by up to 4 km due to a reduction in the flooding tide and an increase in the ebb flow this counter intuitive impact opposes and over compensates the advection effect of stokes drift around the front note that the situation studied here is not strongly forced by winds and tidal currents are much stronger than the wave induced drift yet the impact of waves is clearly detectable the processes at play are summarized in the diagram in fig 15 here horizontal ocean and wave variability on either side of the front are neglected as the resolution is not yet sufficient to properly reproduce them in the current coupled framework the main wave dynamics behind the changes in currents are the vertical mixing and the stokes coriolis force which leads to a transport that opposes the stokes drift including wave physics is seen to increase the vertical mixing at the sea surface due to the tke injection related to wave breaking this increase in vertical mixing results in a reduction of the surface vertical gradient of the current which is positive for both flood and ebb tides leading to the observed changes in quasi eulerian currents within the studied environmental setting strong tidal currents moderate waves and winds it appears that only forcing the turbulence closure with a surface wave breaking energy flux is sufficient to reproduce the wave impact produced by the fully coupled framework in environments which are much more sensitive to the local wind conditions such as upwelling systems or under extreme conditions feedback between the ocean and the waves will have to be taken into account before a definite conclusion can be reached on which coupling aspects are necessary for operational use in coastal seas the coupled model framework will have to be improved further both the horizontal and vertical resolutions need to be increased and further development is needed to improve the representation of the stokes shear and stokes vortex force and include langmuir turbulence nevertheless the present study highlights the importance of taking wave current interactions into account even in environments where the background flow is an order of magnitude stronger than the stokes drift thus waves should be considered in dispersion studies even in tidally forced coastal seas the enhanced surface mixing resulting of injection of tke from wave breaking can significantly vertically homogenize surface tidal currents even under moderate winds in altering the surface advection waves can lead to displacements of fronts valid in a tidally forced environment the processes described herein are likely more important where surface currents are weaker susceptible to influence the position of any surface temperature front wave current interactions could be important in dictating the offshore extent of upwelling systems the coupled model framework exploited herein would allow studying coupling dynamics and energetics in a wide variety of coastal settings through analysis not only of state variables but also of the terms of the temperature current and energy equations
