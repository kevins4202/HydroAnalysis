24120,a set of wave hindcasts is constructed using two different types of wind calibration followed by an additional test retuning the input source term sin in the wave model the goal is to improve the simulation in extreme wave events in the south atlantic ocean without compromising average conditions wind fields are based on climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep the first wind calibration applies a simple linear regression model with coefficients obtained from the comparison of cfsr against buoy data the second is a method where deficiencies of the cfsr associated with severe sea state events are remedied whereby defective winds are replaced with satellite data within cyclones a total of six wind datasets forced wavewatch iii and additional three tests with modified sin in wavewatch iii lead to a total of nine wave hindcasts that are evaluated against satellite and buoy data for ambient and extreme conditions the target variable considered is the significant wave height hs the increase of sea state severity shows a progressive increase of the hindcast underestimation which could be calculated as a function of percentiles the wind calibration using a linear regression function shows similar results to the adjustments to sin term increase of β max parameter in wavewatch iii it effectively reduces the average bias of hs but cannot avoid the increase of errors with percentiles the use of blended scatterometer winds within cyclones could reduce the increasing wave hindcast errors mainly above the 93rd percentile and leads to a better representation of hs at the peak of the storms the combination of linear regression calibration of non cyclonic winds with scatterometer winds within the cyclones generated a wave hindcast with small errors from calm to extreme conditions this approach led to a reduction of the percentage error of hs from 14 to less than 8 for extreme waves while also improving the rmse keywords extreme winds and waves wave hindcasts cyclones south atlantic ocean 1 introduction coastal regions in south american countries are widely exposed to extra tropical and sub tropical cyclones occurring in the south atlantic ocean severe winds and waves pose increasing risks to highly populated coastal cities the fishing industry harbors and ship routes and the offshore industry therefore the accurate representation of the wind waves in the south atlantic is extremely important for marine safety and offshore industry activities the goal of this paper it to develop alternative wave hindcasts in the region discussing different calibration methods to improve the numerical modeling of significant wave heights hs under extreme conditions special attention is devoted to the surface winds where the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 is chosen based on selection criteria explained below an improved wind database is achieved via the application of two methods of wind calibration using buoy measurements and altimeter data which are briefly discussed and compared below details of the methodology are provide in alves et al 2017 the skill of the numerical wave model wavewatch iii tolman et al 2014 using these wind inputs is assessed as we also explore the effect of adjusting the wave growth parameters at the input source term sin to compose a total of nine wave hindcasts with different wind and wave calibrations the main goal is to assess and improve the skill of the wave simulations under extreme events without compromising the average conditions moreover a sensitivity test studies the impact of each calibration on the simulation of significant wave heights discussing the pros and cons of each database the south atlantic ocean is evaluated as a whole but the focus is on the south and southeastern coasts of brazil where data was more readily available that region has a wave climate with extreme waves up to 7 m of significant wave height as studied by parente 1999 alves and melo 2001 pinho 2003 pianca et al 2010 campos et al 2012 nascimento 2013 godoi et al 2014 romeu et al 2015 and campos and guedes soares 2016a moving to southern regions dragani et al 2013 and alonso et al 2015 discuss in details the synoptic patterns associated with the highest waves at the mouth of rio de la plata vanem and walker 2013 consider the significant wave height as the most important parameter in terms of environmental threat to ship and marine structures as it represents the total energy of the power spectrum therefore the significant wave height hs is the target variable studied in this paper in order to improve the information about the metocean climate and extreme events in campos basin offshore rio de janeiro brazil in 1991 a heave pitch roll wave buoy was moored at 22 31 s 39 58 w in water depth of 1250 m which measured winds and waves for approximately three years the most extreme event registered by this dataset is presented in fig 1 on 25 august 1992 when the significant wave height reached 6 5 m it became a benchmark in terms of extreme event in southeast brazil one of the first wave simulations using wavewatch iii wave model forced with climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 for that area led to the black solid line of fig 1 the wave simulation used the cfsr wind resolution approximately 0 3 and 1 h within a global grid the source term applied in wavewatch iii version 3 14 was st2 tolman and chalikov 1996 and the directional spectrum matrix contained 25 frequencies and 24 direction as shown in fig 1 the model result significantly underestimates the measurements to an extend that an important discussion about the accuracy of hindcasts in the location emerged together with a great concern about their use for decisions involving marine safety the low accuracy of wave simulations under extreme conditions has been widely discussed e g cardone et al 1996 swail and cox 2000 stopa and cheung 2014 campos and guedes soares 2016b etc and the proper investigation of the uncertainties sources becomes crucial for the improvement of the wave simulation cavaleri et al 2007 rogers et al 2012a rogers et al 2012a describe three categories of error sources numerics and resolution physics and forcing the forcing wind is pointed to be an important source since the wave simulations are very sensitive to input wind fields as demonstrated by teixeira et al 1995 holthuijsen et al 1996 ponce de leon and guedes soares 2008 van vledder and akpinar 2015 and campos et al 2016c especially due to the quadratic dependence of the significant wave height related to the surface wind speed cavaleri 2009 states that although the great improvement in wave modeling with respect to the past the wind accuracy is still a relevant factor at the peak of the storms this was the main motivation for the wind calibrations and the construction of six wind input databases in the present study moreover the wave model physics and source terms parameterization also have a great impact on the accuracy of the wave simulations as explained by many authors such as janssen 1982 burgers and makin 1992 tolman and chalikov 1996 ardhuin et al 2007a babanin et al 2007 rogers et al 2012b ardhuin et al 2010 and alves et al 2014 it has been taken into account in the present during the set up of the wave simulation choosing the proper source terms and parameterizations additional discussions about wave modeling accuracy can be found in padilla hernandez et al 2004 cavaleri and bertotti 2004 caires et al 2004 feng et al 2006 ardhuin et al 2007b appendini et al 2012 chawla et al 2013 and concerning specifically extreme waves associated with cyclones in rocha et al 2004 tolman and alves 2005 cardone and cox 2011 ponce de leon and guedes soares 2014 and alves et al 2015 a good illustration of extreme waves in the south atlantic is provided by innocentini and caetano neto 1996 who performed a case study of the 9th august 1988 south atlantic storm when the brazilian news media reported the loss of at least one life waves of 3 m and higher and the disappearance of a drainage pipe which weighed 8000 kg off the shores of rio de janeiro a more recent study of innocentini et al 2014 used cfsr winds forcing wavewatch iii to produce a 31 yr wave hindcast in the south atlantic ocean they suggested a new procedure to deal with potentially dangerous swells developed to detect distantly generated systems reaching the brazilian coast another challenge to produce useful simulations of extremes in the south atlantic is the difficulty of producing accurate simulations in a region with very sparse data and few in situ measurements especially because extreme events depend on the position of large fetches and cyclone tracks as discussed by campos et al 2012 gan and rao 1991 sugahara 2000 reboita 2008 and reboita et al 2009 described the main cyclonegetic areas in the southwest atlantic ocean considering the large fetches involved with wave generation in the area under investigation and the poor coverage by in situ platforms the use of satellites became an important source of data in the present study the amount of scatterometer data has significantly increased since the early 2000 s especially with quikscat jpl 2001 which composed the main source of satellite data in this work due to quikscat gaps in between satellite swaths the use of more remotely sensed observations became necessary to properly cover the cyclone propagation this problem could be solved with the blended surface wind databases of seawinds ncdc noaa zhang et al 2006 which is used in association with quikscat data in the present study to evaluate and calibrate the cfsr reanalysis within a domain ranging from 70 s to 5 s and 70 w to 0 despite the heavy dependence on remotely sensed data some buoys were also used to provide ground truth in this study illustrated in fig 2 no shallow water buoys are included so this work is restricted to deep water and large scale analyses considering the availability of buoy and satellite data the period for wind calibration and wave hindcasting extended from 2002 till 2009 wave hindcasts are evaluated using buoys and altimeter data as the spatial distribution of wave hindcast errors is an important discussion in the present paper which is only possible with assessments against altimeter data the analysis of the wave period is not included since altimeter databases do not provide this parameter section 2 is dedicated to the wind analyses sections 2 1 and 2 2 evaluate the 10 meter winds of cfsr against metocean buoys and scatterometer data section 2 3 describes the cyclone identification followed by the construction of composites of extreme events where the spatial distribution of wind errors is highlighted section 2 4 presents the wind calibration using buoy and scatterometer data section 3 is dedicated to the wave simulations where wave hindcasts are constructed testing different parameters and then evaluated against buoy and altimeter data considering calm and extreme conditions finally section 4 has the final discussion and conclusions 2 assessment and calibration of cfsr surface winds ncep and the european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf have been producing state of the art reanalysis products for the last three decades kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 gibson et al 1997 uppala et al 2005 dee et al 2011 the most recent ncep reanalysis database was generated as part of the climate forecast system reanalysis project cfsr saha et al 2000 the cfsr reanalysis is a global product covering the period 1979 to 2009 in its first release the wind fields have resolution of 18 5 0 31 and 1 h the cfsr reanalysis uses the ncep atmospheric global forecast system gfs with a robust data assimilation system a detailed description is provided in saha et al 2010 quikscat scatterometer wind is one among several sources of measurements assimilated by cfsr however the optimization in the assimilation process takes into account the whole atmospheric model with several layers and the stability of the solution therefore the cfsr 10 m wind the main parameter for wave simulations can diverge to the scatterometer winds under certain conditions stopa and cheung 2014 evaluated the flagship reanalyses from ncep and ecmwf cfsr and era interim respectively they found important divergences between both ncep and ecmwf reanalyses for the higher wind percentiles mainly for the top 1 level the authors conclude that both reanalyses underestimate extreme events above the 95 percentile according to their results ecmwf s era interim underestimates the upper percentile measurements by 8 on average whereas ncep s cfsr shows better agreement with observations with an underestimation of 3 on average this better agreement between cfsr and observed upper percentiles extends to the 99 8 mark when the quality deteriorates significantly result of stopa and cheung 2014 were later confirmed by campos and guedes soares 2016b with an evaluation of cfsr and era interim using globwave satellite data among available surface winds from global reanalyses the cfsr was selected for our study because of the availability of public data at higher spatial and temporal resolutions and for its better performance at higher wind speed percentiles the reasoning may be summarized as follows 1 higher resolution the focus of this paper is on extreme events and the spatial and temporal resolution is of great importance for the proper simulation of cyclones and extreme waves as discussed by cavaleri and bertotti 2004 cavaleri and bertotti 2006 and cavaleri et al 2007 2 performance of the higher percentiles as described by stopa and cheung 2014 3 portability for operational applications cfsr was produced with the gfs model which is also used operationally at ncep therefore the methodology applied in the present study using a ncep hindcast can be adopted and implemented for ncep forecasts 4 both cfsr and the operational gfs provide publicly available datasets which favor usage and replication of the results reported presently by the public below a general description of the methodologies for obtaining forcing wind databases that could be used to improve estimates of extreme waves in the south atlantic is provided a more detailed description of the approaches and methodologies is also found in alves et al 2017 2 1 evaluation of cfsr wind speeds relative to buoys the location and duration of buoys used in the present paper is presented by fig 2 all buoys provide wave measurements but only buoys 1 2 and 5 carried meteorological instruments to provide wind data the platform with the longest duration and strategic position at the most southerly location is buoy 1 s rio grande do sul at 32 86 s 50 89 w moored at 85 m water depth from 05 2002 to 10 2004 therefore it will be the main source of observation to evaluate and calibrate cfsr winds winds were converted to the cfsr wind speed height of 10 m using the lkb method liu katsaros businger described by liu et al 1979 validation statistics used henceforth for wind and wave parameters are mean error me measurement minus reanalysis correlation coefficient cc scatter index si and root mean square error rmse 1 m e i 1 n s i r i n 2 r m s e i 1 n s i r i 2 n 3 s i r m s e s 4 c c i 1 n s i s r i r i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n r i r 2 1 2 where s are the observations buoy or satellite measurements r are the reanalysis values the over bar indicate mean values through time and n denotes the number of data pairs positive values of me bias indicate underestimation of the model relative to observations while negative values of me indicate overestimation since the main focus in the present study is on extreme events the same metrics were also calculated for the values above the 95 and 99 percentiles finally the ratio between the cfsr quantile divided by the buoy quantile were also computed for the same levels of 95 and 99 which means the inverse of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the reanalysis related to the buoy when ratio is above 1 0 the wind speed of cfsr is greater than the buoy and when it is below 1 0 the wind speed of the buoy is greater than cfsr table 1 presents results for the bulk of data and also restricted to extreme events before making assertions on the quality of cfsr winds relative to available buoy data two limitations must be considered first the short measurements duration at buoys 2 and 5 cast doubts on the reliability and statistical significance of their data second even considering the longer buoy 1 dataset measured 95 and 99 percentiles had most intense winds at 14 and 17 m s respectively which also cast doubts to their being representative of true extreme conditions therefore the term extreme referring to upper percentiles in table 1 indicate wind intensities above 14 m s which for several locations with severe wind climate it would not be considered extreme table 1 shows a relative good agreement between cfsr and buoy data with cc around 0 8 and small me and rmse moving to the upper percentile of 95 the me increases at buoy 1 and cfsr starts to underestimate the events me values increase even more at the percentile of 99 the me and rmse become higher under extreme conditions whereas si are reduced therefore the reanalysis does not necessarily deteriorate moving to extreme events the precision showed small changes and the accuracy indicated an increasing reanalysis underestimation at buoy 1 with intensity an alternative way to analyze the performance of the reanalysis with the intensity is by looking at the scatter plots qq plots and probability distributions shown in fig 3 the scatter plots indicate a large spread of co located cfsr and buoy data the qq plots indicate a good representation of cfsr winds for wind intensities up to 10 m s from that point cfsr consistently underestimates higher wind speeds the probability density functions show that the shape of the functions diverges mainly in terms of kurtosis which impacts long term distribution fits and extrapolations although the cfsr evaluation using buoy data is a relevant first step to qualify the reanalysis the available buoy dataset is not sufficient for a proper statistical analysis regarding both temporal and spatial coverage therefore in the next item the use of satellite data will make possible the evaluation of the cyclonic winds and fetches that generate the most extreme waves during the period from 2002 to 2009 2 2 evaluation of cfsr relative to scatterometer winds in this section surface wind speeds from cfsr are compared to measurements made by quikscat during severe weather events associated with extreme significant wave heights in the western south atlantic comparisons are made using a grid with a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 and preserve the time of quikscat tracks whereby cfsr data is interpolated in space and time to match measurements wave buoy measurements were used to select the periods when extreme wave heights occurred including a lead up time of 72 h before the observed time of maximum wave height the use of quikscat data under extreme wind conditions above 20 m s might be considered questionable since the scatterometer has increasing uncertainties for high intensity storms with heavy clouds freilich and vanhoff 2006 quilfen et al 2007 however quilfen et al 2007 after performing a complete evaluation of quikscat data found that wind vector retrieval under extreme condition is feasible besides the conditions considered extremes in extra tropical cyclones in the southwest atlantic are much less intense than those associated with tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere the nine most severe events were selected from the buoy measurements all of them associated with peak wave periods from 11 to 15 seconds and directions from southeast to southwest most part of the events occurred during winter and fall synoptic conditions reveal cold fronts with strong southerly winds hitting the southeast coast of brazil before the maximum of wave heights the cyclones quickly propagate towards east and southeast creating a large fetch that dominated the left part of the cyclone the first line of fig 4 illustrates this evolution with relatively short to medium fetch with intense winds of 25 m s on the july 29 as the cyclone evolved a larger fetch developed on july 30 with lighter winds of 15 m s the second line of fig 4 presents the difference between quikscat and cfsr surface winds hot colors indicate underestimation of cfsr while cold colors indicate overestimation although cfsr reanalysis assimilated quikscat from 2001 to 2009 the evolution of the cyclone shows that cfsr consistently underestimates measurements within the cyclone especially at the left part of the low pressure system associated with southerly winds differences are around 5 m s in a relatively small area with strong winds and from 2 to 3 m s over the larger fetch this represents an underestimation of 10 to 25 in areas where quikscat is more intense than cfsr the same differences with common pattern were found in other extreme events considering that the atmospheric conditions in the south atlantic ocean associated with the most extreme hs events are reasonably similar and the analysis and inclusion of many figures would make this paper unnecessary long it was decided to present a composition of all extreme events in terms of the average surface winds before the peak of the wave measurement we call these images composites presented in the next section and they indicate where the regions containing the most differences between cfsr and quikscat occur as well as the time evolution of the cfsr underestimation areas 2 3 cyclone identification and composites of extreme winds prior to building composites a cyclone tracker based on murray and simmonds 1991 sugahara 2000 reboita 2008 and reboita et al 2009 was implemented to identify the center of cyclones and to calculate maximum and average parameters of atmospheric variables within storms in order to enhance vortices and events with strong vorticity the method of kurihara et al 1993 was applied which facilitated the identification the seawinds and cfsr databases were used for the cyclone tracking and results were combined to create a database including latitudes longitudes dates minimum maximum and mean wind intensities vorticities and pressures for each cyclone occurrences of cyclones show a high density at 35 s close to uruguai and rio grande do sul brazil and the greatest intensities are found below 40 s campos et al 2012 discuss this balance between positioning and intensity associated with the severity of extreme events in terms of hs in brazil the cyclone identification was applied to considered period from 2002 to 2009 including the 47 most extreme events selected on the basis of buoy data table 2 shows the results the number of selected events is related to the top 1 independent events measured by the wave buoys in all cases generated by cyclones in terms of cyclogenesis and positioning the latitude is around 40 s with tracks moving towards southeast the mean sea level pressure mslp has the lowest values at 48 h and 6 h while the average wind speed has highest values 48 h before the peak of the wave measurements maximum winds within cyclones are most intense 12 h before peak measured waves fig 5 summarizes the error of composites of cfsr surface wind speeds relative to measurements for up to three days before the peak of hs the spatial distribution clearly shows some important characteristics governing the occurrence of extremes with bias distribution being consistent with the changes in the wind fields average wind intensity and direction confirm the well known persistence of southwesterly winds in southern brazil uruguay and northeast argentina the strongest winds are found again 48 h before maximum waves are observed even rows of panels in fig 5 lines 2 and 4 present the differences in wind intensity quikscat minus cfsr once again hot colors indicate cfsr underestimation while cold colors indicate overestimation maps confirm that cfsr generally underestimates intensities in the area of maximum winds mainly associated with southerly directions the average underestimation varies from 1 m s to 2 m s especially in the western part of the atlantic ocean the evolution in time indicates a displacement of the cfsr underestimation area following cold fronts coupled with the tracked cyclones underestimation becomes more significant 48 h prior to maximum waves mostly at southern latitudes around 24 h prior to maximum waves the largest underestimation red shaded areas shifts northward nearing southeastern brazil and 20 s in the 12 h lead to maximum measured waves the underestimation persists with more or less the same spatial extent having a small spread towards eastern longitudes as the surface winds are the most important variable for the numerical wave forecasts fig 5 maps regions that must be carefully investigated as potential sources of largest inaccuracies in winds used for simulating extreme waves in the south and southeast of brazil 2 4 improved winds for extreme wave simulations it was shown that cfsr surface winds are generally skillful for ambient conditions but consistently underestimate the highest observed wind percentiles when both buoys and particularly scatterometer data are considered when compared to quikscat cfsr showed large errors around 5 m s within the cyclones with wind intensities up to 35 m s these inaccuracies at strong wind speeds are crucial for extreme wave simulation therefore an adjustment method was investigated to improve cfsr higher percentile winds in the south atlantic ocean in view of the availability of measurements with different characteristics used for the cfsr assessment we performed a series of alternative calibration approaches as follows first a very simple univariate linear regression model is applied using buoy measurements only a quick and widely used solution in the private consultancy industry thereafter more complex methods using satellite measurements merged with the cfsr reanalysis within the area of influence of cyclones are applied the ultimate objective of the calibration performed below is the generation of a consistent high quality surface wind database optimally adjusted to force a wave model in a way that both ambient and extreme waves are skillfully simulated 2 4 1 linear regression model the use of a linear regression model is a common approach to calibrate wind intensity and wave height in several applications using observations or numerical prediction models tolman 1998 alves et al 2009 and caires and sterl 2005 are examples of simple wind and wave calibrations using linear regression and composed the methodology applied in this section pairs of wind data were built from cfsr and buoys which were used to calculate quantiles ranging from 1 to 100 results were plotted as illustrated in fig 6 black dots two linear regression fits were calculated one for the whole set of quantiles grey line and another for the values above the 80th percentile red line approximately above 10 m s eqs 5 and 6 are the resulting linear regression models adjusted to the bulk percentiles and to the upper percentiles only respectively 5 u 10 m b u o y 1 094 u 10 m c f s r 0 370 6 u 10 m b u o y 1 049 u 10 m c f s r 0 140 a first candidate wind database for application to simulation of wave extremes was built applying eq 6 to the cfsr winds in the south atlantic ocean cfsr lr only the wind intensity is modified changes obtained with this approach represent an increase of 5 to 6 of the cfsr wind intensity within more severe storm systems observed in the south atlantic this calibration was not meant to be a reliable optimized solution since such regression model is oversimplified and does not take into account the spatial variation of cfsr error instead it is applied to evaluate the impact of a quick and simple calibration compared to other methods later discussed in this paper 2 4 2 cyclonic wind replacement and blending the evaluation of cfsr surface winds indicates that it severely underestimates upper percentile winds within cyclones in the south atlantic which cannot be corrected using a simple linear regression model chawla et al 2013 also reported problems in the noaa s wave hindcast using wavewatch iii associated with cfsr in the southern hemisphere furthermore the most critical regions in terms of cfsr wind speed underestimation the cyclonic areas rarely pass through the buoy s position an original method devised as part of the present study is proposed where the perceived deficiencies of the cfsr cyclonic winds are remedied whereby defective wind fields are replaced with data measured by satellites and the consistency of overall fields ensured by a blending algorithm replacement and blending are performed following the center of cyclones the basis of the proposed approach follows three steps first cyclones are identified using the cyclone tracking algorithm previously explained second cyclonic wind fields are isolated from the background ambient wind signal following the approach of kurihara et al 1993 finally new cyclonic winds are added to the background field following the approach of chao et al 2005 a key step is to separate cyclonic winds from the background ambient fields and extract them for replacement kurihara et al 1993 use iterative filters to remove high frequency disturbances from the large scale wind fields so that a smooth environmental field is produced the latter is retained and provides the ambient component of the new surface wind field database due to the gaps between quikscat swaths the seawinds database was used in combination with it allowing the reconstruction of surface winds from each cyclonic event in a more reliable way seawinds is a 6 hourly satellite database which was interpolated onto the 1 hourly sampling same as cfsr using the technique of tolman and alves 2005 instead of the traditional bi linear interpolation that deteriorates the structure of small cyclones with fast propagation german salsa effect therefore an algorithm was developed to separate the cyclonic and background winds from the seawinds database following again the approach of kurihara et al 1993 and to perform separately background and storm centered interpolation between consecutive seawinds time slices providing hourly wind fields which are then recombined onto a consistent hourly seawinds database fig 7 exemplifies the process for two cyclones in july 2007 associated with an extreme event with hs of 6 1 m measured in the southeast of brazil the blending of cfsr ambient fields with satellite based cyclonic wind fields generated two distinct surface wind databases which differ only in terms of the cfsr ambient winds in the first set no calibration is applied to cfsr ambient conditions while in the second set the linear regression is used to calibrate the cfsr ambient winds both have satellite data of seawinds and quikscat within cyclones using the same methodology results are presented in fig 8 for an event in june 2008 when a cyclone generated the highest wave measured in brazil with 7 6 m of hs fig 8c illustrates the differences of wind intensities from the new database minus the original cfsr in red are regions where satellite winds are more intense than cfsr it shows that quikscat data represent more accurately sharp fronts and higher wind speeds in intense cyclones therefore quikscat winds provided an alternative framework for improving the simulation of extreme waves in combination with seawinds stencils on fig 8d depict the areas where each different wind source was retained as well as transition zones areas with heavy clouds where quikscat flags pointed high uncertainty were excluded this problem in the quikscat database is discussed by several studies including freilich and vanhoff 2006 and quilfen et al 2007 moreover the few areas with very calm wind conditions inside the cyclone running window did not use satellite data 3 wave modelling the surface winds selected for this paper together with the new databases constructed provide a total of six different wind inputs for the wave modeling cfsr original cfsr calibrated using linear regression seawinds original seawinds centered interpolated to 1 hour of time resolution cfsr with satellite data blended within cyclones and cfsr with ambient winds calibrated using linear regression and satellite data blended within cyclones these winds lead to six wave hindcasts followed by an additional test retuning the input source term sin in the wave model results are then evaluated and calibration and tuning are discussed altimeter data allows a spatial evaluation of the results but comes with the problem of the coarse time sampling at single points satellites only revisit a site once every 10 35 days and their tracks are separated by 100 200 km cooper and forristall 1997 the buoy has regular hourly measurements that better capture the time evolution and the peaks of the storms but does not provide any information about the spatial distribution the use of both satellites and buoys provides sufficient information to evaluate the wave hindcasts in function of space and sea severity 3 1 wave hindcasts construction the state of the art wavewatch iii model version 4 18 tolman et al 2014 with the st4 source term package developed by ardhuin et al 2010 was selected for the wave simulations in the present paper wavewatch iii is a third generation wave model that has been developed at noaa ncep and provides an appropriate framework for the current investigation the choice of the st4 package overs st2 tolman and chalikov 1996 was justified on the basis of studies by ardhuin et al 2010 and alves et al 2014 it has the wind input source term sin adapted from janssen 1991 with adjustments performed by bidlot et al 2005 2007 the complete wind input source term from ardhuin et al 2010 is given 7 s i n k θ ρ a ρ w β m a x κ 2 e z z 4 u c 2 m a x cos θ θ u 0 2 σ f k θ where ρ a and ρ w are the air and water densities β max is a nondimensional growth parameter κ is von karman s constant u is the wind friction velocity c is the phase velocity and z the effective wave age tolman et al 2014 provide optimized parameters values for four tests using cfsr noaa input winds the best results are found with β max 1 33 according to tolman et al 2014 from eq 7 it is possible to see that sin is directly proportional to β max and to the energy of the spectrum therefore higher values of β max lead to higher significant wave heights which can be applied as an attempt to reduce the underestimation of wavewatch iii simulations under extreme events as seen in fig 1 four different values of β max were used in the wave modeling in this paper the default value 1 33 suggested by tolman et al 2014 plus three higher values of 1 44 1 55 and 1 66 applied to the original cfsr wind database to force the wave model the impact of these four different β max on the skill of the model is analyzed and further discussed below the wavewatch iii simulations were run using two grids generated by a grid generation package gridgen chawla and tolman 2007 where the bathymetry is based on etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 national geophysical data center geodas databases ngda geodas noaa shown at fig 9 and the obstruction grids are generated using the gshhs shoreline database wessel and smith 1996 the global grid has a resolution of 0 5 x 0 5 and it was forced with cfsr winds solely to obtain the boundary conditions to the sub grid the second grid has limits shown by fig 9 with resolution of 12 x 12 and it was forced by the six wind databases constructed and described both grids had the same input sea ice concentration database of cfsr wu and grumbine 2013 saha et al 2000 the spectral information in wavewatch iii was set with frequency increment factor first frequency hz number of frequencies and number of directions respectively 1 124398 0 04177 25 36 therefore each spectrum is composed of a matrix with 25 frequencies and 36 directions as the model is intended to simulate waves with a period of no more than 24 seconds the first frequency is 0 04177 hz the hindcast duration matches the full years of the wind databases which correspond to the period from 2002 to 2008 i e 7 years of simulation the significant wave height hs is the parameter analyzed and the results assessment is performed using altimeter data within the southwest atlantic sub grid of fig 9 and buoy data a buoy at 32 86 s 50 89 w buoy 1 of fig 2 moored in deep waters in the south of brazil contains the longest and most reliable data and therefore is used as the main data source for the wave hindcasts evaluation the same analysis was initially applied to a few other buoys in the region additional buoys at fig 2 but the small number of measurements and the frequent errors captured by the quality control algorithm at these additional locations led to the exclusion of these data due to its southernmost location buoy 1 was more exposed to the extreme events which made it the most suitable for our analyses the description of the nine hindcasts is presented by table 3 the hindcast ww3cfsr d run with original cfsr winds and default wavewatch iii parameters no wind or wave calibration method applied is used as the control dataset taken as reference in the analyses and comparisons hindcasts ww3cfsr b1 44 ww3cfsr b1 55 and ww3cfsr b1 66 are the same as ww3cfsr d but run with increasing β max parameters of eq 7 which is a simple wave model tuning test the hindcasts assessment is conducted under general and extreme conditions the evaluation using buoy data also studies the error as a function of the sea state severity increasing percentiles and looks at individual extreme events a first example of modeled hs compared to buoy measurements for two extreme events in the south of brazil is shown in fig 10 the hindcasts are plotted from now on using the same style ww3cfsr d solid blue ww3cfsr b1 44 dotted blue ww3cfsr b1 55 dashed dotted blue ww3cfsr b1 66 dashed blue ww3cfsr lr cyan ww3cfsr qssw green ww3cfsr lr qssw magenta ww3sw solid black ww3sw ci dashed black both events were generated by intense cyclones in the south atlantic ocean and the observations exceeded 6 0 m of significant wave height at the peak of the storms although fig 10 presents only two events a low statistical relevance from which one cannot draw any conclusion it is a good introductory example of the hindcasts features under severe conditions from fig 10a and b it is clear that hindcasts are very similar each other for small waves being in good agreement with measurements the dispersion among the nine hindcasts increases significantly for higher waves especially during the peak of the storms when the difference to the buoy measurements becomes large at this moment the black lines hindcasts forced with seawinds database tend to overestimate the peaks while the blue solid line ww3cfsr d underestimates it this is a common characteristic visualized in most of the extreme events analyzed and it is confirmed throughout this study another characteristic can be exemplified in the beginning of fig 10a on 05 04 2003 regarding a less severe event the wave hindcasts forced with satellite winds ww3cfsr qssw ww3cfsr lr qssw ww3sw ww3sw ci tend to better follow the wave measurements even when under or over estimated which leads to a better correlation coefficient compared to purely cfsr forcing winds hindcast the input winds associated with the extreme wave event of fig 10b is presented by fig 11 although the wind direction and circulation is very similar among wind databases the satellite winds show higher intensities when compared to cfsr hence the cfsr qssw wind database have much stronger winds inside the cyclone than cfsr winds and have exactly the same winds of cfsr for non cyclonic regions identified by fig 11f fig 12 presents the significant wave height generated by the winds of fig 11 it confirms the direct impact of wind under and over estimation on the wave fields fig 12a has the smallest waves due to the lowest intensities of original cfsr winds of fig 11a on the other hand satellite winds inside the cyclones fig 11b d e result in larger waves in the cyclone fetch the simple linear regression wind calibration of fig 11c increases the intensities of the whole domain by a small amount which leads to hs within the cyclone that is greater than ww3cfsr d but smaller than the wave hindcasts forced with satellite winds it can be confirmed by comparing fig 12c and fig 12d the linear regression fig 12c also amplifies the waves in non cyclonic areas seen in the eastern part of the map which is higher than fig 12d for the same location however the cyclonic waves of fig 12d are higher than in fig 12c in order to better visualize the differences between hindcasts fig 13 shows the difference of each hindcast compared to the reference ww3cfsr d for the same instant of fig 11 and fig 12 hot colors in red indicate locations where constructed hindcasts have higher waves than the default ww3cfsr d whereas cold colors in blue indicate locations where the constructed hindcasts have smaller waves this plot highlights the impact of using satellite wind data compared to the linear regression uplift fig 13b confirms the large overestimation of waves generated by seawinds fig 13c shows the overall increase of wave heights in the whole domain using the linear regression wind calibration which is much smaller than the increase of the wave heights inside the cyclones forced by satellite winds fig 13d illustrates that the impact of ww3cfsr qssw is mainly restricted to cyclonic areas the differences in the wave fields of fig 13 spreads out of the wave generation zone moving dispersively towards the south coast of brazilian where the buoy was moored fig 2a which explains the hindcast divergences of fig 10b 3 2 bulk evaluation for general conditions the altimeter database used for the hindcast assessment was quality controlled and organized by the globwave project ash et al 2012 an initiative funded by the european space agency globwave dd pug globwave product user guide 2013 due to the period of simulations from 01 2002 to 12 2008 the exact missions used for the evaluation were jason1 jason2 topex poseidon geosat ers2 and envisat the composition of data pairs wavewatch satellite first excludes areas close to the coast and in shallow waters as recommended by globwave dd pug 2013 the satellite data track is assigned to the nearest wavewatch regular grid point taking the sub grid of 12 x 12 and the wavewatch significant wave heights are interpolated in time to match the satellite data since the wavewatch regular grid has a high resolution of 12 x 12 and 1 h it ensures that wave model results and satellite measurements have distance of maximum 8 5 and 0 5 h a large group of pairs were constructed and for the visualization it was assembled to a new grid with resolution of 1 x 1 this procedure partially followed the description of young and holland 1996 who differently partitioned the satellite data into 2 x 2 sampling squares results are illustrated by fig 14 where hot colors in red at the bias maps indicate regions where the significant wave heights from the satellite are greater than the hindcasts i e the wave heights from hindcast are underestimated cold colors in blue indicate regions where the hindcast overestimates the satellites the first feature clearly noticeable is the great difference in accuracy among locations with a strong variation with longitude all hindcasts have relative higher waves at eastern portions of the south atlantic ocean than at western locations close to south america this leads to overestimation of all hindcasts in the south east areas and underestimation of some hindcasts at western locations the default hindcast ww3cfsr d fig 14a presented the largest underestimation in brazil at southern states but still containing small bias around 0 2 m in average the increase of wind intensities using the linear regression calibration of ww3cfsr lr resulted in an uplift of the wave heights throughout the entire grid fig 14d this benefits the western areas removing their underestimation but it worsens the overestimation at south east grid points we will later show that the deterioration of the simulation at western portions of the ocean although distant from brazil compromise other error metrics as the correlation coefficient when evaluated against buoy measurements the inclusion of satellite data within the cyclones in ww3cfsr qssw fig 14c presents a small impact in average when compared to the default hindcast ww3cfsr d it is possible to see a small improvement and reduction of both positive and negative bias especially at mid latitudes and southern grid points where the influence of cyclones is greater the hindcast fully forced by satellite winds ww3sw ci fig 14e has a different pattern where the bias significantly changes with the latitude the underestimation of ww3sw ci is more evident at the southern points whereas the mid and northern locations of the figure including brazil present small overestimation the increase of β max from 1 33 used by ww3cfsr d to 1 66 showed an improvement in terms of accuracy at brazilian waters but it severely increases the problem of overestimation at western areas this effect is similar to the linear regression uplift of the winds in ww3cfsr lr moreover hindcasts ww3cfsr b1 66 and ww3cfsr lr also deteriorates the root mean square errors compared to ww3cfsr d therefore even if they present better results for extreme waves the worse accuracy in averaged and moderate highs disregards the main purpose of this paper which is to improve the simulation of extreme waves without compromising the general conditions 3 3 evaluation under severe conditions this section will progressively move the analysis to more severe events selecting higher percentiles first using altimeter data the analysis is redone for waves above the 80th percentile then an evaluation using buoy measurements calculates the bias in function of the percentile from 0 to 99th the last part concludes the hindcast evaluation by analyzing the errors associated with the 20 most extreme events registered by the buoys we will see that depending on the level selected and the error metric considered the group of best hindcasts can change fig 15 presents the most important results which is worthwhile to compare it with fig 14a the colorbar scale has now changed and broadened the values which clearly shows the increase of hindcast errors under severe conditions the deterioration of hindcast is mainly found at mid and southern latitudes although the largest errors are more evident at these locations the propagation of the hindcast errors towards northern latitudes worsens the results across the entire domain the deterioration of hindcasts under severe conditions moves toward the underestimation of the simulations compared to the measurements as illustrated for the dataset ww3cfsr d in fig 15a the use of satellite winds inside the cyclones ww3cfsr qssw presented a small improvement compared to ww3cfsr d considering these range of percentiles analyzed and averaged the wave hindcast ww3cfsr lr that severely overestimated altimeter waves in the comparison for general conditions has now presented small bias with similar effect of increasing the parameter β max fig 15b shows the best results related to the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw with the combined application of the linear regression wind calibration together with satellite wind data inside the cyclones the linear regression reduced the general bias while the satellite data within cyclones improve the results at mid and southern latitudes the bias at fig 15b is in between 0 2 and 0 4 m and locations close to brazil show very small errors the averaged analysis above the 80th percentile used so far cannot be considered extreme however the use of higher percentiles would compromise the statistics and lead to small satellite samples regarding the wave buoy containing a better sampling rate it is possible to move to higher percentiles the mean error was calculated several times resampling the buoy and hindcast data by fixing thresholds linked to the percentiles from 0 to 99 the error metrics is then calculated and averaged for all dataset with wave heights above each of these percentiles in other words fig 16 is built by re sampling the data moving a minimum percentile level from 0 to 99 and calculating the metrics with several iterations that generate error metrics values and the curves it is now possible to evaluate the hindcast errors for each level of severity from small waves until extreme events above the 95th percentile once again positive values indicate underestimation of hindcasts related to the buoy while negative values indicate overestimation of hindcasts the default hindcast ww3cfsr d is shown in solid blue in fig 16 presenting the largest underestimation positive mean error compared to the buoy for all percentiles the increase of wavewatch parameter β max reduces the underestimation as observed in the dotted dashed dotted and dashed blue lines however this led to the overestimation of ww3cfsr b1 66 at the lower percentiles and did not avoid the increase of error at higher percentiles which is the most critical problem of simulations it is also observed in the hindcast ww3cfsr lr with similar shape of the error evolution the percentiles from 0 to 40 are overestimated while the underestimation increases moving towards the extreme events the opposite occurs with hindcasts ww3sw and ww3sw ci forced by satellite winds the errors increase dramatically at higher percentiles but related to overestimation when the hindcasts present much higher waves than the buoy measurements the dashed black line ww3sw ci shows a smaller overestimation than ww3sw i e the centered interpolation of tolman and alves 2005 resulted in decrease of the wave heights the use of satellite winds inside the cyclones ww3cfsr qssw is shown by the green line of fig 16 it closely follows the blue line of ww3cfsr d for small and moderate waves with a slight underestimation however above the 80th percentile curves start to diverge and especially above the 93rd percentile the bias of ww3cfsr qssw drops while the ww3cfsr d error keeps increasing the shape of this drastic reduction of the ww3cfsr qssw error curve is similar to the ww3sw and ww3sw ci hindcasts entirely forced by satellite winds the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw in magenta at fig 16 shows small bias for all ranges of percentiles with the combination of the linear regression for non cyclonic areas and scatterometer winds within cyclones ww3cfsr lr qssw has a small overestimation at small percentiles similar to ww3cfsr lr and it presents the same reduction of bias for extreme events seen in the ww3cfsr qssw curve the last part of the wave hindcasts assessment is focused on the twenty most extreme events registered by the same heave pitch roll buoy 1 from 05 2002 to 10 2004 the independent events were selected considering 36 hours before and after the instant of maximum wave height from the buoy selecting slices of 72 hours of hindcast and buoy data although events have different durations the same period is used for all extremes in order to calculate the correlation coefficient with the same data length the differences from the buoy to the hindcast at the peak of the storm even when displaced is also computed referred as peakerr table 4 presents the results where me rmse and peakerr are given in meters besides fig 17 presents a taylor diagram taylor 2001 containing each of the twenty events simulated by the hindcasts and compared against the buoy table 4 shows positive mean errors underestimation for all hindcasts apart from ww3sw and ww3sw ci which overestimated the buoy measurements although the small bias of ww3sw ci it shows the worst rmse 0 5 m and the worst correlation coefficient of 0 92 the largest underestimation is found in ww3cfsr d considering both me and peakerr it gradually decreases to better results with increasing β max parameters the hindcast ww3cfsr lr has good results for the me rmse si and peakerr but the correlation coefficient cc is practically the same as ww3cfsr d the results of ww3cfsr qssw show a small improvement in the me rmse si and peakerr metrics compared to ww3cfsr d and it has the best cc among all hindcasts of 0 95 the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw presents good overall results with very small bias small rmse and si and the second best cc in order to evaluate the new constructed hindcasts table 5 was made with the percentage of improvement for each error metric related to the control hindcast ww3cfsr d positive values indicate better result of the constructed hindcast than ww3cfsr d whereas negative values point to deterioration of the new hindcast compared to ww3cfsr d the group of hindcasts that better reduced the bias me and peakerr for extreme events is composed of ww3sw ci ww3cfsr lr qssw ww3cfsr lr and ww3cfsr b1 66 the group that better reduced the rmse and si is ww3cfsr lr ww3cfsr lr qssw and ww3cfsr b1 66 the hindcast ww3sw ci though presented deterioration of rmse the hindcasts with the best improvement in cc are ww3cfsr qssw and ww3cfsr lr qssw the hindcasts ww3sw ci and ww3cfsr b1 66 showed worse correlation coefficients than the default ww3cfsr d instead of showing averages among the twenty events fig 17 has the results for each extreme event plotted with the taylor diagram blt points on the right of the curve of normalized standard deviation equal to 1 0 have underestimated the buoy measurements while points on the left of this curve indicate overestimation of the wave heights the rmse are represented by the two dashed dotted black curves in meters and the correlation coefficient by the straight rays in dashed black it is first clear to note a great spread of the results all hindcasts have events very well simulated and others with larger errors the cloud of blue dots indicates ww3cfsr d with majority of underestimation and only one event overestimated whereas the black markers ww3sw and ww3sw ci mostly overestimate the measurements the green marker ww3cfsr qssw shows a better correlation coefficient but a large spread over the normalized standard deviation it is important to note that the green and magenta markers related to ww3cfsr qssw and ww3cfsr lr qssw are the only ones bellow the curve of rmse of 0 5 m which highlights the benefit of using satellite winds within cyclonic areas fig 10a and b presented two of these twenty extreme events which were very well simulated by the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw considered one of the best among the nine hindcasts constructed it also illustrates the common overestimation and small correlation with the measurements of the hindcasts entirely forced by satellite winds in addition to fig 10 there are other events at fig 17 that could exemplify and show some benefits of the calibrations performed in this study 4 conclusions this paper investigates three types of surface wind product calibration and their impact to nine wave hindcasts constructed using a state of the art numerical wave model two calibration approaches are related to the surface wind product enhancements a simple linear regression applied to the cfsr wind intensities and a method of blending scatterometer wind within cyclonic areas the third calibration method is a retuning of sin in the wave model with the increase of the wind input source term parameter β max these three groups of wave hindcasts were evaluated using altimeter and buoy data for general and severe conditions considering the main goal of improving the wave modeling in the south atlantic ocean and brazil under extreme events without compromising the average conditions the evaluation maps using altimeter data highlight the great spatial differences in the alternative hindcasts errors with overestimation at eastern longitudes and underestimation close to south america hindcasts made by simply adjusting β max to 1 66 or correcting the cfsr winds via linear regression deteriorate the root mean square errors and resulted in large bias with overestimation at eastern portions of the ocean however at western areas of the south atlantic ocean offshore brazil they reduced the underestimation of the waves especially at higher percentiles the error metrics and maps have shown that increasing the β max parameter in wavewatch iii leads to similar results to increasing the input wind intensity with a linear regression it is effective in reducing the average bias but has small or no impact on the root mean square error and the correlation coefficient the comparison of bulk assessment under general conditions fig 14 against severe conditions fig 15a together with the evaluation in function of the percentiles fig 16 proves that the hindcast errors increase significantly with the sea state severity the linear regression of input winds and increase of β max parameter are methods that do not correct the increase of bias with percentiles which is the main goal of this study the evaluation of cfsr winds indicated errors between 0 5 to 1 0 m s for calm to moderate conditions while within extreme cyclones the underestimation of cfsr grows to values around 5 m s the linear regression applied generally increases in around 5 to 6 cfsr wind intensities however the process still retains an underestimation by cfsr of up to 25 associated with the approximate 5 m s differences within strong extra tropical storms in the south atlantic ocean therefore under cyclonic conditions the proposed method of blending satellite derived cyclonic wind fields with background cfsr data proves effective leading to a better representation of winds both during ambient or extreme cyclonic conditions hence the wave assessment using altimeter data showed the hindcast ww3cfsr qssw with small improvements related to the control hindcast ww3cfsr d for general conditions however fig 16 clearly shows a progressive improvement of this approach with increasing percentiles and a great reduction of the hindcast underestimation above the 93rd percentile associated with waves greater than 5 5 m the hindcast ww3cfsr qssw has also the benefit of not deteriorating the average conditions by worsening the overestimation at eastern latitudes the improvement of the extreme cyclonic waves without compromising the general conditions leads to the better representation of the peak of the storms and higher correlation coefficient it confirms the strong dependence of accurate simulation of extreme events to the surface wind inputs as discussed by cavaleri 2009 the methodology of blending satellite winds in cyclonic areas applied in hindcasts ww3cfsr qssw and ww3cfsr lr qssw is the only calibration approach among the three tested that was able to reduce the error as a function of increasing percentiles however even using much stronger cyclonic winds from satellite the underestimation of the peaks is still noticeable in ww3cfsr qssw this is associated with strong cyclones propagating eastwards that accumulate spectral energy on the local waves that propagate with the storm this process which is strongly dependent on the background cfsr winds outside areas corrected by scatterometer data cannot be well represented if the cfsr data is itself not corrected indeed the extreme wave generation process occasionally extrapolates beyond the cyclonic area following a larger fetch associated with southerly winds on the left of the trough as shown above hence the combination of the linear regression of non cyclonic areas with the satellite data within the cyclones successfully generated a hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw with small errors offshore brazil in all percentiles from calm to extreme conditions for the twenty most extreme events measured by a buoy in the south atlantic near brazil the average bias of hs at the peak of the storms was only 22 cm with scatter index of 0 086 and correlation coefficient of 0 94 this study shows that the use of satellite and buoy data to build new wave hindcasts lead to a reduction of the wave underestimation of the peak of the extremes from 0 7 to 0 2 m a decrease of percentage error from 14 to less than 8 and with new hindcasts containing the rmse under extreme conditions below 0 5 m we also highlight the importance of long and reliable measurements in the south atlantic ocean together with the implementation of a network of continuous oceanographic and meteorological data collection the results of this study draws attention to the most important areas to be monitored for extreme waves fig 5 which are the coasts of northeast argentina uruguay and the southern states of brazil finally although the improvements in the extreme wave modeling performed in this paper fig 17 and table 4 shows that there is still space for more work in order to continuously increase the accuracy of extreme events approaches that better capture the turbulent behavior of the air sea interface during stormy events followed by more complex non linear approximation methods could improve even more the simulation of extreme waves the inclusion of peak period and other spectral information would also have a great benefit to the calibrations and analyzes additionally data assimilation strategies applied to surface winds together with the inclusion of wave data assimilation could also further improve the results of this study finally we suggest future studies to consider error metrics beyond the traditional bias rmse scatter index and correlation coefficient as discussed by mentaschi et al 2013 and hanna and heinold

24120,a set of wave hindcasts is constructed using two different types of wind calibration followed by an additional test retuning the input source term sin in the wave model the goal is to improve the simulation in extreme wave events in the south atlantic ocean without compromising average conditions wind fields are based on climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep the first wind calibration applies a simple linear regression model with coefficients obtained from the comparison of cfsr against buoy data the second is a method where deficiencies of the cfsr associated with severe sea state events are remedied whereby defective winds are replaced with satellite data within cyclones a total of six wind datasets forced wavewatch iii and additional three tests with modified sin in wavewatch iii lead to a total of nine wave hindcasts that are evaluated against satellite and buoy data for ambient and extreme conditions the target variable considered is the significant wave height hs the increase of sea state severity shows a progressive increase of the hindcast underestimation which could be calculated as a function of percentiles the wind calibration using a linear regression function shows similar results to the adjustments to sin term increase of β max parameter in wavewatch iii it effectively reduces the average bias of hs but cannot avoid the increase of errors with percentiles the use of blended scatterometer winds within cyclones could reduce the increasing wave hindcast errors mainly above the 93rd percentile and leads to a better representation of hs at the peak of the storms the combination of linear regression calibration of non cyclonic winds with scatterometer winds within the cyclones generated a wave hindcast with small errors from calm to extreme conditions this approach led to a reduction of the percentage error of hs from 14 to less than 8 for extreme waves while also improving the rmse keywords extreme winds and waves wave hindcasts cyclones south atlantic ocean 1 introduction coastal regions in south american countries are widely exposed to extra tropical and sub tropical cyclones occurring in the south atlantic ocean severe winds and waves pose increasing risks to highly populated coastal cities the fishing industry harbors and ship routes and the offshore industry therefore the accurate representation of the wind waves in the south atlantic is extremely important for marine safety and offshore industry activities the goal of this paper it to develop alternative wave hindcasts in the region discussing different calibration methods to improve the numerical modeling of significant wave heights hs under extreme conditions special attention is devoted to the surface winds where the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 is chosen based on selection criteria explained below an improved wind database is achieved via the application of two methods of wind calibration using buoy measurements and altimeter data which are briefly discussed and compared below details of the methodology are provide in alves et al 2017 the skill of the numerical wave model wavewatch iii tolman et al 2014 using these wind inputs is assessed as we also explore the effect of adjusting the wave growth parameters at the input source term sin to compose a total of nine wave hindcasts with different wind and wave calibrations the main goal is to assess and improve the skill of the wave simulations under extreme events without compromising the average conditions moreover a sensitivity test studies the impact of each calibration on the simulation of significant wave heights discussing the pros and cons of each database the south atlantic ocean is evaluated as a whole but the focus is on the south and southeastern coasts of brazil where data was more readily available that region has a wave climate with extreme waves up to 7 m of significant wave height as studied by parente 1999 alves and melo 2001 pinho 2003 pianca et al 2010 campos et al 2012 nascimento 2013 godoi et al 2014 romeu et al 2015 and campos and guedes soares 2016a moving to southern regions dragani et al 2013 and alonso et al 2015 discuss in details the synoptic patterns associated with the highest waves at the mouth of rio de la plata vanem and walker 2013 consider the significant wave height as the most important parameter in terms of environmental threat to ship and marine structures as it represents the total energy of the power spectrum therefore the significant wave height hs is the target variable studied in this paper in order to improve the information about the metocean climate and extreme events in campos basin offshore rio de janeiro brazil in 1991 a heave pitch roll wave buoy was moored at 22 31 s 39 58 w in water depth of 1250 m which measured winds and waves for approximately three years the most extreme event registered by this dataset is presented in fig 1 on 25 august 1992 when the significant wave height reached 6 5 m it became a benchmark in terms of extreme event in southeast brazil one of the first wave simulations using wavewatch iii wave model forced with climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 for that area led to the black solid line of fig 1 the wave simulation used the cfsr wind resolution approximately 0 3 and 1 h within a global grid the source term applied in wavewatch iii version 3 14 was st2 tolman and chalikov 1996 and the directional spectrum matrix contained 25 frequencies and 24 direction as shown in fig 1 the model result significantly underestimates the measurements to an extend that an important discussion about the accuracy of hindcasts in the location emerged together with a great concern about their use for decisions involving marine safety the low accuracy of wave simulations under extreme conditions has been widely discussed e g cardone et al 1996 swail and cox 2000 stopa and cheung 2014 campos and guedes soares 2016b etc and the proper investigation of the uncertainties sources becomes crucial for the improvement of the wave simulation cavaleri et al 2007 rogers et al 2012a rogers et al 2012a describe three categories of error sources numerics and resolution physics and forcing the forcing wind is pointed to be an important source since the wave simulations are very sensitive to input wind fields as demonstrated by teixeira et al 1995 holthuijsen et al 1996 ponce de leon and guedes soares 2008 van vledder and akpinar 2015 and campos et al 2016c especially due to the quadratic dependence of the significant wave height related to the surface wind speed cavaleri 2009 states that although the great improvement in wave modeling with respect to the past the wind accuracy is still a relevant factor at the peak of the storms this was the main motivation for the wind calibrations and the construction of six wind input databases in the present study moreover the wave model physics and source terms parameterization also have a great impact on the accuracy of the wave simulations as explained by many authors such as janssen 1982 burgers and makin 1992 tolman and chalikov 1996 ardhuin et al 2007a babanin et al 2007 rogers et al 2012b ardhuin et al 2010 and alves et al 2014 it has been taken into account in the present during the set up of the wave simulation choosing the proper source terms and parameterizations additional discussions about wave modeling accuracy can be found in padilla hernandez et al 2004 cavaleri and bertotti 2004 caires et al 2004 feng et al 2006 ardhuin et al 2007b appendini et al 2012 chawla et al 2013 and concerning specifically extreme waves associated with cyclones in rocha et al 2004 tolman and alves 2005 cardone and cox 2011 ponce de leon and guedes soares 2014 and alves et al 2015 a good illustration of extreme waves in the south atlantic is provided by innocentini and caetano neto 1996 who performed a case study of the 9th august 1988 south atlantic storm when the brazilian news media reported the loss of at least one life waves of 3 m and higher and the disappearance of a drainage pipe which weighed 8000 kg off the shores of rio de janeiro a more recent study of innocentini et al 2014 used cfsr winds forcing wavewatch iii to produce a 31 yr wave hindcast in the south atlantic ocean they suggested a new procedure to deal with potentially dangerous swells developed to detect distantly generated systems reaching the brazilian coast another challenge to produce useful simulations of extremes in the south atlantic is the difficulty of producing accurate simulations in a region with very sparse data and few in situ measurements especially because extreme events depend on the position of large fetches and cyclone tracks as discussed by campos et al 2012 gan and rao 1991 sugahara 2000 reboita 2008 and reboita et al 2009 described the main cyclonegetic areas in the southwest atlantic ocean considering the large fetches involved with wave generation in the area under investigation and the poor coverage by in situ platforms the use of satellites became an important source of data in the present study the amount of scatterometer data has significantly increased since the early 2000 s especially with quikscat jpl 2001 which composed the main source of satellite data in this work due to quikscat gaps in between satellite swaths the use of more remotely sensed observations became necessary to properly cover the cyclone propagation this problem could be solved with the blended surface wind databases of seawinds ncdc noaa zhang et al 2006 which is used in association with quikscat data in the present study to evaluate and calibrate the cfsr reanalysis within a domain ranging from 70 s to 5 s and 70 w to 0 despite the heavy dependence on remotely sensed data some buoys were also used to provide ground truth in this study illustrated in fig 2 no shallow water buoys are included so this work is restricted to deep water and large scale analyses considering the availability of buoy and satellite data the period for wind calibration and wave hindcasting extended from 2002 till 2009 wave hindcasts are evaluated using buoys and altimeter data as the spatial distribution of wave hindcast errors is an important discussion in the present paper which is only possible with assessments against altimeter data the analysis of the wave period is not included since altimeter databases do not provide this parameter section 2 is dedicated to the wind analyses sections 2 1 and 2 2 evaluate the 10 meter winds of cfsr against metocean buoys and scatterometer data section 2 3 describes the cyclone identification followed by the construction of composites of extreme events where the spatial distribution of wind errors is highlighted section 2 4 presents the wind calibration using buoy and scatterometer data section 3 is dedicated to the wave simulations where wave hindcasts are constructed testing different parameters and then evaluated against buoy and altimeter data considering calm and extreme conditions finally section 4 has the final discussion and conclusions 2 assessment and calibration of cfsr surface winds ncep and the european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf have been producing state of the art reanalysis products for the last three decades kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 gibson et al 1997 uppala et al 2005 dee et al 2011 the most recent ncep reanalysis database was generated as part of the climate forecast system reanalysis project cfsr saha et al 2000 the cfsr reanalysis is a global product covering the period 1979 to 2009 in its first release the wind fields have resolution of 18 5 0 31 and 1 h the cfsr reanalysis uses the ncep atmospheric global forecast system gfs with a robust data assimilation system a detailed description is provided in saha et al 2010 quikscat scatterometer wind is one among several sources of measurements assimilated by cfsr however the optimization in the assimilation process takes into account the whole atmospheric model with several layers and the stability of the solution therefore the cfsr 10 m wind the main parameter for wave simulations can diverge to the scatterometer winds under certain conditions stopa and cheung 2014 evaluated the flagship reanalyses from ncep and ecmwf cfsr and era interim respectively they found important divergences between both ncep and ecmwf reanalyses for the higher wind percentiles mainly for the top 1 level the authors conclude that both reanalyses underestimate extreme events above the 95 percentile according to their results ecmwf s era interim underestimates the upper percentile measurements by 8 on average whereas ncep s cfsr shows better agreement with observations with an underestimation of 3 on average this better agreement between cfsr and observed upper percentiles extends to the 99 8 mark when the quality deteriorates significantly result of stopa and cheung 2014 were later confirmed by campos and guedes soares 2016b with an evaluation of cfsr and era interim using globwave satellite data among available surface winds from global reanalyses the cfsr was selected for our study because of the availability of public data at higher spatial and temporal resolutions and for its better performance at higher wind speed percentiles the reasoning may be summarized as follows 1 higher resolution the focus of this paper is on extreme events and the spatial and temporal resolution is of great importance for the proper simulation of cyclones and extreme waves as discussed by cavaleri and bertotti 2004 cavaleri and bertotti 2006 and cavaleri et al 2007 2 performance of the higher percentiles as described by stopa and cheung 2014 3 portability for operational applications cfsr was produced with the gfs model which is also used operationally at ncep therefore the methodology applied in the present study using a ncep hindcast can be adopted and implemented for ncep forecasts 4 both cfsr and the operational gfs provide publicly available datasets which favor usage and replication of the results reported presently by the public below a general description of the methodologies for obtaining forcing wind databases that could be used to improve estimates of extreme waves in the south atlantic is provided a more detailed description of the approaches and methodologies is also found in alves et al 2017 2 1 evaluation of cfsr wind speeds relative to buoys the location and duration of buoys used in the present paper is presented by fig 2 all buoys provide wave measurements but only buoys 1 2 and 5 carried meteorological instruments to provide wind data the platform with the longest duration and strategic position at the most southerly location is buoy 1 s rio grande do sul at 32 86 s 50 89 w moored at 85 m water depth from 05 2002 to 10 2004 therefore it will be the main source of observation to evaluate and calibrate cfsr winds winds were converted to the cfsr wind speed height of 10 m using the lkb method liu katsaros businger described by liu et al 1979 validation statistics used henceforth for wind and wave parameters are mean error me measurement minus reanalysis correlation coefficient cc scatter index si and root mean square error rmse 1 m e i 1 n s i r i n 2 r m s e i 1 n s i r i 2 n 3 s i r m s e s 4 c c i 1 n s i s r i r i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n r i r 2 1 2 where s are the observations buoy or satellite measurements r are the reanalysis values the over bar indicate mean values through time and n denotes the number of data pairs positive values of me bias indicate underestimation of the model relative to observations while negative values of me indicate overestimation since the main focus in the present study is on extreme events the same metrics were also calculated for the values above the 95 and 99 percentiles finally the ratio between the cfsr quantile divided by the buoy quantile were also computed for the same levels of 95 and 99 which means the inverse of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the reanalysis related to the buoy when ratio is above 1 0 the wind speed of cfsr is greater than the buoy and when it is below 1 0 the wind speed of the buoy is greater than cfsr table 1 presents results for the bulk of data and also restricted to extreme events before making assertions on the quality of cfsr winds relative to available buoy data two limitations must be considered first the short measurements duration at buoys 2 and 5 cast doubts on the reliability and statistical significance of their data second even considering the longer buoy 1 dataset measured 95 and 99 percentiles had most intense winds at 14 and 17 m s respectively which also cast doubts to their being representative of true extreme conditions therefore the term extreme referring to upper percentiles in table 1 indicate wind intensities above 14 m s which for several locations with severe wind climate it would not be considered extreme table 1 shows a relative good agreement between cfsr and buoy data with cc around 0 8 and small me and rmse moving to the upper percentile of 95 the me increases at buoy 1 and cfsr starts to underestimate the events me values increase even more at the percentile of 99 the me and rmse become higher under extreme conditions whereas si are reduced therefore the reanalysis does not necessarily deteriorate moving to extreme events the precision showed small changes and the accuracy indicated an increasing reanalysis underestimation at buoy 1 with intensity an alternative way to analyze the performance of the reanalysis with the intensity is by looking at the scatter plots qq plots and probability distributions shown in fig 3 the scatter plots indicate a large spread of co located cfsr and buoy data the qq plots indicate a good representation of cfsr winds for wind intensities up to 10 m s from that point cfsr consistently underestimates higher wind speeds the probability density functions show that the shape of the functions diverges mainly in terms of kurtosis which impacts long term distribution fits and extrapolations although the cfsr evaluation using buoy data is a relevant first step to qualify the reanalysis the available buoy dataset is not sufficient for a proper statistical analysis regarding both temporal and spatial coverage therefore in the next item the use of satellite data will make possible the evaluation of the cyclonic winds and fetches that generate the most extreme waves during the period from 2002 to 2009 2 2 evaluation of cfsr relative to scatterometer winds in this section surface wind speeds from cfsr are compared to measurements made by quikscat during severe weather events associated with extreme significant wave heights in the western south atlantic comparisons are made using a grid with a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 and preserve the time of quikscat tracks whereby cfsr data is interpolated in space and time to match measurements wave buoy measurements were used to select the periods when extreme wave heights occurred including a lead up time of 72 h before the observed time of maximum wave height the use of quikscat data under extreme wind conditions above 20 m s might be considered questionable since the scatterometer has increasing uncertainties for high intensity storms with heavy clouds freilich and vanhoff 2006 quilfen et al 2007 however quilfen et al 2007 after performing a complete evaluation of quikscat data found that wind vector retrieval under extreme condition is feasible besides the conditions considered extremes in extra tropical cyclones in the southwest atlantic are much less intense than those associated with tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere the nine most severe events were selected from the buoy measurements all of them associated with peak wave periods from 11 to 15 seconds and directions from southeast to southwest most part of the events occurred during winter and fall synoptic conditions reveal cold fronts with strong southerly winds hitting the southeast coast of brazil before the maximum of wave heights the cyclones quickly propagate towards east and southeast creating a large fetch that dominated the left part of the cyclone the first line of fig 4 illustrates this evolution with relatively short to medium fetch with intense winds of 25 m s on the july 29 as the cyclone evolved a larger fetch developed on july 30 with lighter winds of 15 m s the second line of fig 4 presents the difference between quikscat and cfsr surface winds hot colors indicate underestimation of cfsr while cold colors indicate overestimation although cfsr reanalysis assimilated quikscat from 2001 to 2009 the evolution of the cyclone shows that cfsr consistently underestimates measurements within the cyclone especially at the left part of the low pressure system associated with southerly winds differences are around 5 m s in a relatively small area with strong winds and from 2 to 3 m s over the larger fetch this represents an underestimation of 10 to 25 in areas where quikscat is more intense than cfsr the same differences with common pattern were found in other extreme events considering that the atmospheric conditions in the south atlantic ocean associated with the most extreme hs events are reasonably similar and the analysis and inclusion of many figures would make this paper unnecessary long it was decided to present a composition of all extreme events in terms of the average surface winds before the peak of the wave measurement we call these images composites presented in the next section and they indicate where the regions containing the most differences between cfsr and quikscat occur as well as the time evolution of the cfsr underestimation areas 2 3 cyclone identification and composites of extreme winds prior to building composites a cyclone tracker based on murray and simmonds 1991 sugahara 2000 reboita 2008 and reboita et al 2009 was implemented to identify the center of cyclones and to calculate maximum and average parameters of atmospheric variables within storms in order to enhance vortices and events with strong vorticity the method of kurihara et al 1993 was applied which facilitated the identification the seawinds and cfsr databases were used for the cyclone tracking and results were combined to create a database including latitudes longitudes dates minimum maximum and mean wind intensities vorticities and pressures for each cyclone occurrences of cyclones show a high density at 35 s close to uruguai and rio grande do sul brazil and the greatest intensities are found below 40 s campos et al 2012 discuss this balance between positioning and intensity associated with the severity of extreme events in terms of hs in brazil the cyclone identification was applied to considered period from 2002 to 2009 including the 47 most extreme events selected on the basis of buoy data table 2 shows the results the number of selected events is related to the top 1 independent events measured by the wave buoys in all cases generated by cyclones in terms of cyclogenesis and positioning the latitude is around 40 s with tracks moving towards southeast the mean sea level pressure mslp has the lowest values at 48 h and 6 h while the average wind speed has highest values 48 h before the peak of the wave measurements maximum winds within cyclones are most intense 12 h before peak measured waves fig 5 summarizes the error of composites of cfsr surface wind speeds relative to measurements for up to three days before the peak of hs the spatial distribution clearly shows some important characteristics governing the occurrence of extremes with bias distribution being consistent with the changes in the wind fields average wind intensity and direction confirm the well known persistence of southwesterly winds in southern brazil uruguay and northeast argentina the strongest winds are found again 48 h before maximum waves are observed even rows of panels in fig 5 lines 2 and 4 present the differences in wind intensity quikscat minus cfsr once again hot colors indicate cfsr underestimation while cold colors indicate overestimation maps confirm that cfsr generally underestimates intensities in the area of maximum winds mainly associated with southerly directions the average underestimation varies from 1 m s to 2 m s especially in the western part of the atlantic ocean the evolution in time indicates a displacement of the cfsr underestimation area following cold fronts coupled with the tracked cyclones underestimation becomes more significant 48 h prior to maximum waves mostly at southern latitudes around 24 h prior to maximum waves the largest underestimation red shaded areas shifts northward nearing southeastern brazil and 20 s in the 12 h lead to maximum measured waves the underestimation persists with more or less the same spatial extent having a small spread towards eastern longitudes as the surface winds are the most important variable for the numerical wave forecasts fig 5 maps regions that must be carefully investigated as potential sources of largest inaccuracies in winds used for simulating extreme waves in the south and southeast of brazil 2 4 improved winds for extreme wave simulations it was shown that cfsr surface winds are generally skillful for ambient conditions but consistently underestimate the highest observed wind percentiles when both buoys and particularly scatterometer data are considered when compared to quikscat cfsr showed large errors around 5 m s within the cyclones with wind intensities up to 35 m s these inaccuracies at strong wind speeds are crucial for extreme wave simulation therefore an adjustment method was investigated to improve cfsr higher percentile winds in the south atlantic ocean in view of the availability of measurements with different characteristics used for the cfsr assessment we performed a series of alternative calibration approaches as follows first a very simple univariate linear regression model is applied using buoy measurements only a quick and widely used solution in the private consultancy industry thereafter more complex methods using satellite measurements merged with the cfsr reanalysis within the area of influence of cyclones are applied the ultimate objective of the calibration performed below is the generation of a consistent high quality surface wind database optimally adjusted to force a wave model in a way that both ambient and extreme waves are skillfully simulated 2 4 1 linear regression model the use of a linear regression model is a common approach to calibrate wind intensity and wave height in several applications using observations or numerical prediction models tolman 1998 alves et al 2009 and caires and sterl 2005 are examples of simple wind and wave calibrations using linear regression and composed the methodology applied in this section pairs of wind data were built from cfsr and buoys which were used to calculate quantiles ranging from 1 to 100 results were plotted as illustrated in fig 6 black dots two linear regression fits were calculated one for the whole set of quantiles grey line and another for the values above the 80th percentile red line approximately above 10 m s eqs 5 and 6 are the resulting linear regression models adjusted to the bulk percentiles and to the upper percentiles only respectively 5 u 10 m b u o y 1 094 u 10 m c f s r 0 370 6 u 10 m b u o y 1 049 u 10 m c f s r 0 140 a first candidate wind database for application to simulation of wave extremes was built applying eq 6 to the cfsr winds in the south atlantic ocean cfsr lr only the wind intensity is modified changes obtained with this approach represent an increase of 5 to 6 of the cfsr wind intensity within more severe storm systems observed in the south atlantic this calibration was not meant to be a reliable optimized solution since such regression model is oversimplified and does not take into account the spatial variation of cfsr error instead it is applied to evaluate the impact of a quick and simple calibration compared to other methods later discussed in this paper 2 4 2 cyclonic wind replacement and blending the evaluation of cfsr surface winds indicates that it severely underestimates upper percentile winds within cyclones in the south atlantic which cannot be corrected using a simple linear regression model chawla et al 2013 also reported problems in the noaa s wave hindcast using wavewatch iii associated with cfsr in the southern hemisphere furthermore the most critical regions in terms of cfsr wind speed underestimation the cyclonic areas rarely pass through the buoy s position an original method devised as part of the present study is proposed where the perceived deficiencies of the cfsr cyclonic winds are remedied whereby defective wind fields are replaced with data measured by satellites and the consistency of overall fields ensured by a blending algorithm replacement and blending are performed following the center of cyclones the basis of the proposed approach follows three steps first cyclones are identified using the cyclone tracking algorithm previously explained second cyclonic wind fields are isolated from the background ambient wind signal following the approach of kurihara et al 1993 finally new cyclonic winds are added to the background field following the approach of chao et al 2005 a key step is to separate cyclonic winds from the background ambient fields and extract them for replacement kurihara et al 1993 use iterative filters to remove high frequency disturbances from the large scale wind fields so that a smooth environmental field is produced the latter is retained and provides the ambient component of the new surface wind field database due to the gaps between quikscat swaths the seawinds database was used in combination with it allowing the reconstruction of surface winds from each cyclonic event in a more reliable way seawinds is a 6 hourly satellite database which was interpolated onto the 1 hourly sampling same as cfsr using the technique of tolman and alves 2005 instead of the traditional bi linear interpolation that deteriorates the structure of small cyclones with fast propagation german salsa effect therefore an algorithm was developed to separate the cyclonic and background winds from the seawinds database following again the approach of kurihara et al 1993 and to perform separately background and storm centered interpolation between consecutive seawinds time slices providing hourly wind fields which are then recombined onto a consistent hourly seawinds database fig 7 exemplifies the process for two cyclones in july 2007 associated with an extreme event with hs of 6 1 m measured in the southeast of brazil the blending of cfsr ambient fields with satellite based cyclonic wind fields generated two distinct surface wind databases which differ only in terms of the cfsr ambient winds in the first set no calibration is applied to cfsr ambient conditions while in the second set the linear regression is used to calibrate the cfsr ambient winds both have satellite data of seawinds and quikscat within cyclones using the same methodology results are presented in fig 8 for an event in june 2008 when a cyclone generated the highest wave measured in brazil with 7 6 m of hs fig 8c illustrates the differences of wind intensities from the new database minus the original cfsr in red are regions where satellite winds are more intense than cfsr it shows that quikscat data represent more accurately sharp fronts and higher wind speeds in intense cyclones therefore quikscat winds provided an alternative framework for improving the simulation of extreme waves in combination with seawinds stencils on fig 8d depict the areas where each different wind source was retained as well as transition zones areas with heavy clouds where quikscat flags pointed high uncertainty were excluded this problem in the quikscat database is discussed by several studies including freilich and vanhoff 2006 and quilfen et al 2007 moreover the few areas with very calm wind conditions inside the cyclone running window did not use satellite data 3 wave modelling the surface winds selected for this paper together with the new databases constructed provide a total of six different wind inputs for the wave modeling cfsr original cfsr calibrated using linear regression seawinds original seawinds centered interpolated to 1 hour of time resolution cfsr with satellite data blended within cyclones and cfsr with ambient winds calibrated using linear regression and satellite data blended within cyclones these winds lead to six wave hindcasts followed by an additional test retuning the input source term sin in the wave model results are then evaluated and calibration and tuning are discussed altimeter data allows a spatial evaluation of the results but comes with the problem of the coarse time sampling at single points satellites only revisit a site once every 10 35 days and their tracks are separated by 100 200 km cooper and forristall 1997 the buoy has regular hourly measurements that better capture the time evolution and the peaks of the storms but does not provide any information about the spatial distribution the use of both satellites and buoys provides sufficient information to evaluate the wave hindcasts in function of space and sea severity 3 1 wave hindcasts construction the state of the art wavewatch iii model version 4 18 tolman et al 2014 with the st4 source term package developed by ardhuin et al 2010 was selected for the wave simulations in the present paper wavewatch iii is a third generation wave model that has been developed at noaa ncep and provides an appropriate framework for the current investigation the choice of the st4 package overs st2 tolman and chalikov 1996 was justified on the basis of studies by ardhuin et al 2010 and alves et al 2014 it has the wind input source term sin adapted from janssen 1991 with adjustments performed by bidlot et al 2005 2007 the complete wind input source term from ardhuin et al 2010 is given 7 s i n k θ ρ a ρ w β m a x κ 2 e z z 4 u c 2 m a x cos θ θ u 0 2 σ f k θ where ρ a and ρ w are the air and water densities β max is a nondimensional growth parameter κ is von karman s constant u is the wind friction velocity c is the phase velocity and z the effective wave age tolman et al 2014 provide optimized parameters values for four tests using cfsr noaa input winds the best results are found with β max 1 33 according to tolman et al 2014 from eq 7 it is possible to see that sin is directly proportional to β max and to the energy of the spectrum therefore higher values of β max lead to higher significant wave heights which can be applied as an attempt to reduce the underestimation of wavewatch iii simulations under extreme events as seen in fig 1 four different values of β max were used in the wave modeling in this paper the default value 1 33 suggested by tolman et al 2014 plus three higher values of 1 44 1 55 and 1 66 applied to the original cfsr wind database to force the wave model the impact of these four different β max on the skill of the model is analyzed and further discussed below the wavewatch iii simulations were run using two grids generated by a grid generation package gridgen chawla and tolman 2007 where the bathymetry is based on etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 national geophysical data center geodas databases ngda geodas noaa shown at fig 9 and the obstruction grids are generated using the gshhs shoreline database wessel and smith 1996 the global grid has a resolution of 0 5 x 0 5 and it was forced with cfsr winds solely to obtain the boundary conditions to the sub grid the second grid has limits shown by fig 9 with resolution of 12 x 12 and it was forced by the six wind databases constructed and described both grids had the same input sea ice concentration database of cfsr wu and grumbine 2013 saha et al 2000 the spectral information in wavewatch iii was set with frequency increment factor first frequency hz number of frequencies and number of directions respectively 1 124398 0 04177 25 36 therefore each spectrum is composed of a matrix with 25 frequencies and 36 directions as the model is intended to simulate waves with a period of no more than 24 seconds the first frequency is 0 04177 hz the hindcast duration matches the full years of the wind databases which correspond to the period from 2002 to 2008 i e 7 years of simulation the significant wave height hs is the parameter analyzed and the results assessment is performed using altimeter data within the southwest atlantic sub grid of fig 9 and buoy data a buoy at 32 86 s 50 89 w buoy 1 of fig 2 moored in deep waters in the south of brazil contains the longest and most reliable data and therefore is used as the main data source for the wave hindcasts evaluation the same analysis was initially applied to a few other buoys in the region additional buoys at fig 2 but the small number of measurements and the frequent errors captured by the quality control algorithm at these additional locations led to the exclusion of these data due to its southernmost location buoy 1 was more exposed to the extreme events which made it the most suitable for our analyses the description of the nine hindcasts is presented by table 3 the hindcast ww3cfsr d run with original cfsr winds and default wavewatch iii parameters no wind or wave calibration method applied is used as the control dataset taken as reference in the analyses and comparisons hindcasts ww3cfsr b1 44 ww3cfsr b1 55 and ww3cfsr b1 66 are the same as ww3cfsr d but run with increasing β max parameters of eq 7 which is a simple wave model tuning test the hindcasts assessment is conducted under general and extreme conditions the evaluation using buoy data also studies the error as a function of the sea state severity increasing percentiles and looks at individual extreme events a first example of modeled hs compared to buoy measurements for two extreme events in the south of brazil is shown in fig 10 the hindcasts are plotted from now on using the same style ww3cfsr d solid blue ww3cfsr b1 44 dotted blue ww3cfsr b1 55 dashed dotted blue ww3cfsr b1 66 dashed blue ww3cfsr lr cyan ww3cfsr qssw green ww3cfsr lr qssw magenta ww3sw solid black ww3sw ci dashed black both events were generated by intense cyclones in the south atlantic ocean and the observations exceeded 6 0 m of significant wave height at the peak of the storms although fig 10 presents only two events a low statistical relevance from which one cannot draw any conclusion it is a good introductory example of the hindcasts features under severe conditions from fig 10a and b it is clear that hindcasts are very similar each other for small waves being in good agreement with measurements the dispersion among the nine hindcasts increases significantly for higher waves especially during the peak of the storms when the difference to the buoy measurements becomes large at this moment the black lines hindcasts forced with seawinds database tend to overestimate the peaks while the blue solid line ww3cfsr d underestimates it this is a common characteristic visualized in most of the extreme events analyzed and it is confirmed throughout this study another characteristic can be exemplified in the beginning of fig 10a on 05 04 2003 regarding a less severe event the wave hindcasts forced with satellite winds ww3cfsr qssw ww3cfsr lr qssw ww3sw ww3sw ci tend to better follow the wave measurements even when under or over estimated which leads to a better correlation coefficient compared to purely cfsr forcing winds hindcast the input winds associated with the extreme wave event of fig 10b is presented by fig 11 although the wind direction and circulation is very similar among wind databases the satellite winds show higher intensities when compared to cfsr hence the cfsr qssw wind database have much stronger winds inside the cyclone than cfsr winds and have exactly the same winds of cfsr for non cyclonic regions identified by fig 11f fig 12 presents the significant wave height generated by the winds of fig 11 it confirms the direct impact of wind under and over estimation on the wave fields fig 12a has the smallest waves due to the lowest intensities of original cfsr winds of fig 11a on the other hand satellite winds inside the cyclones fig 11b d e result in larger waves in the cyclone fetch the simple linear regression wind calibration of fig 11c increases the intensities of the whole domain by a small amount which leads to hs within the cyclone that is greater than ww3cfsr d but smaller than the wave hindcasts forced with satellite winds it can be confirmed by comparing fig 12c and fig 12d the linear regression fig 12c also amplifies the waves in non cyclonic areas seen in the eastern part of the map which is higher than fig 12d for the same location however the cyclonic waves of fig 12d are higher than in fig 12c in order to better visualize the differences between hindcasts fig 13 shows the difference of each hindcast compared to the reference ww3cfsr d for the same instant of fig 11 and fig 12 hot colors in red indicate locations where constructed hindcasts have higher waves than the default ww3cfsr d whereas cold colors in blue indicate locations where the constructed hindcasts have smaller waves this plot highlights the impact of using satellite wind data compared to the linear regression uplift fig 13b confirms the large overestimation of waves generated by seawinds fig 13c shows the overall increase of wave heights in the whole domain using the linear regression wind calibration which is much smaller than the increase of the wave heights inside the cyclones forced by satellite winds fig 13d illustrates that the impact of ww3cfsr qssw is mainly restricted to cyclonic areas the differences in the wave fields of fig 13 spreads out of the wave generation zone moving dispersively towards the south coast of brazilian where the buoy was moored fig 2a which explains the hindcast divergences of fig 10b 3 2 bulk evaluation for general conditions the altimeter database used for the hindcast assessment was quality controlled and organized by the globwave project ash et al 2012 an initiative funded by the european space agency globwave dd pug globwave product user guide 2013 due to the period of simulations from 01 2002 to 12 2008 the exact missions used for the evaluation were jason1 jason2 topex poseidon geosat ers2 and envisat the composition of data pairs wavewatch satellite first excludes areas close to the coast and in shallow waters as recommended by globwave dd pug 2013 the satellite data track is assigned to the nearest wavewatch regular grid point taking the sub grid of 12 x 12 and the wavewatch significant wave heights are interpolated in time to match the satellite data since the wavewatch regular grid has a high resolution of 12 x 12 and 1 h it ensures that wave model results and satellite measurements have distance of maximum 8 5 and 0 5 h a large group of pairs were constructed and for the visualization it was assembled to a new grid with resolution of 1 x 1 this procedure partially followed the description of young and holland 1996 who differently partitioned the satellite data into 2 x 2 sampling squares results are illustrated by fig 14 where hot colors in red at the bias maps indicate regions where the significant wave heights from the satellite are greater than the hindcasts i e the wave heights from hindcast are underestimated cold colors in blue indicate regions where the hindcast overestimates the satellites the first feature clearly noticeable is the great difference in accuracy among locations with a strong variation with longitude all hindcasts have relative higher waves at eastern portions of the south atlantic ocean than at western locations close to south america this leads to overestimation of all hindcasts in the south east areas and underestimation of some hindcasts at western locations the default hindcast ww3cfsr d fig 14a presented the largest underestimation in brazil at southern states but still containing small bias around 0 2 m in average the increase of wind intensities using the linear regression calibration of ww3cfsr lr resulted in an uplift of the wave heights throughout the entire grid fig 14d this benefits the western areas removing their underestimation but it worsens the overestimation at south east grid points we will later show that the deterioration of the simulation at western portions of the ocean although distant from brazil compromise other error metrics as the correlation coefficient when evaluated against buoy measurements the inclusion of satellite data within the cyclones in ww3cfsr qssw fig 14c presents a small impact in average when compared to the default hindcast ww3cfsr d it is possible to see a small improvement and reduction of both positive and negative bias especially at mid latitudes and southern grid points where the influence of cyclones is greater the hindcast fully forced by satellite winds ww3sw ci fig 14e has a different pattern where the bias significantly changes with the latitude the underestimation of ww3sw ci is more evident at the southern points whereas the mid and northern locations of the figure including brazil present small overestimation the increase of β max from 1 33 used by ww3cfsr d to 1 66 showed an improvement in terms of accuracy at brazilian waters but it severely increases the problem of overestimation at western areas this effect is similar to the linear regression uplift of the winds in ww3cfsr lr moreover hindcasts ww3cfsr b1 66 and ww3cfsr lr also deteriorates the root mean square errors compared to ww3cfsr d therefore even if they present better results for extreme waves the worse accuracy in averaged and moderate highs disregards the main purpose of this paper which is to improve the simulation of extreme waves without compromising the general conditions 3 3 evaluation under severe conditions this section will progressively move the analysis to more severe events selecting higher percentiles first using altimeter data the analysis is redone for waves above the 80th percentile then an evaluation using buoy measurements calculates the bias in function of the percentile from 0 to 99th the last part concludes the hindcast evaluation by analyzing the errors associated with the 20 most extreme events registered by the buoys we will see that depending on the level selected and the error metric considered the group of best hindcasts can change fig 15 presents the most important results which is worthwhile to compare it with fig 14a the colorbar scale has now changed and broadened the values which clearly shows the increase of hindcast errors under severe conditions the deterioration of hindcast is mainly found at mid and southern latitudes although the largest errors are more evident at these locations the propagation of the hindcast errors towards northern latitudes worsens the results across the entire domain the deterioration of hindcasts under severe conditions moves toward the underestimation of the simulations compared to the measurements as illustrated for the dataset ww3cfsr d in fig 15a the use of satellite winds inside the cyclones ww3cfsr qssw presented a small improvement compared to ww3cfsr d considering these range of percentiles analyzed and averaged the wave hindcast ww3cfsr lr that severely overestimated altimeter waves in the comparison for general conditions has now presented small bias with similar effect of increasing the parameter β max fig 15b shows the best results related to the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw with the combined application of the linear regression wind calibration together with satellite wind data inside the cyclones the linear regression reduced the general bias while the satellite data within cyclones improve the results at mid and southern latitudes the bias at fig 15b is in between 0 2 and 0 4 m and locations close to brazil show very small errors the averaged analysis above the 80th percentile used so far cannot be considered extreme however the use of higher percentiles would compromise the statistics and lead to small satellite samples regarding the wave buoy containing a better sampling rate it is possible to move to higher percentiles the mean error was calculated several times resampling the buoy and hindcast data by fixing thresholds linked to the percentiles from 0 to 99 the error metrics is then calculated and averaged for all dataset with wave heights above each of these percentiles in other words fig 16 is built by re sampling the data moving a minimum percentile level from 0 to 99 and calculating the metrics with several iterations that generate error metrics values and the curves it is now possible to evaluate the hindcast errors for each level of severity from small waves until extreme events above the 95th percentile once again positive values indicate underestimation of hindcasts related to the buoy while negative values indicate overestimation of hindcasts the default hindcast ww3cfsr d is shown in solid blue in fig 16 presenting the largest underestimation positive mean error compared to the buoy for all percentiles the increase of wavewatch parameter β max reduces the underestimation as observed in the dotted dashed dotted and dashed blue lines however this led to the overestimation of ww3cfsr b1 66 at the lower percentiles and did not avoid the increase of error at higher percentiles which is the most critical problem of simulations it is also observed in the hindcast ww3cfsr lr with similar shape of the error evolution the percentiles from 0 to 40 are overestimated while the underestimation increases moving towards the extreme events the opposite occurs with hindcasts ww3sw and ww3sw ci forced by satellite winds the errors increase dramatically at higher percentiles but related to overestimation when the hindcasts present much higher waves than the buoy measurements the dashed black line ww3sw ci shows a smaller overestimation than ww3sw i e the centered interpolation of tolman and alves 2005 resulted in decrease of the wave heights the use of satellite winds inside the cyclones ww3cfsr qssw is shown by the green line of fig 16 it closely follows the blue line of ww3cfsr d for small and moderate waves with a slight underestimation however above the 80th percentile curves start to diverge and especially above the 93rd percentile the bias of ww3cfsr qssw drops while the ww3cfsr d error keeps increasing the shape of this drastic reduction of the ww3cfsr qssw error curve is similar to the ww3sw and ww3sw ci hindcasts entirely forced by satellite winds the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw in magenta at fig 16 shows small bias for all ranges of percentiles with the combination of the linear regression for non cyclonic areas and scatterometer winds within cyclones ww3cfsr lr qssw has a small overestimation at small percentiles similar to ww3cfsr lr and it presents the same reduction of bias for extreme events seen in the ww3cfsr qssw curve the last part of the wave hindcasts assessment is focused on the twenty most extreme events registered by the same heave pitch roll buoy 1 from 05 2002 to 10 2004 the independent events were selected considering 36 hours before and after the instant of maximum wave height from the buoy selecting slices of 72 hours of hindcast and buoy data although events have different durations the same period is used for all extremes in order to calculate the correlation coefficient with the same data length the differences from the buoy to the hindcast at the peak of the storm even when displaced is also computed referred as peakerr table 4 presents the results where me rmse and peakerr are given in meters besides fig 17 presents a taylor diagram taylor 2001 containing each of the twenty events simulated by the hindcasts and compared against the buoy table 4 shows positive mean errors underestimation for all hindcasts apart from ww3sw and ww3sw ci which overestimated the buoy measurements although the small bias of ww3sw ci it shows the worst rmse 0 5 m and the worst correlation coefficient of 0 92 the largest underestimation is found in ww3cfsr d considering both me and peakerr it gradually decreases to better results with increasing β max parameters the hindcast ww3cfsr lr has good results for the me rmse si and peakerr but the correlation coefficient cc is practically the same as ww3cfsr d the results of ww3cfsr qssw show a small improvement in the me rmse si and peakerr metrics compared to ww3cfsr d and it has the best cc among all hindcasts of 0 95 the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw presents good overall results with very small bias small rmse and si and the second best cc in order to evaluate the new constructed hindcasts table 5 was made with the percentage of improvement for each error metric related to the control hindcast ww3cfsr d positive values indicate better result of the constructed hindcast than ww3cfsr d whereas negative values point to deterioration of the new hindcast compared to ww3cfsr d the group of hindcasts that better reduced the bias me and peakerr for extreme events is composed of ww3sw ci ww3cfsr lr qssw ww3cfsr lr and ww3cfsr b1 66 the group that better reduced the rmse and si is ww3cfsr lr ww3cfsr lr qssw and ww3cfsr b1 66 the hindcast ww3sw ci though presented deterioration of rmse the hindcasts with the best improvement in cc are ww3cfsr qssw and ww3cfsr lr qssw the hindcasts ww3sw ci and ww3cfsr b1 66 showed worse correlation coefficients than the default ww3cfsr d instead of showing averages among the twenty events fig 17 has the results for each extreme event plotted with the taylor diagram blt points on the right of the curve of normalized standard deviation equal to 1 0 have underestimated the buoy measurements while points on the left of this curve indicate overestimation of the wave heights the rmse are represented by the two dashed dotted black curves in meters and the correlation coefficient by the straight rays in dashed black it is first clear to note a great spread of the results all hindcasts have events very well simulated and others with larger errors the cloud of blue dots indicates ww3cfsr d with majority of underestimation and only one event overestimated whereas the black markers ww3sw and ww3sw ci mostly overestimate the measurements the green marker ww3cfsr qssw shows a better correlation coefficient but a large spread over the normalized standard deviation it is important to note that the green and magenta markers related to ww3cfsr qssw and ww3cfsr lr qssw are the only ones bellow the curve of rmse of 0 5 m which highlights the benefit of using satellite winds within cyclonic areas fig 10a and b presented two of these twenty extreme events which were very well simulated by the hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw considered one of the best among the nine hindcasts constructed it also illustrates the common overestimation and small correlation with the measurements of the hindcasts entirely forced by satellite winds in addition to fig 10 there are other events at fig 17 that could exemplify and show some benefits of the calibrations performed in this study 4 conclusions this paper investigates three types of surface wind product calibration and their impact to nine wave hindcasts constructed using a state of the art numerical wave model two calibration approaches are related to the surface wind product enhancements a simple linear regression applied to the cfsr wind intensities and a method of blending scatterometer wind within cyclonic areas the third calibration method is a retuning of sin in the wave model with the increase of the wind input source term parameter β max these three groups of wave hindcasts were evaluated using altimeter and buoy data for general and severe conditions considering the main goal of improving the wave modeling in the south atlantic ocean and brazil under extreme events without compromising the average conditions the evaluation maps using altimeter data highlight the great spatial differences in the alternative hindcasts errors with overestimation at eastern longitudes and underestimation close to south america hindcasts made by simply adjusting β max to 1 66 or correcting the cfsr winds via linear regression deteriorate the root mean square errors and resulted in large bias with overestimation at eastern portions of the ocean however at western areas of the south atlantic ocean offshore brazil they reduced the underestimation of the waves especially at higher percentiles the error metrics and maps have shown that increasing the β max parameter in wavewatch iii leads to similar results to increasing the input wind intensity with a linear regression it is effective in reducing the average bias but has small or no impact on the root mean square error and the correlation coefficient the comparison of bulk assessment under general conditions fig 14 against severe conditions fig 15a together with the evaluation in function of the percentiles fig 16 proves that the hindcast errors increase significantly with the sea state severity the linear regression of input winds and increase of β max parameter are methods that do not correct the increase of bias with percentiles which is the main goal of this study the evaluation of cfsr winds indicated errors between 0 5 to 1 0 m s for calm to moderate conditions while within extreme cyclones the underestimation of cfsr grows to values around 5 m s the linear regression applied generally increases in around 5 to 6 cfsr wind intensities however the process still retains an underestimation by cfsr of up to 25 associated with the approximate 5 m s differences within strong extra tropical storms in the south atlantic ocean therefore under cyclonic conditions the proposed method of blending satellite derived cyclonic wind fields with background cfsr data proves effective leading to a better representation of winds both during ambient or extreme cyclonic conditions hence the wave assessment using altimeter data showed the hindcast ww3cfsr qssw with small improvements related to the control hindcast ww3cfsr d for general conditions however fig 16 clearly shows a progressive improvement of this approach with increasing percentiles and a great reduction of the hindcast underestimation above the 93rd percentile associated with waves greater than 5 5 m the hindcast ww3cfsr qssw has also the benefit of not deteriorating the average conditions by worsening the overestimation at eastern latitudes the improvement of the extreme cyclonic waves without compromising the general conditions leads to the better representation of the peak of the storms and higher correlation coefficient it confirms the strong dependence of accurate simulation of extreme events to the surface wind inputs as discussed by cavaleri 2009 the methodology of blending satellite winds in cyclonic areas applied in hindcasts ww3cfsr qssw and ww3cfsr lr qssw is the only calibration approach among the three tested that was able to reduce the error as a function of increasing percentiles however even using much stronger cyclonic winds from satellite the underestimation of the peaks is still noticeable in ww3cfsr qssw this is associated with strong cyclones propagating eastwards that accumulate spectral energy on the local waves that propagate with the storm this process which is strongly dependent on the background cfsr winds outside areas corrected by scatterometer data cannot be well represented if the cfsr data is itself not corrected indeed the extreme wave generation process occasionally extrapolates beyond the cyclonic area following a larger fetch associated with southerly winds on the left of the trough as shown above hence the combination of the linear regression of non cyclonic areas with the satellite data within the cyclones successfully generated a hindcast ww3cfsr lr qssw with small errors offshore brazil in all percentiles from calm to extreme conditions for the twenty most extreme events measured by a buoy in the south atlantic near brazil the average bias of hs at the peak of the storms was only 22 cm with scatter index of 0 086 and correlation coefficient of 0 94 this study shows that the use of satellite and buoy data to build new wave hindcasts lead to a reduction of the wave underestimation of the peak of the extremes from 0 7 to 0 2 m a decrease of percentage error from 14 to less than 8 and with new hindcasts containing the rmse under extreme conditions below 0 5 m we also highlight the importance of long and reliable measurements in the south atlantic ocean together with the implementation of a network of continuous oceanographic and meteorological data collection the results of this study draws attention to the most important areas to be monitored for extreme waves fig 5 which are the coasts of northeast argentina uruguay and the southern states of brazil finally although the improvements in the extreme wave modeling performed in this paper fig 17 and table 4 shows that there is still space for more work in order to continuously increase the accuracy of extreme events approaches that better capture the turbulent behavior of the air sea interface during stormy events followed by more complex non linear approximation methods could improve even more the simulation of extreme waves the inclusion of peak period and other spectral information would also have a great benefit to the calibrations and analyzes additionally data assimilation strategies applied to surface winds together with the inclusion of wave data assimilation could also further improve the results of this study finally we suggest future studies to consider error metrics beyond the traditional bias rmse scatter index and correlation coefficient as discussed by mentaschi et al 2013 and hanna and heinold

24121,built on the earth system modeling framework esmf the one way and two way nesting methods were implemented into the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom these methods help utilize the unstructured grid multi domain nesting of fvcom with an aim at resolving the multi scale physical and ecosystem processes a detail of procedures on implementing fvcom into esmf was described the experiments were made to validate and evaluate the performance of the nested grid fvcom system the first was made for a wave current interaction case with a two domain nesting with an emphasis on qualifying a critical need of nesting to resolve a high resolution feature near the coast and harbor with little loss in computational efficiency the second was conducted for the pseudo river plume cases to examine the differences in the model simulated salinity between one way and two way nesting approaches and evaluate the performance of mass conservative two way nesting method the third was carried out for the river plume case in the realistic geometric domain in mass bay supporting the importance for having the two way nesting for coastal estuarine integrated modeling the nesting method described in this paper has been used in the northeast coastal ocean forecast system necofs a global regional coastal nesting fvcom system that has been placed into the end to end forecast and hindcast operations since 2007 keywords fvcom ocean model esmf one way nesting two way nesting 1 introduction the primitive equation numerical ocean models are valuable tools for understanding the complexities of the ocean s physical state biophysical interaction and their long term changes due to natural and anthropogenic factors in the past few decades benefiting from the emergence of the supercomputer systems and the high performance computing hpc techniques many global ocean models have been developed for the study of climate the popular global models include mom modular ocean model pacanowski and griffies 1999 opa océan parallélisé madec et al 1998 pop parallel ocean program smith et al 1999 mit gcm marshall et al 1997a b and the hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model bleck 2002 chassignet et al 2003 2006 coupled with atmospheric climate models these ocean models have enhanced our understanding of the impact of climate change on the ocean environment on global to basin scales and the role of oceanic processes in global and regional climate change all of these models however are constructed with structured grids which limit their ability to adequately resolve smaller scale processes and their interaction with the large scale circulation it is a major challenge for a global ocean model to resolve the multi scale processes relevant to global climate and to capture the correct physics of vertical and lateral mixing complexity of the earth system models and the necessity to perform long term 100 years integrations will always dictate limitations on vertical and horizontal resolution in the model components with typical spatial resolution of about 100 km ipcc 2007 commonly used structured grid ocean global models do not adequately resolve smaller scale climatologically important oceanic processes especially in the coastal and shelf regions straits and channels and regions with complex bottom topography grid refinement techniques such as nesting conjoined grids and adaptive grids could be employed to endow ocean models with variable resolution capabilities and to permit these models to better resolve multi scale processes in global and regional simulations one way or two way nesting is a common approach used in both atmosphere and ocean models fox and maskell 1995 sheng et al 2005 debreu and blayo 2008 debreu et al 2012 chen et al 2013a b 2016 chen and beardsley 2015 zhang et al 2016a b the nesting approach needs to enforce mass and energy conservation at the seam where two different size grids are connected this approach is however fraught with problems debreu and blayo 2008 chen and beardsley 2015 chen et al 2016 for example in a free surface shallow water ocean model under a long wave approximation the discrete equation makes non dispersive surface gravity waves become dispersive since the numerical dispersion depends on horizontal resolution the different grid sizes of the two domains at the nesting boundary can cause a jump of the model computed phase and group speeds for a structured grid model a numerical treatment is then required to disperse inconsistent energy exchange between the two grids and to ensure mass and energy conservation at the nesting boundary analogous baroclinic dynamics face the same issue this treatment usually works for a short term simulation but needs to be tested for the long time scale simulations generally used in climate studies unlike the structured grid nesting unstructured grid nesting is much simpler by linking two domains with common cells this approach produces the same surface gravity features at the boundary which ensures volume and mass conservation between the two domains chen et al 2013b 2016 this approach also makes it practical to resolve multi scale processes in the ocean for example energetic high frequency internal waves are frequently generated over submarine banks seamounts and ridges we can create a finer grid over those regions and nest it to the regional model in this small sub domain we can turn on the non hydrostatic dynamics in the sub domain and then hydrostatic dynamics in the regional domain using the varying size grids to specify the nested boundary with coarser grids in the region where the hydrostatic dynamics are dominant we can run the multi scale coupling with an unstructured grid model in a more computational efficient way the key reason for implementing the nesting method into fvcom is to efficiently run a model on a supercomputer by running larger and smaller domain models simultaneously on different processors with data exchange through boundaries this approach could overcome the shortcoming of the model running efficiency that is restricted by the time step as the grid is refined fvcom is a prognostic unstructured grid finite volume free surface 3 d primitive equation coastal ocean model which was originally developed by chen et al 2003 and improved and upgraded by community efforts chen et al 2006 2013a the equations are cast in a generalized terrain following coordinate system with spatially variable vertical distribution pietrzak et al 2002 in the horizontal the equations are discretized using non overlapped triangular grids which provide accurate fitting of irregular coastal geometries and flexibility in refining the grid over steep continental margins ridges and around islands the spatial fluxes of momentum are discretized using a second order accurate finite volume method kobayashi et al 1999 a flux formulation for scalars e g temperature salinity is used in conjunction with a vertical velocity adjustment to enforce exact conservation of the scalar quantities a smagorinsky formulation smagorinsky 1963 is used to parameterize horizontal diffusion and turbulent vertical mixing is calculated using the general ocean turbulence model gotm libraries burchard 2002 with the 2 5 level mellor and yamada 1982 turbulence model used as the default fvcom is coded for both spherical and cartesian coordinates and is solved numerically with an option of either a mode split like pom and roms or semi implicit integration method lai et al 2010a b the umassd

configuration and simple one way nesting this system is capable of resolving realistic global and coastal tides stratification and multi scale subtidal flows down to wetland inundation and drying the one way nesting used in necofs was achieved by an offline approach which required to be done with two steps first run the larger domain model and output the variables at the nodes and cell centroids on the common nesting boundaries second run the smaller domain model with the boundary conditions provided by the larger domain model this approach is generally sound but cannot efficiently use the supercomputer computational nodes by running larger and smaller domain models simultaneously with boundary conditions exchange over the past decade an emphasis on integrated multi component modeling has emerged reflecting an increase in scientific capabilities and computing capacity and resulting in several ambitious coupled earth system modeling efforts among them there are several efforts funded by federal agencies including noaa nasa nsf and doe two examples are esmf hill et al 2004 collins et al 2005 dunlap et al 2008 and the model coupling toolkit mct larson et al 2005 jacob et al

components and framework e g ecosystem modeling space weather modeling framework wang et al 2011 esmf defines architecture for composing complex coupled modeling systems and includes data structures and utilities for developing individual models the basic idea behind esmf is that complicated applications should be broken up into smaller pieces or components a component is a unit of software composition that has a coherent function and a standard calling interface and behavior components can be assembled to create multiple applications and different implementations of a component may be available in esmf a component may be a physical domain or a function such as a coupler or i o system esmf also includes toolkits for building components and applications such as re gridding software calendar management logging and error handling and parallel communications esmf joint specification team 2016b two models or more no matter whether or not they are structured grid or unstructured grid can be coupled in either one way or two way framework fig 1 we have implemented fvcom into esmf this paper was written to first describe the esmf fvcom framework and then present the validation results from numerical experiments done under idealized and realistic forcing cases the validation experiments were made with an aim at not only evaluating performance of the fvcom nesting on the esmf framework but also highlighting the critical needs for a two way nesting to resolve the realistic physics in a multi scale coastal ocean system the domain nesting algorithms developed in this work could significantly improve multi domain coupling for ocean applications the remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows in section 2 the methodology of fvcom one way and two way nesting on the esmf framework is described in section 3 an experiment made to evaluate the performance of the nesting method for a fully current wave coupled fvcom system in the northeast u s coastal region is presented in section 4 the two way nesting method is discussed through the experiments first with the pseudo river plume cases and then with a realistic geometric mass coastal river plume case in section 5 the conclusions are summarized 2 fvcom nesting module developed under the esmf framework the fvcom nesting module was developed under a standard esmf two way coupling framework in esmf coupling of two models or two domains is composited with components esmf joint specification team 2016a including one parent gridded component two child gridded components and a coupler component fig 1 coupling starts with an application driver which controls the model system step by step from parent component to child components and coupler component each esmf component contains initialize run and finalize modules the application driver calls the initialize module of parent component and then directly goes to call the initialize modules of all child components the run and finalize modules work in the same way implementing fvcom into esmf for an example of a two way nesting application we defined two child gridded components named large domain and small domain and one child coupler component named two way nesting coupler a flow chart is shown in fig 2 to illustrate the esmf based two way nesting module in fvcom in this chart the first and second columns are built on the esmf architecture the third column is a module named esmf fvcom which is developed on both esmf and fvcom architectures to establish the connection between the esmf framework and fvcom library the fourth column includes the fvcom library with the original fvcom version 4 0 codes and a module named mod esmf nesting this module is to load node and cell indexes of both large and small domains nesting boundaries it is also used to generate sub domain maps of nesting boundaries for parallelization the fvcom library is built for the updated version of the fvcom source codes with inclusion of wave current interaction both large and small domains use the same fvcom library the model simulations of large and small domains are grouped on different amounts of cluster processors separately via the esmf the data exchanges between the large and small domain nesting boundaries are carried out using the entire number of processors that the nesting system uses this nesting system was originally developed for the two way nesting but it can be used for a simpler one way nesting case when turning off the run cplcomp s l controller in the do loop of the second column shown in fig 2 the procedures of time integration and nesting data exchange between large and small domains are illustrated in fig 3 a the red lines indicate the data from large domain to small domain while the green lines represent the data feedback from small domain to large domain the frequency of the data exchange between two domains is based on the time step of large domain let us define δtl and δts as the time steps used for large and small domains respectively δtl nδts where n is an integer first when the large domain is integrated over one time step δtl from the time t to the time t δtl the nesting data in the large domain are sent to the small domain as the open boundary condition of the small domain then when the small domain is integrated for n time steps of δts to the time of t δtl the data in the small domain are feedback to the large domain the data exchange between large and small domains is illustrated by a sketch map in fig 3b the red line was defined as the nesting boundary of the small domain on which the variables at nodes and cells connected to this red line were provided by variables computed at the same nodes and cells in the large domain the area between the two green lines was where the simulated variables in the small domain gave feedback to the same nodes and cells in the large domain 3 a wave current interaction experiment 3 1 the experiment designs the northeast coastal ocean forecast system necofs as one component of the noaa ioos funded northeastern regional association of coastal and ocean observing systems neracoos is an integrated atmosphere

unstructured triangular meshes with horizontal resolution of 0 3 25 km fig 4a and a hybrid terrain following vertical coordinate with a total of 45 layers 10 and 5 uniform layers near the surface and bottom respectively in regions deeper than 225 m with a transfer to a sigma coordinate in the shallow continental and coastal regions an example of the distribution of the vertical layers in the hybrid coordinate is displayed in fig 5 the thickness of the uniform layers is 5 m so the hybrid coordinate transition occurs at locations where all layers have uniform thickness of 5 m the mass

horizontal resolution up to 5 10 m and 10 vertical layers gom fvcom is driven by surface forcing from the output of the wrf model configured for the region with a 9 km resolution the coare3 bulk air sea flux algorithms tidal forcing constructed using five constituents m2 s2 n2 k1 and o1 on the open boundary and local river discharges the gom swave is driven by the same wrf wind field with wave

inundation models are connected with gom fvcom through the offline one way nesting in the common boundary zones the mass coastal fvcom is driven by the same surface forcing as gom fvcom the nesting boundary conditions for the inundation models include both hydrodynamics and waves provided by gom fvcom and gom swave necofs was placed in experimental forecast operations in late 2007 and the daily 3 day forecast product can be accessed and viewed on the necofs web map server addressed http 134 88 229 220 8080 fvcomwms an experiment was made on running the gom fvcom and mass coastal fvcom nested ocean model system in necofs simultaneously using the one way and two way nesting approaches on the esmf coupler in this case the large domain referred to the gom fvcom domain fig 4a and the small domain referred to the mass coastal fvcom domain fig 4b in the large domain the area enclosed with the red line was the small domain in the small domain the meshes enclosed within the red and green lines shared the same elements with the large domain time integration and nesting data exchange between mass coastal fvcom and gom fvcom follow the procedures described in section 2 the model data comparisons were made at available observations in the small domain there were two buoys red dots in fig 4b and two tidal gauges green dots in fig 4b in the mass coastal fvcom domain buoy 44013 was located in mass bay and buoy 44020 was in nantucket sound http www ndbc noaa gov on these buoys the wind velocity and significant wave heights frequency were measured and hourly records were made in the comparison one tidal gauge named 8443970 was within the boston harbor https tidesandcurrents noaa gov and another was in the scituate harbor ma these two areas were not resolved in the large domain the tidal gauge in the scituate harbor was deployed by r thompson nws taunton wfo and f peri umass boston in december 2008 chen et al 2013b the nested model ran with the inclusion of wave current interaction by one way and two way nesting respectively the simulation was conducted for the december 27 2010 nor easter storm with the integration time covering the period of december 23 29 the initial conditions used in the two domains were given from the necofs hindcast database the december 27 nor easter storm was one of largest storms that had swept over this mass coastal region with a maximum wind speed of 20 m s beardsley et al 2013 3 2 waves comparisons during the simulation period the northerly wind prevailed in mass bay the strongest wind occurred around 11 00 uct december 27 2010 at which the northeasterly wind was dominate and its speed recorded on buoy 44013 exceeded 20 m s the maximum significant wave height occurred at the same time as the maximum wind speed with its highest value of 7 7 m and a peak period of 10 sec necofs wrf was capable of reproducing the wind velocity at this station under the same wind forcing condition the model predicted significant wave heights and peak periods from the one way and two way nesting approaches were almost identical fig 6 left panel with the root mean square deviations rmsd of 0 42 m and 1 94 s respectively the taylor diagrams of rmsd and correlation coefficient are shown in fig 7 a for significant wave height and in fig 8 a for peak wave periods we also ran the model with a single mesh by merging the small domain grid with the large domain with the results remaining the same but much more computational cost this suggested that the model data difference appeared in the figure was not related to either one way or two way nesting methods used in the experiment this comparison result indicated that the nesting method coded under the esmf framework performed well in this case the one way nesting was sufficient and no two way nesting was needed this finding was not surprising since the storm induced surface waves observed at this station mainly consisted of wind sea and swells the wind sea was generated by the local wind while swells were the waves propagated from the outer shelf of mass bay similar results were found on buoy 44020 in nantucket sound fig 6 right panel nantucket sound is bounded by cape cod on the north martha s vineyard on the southwest and nantucket island on the southeast the storm induced surface waves were much weaker in nantucket sound than those observed in mass bay even though the wind intensification was similar in these two regions the maximum significant wave height at buoy 44020 was about 3 0 m occurring around 00 00 uct december 27 the model reasonably captured the significant wave height and peak period as found at buoy 44013 the model predicted significant wave heights and peak periods were almost identical in both one way and two way nesting cases figs 7b and 8b the offline one way nesting used in necofs was operated using the same cluster nodes for both large and small domains and they were required to run one after another the one way nesting coupler on the esmf framework allowed the two domains to run simultaneously which could help maximize the use of the supercomputer nodes the two domain nesting approach enables one to increase the model grid spatial resolution near the coastal region with no significant sacrifice in computational efficiency particularly in the areas characterized with narrow water passages islands inlets and rivers an example is illustrated in fig 9 where snapshots of the distributions of the significant wave heights plus propagation directions in the mass bay boston harbor show the large fig 9a and small fig 9b domain model results the large domain model had a horizontal resolution of 300 m in the boston harbor area which failed to resolve numerous islands and complex irregular coastline in that area the small domain model had a horizontal resolution of 10 m which was sufficient to accurately capture those islands and irregular coastline due to the lack of the blocking mechanism by those solid obstacles the large domain model tended to produce a higher wave height in the harbor area the difference can be viewed more clearly at sites a outside of the harbor and b inside the harbor illustrated in fig 10 and table 1 the locations of sites a and b were shown in fig 9a the storm induced waves propagated towards the coast from the outer mass bay shelf at point a the wave heights predicted by the large domain and small domain models were close each other except at the time when the waves were highest at that time the simulated maximum wave was about 0 32 m higher in the small domain model than in the large domain model at point b however the simulated waves produced by the large domain model were generally about 0 37 m higher with a maximum difference up to 0 72 m this comparison clearly demonstrated a need to increase the model resolution in the coastal wave simulation and such a requisite can be efficiently achieved by a nested domain model approach 3 3 current and sea level comparisons the nesting approach also helped a model to resolve the complex spatial distribution of the currents inside boston harbor an example is shown in fig 11 for the comparison of the surface currents in the harbor area at 11 00 uct dec 27 2010 at that time currents outside of the harbor were dominated by the wind induced inflow but the water inside the harbor was flushed out in the large domain model fig 11a due to missing of islands inside the harbor the outflow was relative uniformly distributed nesting allowed the small domain model to include all islands inside the harbor as a result the outflow featured two strong current jets through the islands fig 11b although the total outflow transports obtained from large and small domain models were close to each other it is clear that the nesting model provided a more realistic flow pattern in the harbor area which is critically important for capturing the spatial distribution of the storm induced coastal inundation we also compared the observed water elevation with model simulated elevations predicted by the one way and two way nesting approaches at the boston harbor tidal gauge station 8443970 and the tide station in scituate harbor fig 12 note here that these two stations were not resolved in the large domain model it was not surprising that no significant difference was found in the model simulated elevations predicted by the one way and two way nesting approaches fig 13 since these two stations were located inside harbors which was far away from the nesting boundary tidal currents are periodic motions that were not affected by nesting if the tidal elevation is accurately given at the nesting boundary during the simulation period the onshore northeasterly wind prevailed with interacting with surface waves the wind pushed the water towards the coast on the nesting boundary the tidal currents were the same for both small and large domains and the wind induced subtidal flow was onshore so that no significant feedback flow from the small domain to large domain appeared 4 salinity plume simulation experiments the current wave interaction experiment described in section 3 was done under a nor easter storm during which the inflow was dominant in that case we found that the one way and two way nesting showed no significant differences in the results for the high resolution small domain model here we present the salinity plume case with the flow towards the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain illustrating the importance in having two way nesting two experiments were made for the salinity plume first we conducted the plume case with a point source over an idealized rectangular continental shelf with a constant depth and then a point source case in boston harbor configured with the nested mass bay fvcom and gom fvcom system 4 1 an idealized continental shelf the experiment was made over a constant depth idealized rectangular continental shelf with a length of 30 km and a width of 5 km to view the grid in the domain clearly the portion of the left 10 km computational domain are shown in fig 14 a and d experiments were made for the cases with 1 a single merged domain named the standard run solved without nesting 2 two domain solved through the one way nesting and 3 two domains solved through the two way nesting we assumed that the results from 1 are the true solution and the model performance for one way and two way nesting methods are evaluated through the comparison with the true solution obtained from the standard run the large domain model was configured with a resolution of 250 m in the almost whole domain except near the point source area where a resolution of 125 m was specified fig 14a the small domain models were configured with a resolution of 125 m everywhere except in the overlapping meshes zone connected to the nesting boundary with the large domain model fig 14b and c for the two way nesting experiments to examine the sensitivity of the model performance to the location of the nesting boundary we ran the model for two cases with different locations of the nesting boundary of the small domain to the large domain and named the cases case a and case b in case a fig 14b there were only two layers of overlapping cells beside the nesting boundary from the large domain to the small domain the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain is located at the second layer of overlapping cells in case b fig 14c there were five layers of overlapping cells the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain is located at the fifth layer of overlapping cells a single merged domain was constructed by the small domain in case a with the rest region filled using the large domain grid fig 14d in fig 14 the red dot in each figure was the location where the point source was specified the one way nesting experiment was run with the configuration of two domains like case a except that the feedback from the small domain to the large domain was turned off in all experiments both large domain and small domain models used uniform thickness layers with a total of 11 levels in the vertical the radiation boundary conditions were employed at the large domain open boundary initially a constant salinity of 30 psu was specified everywhere water with a salinity of 10 psu was discharged into the domain at a constant rate of 100 m3 s from the point source the nested model was integrated for 9 days the snapshots of the spatial distribution of model simulated surface salinity which were predicted from the standard run with a single merged grid without nesting at the end of 3 and 9 days were shown in fig 15 a and e respectively taking the standard run results as true solution an assessment was done for one way and two way nesting methods through comparing their results with the true solution the comparison results clearly showed that the simulated surface salinity through the one way nesting led to a significant bias around the nesting boundary and in the large domain region fig 15b and f sites a and b in fig 15b and f were the locations where the maximum errors appeared at the nesting boundary at the end of 3 and 9 days respectively at these two sites the simulated salinity started deviating from the true solution after the 12 hour simulation time and maximum deviation reached 0 29 at site a and 0 21 at site b after 9 day simulation time fig 16 the error reduced significantly when the two way nesting was turned on in both case a and case b the simulated surface salinity exhibited the almost same distribution and values in the entire computational domain including at the nesting boundary fig 15c g for case a and fig 15d h for case b at site a and site b the maximum deviation errors were 0 02 in case a and 0 06 in case b showing the error reduction of 93 and 79 respectively compared with the one way nesting case fig 16 a statistical analysis of the errors was presented through the taylor diagram shown in fig 17 where the rmsd and correlation coefficients of the comparison results of the one way and two way nesting model runs with the single merged domain standard model run were presented it is clear that in the one way nesting case the water in the small domain was blocked when it entered the nesting zone with grid refinement in the small domain the model simulated structure of the low salinity plume in the small domain significantly differed from that produced by the large domain model in the one way nesting case as the integration time becomes longer when the plume s edge reached the nesting boundary the velocity sea level and salinity produced by the small domain model differed from the boundary conditions provided by the large domain model as a result the water was blocked near the nesting boundary which clearly appeared in the distribution of the salinity by merging the large and small domain model results fig 15b and f this block disappeared when the two way nesting was used fig 15c and g the two way nesting not only included a feedback boundary condition from the small domain model to the large domain model but also adjusted the boundary forcing to the small domain the two way nesting method developed in the fvcom on the esmf framework performed well to avoid the mass accumulation at the nesting boundary this example illustrates the need for having a two way nesting in addition to demonstrating how well this method performed the comparison results for case a and case b clearly show that the location of the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain affects less to the distribution of the salinity the simple merged domain case fig 14d for true resolution was designed based on case a the comparison between this true resolution and case b is not reasonable this comparison only illustrated that the configuration for case a is simple and efficient with enough accuracy 4 2 a realistic geometric case in boston harbor necofs has setup a fvcom inundation model for mass bay named mass bay fvcom with the small domain grid shown in fig 4c this small domain model is being operated by one way nesting with the regional gom fvcom in necofs we used this nested model to repeat the point source experiments conducted in section 4 1 to see how the one way and two way nesting methods in the fvcom performed in a realistic geometric domain case the fvcom inundation model for mass bay hereafter referred to as the small domain model was configured with a horizontal resolution varying from 10 m to 500 m and a total of 11 uniform thickness sigma levels in the vertical the red and green lines shown in fig 4c had the same definitions as those shown in fig 3b the nested model was run by injecting low salinity water as a point source at the location marked with a red dot in fig 4c for the one way and two way nesting approaches respectively a constant salinity of 30 psu was specified everywhere initially then low salinity water with a constant salinity of 10 psu was injected at a rate of 2000 m3 s into the domain from the point source the simulation was conducted for a period of 3 days the tide was included in this case as was found in the idealized rectangular continental shelf case the one way nesting approach caused the low salinity plume water to be blocked when it entered the nesting boundary zone fig 18 b mismatching of the salinity between small and large domain models rapidly increased as the integration time became larger this error disappeared when two way nesting was applied grid refinement in the small domain model captured complex islands in boston harbor which produced significant spatial variability of the low salinity plume in the small domain the spatial distribution and intensity of the flow and salinity plume produced by the small domain model considerably differed from those in the large domain model fig 18a the mismatch of velocity and salinity between large and small domain models in the nesting boundary zone caused the blocking phenomenon and a gap of the salinity in that region fig 18b there was no question that in such a case the two way nesting was required fig 18c selecting the transect indicated in fig 18a we plotted the vertical distribution of the salinity for the case runs with a single large domain and nested small large domain fig 19 in the nested small large domain model runs we included the results for the one way fig 19b and two way fig 19c experiments as we described above the simulated salinity from the single large domain model run was not comparable with the nested small domain model runs since it failed to resolve the detailed geometry in the inshore area of the harbor fig 19b comparing the salinity distribution shown in fig 19b for one way nesting and in fig 19c for two way nesting we did see that in the one way nesting case blocking at the nesting boundary tended to produce a large along transect salinity gradient inside the small domain the two way nesting case accounted for the feedback from the small domain to the large domain as a result the salinity plume was carried out of the small domain producing an enhanced halocline in the large domain region in turn the horizontal salinity gradient in the small domain reduced 5 summary and discussion the fvcom was implemented into the esmf framework to set up the one way and two way nesting modules for the unstructured grid based fvcom these modules made fvcom utilize the community coupler for the multi domain nesting application with the esmf fvcom can be used to establish a multi domain nested model system without offline data interpolating and remapping the esmf based two way nesting method coded in fvcom was designed with conserved properties in data transition this approach can efficiently use the supercomputer computational nodes by running larger and smaller domain models simultaneously with boundary conditions exchange experiments were made to evaluate the performance of the one way and two way nesting methods the results not only demonstrated that the nesting methods in fvcom under the esmf framework worked well but also provided us insight into critical issues in selections of one way and two way nesting for storm induced storm surge application since the wind induced flow was onshore no matter if one way or two way nesting was used the nested model performed well for a salinity plume case however the water movement was featured by an outflow in this case the one way nesting could lead to a water blocking feature at the nesting boundary so that two way nesting should be used in general for a long term simulation the two way nesting should be used to keep the conservative property in the model for a short term simulation the one way nesting could be used if the nesting boundary was set up in the region far away from the coast the success in implementing the esmf coupler has provided a tool to make fvcom more applicable to couple with other ocean and meteorological models acknowledgments this

understanding the complexities of the ocean s physical state biophysical interaction and their long term changes due to natural and anthropogenic factors in the past few decades benefiting from the emergence of the supercomputer systems and the high performance computing hpc techniques many global ocean models have been developed for the study of climate the popular global models include mom

model bleck 2002 chassignet et al 2003 2006 coupled with atmospheric climate models these ocean models have enhanced our understanding of the impact of climate change on the ocean environment on global to basin scales and the role of oceanic processes in global and regional climate change all of these models however are constructed with structured grids which limit their ability to adequately resolve smaller scale processes and their interaction with the large scale circulation it is a major challenge for a global ocean model to resolve the multi scale processes relevant to global climate and to capture the correct physics of vertical and lateral mixing complexity of the earth system models and the necessity to perform long term 100 years integrations will always dictate limitations on vertical and horizontal resolution in the model components with typical spatial resolution of about 100 km ipcc 2007 commonly used structured grid ocean global models do not adequately resolve smaller scale climatologically important oceanic processes especially in the coastal and shelf regions straits and channels and regions with complex bottom topography grid refinement techniques such as nesting conjoined grids and adaptive grids could be employed to endow ocean models with variable resolution capabilities and to permit these models to better resolve multi scale processes in global and regional simulations one way or two way nesting is a common approach used in both atmosphere and ocean models fox and maskell 1995 sheng et al 2005 debreu and blayo 2008 debreu et al 2012 chen et al 2013a b 2016 chen and beardsley 2015 zhang et al 2016a b the nesting approach needs to enforce mass and energy conservation at the seam where two different size grids are connected this approach is however fraught with problems debreu and blayo 2008 chen and beardsley 2015 chen et al 2016 for example in a free surface shallow water ocean model under a long wave approximation the discrete equation makes non dispersive surface gravity waves become dispersive since the numerical dispersion depends on horizontal resolution the different grid sizes of the two domains at the nesting boundary can cause a jump of the model computed phase and group speeds for a structured grid model a numerical treatment is then required to disperse inconsistent energy exchange between the two grids and to ensure mass and energy conservation at the nesting boundary analogous baroclinic dynamics face the same issue this treatment usually works for a short term simulation but needs to be tested for the long time scale simulations generally used in climate studies unlike the structured grid nesting unstructured grid nesting is much simpler by linking two domains with common cells this approach produces the same surface gravity features at the boundary which ensures volume and mass conservation between the two domains chen et al 2013b 2016 this approach also makes it practical to resolve multi scale processes in the ocean for example energetic high frequency internal waves are frequently generated over submarine banks seamounts and ridges we can create a finer grid over those regions and nest it to the regional model in this small sub domain we can turn on the non hydrostatic dynamics in the sub domain and then hydrostatic dynamics in the regional domain using the varying size grids to specify the nested boundary with coarser grids in the region where the hydrostatic dynamics are dominant we can run the multi scale coupling with an unstructured grid model in a more computational efficient way the key reason for implementing the nesting method into fvcom is to efficiently run a model on a supercomputer by running larger and smaller domain models simultaneously on different processors with data exchange through boundaries this approach could overcome the shortcoming of the model running efficiency that is restricted by the time step as the grid is refined fvcom

configuration and simple one way nesting this system is capable of resolving realistic global and coastal tides stratification and multi scale subtidal flows down to wetland inundation and drying the one way nesting used in necofs was achieved by an offline approach which required to be done with two steps first run the larger domain model and output the variables at the nodes and cell centroids on the common nesting boundaries second run the smaller domain model with the boundary conditions provided by the larger domain model this approach is generally sound but cannot efficiently use the supercomputer computational nodes by running larger and smaller domain models simultaneously with boundary conditions exchange over the past decade an emphasis on integrated multi component modeling has emerged reflecting an increase in scientific capabilities and computing capacity and resulting in several ambitious coupled earth system modeling efforts among them there are several efforts funded by federal agencies including noaa nasa nsf and doe two examples are esmf hill et al 2004 collins et al 2005 dunlap et al 2008 and the model coupling toolkit mct larson et al 2005 jacob et al

calendar management logging and error handling and parallel communications esmf joint specification team 2016b two models or more no matter whether or not they are structured grid or unstructured grid can be coupled in either one way or two way framework fig 1 we have implemented fvcom into esmf this paper was written to first describe the esmf fvcom framework and then present the validation results from numerical experiments done under idealized and realistic forcing cases the validation experiments were made with an aim at not only evaluating performance of the fvcom nesting on the esmf framework but also highlighting the critical needs for a two way nesting to resolve the realistic physics in a multi scale coastal ocean system the domain nesting algorithms developed in this work could significantly improve multi domain coupling for ocean applications the remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows in section 2 the methodology of fvcom one way and two way nesting on the esmf framework is described in section 3 an experiment made to evaluate the performance of the nesting method for a fully current wave coupled fvcom system in the northeast u s coastal region is presented in section 4 the two way nesting method is discussed through the experiments first with the pseudo river plume cases and then with a realistic geometric mass coastal river plume case in section 5 the conclusions are summarized 2 fvcom nesting module developed under the esmf framework the fvcom nesting module was developed under a standard esmf two way coupling framework in esmf coupling of two models or two domains is composited with components esmf joint specification team 2016a including one parent gridded component two child gridded components and a coupler component fig 1 coupling starts with an application driver which controls the model system step by step from parent component to child components and coupler component each esmf component contains initialize run and finalize modules the application driver calls the initialize module of parent component and then directly goes to call the initialize modules of all child components the run and finalize modules work in the same way implementing fvcom into esmf for an example of a two way nesting application we defined two child gridded components named large domain and small domain and one child coupler component named two way nesting coupler a flow chart is shown in fig 2 to illustrate the esmf based two way nesting module in fvcom in this chart the first and second columns are built on the esmf architecture the third column is a module named esmf fvcom which is developed on both esmf and fvcom architectures to establish the connection between the esmf framework and fvcom library the fourth column includes the fvcom library with the original fvcom version 4 0 codes and a module named mod esmf nesting this module is to load node and cell indexes of both large and small domains nesting boundaries it is also used to generate sub domain maps of nesting boundaries for parallelization the fvcom library is built for the updated version of the fvcom source codes with inclusion of wave current interaction both large and small domains use the same fvcom library the model simulations of large and small domains are grouped on different amounts of cluster processors separately via the esmf the data exchanges between the large and small domain nesting boundaries are carried out using the entire number of processors that the nesting system uses this nesting system was originally developed for the two way nesting but it can be used for a simpler one way nesting case when turning off the run cplcomp s l controller in the do loop of the second column shown in fig 2 the procedures of time integration and nesting data exchange between large and small domains are illustrated in fig 3 a the red lines indicate the data from large domain to small domain while the green lines represent the data feedback from small domain to large domain the frequency of the data exchange between two domains is based on the time step of large domain let us define δtl and δts as the time steps used for large and small domains respectively δtl nδts where n is an integer first when the large domain is integrated over one time step δtl from the time t to the time t δtl the nesting data in the large domain are sent to the small domain as the open boundary condition of the small domain then when the small domain is integrated for n time steps of δts to the time of t δtl the data in the small domain are feedback to the large domain the data exchange between large and small domains is illustrated by a sketch map in fig 3b the red line was defined as the nesting boundary of the small domain on which the variables at nodes and cells connected to this red line were provided by variables computed at the same nodes and cells in the large domain the area between the two green lines was where the simulated variables in the small domain gave feedback to the same nodes and cells in the large domain 3 a wave current interaction experiment 3 1 the experiment designs the

bottom respectively in regions deeper than 225 m with a transfer to a sigma coordinate in the shallow continental and coastal regions an example of the distribution of the vertical layers in the hybrid coordinate is displayed in fig 5 the thickness of the uniform layers is 5 m so the hybrid coordinate transition occurs at locations where all layers have uniform thickness of 5 m the mass

3 day forecast product can be accessed and viewed on the necofs web map server addressed http 134 88 229 220 8080 fvcomwms an experiment was made on running the gom fvcom and mass coastal fvcom nested ocean model system in necofs simultaneously using the one way and two way nesting approaches on the esmf coupler in this case the large domain referred to the gom fvcom domain fig 4a and the small domain referred to the mass coastal fvcom domain fig 4b in the large domain the area enclosed with the red line was the small domain in the small domain the meshes enclosed within the red and green lines shared the same elements with the large domain time integration and nesting data exchange between mass coastal fvcom and gom fvcom follow the procedures described in section 2 the model data comparisons were made at available observations in the small domain there were two buoys red dots in fig 4b and two tidal gauges green dots in fig 4b in the mass coastal fvcom domain buoy 44013 was located in mass bay and buoy 44020 was in nantucket sound http www ndbc noaa gov on these buoys the wind velocity and significant wave heights frequency were measured and hourly records were made in the comparison one tidal gauge named 8443970 was within the boston harbor https tidesandcurrents noaa gov and another was in the scituate harbor ma these two areas were not resolved in the large domain the tidal gauge in the scituate harbor was deployed by r thompson nws taunton wfo and f peri umass boston in december 2008 chen et al 2013b the nested model ran with the inclusion of wave current interaction by one way and two way nesting respectively the simulation was conducted for the december 27 2010 nor easter storm with the integration time covering the period of december 23 29 the initial conditions used in the two domains were given from the necofs hindcast database the december 27 nor easter storm was one of largest storms that had swept over this mass coastal region with a maximum wind speed of 20 m s beardsley et al 2013 3 2 waves comparisons during the simulation period the northerly wind prevailed in mass bay the strongest wind occurred around 11 00 uct december 27 2010 at which the northeasterly wind was dominate and its speed recorded on buoy 44013 exceeded 20 m s the maximum significant wave height occurred at the same time as the maximum wind speed with its highest value of 7 7 m and a peak period of 10 sec necofs wrf was capable of reproducing the wind velocity at this station under the same wind forcing condition the model predicted significant wave heights and peak periods from the one way and two way nesting approaches were almost identical fig 6 left panel with the root mean square deviations rmsd of 0 42 m and 1 94 s respectively the taylor diagrams of rmsd and correlation coefficient are shown in fig 7 a for significant wave height and in fig 8 a for peak wave periods we also ran the model with a single mesh by merging the small domain grid with the large domain with the results remaining the same but much more computational cost this suggested that the model data difference appeared in the figure was not related to either one way or two way nesting methods used in the experiment this comparison result indicated that the nesting method coded under the esmf framework performed well in this case the one way nesting was sufficient and no two way nesting was needed this finding was not surprising since the storm induced surface waves observed at this station mainly consisted of wind sea and swells the wind sea was generated by the local wind while swells were the waves propagated from the outer shelf of mass bay similar results were found on buoy 44020 in nantucket sound fig 6 right panel nantucket sound is bounded by cape cod on the north martha s vineyard on the southwest and nantucket island on the southeast the storm induced surface waves were much weaker in nantucket sound than those observed in mass bay even though the wind intensification was similar in these two regions the maximum significant wave height at buoy 44020 was about 3 0 m occurring around 00 00 uct december 27 the model reasonably captured the significant wave height and peak period as found at buoy 44013 the model predicted significant wave heights and peak periods were almost identical in both one way and two way nesting cases figs 7b and 8b the offline one way nesting used in necofs was operated using the same cluster nodes for both large and small domains and they were required to run one after another the one way nesting coupler on the esmf framework allowed the two domains to run simultaneously which could help maximize the use of the supercomputer nodes the two domain nesting approach enables one to increase the model grid spatial resolution near the coastal region with no significant sacrifice in computational efficiency particularly in the areas characterized with narrow water passages islands inlets and rivers an example is illustrated in fig 9 where snapshots of the distributions of the significant wave heights plus propagation directions in the mass bay boston harbor show the large fig 9a and small fig 9b domain model results the large domain model had a horizontal resolution of 300 m in the boston harbor area which failed to resolve numerous islands and complex irregular coastline in that area the small domain model had a horizontal resolution of 10 m which was sufficient to accurately capture those islands and irregular coastline due to the lack of the blocking mechanism by those solid obstacles the large domain model tended to produce a higher wave height in the harbor area the difference can be viewed more clearly at sites a outside of the harbor and b inside the harbor illustrated in fig 10 and table 1 the locations of sites a and b were shown in fig 9a the storm induced waves propagated towards the coast from the outer mass bay shelf at point a the wave heights predicted by the large domain and small domain models were close each other except at the time when the waves were highest at that time the simulated maximum wave was about 0 32 m higher in the small domain model than in the large domain model at point b however the simulated waves produced by the large domain model were generally about 0 37 m higher with a maximum difference up to 0 72 m this comparison clearly demonstrated a need to increase the model resolution in the coastal wave simulation and such a requisite can be efficiently achieved by a nested domain model approach 3 3 current and sea level comparisons the nesting approach also helped a model to resolve the complex spatial distribution of the currents inside boston harbor an example is shown in fig 11 for the comparison of the surface currents in the harbor area at 11 00 uct dec 27 2010 at that time currents outside of the harbor were dominated by the wind induced inflow but the water inside the harbor was flushed out in the large domain model fig 11a due to missing of islands inside the harbor the outflow was relative uniformly distributed nesting allowed the small domain model to include all islands inside the harbor as a result the outflow featured two strong current jets through the islands fig 11b although the total outflow transports obtained from large and small domain models were close to each other it is clear that the nesting model provided a more realistic flow pattern in the harbor area which is critically important for capturing the spatial distribution of the storm induced coastal inundation we also compared the observed water elevation with model simulated elevations predicted by the one way and two way nesting approaches at the boston harbor tidal gauge station 8443970 and the tide station in scituate harbor fig 12 note here that these two stations were not resolved in the large domain model it was not surprising that no significant difference was found in the model simulated elevations predicted by the one way and two way nesting approaches fig 13 since these two stations were located inside harbors which was far away from the nesting boundary tidal currents are periodic motions that were not affected by nesting if the tidal elevation is accurately given at the nesting boundary during the simulation period the onshore northeasterly wind prevailed with interacting with surface waves the wind pushed the water towards the coast on the nesting boundary the tidal currents were the same for both small and large domains and the wind induced subtidal flow was onshore so that no significant feedback flow from the small domain to large domain appeared 4 salinity plume simulation experiments the current wave interaction experiment described in section 3 was done under a nor easter storm during which the inflow was dominant in that case we found that the one way and two way nesting showed no significant differences in the results for the high resolution small domain model here we present the salinity plume case with the flow towards the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain illustrating the importance in having two way nesting two experiments were made for the salinity plume first we conducted the plume case with a point source over an idealized rectangular continental shelf with a constant depth and then a point source case in boston harbor configured with the nested mass bay fvcom and gom fvcom system 4 1 an idealized continental shelf the experiment was made over a constant depth idealized rectangular continental shelf with a length of 30 km and a width of 5 km to view the grid in the domain clearly the portion of the left 10 km computational domain are shown in fig 14 a and d experiments were made for the cases with 1 a single merged domain named the standard run solved without nesting 2 two domain solved through the one way nesting and 3 two domains solved through the two way nesting we assumed that the results from 1 are the true solution and the model performance for one way and two way nesting methods are evaluated through the comparison with the true solution obtained from the standard run the large domain model was configured with a resolution of 250 m in the almost whole domain except near the point source area where a resolution of 125 m was specified fig 14a the small domain models were configured with a resolution of 125 m everywhere except in the overlapping meshes zone connected to the nesting boundary with the large domain model fig 14b and c for the two way nesting experiments to examine the sensitivity of the model performance to the location of the nesting boundary we ran the model for two cases with different locations of the nesting boundary of the small domain to the large domain and named the cases case a and case b in case a fig 14b there were only two layers of overlapping cells beside the nesting boundary from the large domain to the small domain the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain is located at the second layer of overlapping cells in case b fig 14c there were five layers of overlapping cells the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain is located at the fifth layer of overlapping cells a single merged domain was constructed by the small domain in case a with the rest region filled using the large domain grid fig 14d in fig 14 the red dot in each figure was the location where the point source was specified the one way nesting experiment was run with the configuration of two domains like case a except that the feedback from the small domain to the large domain was turned off in all experiments both large domain and small domain models used uniform thickness layers with a total of 11 levels in the vertical the radiation boundary conditions were employed at the large domain open boundary initially a constant salinity of 30 psu was specified everywhere water with a salinity of 10 psu was discharged into the domain at a constant rate of 100 m3 s from the point source the nested model was integrated for 9 days the snapshots of the spatial distribution of model simulated surface salinity which were predicted from the standard run with a single merged grid without nesting at the end of 3 and 9 days were shown in fig 15 a and e respectively taking the standard run results as true solution an assessment was done for one way and two way nesting methods through comparing their results with the true solution the comparison results clearly showed that the simulated surface salinity through the one way nesting led to a significant bias around the nesting boundary and in the large domain region fig 15b and f sites a and b in fig 15b and f were the locations where the maximum errors appeared at the nesting boundary at the end of 3 and 9 days respectively at these two sites the simulated salinity started deviating from the true solution after the 12 hour simulation time and maximum deviation reached 0 29 at site a and 0 21 at site b after 9 day simulation time fig 16 the error reduced significantly when the two way nesting was turned on in both case a and case b the simulated surface salinity exhibited the almost same distribution and values in the entire computational domain including at the nesting boundary fig 15c g for case a and fig 15d h for case b at site a and site b the maximum deviation errors were 0 02 in case a and 0 06 in case b showing the error reduction of 93 and 79 respectively compared with the one way nesting case fig 16 a statistical analysis of the errors was presented through the taylor diagram shown in fig 17 where the rmsd and correlation coefficients of the comparison results of the one way and two way nesting model runs with the single merged domain standard model run were presented it is clear that in the one way nesting case the water in the small domain was blocked when it entered the nesting zone with grid refinement in the small domain the model simulated structure of the low salinity plume in the small domain significantly differed from that produced by the large domain model in the one way nesting case as the integration time becomes longer when the plume s edge reached the nesting boundary the velocity sea level and salinity produced by the small domain model differed from the boundary conditions provided by the large domain model as a result the water was blocked near the nesting boundary which clearly appeared in the distribution of the salinity by merging the large and small domain model results fig 15b and f this block disappeared when the two way nesting was used fig 15c and g the two way nesting not only included a feedback boundary condition from the small domain model to the large domain model but also adjusted the boundary forcing to the small domain the two way nesting method developed in the fvcom on the esmf framework performed well to avoid the mass accumulation at the nesting boundary this example illustrates the need for having a two way nesting in addition to demonstrating how well this method performed the comparison results for case a and case b clearly show that the location of the nesting boundary from the small domain to the large domain affects less to the distribution of the salinity the simple merged domain case fig 14d for true resolution was designed based on case a the comparison between this true resolution and case b is not reasonable this comparison only illustrated that the configuration for case a is simple and efficient with enough accuracy 4 2 a realistic geometric case in boston harbor necofs has setup a fvcom inundation model for mass bay named mass bay fvcom with the small domain grid shown in fig 4c this small domain model is being operated by one way nesting with the regional gom fvcom in necofs we used this nested model to repeat the point source experiments conducted in section 4 1 to see how the one way and two way nesting methods in the fvcom performed in a realistic geometric domain case the fvcom inundation model for mass bay hereafter referred to as the small domain model was configured with a horizontal resolution varying from 10 m to 500 m and a total of 11 uniform thickness sigma levels in the vertical the red and green lines shown in fig 4c had the same definitions as those shown in fig 3b the nested model was run by injecting low salinity water as a point source at the location marked with a red dot in fig 4c for the one way and two way nesting approaches respectively a constant salinity of 30 psu was specified everywhere initially then low salinity water with a constant salinity of 10 psu was injected at a rate of 2000 m3 s into the domain from the point source the simulation was conducted for a period of 3 days the tide was included in this case as was found in the idealized rectangular continental shelf case the one way nesting approach caused the low salinity plume water to be blocked when it entered the nesting boundary zone fig 18 b mismatching of the salinity between small and large domain models rapidly increased as the integration time became larger this error disappeared when two way nesting was applied grid refinement in the small domain model captured complex islands in boston harbor which produced significant spatial variability of the low salinity plume in the small domain the spatial distribution and intensity of the flow and salinity plume produced by the small domain model considerably differed from those in the large domain model fig 18a the mismatch of velocity and salinity between large and small domain models in the nesting boundary zone caused the blocking phenomenon and a gap of the salinity in that region fig 18b there was no question that in such a case the two way nesting was required fig 18c selecting the transect indicated in fig 18a we plotted the vertical distribution of the salinity for the case runs with a single large domain and nested small large domain fig 19 in the nested small large domain model runs we included the results for the one way fig 19b and two way fig 19c experiments as we described above the simulated salinity from the single large domain model run was not comparable with the nested small domain model runs since it failed to resolve the detailed geometry in the inshore area of the harbor fig 19b comparing the salinity distribution shown in fig 19b for one way nesting and in fig 19c for two way nesting we did see that in the one way nesting case blocking at the nesting boundary tended to produce a large along transect salinity gradient inside the small domain the two way nesting case accounted for the feedback from the small domain to the large domain as a result the salinity plume was carried out of the small domain producing an enhanced halocline in the large domain region in turn the horizontal salinity gradient in the small domain reduced 5 summary and discussion the fvcom was implemented into the esmf framework to set up the one way and two way nesting modules for the unstructured grid based fvcom these modules made fvcom utilize the community coupler for the multi domain nesting application with the esmf fvcom can be used to establish a multi domain nested model system without offline data interpolating and remapping the esmf based two way nesting method coded in fvcom was designed with conserved properties in data transition this approach can efficiently use the supercomputer computational nodes by running larger and smaller domain models simultaneously with boundary conditions exchange experiments were made to evaluate the performance of the one way and two way nesting methods the results not only demonstrated that the nesting methods in fvcom under the esmf framework worked well but also provided us insight into critical issues in selections of one way and two way nesting for storm induced storm surge application since the wind induced flow was onshore no matter if one way or two way nesting was used the nested model performed well for a salinity plume case however the water movement was featured by an outflow in this case the one way nesting could lead to a water blocking feature at the nesting boundary so that two way nesting should be used in general for a long term simulation the two way nesting should be used to keep the conservative property in the model for a short term simulation the one way nesting could be used if the nesting boundary was set up in the region far away from the coast the success in implementing the esmf coupler has provided a tool to make fvcom more applicable to couple with other ocean and meteorological models acknowledgments this

24122,the columbia river cr estuary is characterized by high river discharge and strong tides that generate high velocity flows and sharp density gradients its dynamics strongly affects the coastal ocean circulation tidal straining in turn modulates the stratification in the estuary simulating the hydrodynamics of the cr estuary and plume therefore requires a multi scale model as both shelf and estuarine circulations are coupled such a model has to keep numerical dissipation as low as possible in order to correctly represent the plume propagation and the salinity intrusion in the estuary here we show that the 3d baroclinic discontinuous galerkin finite element model slim 3d is able to reproduce the main features of the cr estuary to ocean continuum we introduce new vertical discretization and mode splitting that allow us to model a region characterized by complex bathymetry and sharp density and velocity gradients our model takes into account the major forcings i e tides surface wind stress and river discharge on a single multi scale grid the simulation period covers the end of spring early summer of 2006 a period of high river flow and strong changes in the wind regime slim 3d is validated with in situ data on the shelf and at multiple locations in the estuary and compared with an operational implementation of selfe the model skill in the estuary and on the shelf indicate that slim 3d is able to reproduce the key processes driving the river plume dynamics such as the occurrence of bidirectional plumes or reversals of the inner shelf coastal currents keywords unstructured mesh multi scale model river to ocean continuum plume dynamics columbia river estuary 1 introduction the columbia river cr is the main river of the western coast of north america its discharge is on average around 8 10 3 m 3 s and regularly exceeds 10 4 m 3 s the cr estuary alternates between a moderately and a strongly stratified system based on the estuary classification scheme of geyer and maccready 2014 kärnä and baptista 2016a identified four dominant regimes corresponding to a combination of high low flow and spring neap tidal conditions the cr is a mesotidal river with a maximum tidal range varying from 1 7 m to 3 8 m these characteristics induce large surface velocities and density fronts at the mouth during ebbs water outflowing from the cr mouth spreads into the pacific ocean forming a river plume horner devine et al 2009 split this complex body into four main water masses the source water and the tidal re circulating and far field plumes the source water is the estuarine low salinity water detaching from the ground to create the plume the tidal plume is the pulse of brackish waters outflowing from the mouth of the estuary every ebb tide with a timescale of 6 12 hours the re circulating plume also called the bulge is the near field part of the plume waters on the shelf mostly driven by the coriolis force and the river momentum flux these waters stay on the shelf for a period of 0 5 4 days the far field plume is the discharged waters beyond the re circulating plume generating the coastal currents with a retention timescale of roughly 1 week the development of the three coastal plume regions can be observed under low wind conditions strong winds can significantly modify the re circulating and far field plumes dynamics the ekman theory states that wind driven coastal upwelling resp downwelling is generated in the northern hemisphere when the coast lays left resp right of the wind blowing direction as the surface water moves offshore it is replaced by water that wells up from below a process known as coastal upwelling this creates major changes in the development of the plume as reversals in wind lead to rapid changes in the plume orientation fiedler and laurs 1990 garcia berdeal et al 2002 hickey et al 2005 downwelling favorable winds tend to enhance and narrow the northern coastal current erasing the re circulating plume sufficiently strong southward upwelling favorable winds erode the coastal current and drive the extended plume offshore the plume has a significant influence on the biochemical processes occurring on the shelf the cr plume provides a habitat for pacific salmon affects plankton growth advects primary production offshore and is partly responsible for the higher primary production off the washington coast compared to the oregon coast where the wind regime suggests stronger upwelling south of the cr mouth hickey and banas 2003 burla et al 2010 davis et al 2014 giddings et al 2014 phillips et al 2017 the presence of the cr plume also increases the cross shelf transport of nutrient rich upwelled waters hickey et al 2009 accurate modeling of the cr coastal ocean dynamics is fundamental to fully understand its implications on the california current system and its ecosystem the challenge of modeling the cr plume dynamics arises from the strong coupling with the estuarine dynamics the presence of sharp gradients of bathymetry velocity and density and the dependence to external forcings such as tides winds or river discharges earlier numerical modeling studies of the cr estuary and adjacent coastal sea have been carried out by means of three dimensional circulation models after successfully simulating the whole estuary to plume dynamics of the cr with elcirc zhang and baptista 2004 zhang et al 2004 baptista et al 2005 zhang and baptista 2008 produced better results in the cr estuary by using selfe an unstructured mesh model that allows more geometrical flexibility than elcirc this model reproduced the circulation of the estuary and coastal region enabling a good representation of the plume and coastal up down welling burla et al 2010 selfe skill has been mostly assessed and quantified within the estuary kärnä et al 2015 kärnä and baptista 2016a there have been fewer applications of selfe to model the plume variability burla et al 2010 in maccready et al 2009 another successful representation of the global hydrodynamics in this region is described using roms haidvogel et al 2000 further skill assessment for this model was carried both on the shelf and in the estuary liu et al 2009b one major issue of selfe is the inability to represent the complete gravitational circulation causing the model to underestimate salinity intrusion under neap tides conditions kärnä et al 2015 the numerical dissipation prevents to capture the sharp stratification lopez and baptista 2017 highlight the difficulty of the selfe sediment module to reproduce the sediment dynamics as the stratification is one of the key process at stake furthermore this dissipation is detrimental on the shelf where the sharp fronts of the plume are smoothed out this prevents capturing small scale variability of the plume despite high mesh resolution major issues with roms are the use of structured grids the approximation of the upper river by a long straight channel and the need to strongly smooth the bathymetry leading to a spurious deepening of the estuarine channels maccready et al 2009 a better model would tackle major issues of both models low numerical dissipation and unstructured multi scale mesh here we use the three dimensional version of the second generation louvain la neuve ice ocean model slim 3d http www climate be slim to simulate the columbia river to sea continuum slim is an unstructured mesh discontinuous galerkin finite element model the depth averaged 2d version of slim has been applied to a variety of coastal areas including the great barrier reef lambrechts et al 2008 thomas et al 2014 the scheldt estuary de brye et al 2010 the congo river le bars et al 2016 the mahakam river de brye et al 2011 pham van et al 2016 and even a lake on titan vincent et al 2016 the main drawback of discontinuous galerkin dg methods is the larger number of degrees of freedom per element which results in a higher computational cost than continuous galerkin cg methods the data structure of dg methods however makes them better suited to parallel computing architectures here we use the 3d baroclinic version of slim it solves the hydrostatic equations under boussinesq approximation white et al 2008 blaise et al 2010 comblen et al 2010 kärnä et al 2013 in order to include a realistic large scale ocean circulation in the model we have improved slim 3d by adding z layers boundary conditions with stratified density and velocity fields and an improved mode splitting algorithm the goal of this study is to model the cr plume and estuary by means of slim 3d provide a qualitative and quantitative validation against sets of observations in the estuary and on the shelf and compare slim 3d to an operational implementation of selfe we first evaluate the ability of slim 3d to simulate all major hydrodynamical regimes of the cr estuary and plume we then study the evolution of the cr plume under realistic wind conditions data and methods are detailed in section 2 the model is then validated against a large set of observations and compared to selfe section 3 which helps us gain insight on the cr plume variability section 4 discussion and perspectives for future work are in section 5 2 material and methods slim 3d is a hydrodynamical model solving the 3d hydrostatic equations under boussinesq approximation by means of a discontinuous galerkin discretization it has been validated against a number of idealized baroclinic test cases kärnä et al 2013 as well as for fine sediments dynamics in a very shallow semi open basin in the great barrier reef delandmeter et al 2015 both cases consisted in a rather shallow area with a smooth bathymetry the cr study is the first attempt to apply slim 3d to a complex river estuary plume system that includes a shelf break compared to the previous version of slim 3d delandmeter et al 2015 the main improvements are enhanced flexibility in the generation of the vertical grid as explained in section 2 3 slim 3d now enables any user defined vertical grids terrain following staircase like z or any combination of it depth dependent boundary conditions at the open boundaries before the present study only depth integrated tidal transport or river discharges could be imposed new mode splitting formulation based on the work of higdon and de szoeke 1997 the 2d external mode equations have been simplified by keeping only the coriolis and the external pressure gradient terms all the other terms are merged together in a vertically averaged force term the current formulation of slim 3d and all the implementation details are presented below 2 1 numerical model slim 3d solves the 3d hydrostatic equations under boussinesq approximation 1 u

variables are the horizontal velocity u the vertical velocity w the pressure p the surface elevation η the salinity s and the temperature t the symbol h stands for the horizontal gradient operator the equation for the pressure results from the hydrostatic hypothesis the equation of state from jackett et al 2006 is used for the density ρ s t while ρ 0 1027 kg m 3 is the constant reference density the material parameters are the coriolis frequency f the horizontal and vertical viscosities νh and ν and the horizontal and vertical diffusivities for κh and κ horizontal viscosity νh follows the smagorinsky 1963 parametrization with c d 0 02 vertical eddy viscosity ν and diffusivity κ are determined from the k ϵ turbulence closure model of gotm that is coupled to slim 3d kärnä et al 2012 with canuto a stability functions canuto et al 2001 the bottom friction is computed with the law of the wall assuming a logarithmic profile of velocity the bottom roughness length z 0 is set constant to 5 10 4 m in the previous version of slim 3d fast propagating gravity waves were represented by the traditional two dimensional depth integrated shallow water equations until now the splitting between 2d and 3d equations was not exact for example the manning coefficient of the 2d bottom stress parametrization does not perfectly match the value computed with the law of the wall in 3d this leads to a mismatch between the 2d and 3d modes constraining the conformity between modes smooths the velocity field and the model tends to be too dissipative to correctly represent complex baroclinic flows following higdon and de szoeke 1997 we adapted the model formulation such that the mode splitting becomes exact all the 3d forcing and coupling terms are now gathered together into a single term

ringler et al 2013 2 2 bathymetry and forcing data the bathymetry fig 1 is constructed from various data sets including etopo2v2 and local survey data see kärnä et al 2015 for details a minimal depth of 3 m is prescribed as wetting and drying processes are not taken into account the methodology is the same as in maccready et al 2009 the estuary is characterized by two major deep channels merging close to the mouth in a shallow estuary see fig 1 the north channel is flood dominant the south channel is ebb dominant the latter is the main driver of the freshwater discharge as shallow areas prevent the connection between the north channel and the upstream estuary at the end of the ebb chawla et al 2008 the velocity and elevation boundary conditions are obtained by combining 13 tidal constituents of the elevation and currents from osu topex poseidon global inverse solution tpxo7 2 dataset egbert and erofeeva 2002 with global circulation model hycom subtidal elevations and baroclinic velocities to construct a flather condition on the open ocean boundaries open ocean boundary conditions for salinity and temperature also come from the global 1 12 hycom reanalysis chassignet et al 2007 initial values of salinity and temperature are interpolated from the hycom data on the shelf and vary linearly in the estuary toward in situ measurements at the upstream boundary the choice of the upstream limit of the computational domain beaver army terminal comes from the availability of the river discharge and temperature collected from a usgs adcp at this location in summer less than 1 of the river flow comes from downstream tributaries maccready et al 2009 water is known to be entirely fresh there the wind speed at 10 m above sea level and the atmospheric pressure are obtained from the noaa ncep north american mesoscale nam forecast system with a resolution of 12 km the bulk formula from smith and banke 1975 is used to derive the wind stress to force the top surface boundary of the momentum equation the heat flux is parametrized with a relaxation boundary condition toward the sea surface temperature from hycom and a relaxation time of half a day evaporation and precipitation are negligible compared to the water discharge and hence not taken into account the fluvial and atmospheric conditions are represented in fig 2 panel a shows the river discharge as measured at beaver army terminal the outflow is at its highest during the spring freshet period panel b of fig 2 shows the water elevation at noaa station located at astoria or tpoin see section 2 4 for details the tidal signal alternates between neap and spring panel c shows the wind velocity data from nam model at rice station see fig 1 for location two periods of downwelling favorable winds i and ii are shadowed the impact of such conditions on the plume dynamics is studied in section 4 the simulation runs from april 30 until july 1 2006 and its analysis starts on may 15 as most of the estuarine water mass is flushed out in about 7 days kärnä and baptista 2016b the analysis is performed after a two week spin up period 2 3 computational domain the mesh spans the columbia river to sea continuum from beaver army terminal located 85 km upstream of the river mouth to a distance of about 150 km offshore and 200 km alongshore in the pacific ocean fig 3 the 3d mesh is created in two steps a 2d unstructured horizontal mesh is first generated for the whole z 0 surface with gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 each triangle is then vertically extruded to obtain a 3d mesh made up of prisms the mesh is structured in the z direction where all lateral facets are strictly vertical the 2d mesh is made up of 1 22 104 elements with a resolution ranging from 400 m to 10 km with the finer mesh located in the estuary and a smooth transition from fine resolution near the coast to a coarser resolution in the open ocean fig 3 the use of unstructured meshes provides tools to include both small scale estuarine processes and large scale shelf circulation within a single model with neither nudging nor nesting for the vertical extrusion there are three major types of vertical grids staircase like z terrain following or isopycnal coordinates terrain following coordinates precisely follow the exact bathymetry but need a uniform number of vertical cells over the domain or the connection of one prism with two others and suffer from a lack of resolution near the surface they also introduce internal pressure gradients errors haney 1991 with z coordinates the problems are inverted the bathymetry is poorly represented unless a very large number of layers is used but no specific treatment is needed for the pressure gradient in order to benefit from both discretization slim 3d allows for the use of hybrid grids terrain following for shallow regions to correctly represent the bathymetry and staircase below for deeper areas to avoid pressure gradient related errors the mesh is constructed such that haney s hydrostatic consistency criterion is satisfied for all truncated elements haney 1991 in the present cr benchmark the vertical extrusion of the 2d mesh is done over 8 terrain following levels in shallow regions depth 150 m see top right panels in fig 3 to increase the near surface resolution the depth of each level is saturated as a maximal thickness is prescribed for each layer layers are located at most 0 5 1 3 5 12 30 60 and 150 m below the surface below those layers up to 7 z layers are added to fit the bathymetry at 250 400 800 1200 1700 2300 3000 m below the surface the whole grid is made up of about 105 prismatic elements 2 4 in situ observations time series of water elevation are collected at the following national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa tidal gauges astoria tongue point or tpoin located in the south channel and skamokawa wa skaw1 located upstream in the river tidal gauges are highlighted in cyan in fig 1 time series of salinity and temperature are collected at stations from the saturn network managed by the center for coastal margin observation and prediction baptista et al 2015 the analysis of salinity and temperature is performed at 4 saturn stations in the estuary dsdma 7 3 m sandi 7 9 m red26 7 5 m and tansy 8 4 m and 2 on the shelf ogi01 0 8 5 11 and 50 m and saturn02 1 5 and 17 m three moorings were deployed on the shelf close to the cr mouth during the rise river influence on shelf ecosystem project see hickey et al 2010 and references therein all moorings are located on the 72 m isobath rice off the river mouth rino about 100 km north of the mouth and riso about 70 km south see fig 1 temperature and salinity are recorded at several depths 1 and 20 m for all and 5 m only for rice the pointwise plume depth is computed at two locations to compare with observations ogi01 a buoy from the saturn observation network located along the 100 m isobath 30 km southwest of the cr mouth and saturn02 a saturn endurance station located just downstream the river mouth the plume profile over the depth is obtained by linearly interpolating the data over the vertical the plume depth is the part above the 26 isohaline 2 5 error metrics the quantitative assessment of the model skill is similar to kärnä and baptista 2016a intuitive metrics such as bias and root mean square error rmse have the same units as the variable and hence facilitate the interpretation of the results the rmse still suffers from the presence of outliers and is scale dependent in order to compare metrics between variables at different scales an additional metric is computed the normalized root mean square error nmse the latter is zero for a perfect model one for a model with an error equal to the observed variability and greater than one for models that yield an error larger than observed variability the definition is similar to the murphy 1988 score if the mean of the observations is taken as the reference the model skill can be summarized by drawing normalized taylor diagrams taylor 2001 where the radial coordinate is the model standard deviation normalized by the standard deviation of the observations nsd and the angular coordinate is arccos c o r r with corr the pearson correlation coefficient on this diagram the normalized centered root mean square ncrmse appears as a radial distance from the position of a perfect model radius 1 angle 0 the metrics we consider are defined as follows bias m o rmse 1 n i 1 n o i m i 2 ncrmse 1 n 1 σ o 2 i 1 n m i m o i o 2 nmse rmse 2 σ o 2 nsd 1 n 1 σ o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 corr i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where oi and mi are the observed and modeled values at time step i respectively and y and σ y 2 stand for the mean and variance of y as the taylor diagram is based on centered signals the analysis is complemented with a bias nmse plot the error metrics are also computed for db33 the most recent longterm hindcast database output from selfe kärnä et al 2015 2 6 plume metrics understanding the space time evolution of the plume can be difficult as its 3d shape rapidly changes with wind conditions we therefore consider the metric of burla et al 2010 to easily visualize the global plume dynamics by integrating the 3d salinity field over space we generate time series for the volume surface area thickness and centroid location of the plume following horner devine et al 2009 the s t 26 salinity threshold delimiting the re circulating plume from the far field plume is chosen for these definitions this cutoff is sufficiently small to differentiate the cr plume from ocean waters and other freshwater sources the estuaries are not taken into account for the plume metrics the plume area defines the ocean water surface with a salinity below st in the same sense we define the plume volume as the sum of the volumes of each prism which mean salinity is below the threshold the mean plume thickness is simply the ratio of the plume volume to its area in addition to the latter thickness the depth of the plume is assessed at stations ogi01 and saturn02 tracking the location of the plume can be assessed by computing the surface plume centroid this is the area weighted mean of the center of each surface plume triangle x s s s t x d γ s s t d γ where γ is the top surface of the computational domain and x is the position vector of the center of each triangle this metric cannot show the occurrence of a bidirectional plume as it is only a single point but may give an idea of the predominance of one plume direction to the other 3 model validation the error metrics defined in section 2 are used to evaluate the model skill for the elevation salinity and temperature the validation distinguishes between estuary and shelf stations the salinity intrusion in the estuary is caused by both tidal pumping and gravitational circulation chawla et al 2008 during floods tidal straining brings salty water in the estuary channels de boer et al 2008 major ebb currents then flush most of the salinity downstream while minor ebb currents allow for salinity retention the top layer of the river remains relatively fresh at all times even during major flood tides as freshwater outflow still drives the top of each water column in numerical models the salinity retention and gravitational circulation are often underestimated due the challenging complexity of the area especially during neap tides kärnä and baptista 2016a in this section we first validate slim 3d simulations in the estuary using the indicators defined in section 3 1 the spatial evolution of the cr plume can exhibit a strong variability at time scales of a few days see northward wind periods i and ii in fig 2 largely driven by changes in wind direction hickey et al 1998 liu et al 2009a burla et al 2010 shorter wind fluctuations over just one day are also observed e g on may 8 and 16 in fig 2 but have a weaker impact on the plume those fluctuations can be strong in late spring and early summer the cr plume is strongly affected by these changes as ekman transport dominates the dynamics of the upper layer of the coastal ocean the ability of slim 3d to capture the plume dynamics is assessed by means of comparison with in situ observations in section 3 2 a comparison to existing models of the coupled cr estuary plume using roms and selfe is also performed roms results come from the rise project maccready et al 2009 liu et al 2009b and selfe results are extracted from the most recent longterm database called db33 kärnä et al 2015 the comparison is not direct as settings and forcings are not the same in all models we list here major differences between those models both domains covered by selfe and roms spread over a larger part of the pacific ocean selfe and roms are nudged toward global navy coastal ocean model ncom whereas slim 3d is forced only at the boundaries with hycom model outputs roms and selfe use bulk formula to compute heat fluxes whereas a relaxation to the sst is used in slim 3d horizontal spatial resolution in the plume region ranges between 1 and 10 km for slim 3d between 200 m and 2 km for selfe and 400 m for roms in the vertical direction roms and selfe both use s coordinates haidvogel et al 2000 there are 20 levels in roms and 37 levels in selfe 17 z levels are added below 100 m in the latter by comparison slim 3d only use 8 terrain following cells and 7 z levels below 150 m despite the lower resolution the low order heat flux parametrization and the absence of relaxation to the external global model we investigate how well slim 3d compares with the other two models 3 1 estuarine dynamics validation the dominant tidal features in the estuary are well reproduced by the slim 3d as shown in fig 4 the model skill at sandi station proves the good representation of the flow exchanges between the estuary and the shelf all stations show that the peaks of salinity intrusion during flood tides are well captured by the model the ebb flushing is somewhat overestimated as the predicted salinity is slightly below observations fig 4 fig 5 summarizes the values of several error metrics for water levels temperature and salinity at different estuarine stations on a taylor diagram and a nmse versus normalized bias plot all skill metrics are listed in table a 1 slim 3d represents well the elevation in the estuary and achieves a nmse of less than 0 1 the overall correlation is close to 1 0 98 all data points fall within the 0 25 ncrmse circle this good model skill is comparable to that of selfe the model reproduces the bottom salinity and temperature evolutions with good skill at all stations with a rmse of about 5 for the salinity and about 1 c for the temperature the nmse is small for both variables between 0 27 and 0 48 correlations are also high with a minimal value of 0 82 all stations are located close to the river mouth and in the south channel producing a good performance there confirms that slim 3d is well suited to represent the exchanges between the river and the ocean compared to selfe we obtain slightly higher bias and nmse for the salinity skill metrics for temperature are better with slim 3d than selfe in the estuary slim 3d also achieves slightly better skill than roms salinity correlations of 0 91 vs 0 88 at dsdma 0 91 vs 0 90 at red26 0 88 vs 0 84 at sandi see liu et al 2009b for details even though the metrics are not directly comparable as the simulated time periods are different 3 2 plume dynamics validation in order to assess the quality of the simulations over the shelf the salinity signal observed at rise stations is compared to model results fig 6 shows that slim 3d simulations solid lines represent all the major events recorded in the observations dotted lines at northern station rino the two major brackish water events recorded around june 7 and june 19 are well reproduced by the model predicted values slightly overestimate freshness at the surface red 1 m depth during the first event and underestimate the second one by only 10 interestingly the plume signature is not visible at rino when wind is downwelling favorable northward although the plume is spreading to the north the plume spreads shoreward of the mooring and is thinner than the inner shelf delimited by the 72 m isobath the decrease in salinity is observed a few days after wind reversals as the plume detaches from the washington coast and reaches the station slim 3d proves capable of capturing this upwelling induced detachment even though the decrease in salinity is less sharp by comparison selfe response to the event starts earlier and the amplitude is less intense the major event around june 15 observed at the southern station riso is also well captured in terms of the amplitude and the duration while slim 3d predictions show a one day time lag at rice the station close to the river mouth the signal variability is stronger because it is influenced by the near field tidal plume the model correctly represents the stratification for most of the period under consideration the absence of brackish water at the end of may is well reproduced although the model predicts a non recorded brackish water event at the beginning of june on the bottom panel of fig 6 a closer view of salinity at rice confirms that slim 3d can predict the amplitude of tidal induced oscillations of the salinity as well as slower changes in figs 7 and 8 skill metrics of slim 3d are detailed with red circles on a taylor diagram and a plot of the nmse versus the bias all skill metrics are listed in table a 2 for salinity the biases and rmse are small except at 1 meter depth where the variability is strong almost all nmse are below 1 fig 7 red circles this proves that slim 3d errors are below the variability of the measurements for temperature slim 3d skill is good but all stations seem to underestimate the temperature fig 8 red circles as opposed to selfe that has almost only positive biases burla et al 2010 reported poor correlation between modeled and observed salinities at rice station due to the inability of selfe to reproduce the small scale variability in the bulge the metrics shown in fig 7 blue circles prove that selfe skill on the shelf has strongly improved with db33 kärnä et al 2015 a direct comparison of skill metrics shows that slim 3d has a better skill on the shelf in predicting the salinity biases and nmse are smaller at almost every stations and depths selfe predictions seem to underestimate salinity at every station the comparison for the temperature is favorable to selfe in term of bias but the nmse are comparable and correlations favor slim 3d the maximal value of nmse of slim 3d is 2 48 for temperature and 1 69 for salinity by comparison selfe db33 nmse exceed these values at several stations and depths with worse values at ogi01 50 m 12 96 for salinity 4 57 for temperature only a single value of correlation obtained with slim 3d is below 0 42 0 22 for temperature at ogi01 50 m deep several correlations obtained with selfe lie below this value with even a value close to 0 0 04 for temperature at rice 20 m deep the plume thickness estimation at station ogi01 and saturn02 is obtained by linearly interpolating the measurements at recorded depths 0 8 5 11 and 50 m for ogi01 and 1 5 and 20 m for saturn02 the 26 salinity threshold time series are scattered against the simulated values in fig 9 at ogi01 the absence of the plume at the end of may and at the beginning of june is well represented by the model the time of appearance 06 08 also matches the observations predicted thickness slightly differs the model misses the disappearance of the plume around mid june the predicted salinity remains just below the 26 salinity threshold defined in section 2 6 although the observed data are just above this value the onset and vanishing plumes at this station are correctly estimated by the model at the end of june at saturn02 correlation between predicted and observed plume thickness is stronger the thickness grows around mid june and drops after june 20 at a smaller time scale the tidal amplitude is also correctly predicted 4 model application wind induced variability of the plume the cr plume dynamics is characterized by two major regimes in winter the freshwater flow leaving the cr estuary turns north due to the earth s rotation reinforced by downwelling favorable winds generating a thin plume attached to the washington coast in summer as the wind strongly blows southward due to the predominance of a high pressure anticyclone the plume is oriented in an offshore south west direction during spring summer the cr plume is known to be regularly split into two parts in this section we investigate the response of the plume to wind changes the wind direction is mostly southward during late spring and summer in the north east pacific region short wind reversals regularly happen interrupting the well established atmospheric conditions as shown in fig 2 the period may june 2006 is no exception as the wind mainly blows southward with short and long wind directional shifts for example wind shifts lasting less than a day happen around may 8 and may 16 while the period between may 21 to june 6 is almost continuously downwelling favorable the year 2006 is characterized by early spring transition large river discharge and early freshet hickey et al 2005 defined a data derived conceptual model of the bidirectional summer plume which is clearly depicted by the top panels of fig 10 describing the first downwelling event i the wide cr far field plume extends offshore in a south west direction as upwelling favorable winds blow strong 05 22 after about 2 days of downwelling favorable wind 05 24 the aged plume is driven toward the coast and a new plume emerges north of the river mouth the bulge turns north generating an along coast plume and the southerly plume is almost fully eroded within 4 days 05 26 the downwelling favorable winds constrict the plume along the washington coast but after several days and as wind intensity declines the plume starts widening 06 06 as soon as the wind blows from the north again the along coast plume detaches 06 10 and nearly vanishes 06 12 soon afterwards this plume evolution is in agreement with the conceptual model of hickey et al 2005 the bottom panels of fig 10 describe the second downwelling event ii the far field plume again extends in its summer common south west direction made up of a majority of primarily aged water originating from the plume along the washington coast 06 12 the wind regime once more changes and pushes the far field plume onshore and the bulge northward 06 16 the bulge quickly responds to form a coriolis driven near field plume 06 14 this downwelling favorable event is not strong enough to fully erode the southern plume hence both the oregon and washington coasts are connected to a brackish water plume 06 18 the southwest plume after period ii is a combination of aged plume waters from oregon coast medium aged plume waters from washington coast and new plume waters directly coming from the river mouth 06 22 the model snapshots show that unlike the conceptual model by hickey et al 2005 significant downwelling events may not be sufficient to fully erode the southern plume waters during late spring early summer both duration and intensity of the event impact the plume erosion on the oregon shelf in the literature selfe has been shown to produce similar patterns in the plume dynamics hickey et al 2009 fig 11 shows a comparison of the surface salinity predicted by three models of the cr estuary and shelf roms maccready et al 2009 liu et al 2009b slim 3d and selfe kärnä et al 2015 despite a coarser vertical and horizontal resolution slim 3d shows more lateral structures than selfe where fronts and gradients are smoothed out while the plume extensions predicted by all models are rather similar a major difference between simulations is the detachment from the washington coast on june 9 that is well captured by slim 3d and roms and not by selfe this detachment is a consequence of coastal upwelling which is correctly represented with slim 3d as forcings differ between models part of the differences is not directly related to the numerics of the model as explained in section 2 the plume centroid is defined as the geographic center of the plume its location is a good proxy for interpreting global movements of the cr plume fig 12 displays the 2d plume centroid trajectory colored by the plume thickness as defined in section 2 as expected for this season the plume location is mainly south west of the river mouth at an average distance of about 80 km fig 12 during the first three weeks of may the plume centroid mainly lies southwest of the cr mouth this feature is only modified by limited strong downwelling events slightly moving it north east the plume experiences a long excursion to the north between may 22 and june 12 fig 12 the first part of this period is characterized by strong downwelling favorable winds fig 2 period i which drives the plume northward the course of events is as follows first the plume quickly moves shoreward to reach the coast then it slowly continues up along the washington coast as long as winds favor downwelling after that as downwelling favorable wind intensity diminishes at the beginning of june during a storm the plume centroid moves west but remains off the washington shelf finally as upwelling favorable winds take over again the plume slowly moves southward and comes back to a position south west of the cr mouth further away than before the event similar patterns of atmospheric conditions occurred between june 12 and june 18 fig 10 the plume as estimated by the plume centroid location reacts less intensely a similar loop as the one described earlier is visible but the distance traveled is far smaller the centroid starts further away from the coast at the start of the event this means that the plume spreads over a larger area of the shelf a criterion based on this distance and the northward wind intensity may be defined to predict the full erosion of the plume off the oregon shelf as predicted by hickey et al 2005 those patterns are visible on the plume thickness at station ogi01 fig 9 the summer plume is present there during high discharge and southward wind conditions as the plume propagates southwestward or during low flow and frequent wind reversals as the plume grows close to the mouth the decrease in plume thickness at this station is correlated with northward wind as the wind blows southward blue the plume grows at ogi01 while it disappears if northward winds events red remain strong enough and or last long enough the simulated presence of the plume at mid june corresponds to the underestimation of brackish water at riso fig 12 highlights the correlation between the plume thickness volume area and the plume location it reflects the rapid reaction of the plume to wind changes during upwelling favorable wind events the mean plume thickness is rather small 4 m as the cr plume spreads over a large area due to ekman transport and ambient stratification on the contrary northward winds push the plume toward the washington coast the cr plume is pressed against the coast weakening the stratification and deepening the plume in shallow shelf area north of the cr mouth as downward velocity advects surface water down the water column while moving northward during event i the plume centroid deepens with a mean thickness 4 m and decelerates for comparison the distance traveled by the centroid between may 22 and may 24 start of i is similar to the distance between may 24 and june 2 as its mean velocity drops tidal oscillations plays a significant role in its displacement the aforementioned behavior is described in detail by cole and hetland 2016 where the characteristics of vertical mixing in such plumes are discussed the plume area shows a strong correlation with the wind direction fig 13 during event i the plume area is smaller than average as the plume is driven to the coast in the days following period i the area grows again as the wind constrained plume propagates along the coast as soon as the wind turns the area covered by the plume increases sharply and the far field plume covers a larger part of the coastal ocean the drop during downwelling event ii is also due to the ekman transport toward the coast the area covered at the end of the upwelling favorable wind is still significant a large part being along the oregon coast by contrast the decrease at the end of june is a direct consequence of the drop of the river discharge as the centroid path suggested the plume area before the second event ii is far larger fig 12 this partly explains why the plume remains on the oregon shelf after the downwelling event as explained above the plume area and thickness evolve in exact opposite ways this feature is not surprising considering that wind changes do not significantly alter the plume volume the plume volume instead correlates with a time lag of a few days to the water discharge not shown as the bulge retains a significant part of the outgoing water burla et al 2010 showed that river discharge is the predominant factor of the interannual plume variability in may in their analysis of the sea surface salinity anomaly burla et al 2010 underscore that year 2006 exhibits saltier conditions than the climatological signal on both the washington and oregon shelves although the river discharge is not sensibly lower than average for that period coastal upwelling partly explains this feature due to the quasi uninterrupted long period of southward wind from the end of april until the last third of may the prolongated freshet impacted the plume evolution of the following june our study confirms the occurrence of bidirectional plumes see fig 10 in summer 2006 hickey and banas 2003 horner devine et al 2009 liu et al 2009a burla et al 2010 as upwelling favorable seasonal wind is often interrupted by wind reversals liu et al 2009a states that this behavior is representative of the majority of the 2004 summer season with a self organizing map som analysis an empirical orthogonal function eof analysis conducted over the period 1999 2006 by burla et al 2010 confirms the leading mode of variability in summer is bimodal and accounts for 51 of the variance downwelling favorable winds enhance the coriolis effect to the north of the emerging plume medium to strong upwelling events annihilate this feature and drives the majority of the plume offshore in the south west direction the mean california current further advects the plume to the south 5 discussion and conclusions coastal impact studies rely on accurate simulations of currents in the estuary and the coastal sea and their complex interactions the hydrodynamics is the foundation on which ecological or geochemical models are built in this study we describe the latest version of slim 3d a hydrodynamical model aimed at bridging the gap between the estuary and the coastal sea to suitably model such a complex continuum slim 3d offers several advantages 1 multi scale phenomena are simulated seamlessly in a single mesh model 2 the use of an unstructured mesh allows for a detailed representation of small scale features of the topography 3 the discontinuous galerkin formulation provides high accuracy and robustness for this advection dominated problem here we simulate the hydrodynamics of the cr estuary and coastal sea during may june 2006 a period characterized by high river discharge and strong changes in wind regime quantitative statistics evaluate the model skill and integrative metrics facilitate the analysis by highlighting the evolution of the cr plume in response to wind and river forcings the results show the ability of slim 3d to capture both the salinity intrusion in the estuary and the rapid response of the cr plume to wind reversals slim 3d is able to reproduce the offshore advection of the northern coastal plume at the beginning of upwelling favorable wind events the discontinuous galerkin numerical discretization allows slim 3d to handle gradients of bathymetry velocity and density with minimal numerical dissipation by introducing a new splitting between the 2d and 3d momentum equations we markedly improved the representation of large scale flow structures we observe that it reduces the dissipation as the coupling between internal and external modes is much more accurate our model stands the comparison with other models of the cr estuary plume dynamics inside the estuary slim 3d compares well to an operational implementation of selfe same mean correlation coefficient on the shelf slim 3d correctly represents the large scale flow structures despite using a rather coarse mesh resolution it correctly reproduces the occurrence of a bidirectional plume as well as the wind driven coastal upwelling these features favorably compare to those obtained with roms despite a finer mesh resolution selfe yields overly smoothed fronts and seems to underestimate upwelling based on this study and on our previous experience with the model we suggest that slim 3d skill is directly linked to the 2d 3d mode splitting procedure and to the discontinuous galerkin discretization the former notably reduces the level of numerical dissipation particularly for baroclinic processes the latter provides a high level of flexibility to resolve small scale processes even on relatively coarse meshes such a combination of a consistent model formulation with a flexible numerical scheme seems ideally suited to coastal applications acknowledgments v vallaeys visited ncf science and technology center for coastal margin observation and

24122,the columbia river cr estuary is characterized by high river discharge and strong tides that generate high velocity flows and sharp density gradients its dynamics strongly affects the coastal ocean circulation tidal straining in turn modulates the stratification in the estuary simulating the hydrodynamics of the cr estuary and plume therefore requires a multi scale model as both shelf and estuarine circulations are coupled such a model has to keep numerical dissipation as low as possible in order to correctly represent the plume propagation and the salinity intrusion in the estuary here we show that the 3d baroclinic discontinuous galerkin finite element model slim 3d is able to reproduce the main features of the cr estuary to ocean continuum we introduce new vertical discretization and mode splitting that allow us to model a region characterized by complex bathymetry and sharp density and velocity gradients our model takes into account the major forcings i e tides surface wind stress and river discharge on a single multi scale grid the simulation period covers the end of spring early summer of 2006 a period of high river flow and strong changes in the wind regime slim 3d is validated with in situ data on the shelf and at multiple locations in the estuary and compared with an operational implementation of selfe the model skill in the estuary and on the shelf indicate that slim 3d is able to reproduce the key processes driving the river plume dynamics such as the occurrence of bidirectional plumes or reversals of the inner shelf coastal currents keywords unstructured mesh multi scale model river to ocean continuum plume dynamics columbia river estuary 1 introduction the columbia river cr is the main river of the western coast of north america its discharge is on average around 8 10 3 m 3 s and regularly exceeds 10 4 m 3 s the cr estuary alternates between a moderately and a strongly stratified system based on the estuary classification scheme of geyer and maccready 2014 kärnä and baptista 2016a identified four dominant regimes corresponding to a combination of high low flow and spring neap tidal conditions the cr is a mesotidal river with a maximum tidal range varying from 1 7 m to 3 8 m these characteristics induce large surface velocities and density fronts at the mouth during ebbs water outflowing from the cr mouth spreads into the pacific ocean forming a river plume horner devine et al 2009 split this complex body into four main water masses the source water and the tidal re circulating and far field plumes the source water is the estuarine low salinity water detaching from the ground to create the plume the tidal plume is the pulse of brackish waters outflowing from the mouth of the estuary every ebb tide with a timescale of 6 12 hours the re circulating plume also called the bulge is the near field part of the plume waters on the shelf mostly driven by the coriolis force and the river momentum flux these waters stay on the shelf for a period of 0 5 4 days the far field plume is the discharged waters beyond the re circulating plume generating the coastal currents with a retention timescale of roughly 1 week the development of the three coastal plume regions can be observed under low wind conditions strong winds can significantly modify the re circulating and far field plumes dynamics the ekman theory states that wind driven coastal upwelling resp downwelling is generated in the northern hemisphere when the coast lays left resp right of the wind blowing direction as the surface water moves offshore it is replaced by water that wells up from below a process known as coastal upwelling this creates major changes in the development of the plume as reversals in wind lead to rapid changes in the plume orientation fiedler and laurs 1990 garcia berdeal et al 2002 hickey et al 2005 downwelling favorable winds tend to enhance and narrow the northern coastal current erasing the re circulating plume sufficiently strong southward upwelling favorable winds erode the coastal current and drive the extended plume offshore the plume has a significant influence on the biochemical processes occurring on the shelf the cr plume provides a habitat for pacific salmon affects plankton growth advects primary production offshore and is partly responsible for the higher primary production off the washington coast compared to the oregon coast where the wind regime suggests stronger upwelling south of the cr mouth hickey and banas 2003 burla et al 2010 davis et al 2014 giddings et al 2014 phillips et al 2017 the presence of the cr plume also increases the cross shelf transport of nutrient rich upwelled waters hickey et al 2009 accurate modeling of the cr coastal ocean dynamics is fundamental to fully understand its implications on the california current system and its ecosystem the challenge of modeling the cr plume dynamics arises from the strong coupling with the estuarine dynamics the presence of sharp gradients of bathymetry velocity and density and the dependence to external forcings such as tides winds or river discharges earlier numerical modeling studies of the cr estuary and adjacent coastal sea have been carried out by means of three dimensional circulation models after successfully simulating the whole estuary to plume dynamics of the cr with elcirc zhang and baptista 2004 zhang et al 2004 baptista et al 2005 zhang and baptista 2008 produced better results in the cr estuary by using selfe an unstructured mesh model that allows more geometrical flexibility than elcirc this model reproduced the circulation of the estuary and coastal region enabling a good representation of the plume and coastal up down welling burla et al 2010 selfe skill has been mostly assessed and quantified within the estuary kärnä et al 2015 kärnä and baptista 2016a there have been fewer applications of selfe to model the plume variability burla et al 2010 in maccready et al 2009 another successful representation of the global hydrodynamics in this region is described using roms haidvogel et al 2000 further skill assessment for this model was carried both on the shelf and in the estuary liu et al 2009b one major issue of selfe is the inability to represent the complete gravitational circulation causing the model to underestimate salinity intrusion under neap tides conditions kärnä et al 2015 the numerical dissipation prevents to capture the sharp stratification lopez and baptista 2017 highlight the difficulty of the selfe sediment module to reproduce the sediment dynamics as the stratification is one of the key process at stake furthermore this dissipation is detrimental on the shelf where the sharp fronts of the plume are smoothed out this prevents capturing small scale variability of the plume despite high mesh resolution major issues with roms are the use of structured grids the approximation of the upper river by a long straight channel and the need to strongly smooth the bathymetry leading to a spurious deepening of the estuarine channels maccready et al 2009 a better model would tackle major issues of both models low numerical dissipation and unstructured multi scale mesh here we use the three dimensional version of the second generation louvain la neuve ice ocean model slim 3d http www climate be slim to simulate the columbia river to sea continuum slim is an unstructured mesh discontinuous galerkin finite element model the depth averaged 2d version of slim has been applied to a variety of coastal areas including the great barrier reef lambrechts et al 2008 thomas et al 2014 the scheldt estuary de brye et al 2010 the congo river le bars et al 2016 the mahakam river de brye et al 2011 pham van et al 2016 and even a lake on titan vincent et al 2016 the main drawback of discontinuous galerkin dg methods is the larger number of degrees of freedom per element which results in a higher computational cost than continuous galerkin cg methods the data structure of dg methods however makes them better suited to parallel computing architectures here we use the 3d baroclinic version of slim it solves the hydrostatic equations under boussinesq approximation white et al 2008 blaise et al 2010 comblen et al 2010 kärnä et al 2013 in order to include a realistic large scale ocean circulation in the model we have improved slim 3d by adding z layers boundary conditions with stratified density and velocity fields and an improved mode splitting algorithm the goal of this study is to model the cr plume and estuary by means of slim 3d provide a qualitative and quantitative validation against sets of observations in the estuary and on the shelf and compare slim 3d to an operational implementation of selfe we first evaluate the ability of slim 3d to simulate all major hydrodynamical regimes of the cr estuary and plume we then study the evolution of the cr plume under realistic wind conditions data and methods are detailed in section 2 the model is then validated against a large set of observations and compared to selfe section 3 which helps us gain insight on the cr plume variability section 4 discussion and perspectives for future work are in section 5 2 material and methods slim 3d is a hydrodynamical model solving the 3d hydrostatic equations under boussinesq approximation by means of a discontinuous galerkin discretization it has been validated against a number of idealized baroclinic test cases kärnä et al 2013 as well as for fine sediments dynamics in a very shallow semi open basin in the great barrier reef delandmeter et al 2015 both cases consisted in a rather shallow area with a smooth bathymetry the cr study is the first attempt to apply slim 3d to a complex river estuary plume system that includes a shelf break compared to the previous version of slim 3d delandmeter et al 2015 the main improvements are enhanced flexibility in the generation of the vertical grid as explained in section 2 3 slim 3d now enables any user defined vertical grids terrain following staircase like z or any combination of it depth dependent boundary conditions at the open boundaries before the present study only depth integrated tidal transport or river discharges could be imposed new mode splitting formulation based on the work of higdon and de szoeke 1997 the 2d external mode equations have been simplified by keeping only the coriolis and the external pressure gradient terms all the other terms are merged together in a vertically averaged force term the current formulation of slim 3d and all the implementation details are presented below 2 1 numerical model slim 3d solves the 3d hydrostatic equations under boussinesq approximation 1 u

smagorinsky 1963 parametrization with c d 0 02 vertical eddy viscosity ν and diffusivity κ are determined from the k ϵ turbulence closure model of gotm that is coupled to slim 3d kärnä et al 2012 with canuto a stability functions canuto et al 2001 the bottom friction is computed with the law of the wall assuming a logarithmic profile of velocity the bottom roughness length z 0 is set constant to 5 10 4 m in the previous version of slim 3d fast propagating gravity waves were represented by the traditional two dimensional depth integrated shallow water equations until now the splitting between 2d and 3d equations was not exact for example the manning coefficient of the 2d bottom stress parametrization does not perfectly match the value computed with the law of the wall in 3d this leads to a mismatch between the 2d and 3d modes constraining the conformity between modes smooths the velocity field and the model tends to be too dissipative to correctly represent complex baroclinic flows following higdon and de szoeke 1997 we adapted the model formulation such that the mode splitting becomes exact all the 3d forcing and coupling terms are now gathered together into a single term

ringler et al 2013 2 2 bathymetry and forcing data the bathymetry fig 1 is constructed from various data sets including etopo2v2 and local survey data see kärnä et al 2015 for details a minimal depth of 3 m is prescribed as wetting and drying processes are not taken into account the methodology is the same as in maccready et al 2009 the estuary is characterized by two major deep channels merging close to the mouth in a shallow estuary see fig 1 the north channel is flood dominant the south channel is ebb dominant the latter is the main driver of the freshwater discharge as shallow areas prevent the connection between the north channel and the upstream estuary at the end of the ebb chawla et al 2008 the velocity and elevation boundary conditions are obtained by combining 13 tidal constituents of the elevation and currents from osu topex poseidon global inverse solution tpxo7 2 dataset egbert and erofeeva 2002 with global circulation model hycom subtidal elevations and baroclinic velocities to construct a flather condition on the open ocean boundaries open ocean boundary conditions for salinity and temperature also come from the global 1 12 hycom reanalysis chassignet et al 2007 initial values of salinity and temperature are interpolated from the hycom data on the shelf and vary linearly in the estuary toward in situ measurements at the upstream boundary the choice of the upstream limit of the computational domain beaver army terminal comes from the availability of the river discharge and temperature collected from a usgs adcp at this location in summer less than 1 of the river flow comes from downstream tributaries maccready et al 2009 water is known to be entirely fresh there the wind speed at 10 m above sea level and the atmospheric pressure are obtained from the noaa ncep north american mesoscale nam forecast system with a resolution of 12 km the bulk formula from smith and banke 1975 is used to derive the wind stress to force the top surface boundary of the momentum equation the heat flux is parametrized with a relaxation boundary condition toward the sea surface temperature from hycom and a relaxation time of half a day evaporation and precipitation are negligible compared to the water discharge and hence not taken into account the fluvial and atmospheric conditions are represented in fig 2 panel a shows the river discharge as measured at beaver army terminal the outflow is at its highest during the spring freshet period panel b of fig 2 shows the water elevation at noaa station located at astoria or tpoin see section 2 4 for details the tidal signal alternates between neap and spring panel c shows the wind velocity data from nam model at rice station see fig 1 for location two periods of downwelling favorable winds i and ii are shadowed the impact of such conditions on the plume dynamics is studied in section 4 the simulation runs from april 30 until july 1 2006 and its analysis starts on may 15 as most of the estuarine water mass is flushed out in about 7 days kärnä and baptista 2016b the analysis is performed after a two week spin up period 2 3 computational domain the mesh spans the columbia river to sea continuum from beaver army terminal located 85 km upstream of the river mouth to a distance of about 150 km offshore and 200 km alongshore in the pacific ocean fig 3 the 3d mesh is created in two steps a 2d unstructured horizontal mesh is first generated for the whole z 0 surface with gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 each triangle is then vertically extruded to obtain a 3d mesh made up of prisms the mesh is structured in the z direction where all lateral facets are strictly vertical the 2d mesh is made up of 1 22 104 elements with a resolution ranging from 400 m to 10 km with the finer mesh located in the estuary and a smooth transition from fine resolution near the coast to a coarser resolution in the open ocean fig 3 the use of unstructured meshes provides tools to include both small scale estuarine processes and large scale shelf circulation within a single model with neither nudging nor nesting for the vertical extrusion there are three major types of vertical grids staircase like z terrain following or isopycnal coordinates terrain following coordinates precisely follow the exact bathymetry but need a uniform number of vertical cells over the domain or the connection of one prism with two others and suffer from a lack of resolution near the surface they also introduce internal pressure gradients errors haney 1991 with z coordinates the problems are inverted the bathymetry is poorly represented unless a very large number of layers is used but no specific treatment is needed for the pressure gradient in order to benefit from both discretization slim 3d allows for the use of hybrid grids terrain following for shallow regions to correctly represent the bathymetry and staircase below for deeper areas to avoid pressure gradient related errors the mesh is constructed such that haney s hydrostatic consistency criterion is satisfied for all truncated elements haney 1991 in the present cr benchmark the vertical extrusion of the 2d mesh is done over 8 terrain following levels in shallow regions depth 150 m see top right panels in fig 3 to increase the near surface resolution the depth of each level is saturated as a maximal thickness is prescribed for each layer layers are located at most 0 5 1 3 5 12 30 60 and 150 m below the surface below those layers up to 7 z layers are added to fit the bathymetry at 250 400 800 1200 1700 2300 3000 m below the surface the whole grid is made up of about 105 prismatic elements 2 4 in situ observations time series of water elevation are collected at the following national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa tidal gauges astoria tongue point or tpoin located in the south channel and skamokawa wa skaw1 located upstream in the river tidal gauges are highlighted in cyan in fig 1 time series of salinity and temperature are collected at stations from the saturn network managed by the center for coastal margin observation and prediction baptista et al 2015 the analysis of salinity and temperature is performed at 4 saturn stations in the estuary dsdma 7 3 m sandi 7 9 m red26 7 5 m and tansy 8 4 m and 2 on the shelf ogi01 0 8 5 11 and 50 m and saturn02 1 5 and 17 m three moorings were deployed on the shelf close to the cr mouth during the rise river influence on shelf ecosystem project see hickey et al 2010 and references therein all moorings are located on the 72 m isobath rice off the river mouth rino about 100 km north of the mouth and riso about 70 km south see fig 1 temperature and salinity are recorded at several depths 1 and 20 m for all and 5 m only for rice the pointwise plume depth is computed at two locations to compare with observations ogi01 a buoy from the saturn observation network located along the 100 m isobath 30 km southwest of the cr mouth and saturn02 a saturn endurance station located just downstream the river mouth the plume profile over the depth is obtained by linearly interpolating the data over the vertical the plume depth is the part above the 26 isohaline 2 5 error metrics the quantitative assessment of the model skill is similar to kärnä and baptista 2016a intuitive metrics such as bias and root mean square error rmse have the same units as the variable and hence facilitate the interpretation of the results the rmse still suffers from the presence of outliers and is scale dependent in order to compare metrics between variables at different scales an additional metric is computed the normalized root mean square error nmse the latter is zero for a perfect model one for a model with an error equal to the observed variability and greater than one for models that yield an error larger than observed variability the definition is similar to the murphy 1988 score if the mean of the observations is taken as the reference the model skill can be summarized by drawing normalized taylor diagrams taylor 2001 where the radial coordinate is the model standard deviation normalized by the standard deviation of the observations nsd and the angular coordinate is arccos c o r r with corr the pearson correlation coefficient on this diagram the normalized centered root mean square ncrmse appears as a radial distance from the position of a perfect model radius 1 angle 0 the metrics we consider are defined as follows bias m o rmse 1 n i 1 n o i m i 2 ncrmse 1 n 1 σ o 2 i 1 n m i m o i o 2 nmse rmse 2 σ o 2 nsd 1 n 1 σ o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 corr i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where oi and mi are the observed and modeled values at time step i respectively and y and σ y 2 stand for the mean and variance of y as the taylor diagram is based on centered signals the analysis is complemented with a bias nmse plot the error metrics are also computed for db33 the most recent longterm hindcast database output from selfe kärnä et al 2015 2 6 plume metrics understanding the space time evolution of the plume can be difficult as its 3d shape rapidly changes with wind conditions we therefore consider the metric of burla et al 2010 to easily visualize the global plume dynamics by integrating the 3d salinity field over space we generate time series for the volume surface area thickness and centroid location of the plume following horner devine et al 2009 the s t 26 salinity threshold delimiting the re circulating plume from the far field plume is chosen for these definitions this cutoff is sufficiently small to differentiate the cr plume from ocean waters and other freshwater sources the estuaries are not taken into account for the plume metrics the plume area defines the ocean water surface with a salinity below st in the same sense we define the plume volume as the sum of the volumes of each prism which mean salinity is below the threshold the mean plume thickness is simply the ratio of the plume volume to its area in addition to the latter thickness the depth of the plume is assessed at stations ogi01 and saturn02 tracking the location of the plume can be assessed by computing the surface plume centroid this is the area weighted mean of the center of each surface plume triangle x s s s t x d γ s s t d γ where γ is the top surface of the computational domain and x is the position vector of the center of each triangle this metric cannot show the occurrence of a bidirectional plume as it is only a single point but may give an idea of the predominance of one plume direction to the other 3 model validation the error metrics defined in section 2 are used to evaluate the model skill for the elevation salinity and temperature the validation distinguishes between estuary and shelf stations the salinity intrusion in the estuary is caused by both tidal pumping and gravitational circulation chawla et al 2008 during floods tidal straining brings salty water in the estuary channels de boer et al 2008 major ebb currents then flush most of the salinity downstream while minor ebb currents allow for salinity retention the top layer of the river remains relatively fresh at all times even during major flood tides as freshwater outflow still drives the top of each water column in numerical models the salinity retention and gravitational circulation are often underestimated due the challenging complexity of the area especially during neap tides kärnä and baptista 2016a in this section we first validate slim 3d simulations in the estuary using the indicators defined in section 3 1 the spatial evolution of the cr plume can exhibit a strong variability at time scales of a few days see northward wind periods i and ii in fig 2 largely driven by changes in wind direction hickey et al 1998 liu et al 2009a burla et al 2010 shorter wind fluctuations over just one day are also observed e g on may 8 and 16 in fig 2 but have a weaker impact on the plume those fluctuations can be strong in late spring and early summer the cr plume is strongly affected by these changes as ekman transport dominates the dynamics of the upper layer of the coastal ocean the ability of slim 3d to capture the plume dynamics is assessed by means of comparison with in situ observations in section 3 2 a comparison to existing models of the coupled cr estuary plume using roms and selfe is also performed roms results come from the rise project maccready et al 2009 liu et al 2009b and selfe results are extracted from the most recent longterm database called db33 kärnä et al 2015 the comparison is not direct as settings and forcings are not the same in all models we list here major differences between those models both domains covered by selfe and roms spread over a larger part of the pacific ocean selfe and roms are nudged toward global navy coastal ocean model ncom whereas slim 3d is forced only at the boundaries with hycom model outputs roms and selfe use bulk formula to compute heat fluxes whereas a relaxation to the sst is used in slim 3d horizontal spatial resolution in the plume region ranges between 1 and 10 km for slim 3d between 200 m and 2 km for selfe and 400 m for roms in the vertical direction roms and selfe both use s coordinates haidvogel et al 2000 there are 20 levels in roms and 37 levels in selfe 17 z levels are added below 100 m in the latter by comparison slim 3d only use 8 terrain following cells and 7 z levels below 150 m despite the lower resolution the low order heat flux parametrization and the absence of relaxation to the external global model we investigate how well slim 3d compares with the other two models 3 1 estuarine dynamics validation the dominant tidal features in the estuary are well reproduced by the slim 3d as shown in fig 4 the model skill at sandi station proves the good representation of the flow exchanges between the estuary and the shelf all stations show that the peaks of salinity intrusion during flood tides are well captured by the model the ebb flushing is somewhat overestimated as the predicted salinity is slightly below observations fig 4 fig 5 summarizes the values of several error metrics for water levels temperature and salinity at different estuarine stations on a taylor diagram and a nmse versus normalized bias plot all skill metrics are listed in table a 1 slim 3d represents well the elevation in the estuary and achieves a nmse of less than 0 1 the overall correlation is close to 1 0 98 all data points fall within the 0 25 ncrmse circle this good model skill is comparable to that of selfe the model reproduces the bottom salinity and temperature evolutions with good skill at all stations with a rmse of about 5 for the salinity and about 1 c for the temperature the nmse is small for both variables between 0 27 and 0 48 correlations are also high with a minimal value of 0 82 all stations are located close to the river mouth and in the south channel producing a good performance there confirms that slim 3d is well suited to represent the exchanges between the river and the ocean compared to selfe we obtain slightly higher bias and nmse for the salinity skill metrics for temperature are better with slim 3d than selfe in the estuary slim 3d also achieves slightly better skill than roms salinity correlations of 0 91 vs 0 88 at dsdma 0 91 vs 0 90 at red26 0 88 vs 0 84 at sandi see liu et al 2009b for details even though the metrics are not directly comparable as the simulated time periods are different 3 2 plume dynamics validation in order to assess the quality of the simulations over the shelf the salinity signal observed at rise stations is compared to model results fig 6 shows that slim 3d simulations solid lines represent all the major events recorded in the observations dotted lines at northern station rino the two major brackish water events recorded around june 7 and june 19 are well reproduced by the model predicted values slightly overestimate freshness at the surface red 1 m depth during the first event and underestimate the second one by only 10 interestingly the plume signature is not visible at rino when wind is downwelling favorable northward although the plume is spreading to the north the plume spreads shoreward of the mooring and is thinner than the inner shelf delimited by the 72 m isobath the decrease in salinity is observed a few days after wind reversals as the plume detaches from the washington coast and reaches the station slim 3d proves capable of capturing this upwelling induced detachment even though the decrease in salinity is less sharp by comparison selfe response to the event starts earlier and the amplitude is less intense the major event around june 15 observed at the southern station riso is also well captured in terms of the amplitude and the duration while slim 3d predictions show a one day time lag at rice the station close to the river mouth the signal variability is stronger because it is influenced by the near field tidal plume the model correctly represents the stratification for most of the period under consideration the absence of brackish water at the end of may is well reproduced although the model predicts a non recorded brackish water event at the beginning of june on the bottom panel of fig 6 a closer view of salinity at rice confirms that slim 3d can predict the amplitude of tidal induced oscillations of the salinity as well as slower changes in figs 7 and 8 skill metrics of slim 3d are detailed with red circles on a taylor diagram and a plot of the nmse versus the bias all skill metrics are listed in table a 2 for salinity the biases and rmse are small except at 1 meter depth where the variability is strong almost all nmse are below 1 fig 7 red circles this proves that slim 3d errors are below the variability of the measurements for temperature slim 3d skill is good but all stations seem to underestimate the temperature fig 8 red circles as opposed to selfe that has almost only positive biases burla et al 2010 reported poor correlation between modeled and observed salinities at rice station due to the inability of selfe to reproduce the small scale variability in the bulge the metrics shown in fig 7 blue circles prove that selfe skill on the shelf has strongly improved with db33 kärnä et al 2015 a direct comparison of skill metrics shows that slim 3d has a better skill on the shelf in predicting the salinity biases and nmse are smaller at almost every stations and depths selfe predictions seem to underestimate salinity at every station the comparison for the temperature is favorable to selfe in term of bias but the nmse are comparable and correlations favor slim 3d the maximal value of nmse of slim 3d is 2 48 for temperature and 1 69 for salinity by comparison selfe db33 nmse exceed these values at several stations and depths with worse values at ogi01 50 m 12 96 for salinity 4 57 for temperature only a single value of correlation obtained with slim 3d is below 0 42 0 22 for temperature at ogi01 50 m deep several correlations obtained with selfe lie below this value with even a value close to 0 0 04 for temperature at rice 20 m deep the plume thickness estimation at station ogi01 and saturn02 is obtained by linearly interpolating the measurements at recorded depths 0 8 5 11 and 50 m for ogi01 and 1 5 and 20 m for saturn02 the 26 salinity threshold time series are scattered against the simulated values in fig 9 at ogi01 the absence of the plume at the end of may and at the beginning of june is well represented by the model the time of appearance 06 08 also matches the observations predicted thickness slightly differs the model misses the disappearance of the plume around mid june the predicted salinity remains just below the 26 salinity threshold defined in section 2 6 although the observed data are just above this value the onset and vanishing plumes at this station are correctly estimated by the model at the end of june at saturn02 correlation between predicted and observed plume thickness is stronger the thickness grows around mid june and drops after june 20 at a smaller time scale the tidal amplitude is also correctly predicted 4 model application wind induced variability of the plume the cr plume dynamics is characterized by two major regimes in winter the freshwater flow leaving the cr estuary turns north due to the earth s rotation reinforced by downwelling favorable winds generating a thin plume attached to the washington coast in summer as the wind strongly blows southward due to the predominance of a high pressure anticyclone the plume is oriented in an offshore south west direction during spring summer the cr plume is known to be regularly split into two parts in this section we investigate the response of the plume to wind changes the wind direction is mostly southward during late spring and summer in the north east pacific region short wind reversals regularly happen interrupting the well established atmospheric conditions as shown in fig 2 the period may june 2006 is no exception as the wind mainly blows southward with short and long wind directional shifts for example wind shifts lasting less than a day happen around may 8 and may 16 while the period between may 21 to june 6 is almost continuously downwelling favorable the year 2006 is characterized by early spring transition large river discharge and early freshet hickey et al 2005 defined a data derived conceptual model of the bidirectional summer plume which is clearly depicted by the top panels of fig 10 describing the first downwelling event i the wide cr far field plume extends offshore in a south west direction as upwelling favorable winds blow strong 05 22 after about 2 days of downwelling favorable wind 05 24 the aged plume is driven toward the coast and a new plume emerges north of the river mouth the bulge turns north generating an along coast plume and the southerly plume is almost fully eroded within 4 days 05 26 the downwelling favorable winds constrict the plume along the washington coast but after several days and as wind intensity declines the plume starts widening 06 06 as soon as the wind blows from the north again the along coast plume detaches 06 10 and nearly vanishes 06 12 soon afterwards this plume evolution is in agreement with the conceptual model of hickey et al 2005 the bottom panels of fig 10 describe the second downwelling event ii the far field plume again extends in its summer common south west direction made up of a majority of primarily aged water originating from the plume along the washington coast 06 12 the wind regime once more changes and pushes the far field plume onshore and the bulge northward 06 16 the bulge quickly responds to form a coriolis driven near field plume 06 14 this downwelling favorable event is not strong enough to fully erode the southern plume hence both the oregon and washington coasts are connected to a brackish water plume 06 18 the southwest plume after period ii is a combination of aged plume waters from oregon coast medium aged plume waters from washington coast and new plume waters directly coming from the river mouth 06 22 the model snapshots show that unlike the conceptual model by hickey et al 2005 significant downwelling events may not be sufficient to fully erode the southern plume waters during late spring early summer both duration and intensity of the event impact the plume erosion on the oregon shelf in the literature selfe has been shown to produce similar patterns in the plume dynamics hickey et al 2009 fig 11 shows a comparison of the surface salinity predicted by three models of the cr estuary and shelf roms maccready et al 2009 liu et al 2009b slim 3d and selfe kärnä et al 2015 despite a coarser vertical and horizontal resolution slim 3d shows more lateral structures than selfe where fronts and gradients are smoothed out while the plume extensions predicted by all models are rather similar a major difference between simulations is the detachment from the washington coast on june 9 that is well captured by slim 3d and roms and not by selfe this detachment is a consequence of coastal upwelling which is correctly represented with slim 3d as forcings differ between models part of the differences is not directly related to the numerics of the model as explained in section 2 the plume centroid is defined as the geographic center of the plume its location is a good proxy for interpreting global movements of the cr plume fig 12 displays the 2d plume centroid trajectory colored by the plume thickness as defined in section 2 as expected for this season the plume location is mainly south west of the river mouth at an average distance of about 80 km fig 12 during the first three weeks of may the plume centroid mainly lies southwest of the cr mouth this feature is only modified by limited strong downwelling events slightly moving it north east the plume experiences a long excursion to the north between may 22 and june 12 fig 12 the first part of this period is characterized by strong downwelling favorable winds fig 2 period i which drives the plume northward the course of events is as follows first the plume quickly moves shoreward to reach the coast then it slowly continues up along the washington coast as long as winds favor downwelling after that as downwelling favorable wind intensity diminishes at the beginning of june during a storm the plume centroid moves west but remains off the washington shelf finally as upwelling favorable winds take over again the plume slowly moves southward and comes back to a position south west of the cr mouth further away than before the event similar patterns of atmospheric conditions occurred between june 12 and june 18 fig 10 the plume as estimated by the plume centroid location reacts less intensely a similar loop as the one described earlier is visible but the distance traveled is far smaller the centroid starts further away from the coast at the start of the event this means that the plume spreads over a larger area of the shelf a criterion based on this distance and the northward wind intensity may be defined to predict the full erosion of the plume off the oregon shelf as predicted by hickey et al 2005 those patterns are visible on the plume thickness at station ogi01 fig 9 the summer plume is present there during high discharge and southward wind conditions as the plume propagates southwestward or during low flow and frequent wind reversals as the plume grows close to the mouth the decrease in plume thickness at this station is correlated with northward wind as the wind blows southward blue the plume grows at ogi01 while it disappears if northward winds events red remain strong enough and or last long enough the simulated presence of the plume at mid june corresponds to the underestimation of brackish water at riso fig 12 highlights the correlation between the plume thickness volume area and the plume location it reflects the rapid reaction of the plume to wind changes during upwelling favorable wind events the mean plume thickness is rather small 4 m as the cr plume spreads over a large area due to ekman transport and ambient stratification on the contrary northward winds push the plume toward the washington coast the cr plume is pressed against the coast weakening the stratification and deepening the plume in shallow shelf area north of the cr mouth as downward velocity advects surface water down the water column while moving northward during event i the plume centroid deepens with a mean thickness 4 m and decelerates for comparison the distance traveled by the centroid between may 22 and may 24 start of i is similar to the distance between may 24 and june 2 as its mean velocity drops tidal oscillations plays a significant role in its displacement the aforementioned behavior is described in detail by cole and hetland 2016 where the characteristics of vertical mixing in such plumes are discussed the plume area shows a strong correlation with the wind direction fig 13 during event i the plume area is smaller than average as the plume is driven to the coast in the days following period i the area grows again as the wind constrained plume propagates along the coast as soon as the wind turns the area covered by the plume increases sharply and the far field plume covers a larger part of the coastal ocean the drop during downwelling event ii is also due to the ekman transport toward the coast the area covered at the end of the upwelling favorable wind is still significant a large part being along the oregon coast by contrast the decrease at the end of june is a direct consequence of the drop of the river discharge as the centroid path suggested the plume area before the second event ii is far larger fig 12 this partly explains why the plume remains on the oregon shelf after the downwelling event as explained above the plume area and thickness evolve in exact opposite ways this feature is not surprising considering that wind changes do not significantly alter the plume volume the plume volume instead correlates with a time lag of a few days to the water discharge not shown as the bulge retains a significant part of the outgoing water burla et al 2010 showed that river discharge is the predominant factor of the interannual plume variability in may in their analysis of the sea surface salinity anomaly burla et al 2010 underscore that year 2006 exhibits saltier conditions than the climatological signal on both the washington and oregon shelves although the river discharge is not sensibly lower than average for that period coastal upwelling partly explains this feature due to the quasi uninterrupted long period of southward wind from the end of april until the last third of may the prolongated freshet impacted the plume evolution of the following june our study confirms the occurrence of bidirectional plumes see fig 10 in summer 2006 hickey and banas 2003 horner devine et al 2009 liu et al 2009a burla et al 2010 as upwelling favorable seasonal wind is often interrupted by wind reversals liu et al 2009a states that this behavior is representative of the majority of the 2004 summer season with a self organizing map som analysis an empirical orthogonal function eof analysis conducted over the period 1999 2006 by burla et al 2010 confirms the leading mode of variability in summer is bimodal and accounts for 51 of the variance downwelling favorable winds enhance the coriolis effect to the north of the emerging plume medium to strong upwelling events annihilate this feature and drives the majority of the plume offshore in the south west direction the mean california current further advects the plume to the south 5 discussion and conclusions coastal impact studies rely on accurate simulations of currents in the estuary and the coastal sea and their complex interactions the hydrodynamics is the foundation on which ecological or geochemical models are built in this study we describe the latest version of slim 3d a hydrodynamical model aimed at bridging the gap between the estuary and the coastal sea to suitably model such a complex continuum slim 3d offers several advantages 1 multi scale phenomena are simulated seamlessly in a single mesh model 2 the use of an unstructured mesh allows for a detailed representation of small scale features of the topography 3 the discontinuous galerkin formulation provides high accuracy and robustness for this advection dominated problem here we simulate the hydrodynamics of the cr estuary and coastal sea during may june 2006 a period characterized by high river discharge and strong changes in wind regime quantitative statistics evaluate the model skill and integrative metrics facilitate the analysis by highlighting the evolution of the cr plume in response to wind and river forcings the results show the ability of slim 3d to capture both the salinity intrusion in the estuary and the rapid response of the cr plume to wind reversals slim 3d is able to reproduce the offshore advection of the northern coastal plume at the beginning of upwelling favorable wind events the discontinuous galerkin numerical discretization allows slim 3d to handle gradients of bathymetry velocity and density with minimal numerical dissipation by introducing a new splitting between the 2d and 3d momentum equations we markedly improved the representation of large scale flow structures we observe that it reduces the dissipation as the coupling between internal and external modes is much more accurate our model stands the comparison with other models of the cr estuary plume dynamics inside the estuary slim 3d compares well to an operational implementation of selfe same mean correlation coefficient on the shelf slim 3d correctly represents the large scale flow structures despite using a rather coarse mesh resolution it correctly reproduces the occurrence of a bidirectional plume as well as the wind driven coastal upwelling these features favorably compare to those obtained with roms despite a finer mesh resolution selfe yields overly smoothed fronts and seems to underestimate upwelling based on this study and on our previous experience with the model we suggest that slim 3d skill is directly linked to the 2d 3d mode splitting procedure and to the discontinuous galerkin discretization the former notably reduces the level of numerical dissipation particularly for baroclinic processes the latter provides a high level of flexibility to resolve small scale processes even on relatively coarse meshes such a combination of a consistent model formulation with a flexible numerical scheme seems ideally suited to coastal applications acknowledgments v vallaeys visited ncf science and technology center for coastal margin observation and

24123,this study evaluates the effect of el niño and the southern oscillation enso and madden julian oscillation mjo events on 14 day mean significant wave height swh at 3 weeks lead time wk34 over the western pacific and indian oceans using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 the wavewatch 3 ww3 model is forced with daily 10m winds predicted by a modified version of cfsv2 that is initialized with multiple ocean analyses in both january and may for 1979 2008 a significant anomaly correlation of predicted and observed swh anomalies swha at wk34 lead time is found over portions of the domain including the central western pacific south china sea scs bay of bengal bob and southern indian ocean io in january cases and over bob equatorial western pacific the maritime continent and southern io in may cases the model successfully predicts almost all the important features of the observed composite swha during el niño events in january including negative swha in the central io where westerly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state and positive swha over the southern ocean so where westerly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state the model successfully predicts the sign and magnitude of swha at wk34 lead time in may over the bob and scs in composites of combined phases 2 3 and phases 6 7 of mjo the observed leading mode of swha in may and the third mode of swha in january are influenced by the combined effects of enso and mjo based on spatial and temporal correlations the spatial patterns of swha in the model at wk34 in both january and may are in good agreement with the observations over the equatorial western pacific equatorial and southern io and so keywords sub seasonal prediction significant wave heights enso mjo ncep cfsv2 ww3 1 introduction this is part ii of a two part study on the sub seasonal prediction of significant wave height swh in the western pacific and indian ocean wp io region the reader is referred to the first part of this study shukla and kinter 2016 hereafter part i for the motivation of this research and important references about sub seasonal studies in brief the sub seasonal time scale is a very important one because it lies between the time scales of numerical weather prediction nwp and the seasonal mean this time scale forecast range more than 2 weeks but less than a season traditionally has been considered a predictability desert vitart et al 2012 white et al 2017 many management decisions in agriculture transportation water management energy resource management and military operations are made on subseasonal to seasonal s2s time scales so development of more seamless forecasts promises to be of great societal value the u s navy has articulated requirements for forecast information about tropical cyclone genesis and the magnitude of swh at s2s time scales for use by first responder humanitarian missions and other day to day naval operations recent studies lin and brunet 2009 vitart 2014a wang et al 2014 li and robertson 2015 have demonstrated prediction skill of the madden julian oscillation mjo on s2s time scales and at least 10 international weather centers now have the capability to issue s2s forecasts vitart 2014b in part i of this study we found that the magnitude of swh variability grows weaker with lead time over the southern ocean so which may be related to weakening inter annual variability of 10m winds over the course of weeks 1 4 in retrospective forecasts made with the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 saha et al 2014 cfsrr the magnitude and spatial structure of swh in weeks 1 4 are well captured in january and may cases however the magnitude of the bias increases with lead time the prediction skill of swh anomalies in weeks 3 4 is statistically significant in certain sub regions of the wp io in both january and may initialized reforecasts recently delsole et al 2017 found forecasts of 14 day means at 3 weeks lead time wk34 hereafter of temperature and precipitation over the contiguous united states conus using the cfsrr to be skillful during 1999 2009 and the most predictable components of temperature and precipitation are associated with enso the climate prediction center currently issues a wk34 outlook for conus temperature and precipitation based on the ncep cfsv2 http www cpc ncep noaa gov products predictions wk34 the same procedure averaging weeks 3 and 4 is also employed to predict the pacific north american pattern pna north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao all of which strongly affect december february surface weather in the northern hemisphere black et al 2017 many research programs have employed the wavewatch 3 model ww3 tolman et al 2002 and tolman 2009 to study ocean surface wave activity to advise shipping and coastal interests the ww3 model has been used for both global scale wave activity fan et al 2012 marshall et al 2015 and regional wave activity chu et al 2004 mirzaei et al 2013 bertin et al 2013 lopez and kirtman 2016 shukla and kinter 2016 chawla et al 2013 forced the ww3 with climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 10m winds to reproduce the wave conditions for 1979 2009 and validated the output against altimeter records and ndbc buoys showing that the computed wave climate from cfsr is in excellent agreement with the observations at most buoys el niño and the southern oscillation enso is the largest and most important climate variation on seasonal to interannual time scales and is a result of slowly varying interactions between the tropical ocean and atmosphere it occurs on a timescale of 2 4 years and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in the central and east central equatorial pacific during an el niño event the easterly trade winds weaken across the equatorial pacific and warmer than average sea surface temperatures sst across the central and east central equatorial pacific occurs these conditions are associated with a deepening of the thermocline in the central to eastern pacific la niña is the opposite phase of el niño many researchers hemer et al 2010 fan et al 2012 stopa et al 2013 lopez and kirtman 2016 have studied the relationship between interannual variability of swh and enso on seasonal time scales based on the strong correlation between swh and the southern oscillation index soi hemer et al 2010 found that enso variability has a strong influence on the wave climate of the pacific ocean and during el niño years the eastward shift in tropical cyclone activity leads to increases in swh over the equatorial pacific lopez and kirtman 2016 found that swh variability over the wp io region is influenced by enso and there is a potential for predicting swh with several months lead time in the northwest pacific ocean and bay of bengal bob depending upon initialization season the mjo madden and julian 1971 1972 is the most important mode of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric convection and circulation in the tropical indian and west pacific oceans the mjo has a typical period of 30 60 days and propagates eastward along the equator from the western indian ocean to the eastern pacific at approximately 5 m s the eof analysis is performed for daily outgoing longwave radiation olr anomalies during november to february ndjf to identify 8 phases of mjo as discussed in shukla 2014 mjo phases are obtained by the principal components of the first two leading eofs normalized by their standard deviation fig s1a h in the ndjf composite negative olr anomalies enhanced convection in the indian ocean and positive olr anomalies suppressed convection over the maritime continent are observed during phase 1 fig s1a as the sequence progresses negative olr anomalies traverse the equatorial indian ocean during phases 2 3 fig s1b c and pass through the maritime continent in phases 4 and 5 fig s1d e during phases 6 and 7 fig s1f g enhanced negative positive olr anomalies are observed in the western pacific indian ocean during phase 8 fig s1h an enhanced positive olr anomaly over the maritime continent is found and negative olr anomalies may continue into the western hemisphere some recent studied have demonstrated the impacts of mjo on swh variability stopa et al 2013 and marshall et al 2015 stopa et al 2013 identified the influence of mjo on swh in the indian and western pacific oceans using correlation analysis between swh and an mjo index rmm1 and rmm2 wheeler and hendon 2014 marshall et al 2015 detected mjo influences on the swh conditions in the tropics in composite analysis for the november april season during 1980 2009 significant decreases in swh anomalies occur over the maritime continent java sea bismarck sea and coral sea in phases 1 2 and 3 of mjo and during phases 5 6 and 7 there is a significant increase in swh anomalies of up to 30 40 cm over the maritime continent bismarck sea and philippine sea significant decreases and increases of the wave response are pronounced on the north west shelf of australia during phases 1 2 and 3 and phases 5 6 and 7 respectively where marshall and hendon 2014 identified a direct influence of mjo on surface zonal stress sea surface temperature mean sea level and generating coastally trapped kelvin waves in this paper we evaluate the effects of the enso and mjo events on sub seasonal prediction of swh over the western pacific and indian oceans during 1979 2008 using the second generation coupled forecast system cfsv2 saha et al 2014 with four sets of ocean initial conditions oics first we will discuss prediction skill of swh at wk34 lead time over the wp io in january and may initialized reforecasts using revised version of cfsv2 huang et al 2015 and second explore the impacts of the enso states and mjo events on swh our analysis relating swh forecasts to contemporaneous enso states and mjo events show that both seasonal and intra seasonal atmospheric variability exert strong influences on swh in the wp io region at wk34 lead time in observations and the model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the models ww3 and cfsv2 the experimental design the verification dataset and the analysis method in section 3 we describe the swh prediction skill in each of the four oics and the grand ensemble mean gem of four oics in both january and may cases as well as the climatology and variability of sea level pressure slp the impacts of enso states on swh slp and 10m winds at wk34 are presented in section 4 section 5 documents the impact of mjo on swh 10m winds and slp at wk34 the leading patterns of swh at wk34 and their relation to the enso and mjo states are presented in section 6 a summary and discussion are given in section 7 2 model description experimental design and verification data sets in this study we relied on the third generation wavewatch 3 ww3 tolman 1998 2002 and 2009 for wave modeling which is a fully spectral ocean wind wave model developed at ncep the daily outputs 10m winds from global coupled climate forecasts are applied as input to the ww3 model as discussed in part i the coupled model used in this study is the ncep cfsv2 saha et al 2014 which is composed of interacting atmospheric oceanic sea ice and land surface component models huang et al 2015 eliminated a coding error in the surface fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere components at high latitude and adjusted the specified sea ice albedo to a higher value leading to a significant improvement in the model fidelity especially during boreal summer we have used the revised version of cfsv2 huang et al 2015 referred to herein as cfsv2 rev in this study the cfsv2 rev coupled model has been used successfully for studies of the mean state of the indian summer monsoon shukla and huang 2015b indian summer monsoon prediction and predictability shukla et al 2017 and sub seasonal prediction of swh over wp io shukla and kinter 2016 we have conducted 3 month re forecast experiments with cfsv2 rev and initial conditions ics from the beginning of january and may for the period 1979 2008 to sample uncertainty in the ocean initial state the ocean component was initialized with four different sets of ocean initial conditions oics the ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 the ncep global ocean data assimilation system godas behringer 2005 the ecmwf ocean reanalysis system 3 ora s3 balmaseda et al 2008 and nemovar balmaseda et al 2013 to sample uncertainty in the atmosphere and land surface state four ensemble members were generated for each oic by using atmospheric and land surface initial conditions taken from the instantaneous fields at 0000 utc of the first 4 days in january and may of each year the total number of ensemble members is 16 4 oics x 4 aic lics for both january and may cases the computations were made on the extreme science and engineering discovery environment xsede high performance computing platform towns et al 2014 january was chosen as a focus because the influence of enso is strongest at that time of year in the western pacific ocean maritime continent and indian ocean may cases were selected because at that time the large scale atmospheric circulation over the australian asian is transitioning from the australian region to southeast asia and atmospheric conditions associated with the monsoon over the bob is beginning the ww3 model is forced with daily 10m winds from the cfsv2 rev reforecasts at all lead times up to 42 days six weeks the combination of ww3 with csfv2 rev 10m winds will be referred to as the cfsv2 ww3 system for each oic the ensemble mean of 4 ensemble members is formed to evaluate the role of oic in the cfsv2 ww3 system most of the results discussed in this paper are based on the grand ensemble mean gem of 16 forecasts of all oics in both january and may cases the european centre for medium range forecasts ecmwf interim re analysis era interim dee et al 2011 for the 30 year period 1979 2008 is employed for comparison in the present study the daily values were generated from the 6 hourly era interim data and the daily 10m winds were used to force ww3 and produce swh a system referred to below as ecmwf ww3 because the wind applied to ww3 is a reanalysis product the output of ecmwf ww3 is referred to as ecmwf ww3 swh the ww3 model has been configured as in lopez and kirtman 2016 and shukla and kinter 2016 over a portion of the wp io 80 180 e 60 s 40 n with a grid resolution of 1 1 including implementing the appropriate bathymetry obstruction grids and land sea mask from the daily swh data wk34 data were generated for january and may cases i e averages of 15 28 january and 15 28 may respectively wk34 wave height anomalies were derived with respect to that wk34 climatology the statistical significance of these patterns is measured point wise using a 2 sided student t test given the sampling size 29 degree of freedom the correlation values for 90 95 98 and 99 significance levels are 0 30 0 35 0 41 and 0 45 in the analysis we have compared swh in two reanalysis namely the european centre for medium range forecasts ecmwf interim re analysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 during 1979 2008 in january and may cases the structure and amplitude of swh in ecmwf ww3 are in good agreement with cfsr ww3 output in both cases except the amplitude of swh in ecmwf ww3 is slightly weaker in both cases not shown the inter annual variability of swh anomalies in wk34 are quite similar in both re analyses but the amplitude of the swh variability is slightly lower in ecmwf ww3 than in cfsr ww3 in both january and may cases not shown the eof analysis of swh anomalies at wk34 in january not shown and may cases not shown also finds a high degree of similarity between the two reanalysis the table table s1 provides the variance explained for wk34 swh anomalies by the leading 3 principal components and the pattern correlation coefficient of the 3 leading eofs between the cfsr ww3 and ecmwf ww3 reanalysis based on eof analysis in both january and may cases we have found the leading modes of cfsr ww3 and ecmwf ww3 are statistically significantly correlated but these modes are slightly different in the two reanalysis we use the 10m winds and swh from ecmwf in the manuscript 3 general characteristics of wk34 prediction skill 3 1 the impact of oics on prediction skill of swh at wk34 lead time before discussing the impacts of enso and mjo events on swh at wk34 lead time a brief discussion about the 1979 2008 climatology of 10m winds and swh at wk34 and prediction skill of swh at wk34 in both january and may cases in all oics and gem is required fig s2 shows the climatological mean and corresponding model biases of 10m wind speed colored shading and direction unit vectors for wk34 in era interim and cfsv2 for the january fig s2a b c and may fig s2d e f cases as shown in part i the amplitude and pattern of the flow over the southern ocean so northwestern pacific bay of bengal bob and south china sea scs are well predicted by the cfsv2 in both cases the model has a negative bias over the so and maritime continent and a positive bias in the bob and northwestern pacific mainly equator to 17 n in january case fig s2c the model has positive bias over the bob maritime continent and northwestern pacific mainly 15 n to 25 n in may case and depict negative bias over the so fig s2f fig s3 shows the climatological mean and bias of swh at wk34 in observations and gem and corresponding model biases cfsv2 ww3 minus ecmwf ww3 as shown in part i swh is largest in the so in both january fig s3a and may fig s3d cases with peak amplitudes of 2 7 to 3 6 m m qualitatively the magnitude and spatial structure of ecmwf ww3 swh fig s1a d over the so the equatorial western pacific scs and bob is well captured by the model fig s3b e but a positive bias over so and western pacific occurs in both january and may fig s3c f the climatology computed separately for each of the four oics produces similar biases in the mean state of swh at wk34 lead time not shown we have used standard procedures to calculate climatology for example for reforecasts initialized in january the climatology was obtained based on 30 year data at wk34 we have not corrected the model bias in climatology in either january or may cases as in part i a 1 year cross validation window procedure is used to calculate the anomaly correlation coefficient acc of swh at wk34 lead time during 1979 2008 fig 1 shows the acc between ecmwf ww3 and predicted gem swh anomalies at wk34 for january cases fig 1a the acc is significant over the equatorial western pacific scs bob and southern indian ocean io for may cases fig 1b the acc is significant over bob equatorial western pacific mainly 150 180 e 20 s 5 n the maritime continent and southern io mainly 87 120 e 47 25 s there is large root mean square error rmse at wk34 in the so in both january fig 1c and may fig 1d fig 2 depicts the acc of the swh at wk34 in reforecasts initialized in january cases with different ocean analyses we have found that there are some differences in prediction skill using different oics over the western pacific for example the ora s3 fig 2c initialized reforecasts are more skillful over the western pacific mainly 130 150 e 5 s 15 n than those with other oics the prediction skill over the bob scs and northern western pacific are similar in all oics fig 2 the rmse in all oics have similar magnitude over the region of significant skill of swh anomalies at wk34 not shown with higher rmse in the so the acc at wk34 fig s4 in may cases shows that prediction skill over the bob and equatorial western pacific is similar in all oics but there are substantial differences in prediction skill with different oics over the maritime continent and southern io the gem prediction skill at wk34 is generally better than that for any individual oic in both january and may cases only the gem will be analyzed in the remainder of this paper we have found that swha model ensemble spread mes at wk34 of january initialized reforecasts fig 3 c is comparable to the variance of swh anomalies for wk34 of january in ecmwf ww3 fig 3b we have found considerable variability in the southern ocean and northwestern pacific regions and low variability within the region 20 n to 20 s in both mes and ecmwf ww3 swh variance the model has less bias fig 3a in the region where mes fig 3c is low fig 3d shows the spatial distribution of mes versus the ensemble mean rmse for swha at wk34 to identify the regions where there is potential predictability mes rmse 1 or over confidence mes rmse 1 johnson and bowler 2009 palmer et al 2004 weisheimer et al 2009 the mes rmse ratio is larger than 1 in the southern ocean and northwestern pacific which may be a reflection of low potential predictability the mes rmse ratio is less than 1 within the region 20 n to 20 s which means the prediction tends to be over confident zhu et al 2013 in the may cases it is also found that the swha mes at wk34 fig 4 c is comparable to the variance of swh anomalies in ecmwf ww3 fig 4b and there is large swh variability in the southern ocean and bay of bengal it is also found that model has a large bias fig 4a in the region where mes fig 4c is high the mes rmse ratio fig 4d is larger than 1 in the southern ocean southern indian ocean southern western pacific and northwestern pacific which may be a reflection of low potential predictability there the mes rmse ratio fig 4d is less than 1 within the region equator to 20 n which means the prediction tends to be over confident in this region the brier skill score mason 2004 has been computed for six regions in the western pacific and indian ocean wp io area as in shukla and kinter 2016 see fig 11 of part i the regions are labeled southern ocean so southern indian ocean sio southwest pacific swp south china sea scs northwest pacific nwp and bay of bengal bob in each domain the thresholds delimiting the upper and lower thirds of the historical record terciles are calculated from the observations 1979 2008 the 16 ensemble members are then sorted into above normal near normal and below normal categories according to the tercile thresholds as a result the forecast probability is defined by the percentage of ensemble members falling in each tercile i e the counting method following mason 2004 and van den dool et al 2017 the brier skill score bss wilks 2006 is defined by bss 1 b s fcst b s control where bscontrol is the brier score bs of always predicting climatology which in this case means always predicting 1 3 the bss value is positive forecasts better than climatology over the bob scs and sio in january cases table 1 and bob scs sio and swp for may cases table 1 3 2 the spatial distributions of slp at wk34 in order to understand the origin of variations in 10m winds at sub seasonal time scales that drive the swh anomalies the climatology and variability of the mean sea level pressure slp at wk34 over the wp io region predicted by cfsv2 rev in both january and may cases is compared to observations in january the cfsv2 rev fig s5b at wk34 qualitatively captures the main observed slp pattern fig s5a over the wp io region the slp centers in the southern hemisphere mainly between 45 s to 30 s and northern hemisphere mainly between 20 n and 35 n are well predicted by cfsv2 rev quantitatively the model has a negative bias of up to 2 hpa within the tropical belt and a positive bias in the southern hemisphere mainly between 60 s and 45 s fig s5c during may the magnitude and pattern of slp of observations fig s5d over the so bob scs and northwestern pacific regions in wk34 are well predicted by the model fig s5e but there is a positive bias over so the inter annual variability iav of slp at wk34 over wp io are displayed in fig s6 the model fig s6b e reasonably predicts at wk34 main features of iav of slp of observations fig s6a d in both january and may for example higher variability of slp in the so is found in observations as well as model predictions at wk34 the magnitude of slp variability in cfsv2 rev is underestimated compared to observations over entire so with a deficit of up to 3 0 hpa but the predicted slp variability is similar to observations within the tropical belt 4 impact of the enso state on swh slp and 10m winds at wk34 many studies have shown that ocean and atmospheric conditions over the asian monsoon region are influenced by enso states e g alexander et al 2002 lau and nath 2003 and shukla and kinter 2014 as well as many others to explore the impact of el niño and la niña states on swh at wk34 as well as the mechanisms for their influence a composite analysis of swh 10m wind and slp in the observations and the cfsv2 ww3 gem has been performed for the period 1979 2008 we have selected four el niño events namely 1983 1987 1992 and 1998 and four la niña events 1989 1999 2000 and 2008 for our analysis we have only selected those el nino and la nina events in january that persist until may fig s7 shows the year to year variation of nino3 4 index anomalies from the optimum interpolation analysis version 2 oiv2 sea surface temperature sst dataset reynolds et al 2007 and january fig s7a and may fig s7b initialized cfsv2 reforecasts in wk34 the model successfully captures the amplitude and sign in both cases correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted nino3 4 anomalies are 0 99 for the january and 0 91 for may at 3 4 weeks lead time in both january and may cases the model successfully captures spatial structure and magnitude of sst anomalies at wk34 during el niño and la niña composites fig s8 in january fig 5 a and b shows the composite of swh anomalies swha hereafter during the el niño events in ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 respectively while the corresponding patterns of slp anomalies slpa and 10m wind anomalies are displayed in fig 6 a and b the composite ecmwf swha pattern fig 5a has positive anomalies in the so mainly 120 165 e 60 40 s and equatorial western pacific and centers of negative swha in the central io we have found that the positive swha in the so is aligned along the northern flank of the below normal pressure anomaly fig 6a colored shading where westerly wind anomalies fig 6a vectors act on a westerly mean state thereby increasing the total wind speed and hence increasing the swh conversely negative swha over the central io is aligned along the southern flank of the enhanced pressure anomaly where westerly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state thus reducing the total wind speed and reducing the swh fig 5a and fig 6a a band of strong westerly wind anomalies occurs near equator from the western pacific to the central pacific ocean which is a typical el niño response almost all the important features of observed el niño events are well predicted by the model fig 5b and fig 6b at wk34 lead time including negative swha in the central io and positive swha over the so and equatorial western pacific fig 5b the model also captures both reduced slpa over the so and enhanced slpa over the central io and the direction of the 10m wind anomalies over the so and equatorial io figures 5c d and 6c d show the spatial patterns of swha slpa and 10m winds anomalies in composite analysis during la niña events in both ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 in wk34 of january as expected the spatial pattern of ecmwf swha fig 5c has positive swha over the western pacific and scs and negative anomalies over the so mainly around 50 s to 40 s and northwestern pacific mainly around 30 n it is observed that the positive swha in the western pacific locates to be aligned along the northern flank of the below normal pressure anomaly fig 6c colored shading where an easterly wind anomalies fig 6c vectors act on an easterly mean state conversely negative swha over the so is aligned along the northern flank of the enhanced pressure anomaly where an easterly wind anomalies act on westerly mean state fig 5c and fig 6c a band of strong easterly wind anomalies flow from the central pacific ocean to the western pacific near the equator in observations as is typical during la niña events in general the model fig 5d and fig 6d is able to predict the typical features of observed la niña events at wk34 lead time but the magnitude of swha fig 5d is weaker in the so and western pacific the sign of slpa is well predicted fig 6d colored shading at wk34 over so io and western pacific and also direction of 10m wind anomalies over the so and near the equator in the equatorial western pacific fig 6d fig 7 depicts the composite may swha during el niño events and la niña events in ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 while the corresponding patterns of slpa and 10m winds are shown in fig s9 during el niño events negative swha fig 7a occurs in the bob and scs where an easterly wind anomalies fig s9a vectors act on a westerly mean state and positive swha occurs in the so where westerly wind anomalies fig s9a vectors act on a westerly mean state in ecmwf ww3 the model fig 7b successfully captures the sign of swha over the bob and scs but model erroneously produces dipole like structure in the so where ecmwf ww3 depicts monopole during la niña events the ecmwf ww3 fig 7c depicts positive swha at wk34 over the bob where westerly wind anomalies fig s9c vectors act on a westerly mean state and dipole kind of structure in the so mainly between 60 s and 35 s the sign of swha and 10m wind anomalies over the bob is captured by cfsv2 ww3 fig 7c fig s9d the model is not able to correctly reproduce swha and 10m winds over the so during la niña events 5 impact of the mjo events on swh within weeks 3 4 lead time recent studies stopa et al 2013 and marshall et al 2015 discussed the observed mjo impacts on swha as described in section 1 to evaluate the mjo impact on wk34 predictions of swha the composite daily swha and 10m wind in the era interim and gem during 1979 2008 are analyzed the real time multivariate rmm1 and rmm2 indices wheeler and hendon 2004 are used to construct composites on each day the amplitude r m m 1 2 r m m 2 2 and phase tan 1 r m m 2 r m m 1 are computed strong persistent mjo events are defined when the rmm index amplitude is greater than 1 5 standard deviations and persists a minimum of 2 days as shown by neena et al 2014 the ensemble mean prediction skill of mjo in the cfsv2 model is 18 days kim et al 2014 have mentioned that the prediction skill of mjo is 21 days in the cfsv2 model the mjo eastward propagation speed is slower and its amplitude is weaker in cfsv2 than observation therefore we have combined mjo phases 8 and 1 phase 8 1 western hemisphere and africa phases 2 and 3 phase 2 3 indian ocean phases 4 and 5 phase 4 5 maritime continent and phases 6 and 7 phase 6 7 western pacific we found that may initialized wk3 4 reforecasts produce skillful predictions of swha during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo we also found that january initialized reforecasts are able to capture the tendency of swha within wk3 4 during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo the eof analysis is performed for outgoing longwave radiation olr anomalies at wk34 and wks3 4 in order to explore the prediction skill of leading modes of olr in both january and may as discussed in shukla 2014 and shukla and zhu 2014 the eof analysis of olr anomalies is performed for wk34 fig s10a b c d 30 samples and within wk3 4 fig s10e f g h 420 samples during 1979 2008 in both ecmwf ww3 and january initialized reforecasts the two modes together explain 44 4 20 8 and 46 47 31 0 of the variance in ecmwf ww3 and january initialized reforecast at wk34 within wk3 4 the amplitudes of the olr perturbations at the major centers of action of eof 1 and eof 2 range up to 19 w m 2 per standard deviation of the respective standardized principal coefficients pcs 1 and 2 in both cases wk34 and wk3 4 of observations in both cases the model is able to capture the sign of eof 1 and eof 2 but the amplitude of olr anomalies is weaker in both cases correlation coefficients between observed and predicted pc1 are 0 80 0 70 for the wk34 wk3 4 in january and 0 31 0 33 for pc2 in wk34 wk3 4 the model is not able to capture pc2 in both cases of january which may imply that the model is not correctly predicting the eastward propagation in january cases we have also performed eof analysis of olr anomalies in wk34 fig s11a b c d and within wk3 4 fig s11e f g h in both ecmwf ww3 and may initialized reforecasts the two modes together explain 32 4 14 04 and 43 0 26 6 variance in observation and may initialized reforecast at wk34 within wk3 4 respectively the amplitudes of the olr perturbations at the major centers of action of eof 1 and eof 2 range up to 15 w m 2 per standard deviation of the standardized pc1 and pc2 in both cases wk34 and wk3 4 of observation the amplitude of olr anomalies in eof 1 and eof 2 of model is weaker in both wk34 and wk3 4 correlation coefficients between observed and predicted pc1 are 0 57 0 35 for the wk34 wk3 4 in may and 0 73 0 52 for pc2 in wk34 wk3 4 we have found that prediction skill of pc2 in may initialized reforecasts is slightly better than january case fig 8 shows may composite swha during mjo phase 2 3 which is based on 36 days and phase 6 7 that is based 92 days in ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 respectively while the corresponding composite patterns of the 10m winds anomalies is shown in figs 9 the ecmwf composite swha fig 8a is negative over the bob and scs during phase 2 3 and positive during phase 6 7 fig 8c significant positive negative swha occurs over the maritime continent timor sea arafura sea bismarck sea coral sea and on the northwest shelf of australia during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 negative positive swha in phase 2 3 phase 6 7 over the bob and scs is associated with negative anomalies of 10m winds where an easterly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state positive anomalies of 10m winds where westerly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state in ecmwf fig 9a c the composite of swha depicts dipole kind of structure in the so in both phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo with negative positive swha centers at 90 e and 140 e during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 consistent with swha in the so the 10m wind anomalies are negative and positive at these centers in phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 fig 9a c the cfsv2 ww3 successfully captures the sign and amplitude of swha at wk34 over the bob and scs in phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo fig 8b d the model captures the sign of swha over the timor sea arafura sea coral sea and southern io mainly between 45 s and 33 s 80 e and 110 e in both phases the model captures observed features of swha at locations where there is significant skill in general at wk34 lead time fig 1b the model predicts negative positive anomalies of 10m wind fig 9b d over the bob and scs during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 a similar composite analysis for january in wk3 4 was performed during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 the ecmwf swha fig s13 and fig s14 and 10m wind anomalies show important characteristics in composite analysis during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo but the model composite structures initialized in january are only able to capture tendency of swha over the maritime continent at wk3 4 6 leading patterns of swh at wk34 an empirical orthogonal function analysis eof e g thompson and wallace 1998 was used to identify robust spatial and temporal patterns of swh in the wp io region there is significant spatial variability of observed swha not shown in the wp io region ranging from 0 1 to 1 1 in both january and may cases to remove the effect of enhanced variability in the eof analysis the swh biweekly mean anomalies are first normalized as in shukla and huang 2015a b fig 10 a b c depicts the correlation between the may swh anomalies at wk34 and the first three leading principal components pcs of swh anomalies in the wp io region in observation ecmwf ww3 the correlation coefficient cc at or above 90 95 98 and 99 confidence levels are shown the three leading modes of swha in may at wk34 explain 16 86 12 64 and 12 34 of the variance respectively the leading eof eof 1 may fig 10a is dominated by a significant positive correlation over the western pacific and bob eof 2 may fig 10b depicts statistically significance negative correlation of swha over the so and equatorial io and positive correlation in the southern portion of western pacific mainly 155 180 e 30 20 s the pattern of eof 3 may has positive correlation over the bob and scs and negative correlation over the so fig 10c pc1 may is significantly correlated cc 0 41 with the simultaneous nino3 4 sst index and the other two modes are not significantly correlated with enso in may to what extent are the leading modes of may swha in wk34 associated with mjo the correlation between real time multivariate rmm1 and rmm2 index averages of 15 28 may wheeler and hendon 2004 and the first three leading pcs of may swha in observations are mentioned in table 2 pc1 may and pc2 may are significantly associated with mjo table 1 there are significant positive correlations of pc1 may with both rmm1 and rmm2 suggesting a relationship with phase 5 or 6 of mjo since pc1 may is also significantly negatively correlated with nino3 4 it may influence by combined effects of the enso and mjo consistent with above relationship eof 1 may depicts positive swha over the western pacific ocean and bob fig 10a pc2 may is only significantly correlated with rmm2 for cfsv2 ww3 gem reforecasts we have projected the swha at wk34 on the ecmwf ww3 eofs by projecting the reforecast time series onto each observed eigenvector straus and shukla 2002 and then calculating the correlation of the reforecast at each grid point with the projected time series the correlations between may swha in wk34 in cfsv2 ww3 with the first three projected pcs are shown in fig 10 d e f the spatial patterns of swh variability in the model fig 10d e f are in good agreement with the observations fig 10a b c over the western pacific bob southern io and so the pattern correlation coefficients between the ecmwf and reforecasts are 0 72 for eof 1 may 0 81 for eof 2 may and 0 73 for eof 3 may correlation coefficients between observed and predicted time series are 0 31 for pc1 may 0 47 for pc2 may and 0 27 for pc3 may based on the spatial and temporal correlations cfsv2 ww3 is reasonably predicting the leading modes of may swha at wk34 lead times fig 11 shows the correlation between january swh anomalies at wk34 with the first three leading pcs of swh anomalies in the ecmwf ww3 the dominant modes of january swha explain 16 07 13 42 and 10 26 of the variance respectively the leading eof 1 jan fig 11a is dominated by a significant negative correlation over the so central io and equatorial western pacific and positive correlation over northwestern pacific mainly around 30 n eof 2 jan fig 11b has a dipole pattern with negative anomaly over the equatorial io and positive anomaly over the central western pacific and scs the eof 3 jan fig 11c is also a dipole pattern with negative anomaly over the central western pacific and positive anomaly over the so only pc3 jan of swha in wk34 is significantly positively correlated cc 0 64 with the simultaneous nino3 4 sst index which implies suppressed 10m winds and wave activity in the western pacific and bob to evaluate the effects of the mjo on the leading pcs correlation between first three pcs jan and the real time multivariate rmm1 and rmm2 index averages of 15 28 january are display in table 3 based on table 2 it is observed that pc1 jan and pc3 jan of swha at wk34 are significantly associated with mjo a significant negative correlation is found between pc3 jan and rmm1 we may conclude that the combined effects of the enso and mjo influence eof4 3 jan for january cfsv2 ww3 gem reforecasts we have projected the swh anomalies at wk34 on the observed eofs straus and shukla 2002 the correlation between january swha reforecasts in wk34 and the first three projected pcs are shown in fig 11 d e f the spatial patterns of swha in the model fig 11d e f are in good agreement with the ecmwf ww3 fig 11a b c over the equatorial western pacific southern io and so the cfsv2 ww3 reforecasts fail to reproduce positive anomaly over northwestern pacific mainly around 30 n in eof 1 jan and positive correlation over scs in eof2 jan eof 3 jan of model has a large negative correlation over much of the central io than ecmwf ww3 the pattern ccs of swha between the reforecasts and the observations are 0 72 for eof 1 jan 0 77 for eof 2 jan and 0 72 for eof 3 jan the ccs between reforecasts and observed swha pc time series are 0 27 for pc 1 jan 0 54 for pc 2 jan and 0 59 for pc 3 jan based on the spatial and temporal correlations we may conclude that cfsv2 ww3 is able to predict the leading modes of ecmwf ww3 at wk34 in january case 7 summary and discussion we examined the capability of using a coupled model cfsv2 rev to predict 10m winds in order to force an ocean surface wave model ww3 to predict biweekly averages of significant wave height anomalies swha at 3 weeks lead time wk34 in january and may cases over a 30 year period 1979 2008 we also evaluated the effects of enso and mjo events on swha sea level pressure anomaly slpa and 10m wind anomalies the ww3 model was forced with daily 10m wind from the ecmwf reanalysis as a proxy for swh observations the cfsv2 rev model was initialized with four different sets of ocean initial conditions oic the grand ensemble mean of 16 members 4 oics each having 4 atmosphere and land surface initial conditions was used to provide more robust estimates of the predicted quantities the combined model cfsv2 ww3 has significant skill in predicting swha at wk34 in january over several regions within the indian and west pacific oceans notably the equatorial western pacific scs bob and the southern io for the may cases there is prediction skill over the bob equatorial western pacific 150 e 180 e 20 s 5 n the maritime continent and southern io 87 120 e 47 25 s both el niño and la niña events have effects on swh in the wp io region in january and may el niño events in january are associated with positive swh anomalies in the so aligned with below normal pressure anomaly where westerly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state therefore enhanced swh negative swha in the central io aligned with enhanced pressure anomaly where an easterly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state therefore suppressed swh the model successfully predicts the ecmwf ww3 features of swha at wk34 the model also predicts negative slpa over the so and positive slpa over the central io as well as the direction of 10m winds anomalies over the so and equatorial io during la niña events the observed swha is positive over the equatorial western pacific and scs where an easterly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state and negative over the so mainly around 50 40 s where westerly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state the model is able to predict the typical features of observed la niña events at wk34 but the magnitude of swha is weaker in the so and equatorial western pacific in january cases during may the model reproduces the sign of swha at wk34 over the bob and scs but produces erroneously dipole like structure in the so where ecmwf ww3 depicts monopole during el niño events during la niña events the model predicts positive swha at wk34 over the bob as in ecmwf ww3 but not able to capture structure of observed swha over the so the model predicts the impact of mjo events on swha at wk3 4 in may cases including the negative anomalies over the bob and scs during phase 2 3 of mjo and positive anomalies during phase 6 7 of mjo over the bob the negative positive anomalies of 10m winds over the bob during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 are also correct in model the sign of swha over timor sea arafura sea coral sea and southern io mainly between 45 s and 33 s is correctly predicted in both phases of mjo model also able to predict tendency of swha at wk3 4 of january over the maritime continents during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo the leading mode of ecmwf ww3 swha variability in may is dominated by positive anomalies over the western pacific and bob and the analysis shows that it is influenced by combined effects of the enso and mjo the spatial pattern of the first three leading modes of predicted swha variability in may are in good agreement with the observations over the western pacific and bob in eof 1 southern io in eof 2 and so in eof 3 the leading mode eof 1 of ecmwf ww3 swha variability in january depicts negative anomalies over the so central io and wpo and positive correlation over northern western pacific in january the leading mode of swha variability is related to mjo while eof 3 jan is influenced both by mjo and enso the reforecasts capture much of the variability of swha at wk34 in leading modes of ecmwf ww3 the sub seasonal skill of reforecasts of significant wave heights is degraded by the very consistent spatial pattern of bias in the mean 10m wind as a function of lead time the bias along with the error in variance of the surface wind which diminishes with lead time can therefore be corrected a posteriori the ocean surface waves driven by the corrected winds are likely to be more accurate than the swh forecasts described a possibility that will be explored in subsequent work

the western pacific and indian oceans using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 the wavewatch 3 ww3 model is forced with daily 10m winds predicted by a modified version of cfsv2 that is initialized with multiple ocean analyses in both january and may for 1979 2008 a significant anomaly correlation of predicted and observed swh anomalies swha at wk34 lead time is found over portions of the domain including the central western pacific south china sea scs bay of bengal bob and southern indian ocean io in january cases and over bob equatorial western pacific the maritime continent and southern io in may cases the model successfully predicts almost all the important features of the observed composite swha during el niño events in january including negative swha in the central io where westerly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state and positive swha over the southern ocean so where westerly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state the model successfully predicts the sign and magnitude of swha at wk34 lead time in may over the bob and scs in composites of combined phases 2 3 and phases 6 7 of mjo the observed leading mode of swha in may and the third mode of swha in january are influenced by the combined effects of enso and mjo based on spatial and temporal correlations the spatial patterns of swha in the model at wk34 in both january and may are in good agreement with the observations over the equatorial western pacific equatorial and southern io and so keywords sub seasonal prediction significant wave heights enso mjo ncep cfsv2 ww3 1 introduction this is part ii of a two part study on the sub seasonal prediction of significant wave height swh in the western pacific and indian ocean wp io region the reader is referred to the first part of this study shukla and kinter 2016 hereafter part i for the motivation of this research and important references about sub seasonal studies in brief the sub seasonal time scale is a very important one because it lies between the time scales of numerical weather prediction nwp and the seasonal mean this time scale forecast range more than 2 weeks but less than a season traditionally has been considered a predictability desert vitart et al 2012 white et al 2017 many management decisions in agriculture transportation water management energy resource management and military operations are made on subseasonal to seasonal s2s time scales so development of more seamless forecasts promises to be of great societal value the u s navy has articulated requirements for forecast information about tropical cyclone genesis and the magnitude of swh at s2s time scales for use by first responder humanitarian missions and other day to day naval operations recent studies lin and brunet 2009 vitart 2014a wang et al 2014 li and robertson 2015 have demonstrated prediction skill of the madden julian oscillation mjo on s2s time scales and at least 10 international weather centers now have the capability to issue s2s forecasts vitart 2014b in part i of this study we found that the magnitude of swh variability grows weaker with lead time over the southern ocean so which may be related to weakening inter annual variability of 10m winds over the course of weeks 1 4 in retrospective forecasts made with the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 saha et al 2014 cfsrr the magnitude and spatial structure of swh in weeks 1 4 are well captured in january and may cases however the magnitude of the bias increases with lead time the prediction skill of swh anomalies in weeks 3 4 is statistically significant in certain sub regions of the wp io in both january and may initialized reforecasts recently delsole et al 2017 found forecasts of 14 day means at 3 weeks lead time wk34 hereafter of temperature and precipitation over the contiguous united states conus using the cfsrr to be skillful during 1999 2009 and the most predictable components of temperature and precipitation are associated with enso the climate prediction center currently issues a wk34 outlook for conus temperature and precipitation based on the ncep cfsv2 http www cpc ncep noaa gov products predictions wk34 the same procedure averaging weeks 3 and 4 is also employed to predict the pacific north american pattern pna north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao all of which strongly affect december february surface weather in the northern hemisphere black et al 2017 many research programs have employed the wavewatch 3 model ww3 tolman et al 2002 and tolman 2009 to study ocean surface wave activity to advise shipping and coastal interests the ww3 model has been used for both global scale wave activity fan et al 2012 marshall et al 2015 and regional wave activity chu et al 2004 mirzaei et al 2013 bertin et al 2013 lopez and kirtman 2016 shukla and kinter 2016 chawla et al 2013 forced the ww3 with climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 10m winds to reproduce the wave conditions for 1979 2009 and validated the output against altimeter records and ndbc buoys showing that the computed wave climate from cfsr is in excellent agreement with the observations at most buoys el niño and the southern oscillation enso is the largest and most important climate variation on seasonal to interannual time scales and is a result of slowly varying interactions between the tropical ocean and atmosphere it occurs on a timescale of 2 4 years and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in the central and east central equatorial pacific during an el niño event the easterly trade winds weaken across the equatorial pacific and warmer than average sea surface temperatures sst across the central and east central equatorial pacific occurs these conditions are associated with a deepening of the thermocline in the central to eastern pacific la niña is the opposite phase of el niño many researchers hemer et al 2010 fan et al 2012 stopa et al 2013 lopez and kirtman 2016 have studied the relationship between interannual variability of swh and enso on seasonal time scales based on the strong correlation between swh and the southern oscillation index soi hemer et al 2010 found that enso variability has a strong influence on the wave climate of the pacific ocean and during el niño years the eastward shift in tropical cyclone activity leads to increases in swh over the equatorial pacific lopez and kirtman 2016 found that swh variability over the wp io region is influenced by enso and there is a potential for predicting swh with several months lead time in the northwest pacific ocean and bay of bengal bob depending upon initialization season the mjo madden and julian 1971 1972 is the most important mode of intraseasonal variability of atmospheric convection and circulation in the tropical indian and west pacific oceans the mjo has a typical period of 30 60 days and propagates eastward along the equator from the western indian ocean to the eastern pacific at approximately 5 m s the eof analysis is performed for daily outgoing longwave radiation olr anomalies during november to february ndjf to identify 8 phases of mjo as discussed in shukla 2014 mjo phases are obtained by the principal components of the first two leading eofs normalized by their standard deviation fig s1a h in the ndjf composite negative olr anomalies enhanced convection in the indian ocean and positive olr anomalies suppressed convection over the maritime continent are observed during phase 1 fig s1a as the sequence progresses negative olr anomalies traverse the equatorial indian ocean during phases 2 3 fig s1b c and pass through the maritime continent in phases 4 and 5 fig s1d e during phases 6 and 7 fig s1f g enhanced negative positive olr anomalies are observed in the western pacific indian ocean during phase 8 fig s1h an enhanced positive olr anomaly over the maritime continent is found and negative olr anomalies may continue into the western hemisphere some recent studied have demonstrated the impacts of mjo on swh variability stopa et al 2013 and marshall et al 2015 stopa et al 2013 identified the influence of mjo on swh in the indian and western pacific oceans using correlation analysis between swh and an mjo index rmm1 and rmm2 wheeler and hendon 2014 marshall et al 2015 detected mjo influences on the swh conditions in the tropics in composite analysis for the november april season during 1980 2009 significant decreases in swh anomalies occur over the maritime continent java sea bismarck sea and coral sea in phases 1 2 and 3 of mjo and during phases 5 6 and 7 there is a significant increase in swh anomalies of up to 30 40 cm over the maritime continent bismarck sea and philippine sea significant decreases and increases of the wave response are pronounced on the north west shelf of australia during phases 1 2 and 3 and phases 5 6 and 7 respectively where marshall and hendon 2014 identified a direct influence of mjo on surface zonal stress sea surface temperature mean sea level and generating coastally trapped kelvin waves in this paper we evaluate the effects of the enso and mjo events on sub seasonal prediction of swh over the western pacific and indian oceans during 1979 2008 using the second generation coupled forecast system cfsv2 saha et al 2014 with four sets of ocean initial conditions oics first we will discuss prediction skill of swh at wk34 lead time over the wp io in january and may initialized reforecasts using revised version of cfsv2 huang et al 2015 and second explore the impacts of the enso states and mjo events on swh our analysis relating swh forecasts to contemporaneous enso states and mjo events show that both seasonal and intra seasonal atmospheric variability exert strong influences on swh in the wp io region at wk34 lead time in observations and the model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the models ww3 and cfsv2 the experimental design the verification dataset and the analysis method in section 3 we describe the swh prediction skill in each of the four oics and the grand ensemble mean gem of four oics in both january and may cases as well as the climatology and variability of sea level pressure slp the impacts of enso states on swh slp and 10m winds at wk34 are presented in section 4 section 5 documents the impact of mjo on swh 10m winds and slp at wk34 the leading patterns of swh at wk34 and their relation to the enso and mjo states are presented in section 6 a summary and discussion are given in section 7 2 model description experimental design and verification data sets in this study we relied on the third generation wavewatch 3 ww3 tolman 1998 2002 and 2009 for wave modeling which is a fully spectral ocean wind wave model developed at ncep the daily outputs 10m winds from global coupled climate forecasts are applied as input to the ww3 model as discussed in part i the coupled model used in this study is the ncep cfsv2 saha et al 2014 which is composed of interacting atmospheric oceanic sea ice and land surface component models huang et al 2015 eliminated a coding error in the surface fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere components at high latitude and adjusted the specified sea ice albedo to a higher value leading to a significant improvement in the model fidelity especially during boreal summer we have used the revised version of cfsv2 huang et al 2015 referred to herein as cfsv2 rev in this study the cfsv2 rev coupled model has been used successfully for studies of the mean state of the indian summer monsoon shukla and huang 2015b indian summer monsoon prediction and predictability shukla et al 2017 and sub seasonal prediction of swh over wp io shukla and kinter 2016 we have conducted 3 month re forecast experiments with cfsv2 rev and initial conditions ics from the beginning of january and may for the period 1979 2008 to sample uncertainty in the ocean initial state the ocean component was initialized with four different sets of ocean initial conditions oics the ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 the ncep global ocean data assimilation system godas behringer 2005 the ecmwf ocean reanalysis system 3 ora s3 balmaseda et al 2008 and nemovar balmaseda et al 2013 to sample uncertainty in the atmosphere and land surface state four ensemble members were generated for each oic by using atmospheric and land surface initial conditions taken from the instantaneous fields at 0000 utc of the first 4 days in january and may of each year the total number of ensemble members is 16 4 oics x 4 aic lics for both january and may cases the computations were made on the extreme science and engineering discovery environment xsede high performance computing platform towns et al 2014 january was chosen as a focus because the influence of enso is strongest at that time of year in the western pacific ocean maritime continent and indian ocean may cases were selected because at that time the large scale atmospheric circulation over the australian asian is transitioning from the australian region to southeast asia and atmospheric conditions associated with the monsoon over the bob is beginning the ww3 model is forced with daily 10m winds from the cfsv2 rev reforecasts at all lead times up to 42 days six weeks the combination of ww3 with csfv2 rev 10m winds will be referred to as the cfsv2 ww3 system for each oic the ensemble mean of 4 ensemble members is formed to evaluate the role of oic in the cfsv2 ww3 system most of the results discussed in this paper are based on the grand ensemble mean gem of 16 forecasts of all oics in both january and may cases the european centre for medium range forecasts ecmwf interim re analysis era interim dee et al 2011 for the 30 year period 1979 2008 is employed for comparison in the present study the daily values were generated from the 6 hourly era interim data and the daily 10m winds were used to force ww3 and produce swh a system referred to below as ecmwf ww3 because the wind applied to ww3 is a reanalysis product the output of ecmwf ww3 is referred to as ecmwf ww3 swh the ww3 model has been configured as in lopez and kirtman 2016 and shukla and kinter 2016 over a portion of the wp io 80 180 e 60 s 40 n with a grid resolution of 1 1 including implementing the appropriate bathymetry obstruction grids and land sea mask from the daily swh data wk34 data were generated for january and may cases i e averages of 15 28 january and 15 28 may respectively wk34 wave height anomalies were derived with respect to that wk34 climatology the statistical significance of these patterns is measured point wise using a 2 sided student t test given the sampling size 29 degree of freedom the correlation values for 90 95 98 and 99 significance levels are 0 30 0 35 0 41 and 0 45 in the analysis we have compared swh in two reanalysis namely the european centre for medium range forecasts ecmwf interim re analysis era interim dee et al 2011 and the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 during 1979 2008 in january and may cases the structure and amplitude of swh in ecmwf ww3 are in good agreement with cfsr ww3 output in both cases except the amplitude of swh in ecmwf ww3 is slightly weaker in both cases not shown the inter annual variability of swh anomalies in wk34 are quite similar in both re analyses but the amplitude of the swh variability is slightly lower in ecmwf ww3 than in cfsr ww3 in both january and may cases not shown the eof analysis of swh anomalies at wk34 in january not shown and may cases not shown also finds a high degree of similarity between the two reanalysis the table table s1 provides the variance explained for wk34 swh anomalies by the leading 3 principal components and the pattern correlation coefficient of the 3 leading eofs between the cfsr ww3 and ecmwf ww3 reanalysis based on eof analysis in both january and may cases we have found the leading modes of cfsr ww3 and ecmwf ww3 are statistically significantly correlated but these modes are slightly different in the two reanalysis we use the 10m winds and swh from ecmwf in the manuscript 3 general characteristics of wk34 prediction skill 3 1 the impact of oics on prediction skill of swh at wk34 lead time before discussing the impacts of enso and mjo events on swh at wk34 lead time a brief discussion about the 1979 2008 climatology of 10m winds and swh at wk34 and prediction skill of swh at wk34 in both january and may cases in all oics and gem is required fig s2 shows the climatological mean and corresponding

pattern of the flow over the southern ocean so northwestern pacific bay of bengal bob and south china sea scs are well predicted by the cfsv2 in both cases the model has a negative bias over the so

northwestern pacific mainly 15 n to 25 n in may case and depict negative bias over the so fig s2f fig s3 shows the climatological mean and bias of swh at wk34 in observations and gem and corresponding

spatial structure of ecmwf ww3 swh fig s1a d over the so the equatorial western pacific scs and bob is well captured by the model fig s3b e but a positive bias over so and western pacific occurs in both january and may fig s3c f the climatology computed separately for each of the four oics produces similar biases in the mean state of swh at wk34 lead time not shown we have used standard procedures to calculate climatology for example for reforecasts initialized in january the climatology was obtained based on 30 year data at wk34 we have not corrected the model bias in climatology in either january or may cases as in part i a 1 year cross validation window procedure is used to calculate the anomaly correlation coefficient acc of swh at wk34 lead time during 1979 2008 fig 1 shows the acc between ecmwf ww3 and predicted gem swh anomalies at wk34 for january cases fig 1a the acc is significant over the equatorial western pacific scs bob and southern indian ocean io for may cases

wk34 in the so in both january fig 1c and may fig 1d fig 2 depicts the acc of the swh at wk34 in reforecasts initialized in january cases with different ocean analyses we have found that there are some differences in prediction skill using different oics over the western pacific for example the ora s3 fig 2c initialized reforecasts are more skillful over the western pacific mainly 130 150 e 5 s 15 n than those with other oics the prediction skill over the bob scs and northern western pacific are similar in all oics fig 2 the rmse in all oics have similar magnitude over the region of significant skill of swh anomalies at wk34 not shown with higher rmse in the so the acc at wk34 fig s4 in may cases shows that prediction skill over the bob and equatorial western pacific is similar in all oics but there are substantial differences in prediction skill with different oics over the maritime continent and southern io the gem prediction skill at wk34 is generally better than that for any individual oic in both january and may cases only the gem will be analyzed in the remainder of this paper we have found that swha model ensemble spread mes at wk34 of january initialized reforecasts fig 3 c is comparable to the variance of swh anomalies for wk34 of january in ecmwf ww3 fig 3b we have found considerable variability in the southern ocean and northwestern pacific regions and low variability within the region 20 n to 20 s in both mes and ecmwf ww3 swh variance the model has less bias fig 3a in the region where mes fig 3c is low fig 3d shows the spatial distribution of mes versus the ensemble mean rmse for swha at wk34 to identify the regions where there is potential predictability mes rmse 1 or over confidence mes rmse 1 johnson and bowler 2009 palmer et al 2004 weisheimer et al 2009 the mes rmse ratio is larger than 1 in the southern ocean and northwestern pacific which may be a reflection of low potential predictability the mes rmse ratio is less than 1 within the region 20 n to 20 s which means the prediction tends to be over confident zhu et al 2013 in the may cases it is also found that the swha mes at wk34 fig 4 c is comparable to the variance of swh anomalies in ecmwf ww3 fig 4b and there is large swh variability in the southern ocean and bay of bengal it is also found that model has a large bias fig 4a in the region where mes fig 4c is high the mes rmse ratio fig 4d is larger than 1 in the southern ocean southern indian ocean southern western pacific and northwestern pacific which may be a reflection of low potential predictability there the mes rmse ratio fig 4d is less than 1 within the region equator to 20 n which means the prediction tends to be over confident in this region the brier skill score mason 2004 has been computed for six regions in the western pacific and indian ocean wp io area as in shukla and kinter 2016 see fig 11 of part i the regions are labeled southern ocean so southern indian ocean sio southwest pacific swp south china sea scs northwest pacific nwp and bay of bengal bob in each domain the thresholds delimiting the upper and lower thirds of the historical record terciles are calculated from the observations 1979 2008 the 16 ensemble members are then sorted into above normal near normal and below normal categories according to the tercile thresholds as a result the forecast probability is defined by the percentage of ensemble members falling in each tercile i e the counting method following mason 2004 and van den dool et al 2017 the brier skill score bss wilks 2006 is defined by bss 1 b s fcst b s control where bscontrol is the brier score bs of always predicting climatology which in this case means always predicting 1 3 the bss value is positive forecasts better than climatology over the bob scs and sio in january cases table 1 and bob scs sio and swp for may cases table 1 3 2 the spatial distributions of slp at wk34 in order to understand the origin of variations in 10m winds at sub seasonal time scales that drive the swh anomalies the climatology and variability of the mean sea level pressure slp at wk34 over the wp io region predicted by cfsv2 rev in both january and may cases is compared to observations in january the cfsv2 rev fig s5b at wk34 qualitatively captures the main observed slp pattern fig s5a over the wp io region the slp centers in the southern hemisphere mainly between 45 s to 30 s and northern hemisphere mainly between 20 n and 35 n are well predicted by cfsv2 rev quantitatively the model has a negative bias of up to 2 hpa within the tropical belt and a positive bias in the southern hemisphere mainly between 60 s and 45 s fig s5c during may the magnitude and pattern of slp of observations fig s5d over the so bob scs and northwestern pacific regions in wk34 are well predicted by the model fig s5e but there is a positive bias over so the inter annual variability iav of slp at wk34 over wp io are displayed in fig s6 the model fig s6b e reasonably predicts at wk34 main features of iav of slp of observations fig s6a d in both january and may for example higher variability of slp in the so is found in observations as well as model predictions at wk34 the magnitude of slp variability in cfsv2 rev is underestimated compared to observations over entire so with a deficit of up to 3 0 hpa but the predicted slp variability is similar to observations within the tropical belt 4 impact of the enso state on swh slp and 10m winds at wk34 many studies have shown that ocean and atmospheric conditions over the asian monsoon region are influenced by enso states e g alexander et al 2002 lau and nath 2003 and shukla and kinter 2014 as well as many others to explore the impact of el niño and la niña states on swh at wk34 as well as the mechanisms for their influence a composite analysis of swh 10m wind and slp in the observations and the cfsv2 ww3 gem has been performed for the period 1979 2008 we have selected four el niño events namely 1983 1987 1992 and 1998 and four la niña events 1989 1999 2000 and 2008 for our analysis we have only selected those el nino and la nina events in january that persist until may fig s7 shows the year to year variation of nino3 4 index anomalies from the optimum interpolation analysis version 2 oiv2 sea surface temperature sst dataset reynolds et al 2007 and january fig s7a and may fig s7b initialized cfsv2 reforecasts in wk34 the model successfully captures the amplitude and sign in both cases correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted nino3 4 anomalies are 0 99 for the january and 0 91 for may at 3 4 weeks lead time in both january and may cases the model successfully captures spatial structure and magnitude of sst anomalies at wk34 during el niño and la niña composites fig s8 in january fig 5 a and b shows the composite of swh anomalies swha hereafter during the el niño events in ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 respectively while the corresponding patterns of slp anomalies slpa and 10m wind anomalies are displayed in fig 6 a and b the composite ecmwf swha pattern fig 5a has positive anomalies in the so mainly 120 165 e 60 40 s and equatorial western pacific and centers of negative swha in the central io we have found that the positive swha in the so is aligned along the northern flank of the below normal pressure anomaly fig 6a colored shading where westerly wind anomalies fig 6a vectors act on a westerly mean state thereby increasing the total wind speed and hence increasing the swh conversely negative swha over the central io is aligned along the southern flank of the enhanced pressure anomaly where westerly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state thus reducing the total wind speed and reducing the swh fig 5a and fig 6a a band of strong westerly wind anomalies occurs near equator from the western pacific to the central pacific ocean which is a typical el niño response almost all the important features of observed el niño events are well predicted by the model fig 5b and fig 6b at wk34 lead time including negative swha in the central io and positive swha over the so and equatorial western pacific fig 5b the model also captures both reduced slpa over the so and enhanced slpa over the central io and the direction of the 10m wind anomalies over the so and equatorial io figures 5c d and 6c d show the spatial patterns of swha slpa and 10m winds anomalies in composite analysis during la niña events in both ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 in wk34 of january as expected the spatial pattern of ecmwf swha fig 5c has positive swha over the western pacific and scs and negative anomalies over the so mainly around 50 s to 40 s and northwestern pacific mainly around 30 n it is observed that the positive swha in the western pacific locates to be aligned along the northern flank of the below normal pressure anomaly fig 6c colored shading where an easterly wind anomalies fig 6c vectors act on an easterly mean state conversely negative swha over the so is aligned along the northern flank of the enhanced pressure anomaly where an easterly wind anomalies act on westerly mean state fig 5c and fig 6c a band of strong easterly wind anomalies flow from the central pacific ocean to the western pacific near the equator in observations as is typical during la niña events in general the model fig 5d and fig 6d is able to predict the typical features of observed la niña events at wk34 lead time but the magnitude of swha fig 5d is weaker in the so and western pacific the sign of slpa is well predicted fig 6d colored shading at wk34 over so io and western pacific and also direction of 10m wind anomalies over the so and near the equator in the equatorial western pacific fig 6d fig 7 depicts the composite may swha during el niño events and la niña events in ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 while the corresponding patterns of slpa and 10m winds are shown in fig s9 during el niño events negative swha fig 7a occurs in the bob and scs where an easterly wind anomalies fig s9a vectors act on a westerly mean state and positive swha occurs in the so where westerly wind anomalies fig s9a vectors act on a westerly mean state in ecmwf ww3 the model fig 7b successfully captures the sign of swha over the bob and scs but model erroneously produces dipole like structure in the so where ecmwf ww3 depicts monopole during la niña events the ecmwf ww3 fig 7c depicts positive swha at wk34 over the bob where westerly wind anomalies fig s9c vectors act on a westerly mean state and dipole kind of structure in the so mainly between 60 s and 35 s the sign of swha and 10m wind anomalies over the bob is captured by cfsv2 ww3 fig 7c fig s9d the model is not able to correctly reproduce swha and 10m winds over the so during la niña events 5 impact of the mjo events on swh within weeks 3 4 lead time recent studies stopa et al 2013 and marshall et al 2015 discussed the observed mjo impacts on swha as described in section 1 to evaluate the mjo impact on wk34 predictions of swha the composite daily swha and 10m wind in the era interim and gem during 1979 2008 are analyzed the real time multivariate rmm1 and rmm2 indices wheeler and hendon 2004 are used to construct composites on each day the amplitude r m m 1 2 r m m 2 2 and phase tan 1 r m m 2 r m m 1 are computed strong persistent mjo events are defined when the rmm index amplitude is greater than 1 5 standard deviations and persists a minimum of 2 days as shown by neena et al 2014 the ensemble mean prediction skill of mjo in the cfsv2 model is 18 days kim et al 2014 have mentioned that the prediction skill of mjo is 21 days in the cfsv2 model the mjo eastward propagation speed is slower and its amplitude is weaker in cfsv2 than observation therefore we have combined mjo phases 8 and 1 phase 8 1 western hemisphere and africa phases 2 and 3 phase 2 3 indian ocean phases 4 and 5 phase 4 5 maritime continent and phases 6 and 7 phase 6 7 western pacific we found that may initialized wk3 4 reforecasts produce skillful predictions of swha during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo we also found that january initialized reforecasts are able to capture the tendency of swha within wk3 4 during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo the eof analysis is performed for outgoing longwave radiation olr anomalies at wk34 and wks3 4 in order to explore the prediction skill of leading modes of olr in both january and may as discussed in shukla 2014 and shukla and zhu 2014 the eof analysis of olr anomalies is performed for wk34 fig s10a b c d 30 samples and within wk3 4 fig s10e f g h 420 samples during 1979 2008 in both ecmwf ww3 and january initialized reforecasts the two modes together explain 44 4 20 8 and 46 47 31 0 of the variance in ecmwf ww3 and january initialized reforecast at wk34 within wk3 4 the amplitudes of the olr perturbations at the major centers of action of eof 1 and eof 2 range up to 19 w m 2 per standard deviation of the respective standardized principal coefficients pcs 1 and 2 in both cases wk34 and wk3 4 of observations in both cases the model is able to capture the sign of eof 1 and eof 2 but the amplitude of olr anomalies is weaker in both cases correlation coefficients between observed and predicted pc1 are 0 80 0 70 for the wk34 wk3 4 in january and 0 31 0 33 for pc2 in wk34 wk3 4 the model is not able to capture pc2 in both cases of january which may imply that the model is not correctly predicting the eastward propagation in january cases we have also performed eof analysis of olr anomalies in wk34 fig s11a b c d and within wk3 4 fig s11e f g h in both ecmwf ww3 and may initialized reforecasts the two modes together explain 32 4 14 04 and 43 0 26 6 variance in observation and may initialized reforecast at wk34 within wk3 4 respectively the amplitudes of the olr perturbations at the major centers of action of eof 1 and eof 2 range up to 15 w m 2 per standard deviation of the standardized pc1 and pc2 in both cases wk34 and wk3 4 of observation the amplitude of olr anomalies in eof 1 and eof 2 of model is weaker in both wk34 and wk3 4 correlation coefficients between observed and predicted pc1 are 0 57 0 35 for the wk34 wk3 4 in may and 0 73 0 52 for pc2 in wk34 wk3 4 we have found that prediction skill of pc2 in may initialized reforecasts is slightly better than january case fig 8 shows may composite swha during mjo phase 2 3 which is based on 36 days and phase 6 7 that is based 92 days in ecmwf ww3 and cfsv2 ww3 respectively while the corresponding composite patterns of the 10m winds anomalies is shown in figs 9 the ecmwf composite swha fig 8a is negative over the bob and scs during phase 2 3 and positive during phase 6 7 fig 8c significant positive negative swha occurs over the maritime continent timor sea arafura sea bismarck sea coral sea and on the northwest shelf of australia during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 negative positive swha in phase 2 3 phase 6 7 over the bob and scs is associated with negative anomalies of 10m winds where an easterly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state positive anomalies of 10m winds where westerly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state in ecmwf fig 9a c the composite of swha depicts dipole kind of structure in the so in both phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo with negative positive swha centers at 90 e and 140 e during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 consistent with swha in the so the 10m wind anomalies are negative and positive at these centers in phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 fig 9a c the cfsv2 ww3 successfully captures the sign and amplitude of swha at wk34 over the bob and scs in phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo fig 8b d the model captures the sign of swha over the timor sea arafura sea coral sea and southern io mainly between 45 s and 33 s 80 e and 110 e in both phases the model captures observed features of swha at locations where there is significant skill in general at wk34 lead time fig 1b the model predicts negative positive anomalies of 10m wind fig 9b d over the bob and scs during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 a similar composite analysis for january in wk3 4 was performed during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 the ecmwf swha fig s13 and fig s14 and 10m wind anomalies show important characteristics in composite analysis during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo but the model composite structures initialized in january are only able to capture tendency of swha over the maritime continent at wk3 4 6 leading patterns of swh at wk34 an empirical orthogonal function analysis eof e g thompson and wallace 1998 was used to identify robust spatial and temporal patterns of swh in the wp io region there is significant spatial variability of observed swha not shown in the wp io region ranging from 0 1 to 1 1 in both january and may cases to remove the effect of enhanced variability in the eof analysis the swh biweekly mean anomalies are first normalized as in shukla and huang 2015a b fig 10 a b c depicts the correlation between the may swh anomalies at wk34 and the first three leading principal components pcs of swh anomalies in the wp io region in observation ecmwf ww3 the correlation coefficient cc at or above 90 95 98 and 99 confidence levels are shown the three leading modes of swha in may at wk34 explain 16 86 12 64 and 12 34 of the variance respectively the leading eof eof 1 may fig 10a is dominated by a significant positive correlation over the western pacific and bob eof 2 may fig 10b depicts statistically significance negative correlation of swha over the so and equatorial io and positive correlation in the southern portion of western pacific mainly 155 180 e 30 20 s the pattern of eof 3 may has positive correlation over the bob and scs and negative correlation over the so fig 10c pc1 may is significantly correlated cc 0 41 with the simultaneous nino3 4 sst index and the other two modes are not significantly correlated with enso in may to what extent are the leading modes of may swha in wk34 associated with mjo the correlation between real time multivariate rmm1 and rmm2 index averages of 15 28 may wheeler and hendon 2004 and the first three leading pcs of may swha in observations are mentioned in table 2 pc1 may and pc2 may are significantly associated with mjo table 1 there are significant positive correlations of pc1 may with both rmm1 and rmm2 suggesting a relationship with phase 5 or 6 of mjo since pc1 may is also significantly negatively correlated with nino3 4 it may influence by combined effects of the enso and mjo consistent with above relationship eof 1 may depicts positive swha over the western pacific ocean and bob fig 10a pc2 may is only significantly correlated with rmm2 for cfsv2 ww3 gem reforecasts we have projected the swha at wk34 on the ecmwf ww3 eofs by projecting the reforecast time series onto each observed eigenvector straus and shukla 2002 and then calculating the correlation of the reforecast at each grid point with the projected time series the correlations between may swha in wk34 in cfsv2 ww3 with the first three projected pcs are shown in fig 10 d e f the spatial patterns of swh variability in the model fig 10d e f are in good agreement with the observations fig 10a b c over the western pacific bob southern io and so the pattern correlation coefficients between the ecmwf and reforecasts are 0 72 for eof 1 may 0 81 for eof 2 may and 0 73 for eof 3 may correlation coefficients between observed and predicted time series are 0 31 for pc1 may 0 47 for pc2 may and 0 27 for pc3 may based on the spatial and temporal correlations cfsv2 ww3 is reasonably predicting the leading modes of may swha at wk34 lead times fig 11 shows the correlation between january swh anomalies at wk34 with the first three leading pcs of swh anomalies in the ecmwf ww3 the dominant modes of january swha explain 16 07 13 42 and 10 26 of the variance respectively the leading eof 1 jan fig 11a is dominated by a significant negative correlation over the so central io and equatorial western pacific and positive correlation over northwestern pacific mainly around 30 n eof 2 jan fig 11b has a dipole pattern with negative anomaly over the equatorial io and positive anomaly over the central western pacific and scs the eof 3 jan fig 11c is also a dipole pattern with negative anomaly over the central western pacific and positive anomaly over the so only pc3 jan of swha in wk34 is significantly positively correlated cc 0 64 with the simultaneous nino3 4 sst index which implies suppressed 10m winds and wave activity in the western pacific and bob to evaluate the effects of the mjo on the leading pcs correlation between first three pcs jan and the real time multivariate rmm1 and rmm2 index averages of 15 28 january are display in table 3 based on table 2 it is observed that pc1 jan and pc3 jan of swha at wk34 are significantly associated with mjo a significant negative correlation is found between pc3 jan and rmm1 we may conclude that the combined effects of the enso and mjo influence eof4 3 jan for january cfsv2 ww3 gem reforecasts we have projected the swh anomalies at wk34 on the observed eofs straus and shukla 2002 the correlation between january swha reforecasts in wk34 and the first three projected pcs are shown in fig 11 d e f the spatial patterns of swha in the model fig 11d e f are in good agreement with the ecmwf ww3 fig 11a b c over the equatorial western pacific southern io and so the cfsv2 ww3 reforecasts fail to reproduce positive anomaly over northwestern pacific mainly around 30 n in eof 1 jan and positive correlation over scs in eof2 jan eof 3 jan of model has a large negative correlation over much of the central io than ecmwf ww3 the pattern ccs of swha between the reforecasts and the observations are 0 72 for eof 1 jan 0 77 for eof 2 jan and 0 72 for eof 3 jan the ccs between reforecasts and observed swha pc time series are 0 27 for pc 1 jan 0 54 for pc 2 jan and 0 59 for pc 3 jan based on the spatial and temporal correlations we may conclude that cfsv2 ww3 is able to predict the leading modes of ecmwf ww3 at wk34 in january case 7 summary and discussion we examined the capability of using a coupled model cfsv2 rev to predict 10m winds in order to force an ocean surface wave model ww3 to predict biweekly averages of significant wave height anomalies swha at 3 weeks lead time wk34 in january and may cases over a 30 year period 1979 2008 we also evaluated the effects of enso and mjo events on swha sea level pressure anomaly slpa and 10m wind anomalies the ww3 model was forced with daily 10m wind from the ecmwf reanalysis as a proxy for swh observations the cfsv2 rev model was initialized with four different sets of ocean initial conditions oic the grand ensemble mean of 16 members 4 oics each having 4 atmosphere and land surface initial conditions was used to provide more robust estimates of the predicted quantities the combined model cfsv2 ww3 has significant skill in predicting swha at wk34 in january over several regions within the indian and west pacific oceans notably the equatorial western pacific scs bob and the southern io for the may cases there is prediction skill over the bob equatorial western pacific 150 e 180 e 20 s 5 n the maritime continent and southern io 87 120 e 47 25 s both el niño and la niña events have effects on swh in the wp io region in january and may el niño events in january are associated with positive swh anomalies in the so aligned with below normal pressure anomaly where westerly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state therefore enhanced swh negative swha in the central io aligned with enhanced pressure anomaly where an easterly wind anomalies act on a westerly mean state therefore suppressed swh the model successfully predicts the ecmwf ww3 features of swha at wk34 the model also predicts negative slpa over the so and positive slpa over the central io as well as the direction of 10m winds anomalies over the so and equatorial io during la niña events the observed swha is positive over the equatorial western pacific and scs where an easterly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state and negative over the so mainly around 50 40 s where westerly wind anomalies act on an easterly mean state the model is able to predict the typical features of observed la niña events at wk34 but the magnitude of swha is weaker in the so and equatorial western pacific in january cases during may the model reproduces the sign of swha at wk34 over the bob and scs but produces erroneously dipole like structure in the so where ecmwf ww3 depicts monopole during el niño events during la niña events the model predicts positive swha at wk34 over the bob as in ecmwf ww3 but not able to capture structure of observed swha over the so the model predicts the impact of mjo events on swha at wk3 4 in may cases including the negative anomalies over the bob and scs during phase 2 3 of mjo and positive anomalies during phase 6 7 of mjo over the bob the negative positive anomalies of 10m winds over the bob during phase 2 3 phase 6 7 are also correct in model the sign of swha over timor sea arafura sea coral sea and southern io mainly between 45 s and 33 s is correctly predicted in both phases of mjo model also able to predict tendency of swha at wk3 4 of january over the maritime continents during phase 2 3 and phase 6 7 of mjo the leading mode of ecmwf ww3 swha variability in may is dominated by positive anomalies over the western pacific and bob and the analysis shows that it is influenced by combined effects of the enso and mjo the spatial pattern of the first three leading modes of predicted swha variability in may are in good agreement with the observations over the western pacific and bob in eof 1 southern io in eof 2 and so in eof 3 the leading mode eof 1 of ecmwf ww3 swha variability in january depicts negative anomalies over the so central io and wpo and positive correlation over northern western pacific in january the leading mode of swha variability is related to mjo while eof 3 jan is influenced both by mjo and enso the reforecasts capture much of the variability of swha at wk34 in leading modes of ecmwf ww3 the sub seasonal skill of reforecasts of significant wave heights is degraded by the very consistent spatial pattern of bias in the mean 10m wind as a function of lead time the bias along with the error in variance of the surface wind which diminishes with lead time can therefore be corrected a posteriori the ocean surface waves driven by the corrected winds are likely to be more accurate than the swh forecasts described a possibility that will be explored in subsequent work

24124,the target seas of tidal current models are usually semi closed bays minimally affected by ocean currents for these models tidal currents are simulated in computational domains with a spatial scale of a couple hundred kilometers or less by setting tidal elevations at their open boundaries however when ocean currents cannot be ignored in the sea areas of interest such as in open seas near coastlines it is necessary to include ocean current effects in these tidal current models in this study we developed a numerical method to analyze tidal currents near coasts by incorporating pre calculated ocean current velocities first a large regional scale simulation with a spatial scale of several thousand kilometers was conducted and temporal changes in the ocean current velocity at each grid point were stored next the spatially and temporally interpolated ocean current velocity was incorporated as forcing into the cross terms of the convection term of a tidal current model having computational domains with spatial scales of hundreds of kilometers or less then we applied this method to the diffusion of dissolved co2 in a sea area off tomakomai japan and compared the numerical results and measurements to validate the proposed method keywords tidal current model regional scale ocean model carbon capture and storage co2 leakage co2 diffusion in the ocean two phase flow 1 introduction carbon dioxide capture and storage ccs is expected to be a promising solution to global warming and there are plans to demonstrate offshore sub seabed storage experiments worldwide however geological storage has a non zero risk of leakage to the seawater recently a seepage demonstration called the quantifying and monitoring potential ecosystem impacts of geological carbon storage qics project was conducted in a small bay in scotland the report blackford et al 2014 states that its physical chemical and biological impacts were not significant in the bay and that the effects of seeping co2 nearly disappeared approximately one month after the co2 injection stopped this may be because the mass of the injected co2 was limited 80 to 200 kg day although the seepage rate per unit area was not very small compared to those of natural seepage sites e g kikawadaet al 2009 mori et al 2015 conducted a numerical simulation of the mass transfer of the dissolved co2 within this bay and found that non trivial concentrations of co2 are detected only in the vicinity close to the seepage site that is within a circle with a diameter of approximately 200 m in general it is meaningful to examine the fate of dissolved co2 very close to the seepage site e g on a spatial scale of a few kilometers or less and because the injection site and the consequent and possible seepage site are usually in the coastal areas tidal currents cannot be ignored when evaluating the seepage impact on the environment kano et al 2010 assessed the impact of co2 in a sea area using the mec co2 model and found that the adverse effect of leaked co2 into a sea area can be negligible when the seepage rate is the same as that of the real leakage case reported by klusman 2003 here the mec model e g mizumukai et al 2008 sato et al 2006 is a tidal current model and is applicable to semi closed bays where the effects of ocean currents are sufficiently small the mec model has a special feature that it can include a small scale non hydrostatic model domain of a couple of kilometers or less in which vertical flows around artificial marine structures can be simulated nested within a mesoscale hydrostatic model domain of a couple of hundred kilometers or less kano et al 2009 added a function to treat co2 bubble two phase flow in the small scale non hydrostatic model domain this modified version is called the mec co2 model since april 2016 the japanese ministry of economy trade and industry has been conducting a field demonstration experiment of geological co2 storage offshore of tomakomai hokkaido japan the japanese ministry of environment has also been conducting measurements of the background chemistry and biology in this sea area for a couple of years the sea area off tomakomai is not a semi closed bay and is influenced by the chishima current from the okhotsk sea the tsugaru current from the tsugaru strait and accompanying mesoscale eddies therefore these ocean currents play important roles for the advection of the dissolved co2 off tomakomai however as mentioned above most tidal current models usually target bay areas with minimal effects from ocean currents such as semi closed bays or inlets with spatial scales of a couple hundred kilometers or less in these models tidal elevations are imposed at the open boundaries of the computational domains and currents caused by the imposed tidal movements are simulated in the domains if ocean currents the origins of which are phenomena with spatial scales larger than the computational domain cannot be ignored these tidal models are not sufficient to analyze the mass transfer within the sea areas of interest for ocean models targeting far offshore regional scale seas in which the spatial scale is a couple thousand kilometers or more ocean currents are the primary driving force of the advection of mass and heat in these models the periodic motions of tides and their effects are usually trivial and hence ignored on the other hand to calculate currents in the coastal zones tidal effects cannot be ignored and usually tidal forcing is incorporated in the shape of the external force in the momentum equation in addition to the high resolution with without nesting techniques e g moon 2005 schiller and fiedler 2007 arbic et al 2012 higashi et al 2015 kumar et al 2015 tsumune et al 2012 uchiyama et al 2010 warner et al 2008 among them an important work was conducted by shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 who developed the regional ocean modeling system roms they fitted in small time steps for the barotropic mode within one baroclinic time step although incorporating fine grids and tidal surface elevations in ocean current models is certainly a solution to analyze ocean and tidal currents simultaneously these models are still computationally costly because their target domains have spatial scales of several thousand kilometers and the grid sizes near the coastlines are at most a couple hundreds of meters if the spatial scale of interest is hundreds of kilometers necessary resolution is tens to hundreds of meters and the time range of interest is less than a month tidal current models with ocean current effects are no doubt welcomed by researchers who are interested in small mesoscale flows near coastlines in this study we developed a numerical method to analyze tidal currents including the effects of ocean currents as a forcing component and applied the method to the dispersion of co2 bubbles and the diffusion of dissolved co2 both of which are seeping from a seafloor off tomakomai because the interaction between the ocean and tidal currents is thought to be nonlinear the total currents should not be a simple summation of the interpolated ocean currents and the mesoscale tidal currents nihei et al 2003 conducted pioneering work for forcing components and its fluctuations in their nesting method hirabayashi and sato 2010a b developed low wavenumber forcing for turbulence generation jeong et al 2010 2011 applied the low wavenumber forcing to a multi scale ocean model to analyze the ocean currents in a mesoscale domain using moving nesting grids first a large regional scale model simulation with a spatial scale of a couple thousand kilometres was conducted and temporal changes in the ocean current velocity at each grid point were stored in the computer s memory here we adopted the roms as the large scale ocean current model then this velocity was spatially and temporally interpolated at the grid points of a mesoscale computational domain of a tidal current model the mec co2 model to treat the bubbly two phase flows 2 theory 2 1 mesoscale hydrostatic model 2 1 1 general hydrostatic model both for ocean and tidal currents the governing equations of a numerical model both for ocean and tidal currents are the navier stokes equations approximated using the hydrostatic assumption and the continuum equation 1 u h t u u h f 1 ρ 0 p k u h ρ t s c ρ 0 g 2 u 0 where u u v w m s is the total velocity of ocean and tidal currents in which u v and w are its components in the cartesian x east west y south north and z vertical directions respectively u h u v 0 is its horizontal component p kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure ρ kg m3 is the sea water density which is a function of temperature t c salinity s psu and the concentration of some other specific material c kg m3 such as the total concentration of dissolved co2 tco2 ρ0 is its standard density g 0 0 g m s2 is the gravity vector in which g is the gravitational acceleration k k h x k h y k v z m s is the nabla including the eddy kinetic viscosity in which kh m2 s and kv m2 s are the horizontal and vertical components respectively and f fv fu 0 m s2 is the coriolis force in which f 1 s is the coriolis parameter open boundary conditions for eqs 1 and 2 are given as either traction including pressure or velocity normally for tidal current models both the normal and tangential gradients of tidal current velocity components are set to be 0 as long as the open boundary is located within a calm sea area with flat topography and little eddy effects therefore only pressure i e sea surface elevation for hydrostatic models is set at the open boundary and a zero gradient neumann condition is imposed for the tidal current velocity as the traction boundary condition if one consider an ocean current model without tidal current effects ocean current velocity is imposed as a dirichlet condition at the open boundary as the velocity boundary condition this means that a neumann and a dirichlet conditions for the tidal and ocean current components respectively coexist on the same open boundary obviously this is impossible because u is not separated into such components yet however if tidal currents are trivial compared to ocean currents as in the case of considerably offshore ocean it is acceptable to give only ocean current velocity as a dirichlet boundary condition for u the advection diffusion equation is given as 3 q t u q a q where q is a conservative quantity such as t s or c and a a h x a h y a v z m s is nabla including the eddy kinetic diffusivity in which ah m2 s and av m2 s are the horizontal and vertical components respectively the boundary condition of eq 3 is the quantity considering both ocean and tidal currents 2 1 2 tidal current model with one way ocean current forcing imposing a neumann and a dirichlet conditions on unseparated tidal and ocean currents respectively within u at the same time on the same open boundary is impossible when tidal current velocity cannot be ignored compared to the ocean currents as in the case of usual coastal zones to overcome this problem we do not use the ocean currents as the open boundary condition but as a forcing component in the governing equation of a tidal current model after nihei et al 2003 when u in eqs 1 and 2 is divided into the velocity of the ocean currents without tidal effects u o and the residual velocity other than u o u t u u o eqs 1 and 2 are rewritten as 4 u o h u t h t u o u t u o h u t h f o f t 1 ρ 0 p o p t k u o h u t h ρ t o t t s o s t c o c t ρ 0 g 5 u o u t 0 where u o uo vo wo m s is the velocity of the ocean currents without tidal effects u o h uo vo 0 is its horizontal component po kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u o f o fvo fuo 0 m s2 is the coriolis force m s2 for the ocean currents without tidal effects to so and co are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u o u t u t v t w t m s is the residual velocity other than u o out of the total velocity u u o u t u t h u t v t 0 is its horizontal component p t kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u t fv t fu t 0 m s2 is the coriolis force for u t t t s t and c t are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u t if an ocean current model computes the ocean currents without tidal current effects the governing equation should be 6 u o t u o u o h f o 1 ρ 0 p o k u o h ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g 7 u o 0 subtracting eqs 6 and 7 from eqs 4 and 5 respectively results in a new set of governing equations for the residual u t 8 u t t u t u o h u o u t u t h f t 1 ρ 0 p t k u t h ρ t o t t s o s t c o c t ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g 9 u t 0 eqs 8 and 9 are the new governing equations to solve in this study here we find that the differences between the original governing equations 1 and 2 and the new governing equations 8 and 9 are the cross terms of the convection term and the buoyancy term this indicates that currents in the ocean are not a simple summation of tidal and ocean currents u u o u t u o u t where u t is the tidal current velocity without ocean current effects and that we should take into account the one way forcing of ocean currents via the convection term in this study eqs 6 and 7 are solved using the roms and eqs 8 and 9 are solved using the mec model because u o must not include tidal effects the roms simulation in this study does not include tidal effects intentionally note that to obtain eq 8 kh and kv should be the same in both eqs 4 and 6 in this study we used the richardson s 3 4 power law model for kh and the stratification model for kv for both the tidal mec and the ocean roms current models the boundary condition for u t is the zero gradient neumann condition with the tidal elevation u o in eq 8 may be replaced by the measured velocity as long as the data do not include tidal effects to exclude the tidal flow constituents averaging for the diurnal or semi diurnal period may be useful because grid systems of a large regional scale ocean current model are usually larger than those of a mesoscale tidal current model the convection velocity u excludes subgrid components which can be resolved by grids of a tidal current model but not by those of an ocean current model in addition the numerical errors originating from the discretization of the convection and diffusion terms are also different when the grid sizes of the ocean current and the tidal current models are different this may lead to a difference in kh because the richardson s 4 3 power law model uses the grid size therefore even though it is difficult to use the same grid systems it is better if the grids of the two models are as close as possible similarly it is possible to obtain the governing equations of ocean currents with forcing of tidal currents the governing equations of the residual velocity u o other than tidal current velocity without ocean current effects u t out of the total velocity u u o u t however it may not be very practical to analyze u o in regional scale domains because its computational cost may not be very different from analyzing ocean currents together with setting tidal elevations at the open boundaries of regional domains 2 1 3 tidal current model with two way ocean current forcing if the second term on the left hand side of eq 8 moves to the governing equation of the ocean current eq 6 then we can have two way forcing both for the tidal and ocean currents 10 u o t u t u o u o h f o 1 ρ 0 p o k u o h ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g 11 u t t u o u t u t h f t 1 ρ 0 p t k u t h ρ t o t t s o s t c o c t ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g where u o u o v o w o m s is the velocity of the ocean currents without tidal effects u o h u o v o 0 is its horizontal component p o kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u o f o fv o fu o 0 m s2 is the coriolis force m s2 for the ocean currents without tidal effects t o s o and c o are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u o u t u t v t w t m s is the residual velocity other than u o out of the total velocity u u o u t u t h u t v t 0 is its horizontal component p t kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u t f t fv t fu t 0 m s2 is the coriolis force for u t t t s t and c t are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u t the difference of this two way forcing from the one way using eq 8 is that in the case of the one way forcing ocean currents are analyzed in advance using eqs 6 and 7 and later the resultant velocities are stored and used as the forcing component in eq 8 and that in the case of this two way forcing both the ocean and tidal currents are analyzed simultaneously it is noted that in order to make this two way forcing effective both the ocean and tidal current models would better have the same resolutions in space and time to avoid interpolation of velocity at every time step 2 2 small scale non hydrostatic model we divided one of the computational cells of the mesoscale hydrostatic model domain with a horizontal size of kilometers to tens of kilometers into very fine cells for the small scale non hydrostatic model domain with a size of tens of meters to hundreds of meters where we consider the vertical flow to be significant the governing equations of this small scale model are the fully three dimensional 3d navier stokes equations and the continuum equation in addition for the two phase flow simulation considering the co2 bubble plume we adopted the following eulerian lagrangian method of kano et al

non hydrostatic model including the sub models of cd in eq 19 and k eq 20 are referred to in kano et al 2010 we did not use ocean current forcing in this small scale full 3d model and instead we interpolated u to the small scale boundary grids from the neighbouring mesoscale grids as the boundary condition 3 materials and methods 3 1 numerical scheme and computational conditions the mec model employs a finite difference method to solve the governing equations the small scale non hydrostatic model also adopts a finite difference method with the mac marker and cell algorithm see sato et al 2006 both models employ third order upwinding and second order central differencing schemes for the convection and the diffusion terms respectively the mec model needed 7 days for spin up to settle tidal elevations and currents and vertical stratification of temperature and salinity with atmospheric forcing and river effects the computational conditions for the physical parameters are listed in table 1 3 2 selection of sea site we employed a computational domain fig 1 for the sea site off tomakomai japan the domain size of the mesoscale hydrostatic model was 81 km 20 7 km 100 m with 90 23 32 grids in the x y and z directions respectively the size of each computational cell was 900 m 900 m in the x and y directions respectively and 2 m between the surface and a depth of 40 m and 5 m deeper than 40 m in the z direction the numbers in fig 1 indicate the ctd monitoring locations the numbers with a letter r indicate the locations of the mouths of large rivers and the drainages of large power plants the details of which are stated in table 2 the data from rivers 1 and 2 were obtained from the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism http www1 river go jp for the other rivers we calculated the flow rates assuming that their rates are proportional to their catchment areas we took into account the warm water discharge from the two power plants on this coast as rivers 7 and 8 the temperatures of these discharges were not available to this study therefore in this study we set them to be warmer than the surrounding seawater by 7 c we conducted numerical simulations for two seasons november 2011 and february 2012 3 3 ocean current for the large regional scale ocean currents we used the results of roms which was nudged in temperature and salinity towards the jcope2 data with 1 12 grid miyazawa et al 2009 to incorporate assimilated phenomena such as the tsugaru current these ocean currents are used as forcing components in the mesoscale tidal current model the grid system used in the roms simulations is given in table 3 fig 2 a and b show the velocity vectors calculated by the roms for november 2011 and february 2012 respectively the mesoscale model domain is illustrated by a rectangle at approximately 42 5 n these figures indicate that there is a strong eastbound current through the tsugaru strait it is known that the ocean currents in the mesoscale model domain off tomakomai can have unsteady complicated current systems induced by numerous eddies the ocean current depends on the location and direction of the vortices shed from the eastern exit of the tsugaru strait for co2 diffusion in the mesoscale domain the february case shown in fig 2 b is considered more conservative than that in november 2011 because the ocean current is weak in the area in february 2012 and consequently the co2 concentration may be larger then here the wording conservative means less diffusive and therefore more harmful to marine organisms the grid systems and the time increments for the presented roms and mec calculations are compared in table 3 because the horizontal grid sizes and the vertical coordinate systems are different for mec and roms we interpolated the roms results at the mec grid points trilinearly for the time scale interpolation we used linear interpolation even though both grid sizes should be the same for the accuracy of the mesoscale mec calculation they were slightly different 900 m 900 m for mec and 1 120 about 680 m 680 m for roms moreover the vertical coordinate systems were different mec used the z coordinate system and roms used the s coordinate system shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 therefore there are likely some numerical errors from the discretization in the mec calculation as mentioned in section 2 1 3 4 boundary conditions on the open boundary of the mesoscale domain tidal surface elevations are given as the driving force of the tidal currents we used nao99b matsumoto et al 2000 as a tidal wave model to obtain the amplitudes and phases of the significant tides at the positions of the open boundary we chose the five largest tidal constituents m2 k1 o1 s2 and p1 for which amplitudes are 0 31173 m 0 22896 m 0 18477 m 0 14429 m and 0 07392 m at a point x 40 5 km and y 0 km on the open boundary the boundary conditions of the temperature and salinity play an important role in evaluating the validity of the presented method because of the shape of the mesoscale domain in this study we used the roms results for the boundary and initial conditions of the mec calculation fig 3 a and b show the vertical profiles of t and s at 141 41 95 e 42 28 24 n measured in november 2011 and february 2012 respectively as shown later in figs 9 and 10 in the february case the measurements at points 4 7 and 8 indicate that a potentially unstable thermocline and stable halocline coexisted resulting in a stable stratification as also shown later in fig 6 d in this february there was strong inflow at the west side of the open boundary of the sea area off tomakomai while the current velocity is relatively small in the other area it is inferred from them that the warm tsugaru current coming into the sea area from the west intruded into the lower layer beneath the cold water influenced by inland freshwater however the original roms result profiles of temperature and salinity were uniform in the vertical direction partially because the present roms simulation did not include the effects of inland waters we therefore modified the profile to create a pycnocline at the open boundary in the february case referring to the data at point 7 the south west corner of the 3 3 grid shaped measurement points the climate conditions are listed in table 4 3 5 co2 seepage condition the co2 was set to seep out of the seafloor in the small scale non hydrostatic model domain at cell number i 35 j 10 i e point 7 shown in fig 1 in the mesoscale domain fig 4 a shows the mesoscale cell indicated by a black square into which the small scale domain fits tightly in the small scale domain we assumed that there is a fault which is shown in fig 4 b with a north south length of 510 m 34 cells and an east west width of 30 m 2 cells the seepage rate was set to a realistic value which was an estimated leakage rate of the co2 from an actual ccs eor enhanced oil recovery site klusman 2003 3800 ton co2 year in this study only co2 seeped in the form of bubbles is considered co2 in the dissolved aqueous phase is neglected the bubbles had a sphere equivalent diameter of 15 mm and a gaussian distribution with a deviation of 5 mm the seepage positions of single bubbles were determined randomly on the fault surface 4 results and discussion fig 5 shows a snapshot of the calculated velocity vectors indicated by arrows which are drawn at every 2 grids on the sea surface on day 20 in the november case fig 5 a shows only the tidal velocity without considering the ocean currents u t of eqs 10 and 11 fig 5 b shows the interpolated ocean current velocity u o of eqs 6 and 7 fig 5 c shows the tidal velocity with the ocean current effects u t of eqs 8 and 9 and fig 5 d shows the total velocity of the tidal and ocean currents u u o u t it is obvious that u o is dominant in this november fig 5 b and that u t u u o does not succeed the fast inflow and outflow of u t in the west half of the open boundary fig 5 a and c instead we can observe rather disarrayed velocity vectors at the west open boundary and a south ward flow almost along the edge of the shallow shelf at x 5400 m in fig 5 c slight signs of these flows remain in the total velocity field u fig 5 d fig 6 also shows the calculated velocity vectors in the february case in the same order as those shown in fig 5 because the ocean current is very small in february as seen in fig 6 b compared to fig 5 b the difference in the tidal currents between those shown in fig 6 a and c seems smaller than that between those shown in fig 5 a and c fig 6 a and d shows that u t and u have quite fast inflow and outflow at the west side of the open boundary this may have non trivial influences on the particular stratifications at points 4 7 and 8 shown later in figs 9 and 10 the velocity fields in fig 5 a and 5 d and 6 a and 6 d are used for the co2 fate simulations a without and d with ocean current effects in the november and february cases respectively fig 7 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated temperatures in c on day 25 in the november case at the monitoring points shown in fig 1 the solid line indicates the measured temperature and the closed and open dots indicate the calculated temperature with and without the ocean current effects respectively in general in nearly all the figures the calculated profiles with ocean current effects are closer to the measurements than those calculated without ocean currents the average errors between measured and calculated temperature values tmes tcal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 5 89 10 1 c and 9 49 10 1 c respectively the sea surface temperature in the case without ocean currents the open dots is peculiarly low at all the points this may be due to the low temperature river water and the unrealistically slow tidal currents along the coastline of tomakomai however the temperatures in the upper halves of the vertical profiles are slightly larger than those in the lower halves particularly at points 6 and 9 it is thought that this is due to the slightly higher temperature water coming from the shallow shelf in the bay that is entering the northeast area of this computational domain and these two points located at the edge of the shallow shelf as seen in fig 1 it can be seen that the case with ocean currents the closed dots simulates these measured stratified profiles better than the cases without ocean currents the open dots fig 8 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated salinities in psu on the same day and at the same monitoring points as those in fig 7 for the november case the measured salinity profiles do not indicate stratification and are nearly constant in the vertical direction the calculated salinity profiles both with and without ocean current effects also demonstrate similar tendencies even though the calculated profile without ocean current effects erroneously emphasizes the lower salinity near the coast at the sea surface likely due to freshwater from the land and the unrealistically slow tidal currents that result without the ocean current effects the average errors smes scal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 1 58 10 1 psu and 2 58 10 1 psu respectively fig 9 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated temperatures on day 22 in the february case at the points shown in fig 1 because u o is not very large and the difference between u and u t is small in the february case the difference in the calculated temperature profiles between those with and without ocean current effects is also not very large except in the upper layers of the profiles at points 1 2 and 3 near the coast the low temperature probably due to cold inland water in the upper layer near the coast in the case without ocean currents can be attributed to the u ts relatively slow current along the coast line on the other hand near the outer boundary particularly at points 4 7 and 8 the measured temperature profiles at the lower layer exhibit potentially unstable stratifications although the density itself does not cause instability due to the stable salinity stratification later shown in fig 10 the profiles calculated with ocean current effects at points 4 7 and 8 demonstrate stratifications better than those without ocean current effects although the both could not simulate the sharp thermoclines of the measurement probably because of the used unsophisticated vertical eddy viscosity model the average errors tmes tcal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 8 45 10 1 c and 9 43 10 1 c respectively fig 10 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated salinities on the same day and at the same monitoring points as those in fig 9 for the february case the measured salinity profiles near the west side of the open boundary such as point 4 8 and 9 represent stable stratifications while those at the other points are nearly constant in the vertical direction the calculated profiles without ocean current effects indicate lower salinity near the coast at the sea surface caused by freshwater from the inland and slower currents near the coast line it seems that for these stratifications the calculated profiles with ocean current effects perform better than those without ocean current effects the average errors smes scal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 1 33 10 1 psu and 2 32 10 1 psu respectively these figures imply the validity of the presented tidal current simulations with ocean current effects compared to those without ocean current effects although the measurement was conducted on the same day it took several hours to collect data for the nine points to see the effect of the tidal timing the vertical profiles of calculated temperature at the timings of the high low and ebb tides at point 5 are illustrated in fig 11 a and b in the november and february cases respectively together with the measured data it is noticed that although there are slight differences in the profiles among the tidal timings these differences do not affect the comparisons conducted using figs 7 10 fig 12 and 13 show the contour maps of the calculated δtco2 a with and b without ocean current effects on day 26 in the november and february cases respectively here δ indicates the difference from the background value the horizontal planes on the left indicate the sea surface and the vertical sections on the right indicate the plains sectioning point 7 where the virtual co2 seepage takes place in both figures the cases with ocean current effects shown in a suggest a more diffused δtco2 distribution than those without ocean current effects this is due to the faster tidal currents that occur when including the ocean current effects it is interesting to see the vertical sections in fig 12 in which the intrusion depths of the density currents of high δtco2 water differ between the cases with and without ocean current effects it is seen that the plume of high δtco2 water intrudes horizontally close to the seepage depth in the case with ocean current effects fig 12 a conversely the plume rises toward the surface and spreads near the surface in the case without ocean current effects fig 12 b in fig 13 it is seen that the high δtco2 is diffused quickly in the case with ocean current effects fig 13 a while it stayed near the seepage point in the case without ocean current effects fig 13 b to consider the difference in the intrusion depth of the high co2 water we show the contour maps of the calculated δtco2 in the small scale domain with fig 14 a and without fig 14 b the ocean current effects in november and with fig 14 c and without fig 14 d the ocean current effects in february on day 26 similarly fig 15 shows the contour maps of the calculated volume fraction of co2 gas bubbles with fig 15 a and without fig 15 b the ocean current effects in november and with fig 15 c and without fig 15 d the ocean current effects in february on day 26 the co2 bubbles rise as a plume dissolve into the seawater during their ascent and disappear at the top of the upward plume figs 14 and 15 indicate that in both seasonal cases the bubble plume curtains around which δtco2 is high are clearly seen except for fig 14 a the low δtco2 in fig 14 a is probably caused by fast ocean current in the november case the co2 bubbles in november reach higher than those in february in other words the co2 bubbles dissolve into the seawater more in february than in november figs 7 and 9 indicate that the water temperatures near the sea floor at point 7 are 13 4 c and 3 0 c in november and february respectively this difference could cause the differences in the dissolution of co2 gas into the seawater the seawater becomes heavier with the dissolution of co2 and intrudes horizontally as a density current at the depth at which the density of the ambient seawater is the same as experimentally illustrated by sato and sato 2001 it should also be noted that at point 7 at which the virtual seepage takes place there is a stratification only in the february case the depth at which the gradual increase of calculated temperature starts in the downward direction is about 35 m this stratification may not affect the bubble rise but δtco2 distribution in fig 14 d and also fig 13 b it is seen that the high co2 concentration stays beneath that depth in the case without ocean current effects however in the case with ocean current effects high δtco2 is carried away or diffused out in the lower layer and some remain just above that depth fig 14 c this is probably because there are comparatively fast ocean current in the lower layer and calm water mainly originating from the inland in the upper layer 5 summary in this study we developed a mesoscale tidal current model for open bays or in sea sites near coastlines areas in which ocean currents cannot be ignored large regional scale simulations with a spatial scale of a couple thousand kilometers were conducted and the temporal changes of the ocean current velocity at each grid point were stored then we spatially and temporally interpolated the velocities and incorporated them into the convection term as forcing to analyze the tidal currents in the mesoscale domain with a spatial scale of a couple hundred kilometers finally we applied this method to the fate of dissolved co2 in a sea site off tomakomai and validated the method via a comparison with the measurements two phase flows with rising and dissolving co2 bubbles were analyzed in the small scale non hydrostatic model the computational domain of which had a spatial scale of a couple hundred meters and nested in the mesoscale tidal current model grids from the simulated distributions of the dissolved tco2 it is suggested that in this particular sea the tco2 concentration in the seawater is strongly affected by the ocean current in the case of a moderate seepage rate i e the seepage of several thousands of tons of co2 per year acknowledgment we thank mr shunsuke nishimura for his help in the calculation we are also grateful for the editors and reviewers for their instructive comments 
24124,the target seas of tidal current models are usually semi closed bays minimally affected by ocean currents for these models tidal currents are simulated in computational domains with a spatial scale of a couple hundred kilometers or less by setting tidal elevations at their open boundaries however when ocean currents cannot be ignored in the sea areas of interest such as in open seas near coastlines it is necessary to include ocean current effects in these tidal current models in this study we developed a numerical method to analyze tidal currents near coasts by incorporating pre calculated ocean current velocities first a large regional scale simulation with a spatial scale of several thousand kilometers was conducted and temporal changes in the ocean current velocity at each grid point were stored next the spatially and temporally interpolated ocean current velocity was incorporated as forcing into the cross terms of the convection term of a tidal current model having computational domains with spatial scales of hundreds of kilometers or less then we applied this method to the diffusion of dissolved co2 in a sea area off tomakomai japan and compared the numerical results and measurements to validate the proposed method keywords tidal current model regional scale ocean model carbon capture and storage co2 leakage co2 diffusion in the ocean two phase flow 1 introduction carbon dioxide capture and storage ccs is expected to be a promising solution to global warming and there are plans to demonstrate offshore sub seabed storage experiments worldwide however geological storage has a non zero risk of leakage to the seawater recently a seepage demonstration called the quantifying and monitoring potential ecosystem impacts of geological carbon storage qics project was conducted in a small bay in scotland the report blackford et al 2014 states that its physical chemical and biological impacts were not significant in the bay and that the effects of seeping co2 nearly disappeared approximately one month after the co2 injection stopped this may be because the mass of the injected co2 was limited 80 to 200 kg day although the seepage rate per unit area was not very small compared to those of natural seepage sites e g kikawadaet al 2009 mori et al 2015 conducted a numerical simulation of the mass transfer of the dissolved co2 within this bay and found that non trivial concentrations of co2 are detected only in the vicinity close to the seepage site that is within a circle with a diameter of approximately 200 m in general it is meaningful to examine the fate of dissolved co2 very close to the seepage site e g on a spatial scale of a few kilometers or less and because the injection site and the consequent and possible seepage site are usually in the coastal areas tidal currents cannot be ignored when evaluating the seepage impact on the environment kano et al 2010 assessed the impact of co2 in a sea area using the mec co2 model and found that the adverse effect of leaked co2 into a sea area can be negligible when the seepage rate is the same as that of the real leakage case reported by klusman 2003 here the mec model e g mizumukai et al 2008 sato et al 2006 is a tidal current model and is applicable to semi closed bays where the effects of ocean currents are sufficiently small the mec model has a special feature that it can include a small scale non hydrostatic model domain of a couple of kilometers or less in which vertical flows around artificial marine structures can be simulated nested within a mesoscale hydrostatic model domain of a couple of hundred kilometers or less kano et al 2009 added a function to treat co2 bubble two phase flow in the small scale non hydrostatic model domain this modified version is called the mec co2 model since april 2016 the japanese ministry of economy trade and industry has been conducting a field demonstration experiment of geological co2 storage offshore of tomakomai hokkaido japan the japanese ministry of environment has also been conducting measurements of the background chemistry and biology in this sea area for a couple of years the sea area off tomakomai is not a semi closed bay and is influenced by the chishima current from the okhotsk sea the tsugaru current from the tsugaru strait and accompanying mesoscale eddies therefore these ocean currents play important roles for the advection of the dissolved co2 off tomakomai however as mentioned above most tidal current models usually target bay areas with minimal effects from ocean currents such as semi closed bays or inlets with spatial scales of a couple hundred kilometers or less in these models tidal elevations are imposed at the open boundaries of the computational domains and currents caused by the imposed tidal movements are simulated in the domains if ocean currents the origins of which are phenomena with spatial scales larger than the computational domain cannot be ignored these tidal models are not sufficient to analyze the mass transfer within the sea areas of interest for ocean models targeting far offshore regional scale seas in which the spatial scale is a couple thousand kilometers or more ocean currents are the primary driving force of the advection of mass and heat in these models the periodic motions of tides and their effects are usually trivial and hence ignored on the other hand to calculate currents in the coastal zones tidal effects cannot be ignored and usually tidal forcing is incorporated in the shape of the external force in the momentum equation in addition to the high resolution with without nesting techniques e g moon 2005 schiller and fiedler 2007 arbic et al 2012 higashi et al 2015 kumar et al 2015 tsumune et al 2012 uchiyama et al 2010 warner et al 2008 among them an important work was conducted by shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 who developed the regional ocean modeling system roms they fitted in small time steps for the barotropic mode within one baroclinic time step although incorporating fine grids and tidal surface elevations in ocean current models is certainly a solution to analyze ocean and tidal currents simultaneously these models are still computationally costly because their target domains have spatial scales of several thousand kilometers and the grid sizes near the coastlines are at most a couple hundreds of meters if the spatial scale of interest is hundreds of kilometers necessary resolution is tens to hundreds of meters and the time range of interest is less than a month tidal current models with ocean current effects are no doubt welcomed by researchers who are interested in small mesoscale flows near coastlines in this study we developed a numerical method to analyze tidal currents including the effects of ocean currents as a forcing component and applied the method to the dispersion of co2 bubbles and the diffusion of dissolved co2 both of which are seeping from a seafloor off tomakomai because the interaction between the ocean and tidal currents is thought to be nonlinear the total currents should not be a simple summation of the interpolated ocean currents and the mesoscale tidal currents nihei et al 2003 conducted pioneering work for forcing components and its fluctuations in their nesting method hirabayashi and sato 2010a b developed low wavenumber forcing for turbulence generation jeong et al 2010 2011 applied the low wavenumber forcing to a multi scale ocean model to analyze the ocean currents in a mesoscale domain using moving nesting grids first a large regional scale model simulation with a spatial scale of a couple thousand kilometres was conducted and temporal changes in the ocean current velocity at each grid point were stored in the computer s memory here we adopted the roms as the large scale ocean current model then this velocity was spatially and temporally interpolated at the grid points of a mesoscale computational domain of a tidal current model the mec co2 model to treat the bubbly two phase flows 2 theory 2 1 mesoscale hydrostatic model 2 1 1 general hydrostatic model both for ocean and tidal currents the governing equations of a numerical model both for ocean and tidal currents are the navier stokes equations approximated using the hydrostatic assumption and the continuum equation 1 u h t u u h f 1 ρ 0 p k u h ρ t s c ρ 0 g 2 u 0 where u u v w m s is the total velocity of ocean and tidal currents in which u v and w are its components in the cartesian x east west y south north and z vertical directions respectively u h u v 0 is its horizontal component p kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure ρ kg m3 is the sea water density which is a function of temperature t c salinity s psu and the concentration of some other specific material c kg m3 such as the total concentration of dissolved co2 tco2 ρ0 is its standard density g 0 0 g m s2 is the gravity vector in which g is the gravitational acceleration k k h x k h y k v z m s is the nabla including the eddy kinetic viscosity in which kh m2 s and kv m2 s are the horizontal and vertical components respectively and f fv fu 0 m s2 is the coriolis force in which f 1 s is the coriolis parameter open boundary conditions for eqs 1 and 2 are given as either traction including pressure or velocity normally for tidal current models both the normal and tangential gradients of tidal current velocity components are set to be 0 as long as the open boundary is located within a calm sea area with flat topography and little eddy effects therefore only pressure i e sea surface elevation for hydrostatic models is set at the open boundary and a zero gradient neumann condition is imposed for the tidal current velocity as the traction boundary condition if one consider an ocean current model without tidal current effects ocean current velocity is imposed as a dirichlet condition at the open boundary as the velocity boundary condition this means that a neumann and a dirichlet conditions for the tidal and ocean current components respectively coexist on the same open boundary obviously this is impossible because u is not separated into such components yet however if tidal currents are trivial compared to ocean currents as in the case of considerably offshore ocean it is acceptable to give only ocean current velocity as a dirichlet boundary condition for u the advection diffusion equation is given as 3 q t u q a q where q is a conservative quantity such as t s or c and a a h x a h y a v z m s is nabla including the eddy kinetic diffusivity in which ah m2 s and av m2 s are the horizontal and vertical components respectively the boundary condition of eq 3 is the quantity considering both ocean and tidal currents 2 1 2 tidal current model with one way ocean current forcing imposing a neumann and a dirichlet conditions on unseparated tidal and ocean currents respectively within u at the same time on the same open boundary is impossible when tidal current velocity cannot be ignored compared to the ocean currents as in the case of usual coastal zones to overcome this problem we do not use the ocean currents as the open boundary condition but as a forcing component in the governing equation of a tidal current model after nihei et al 2003 when u in eqs 1 and 2 is divided into the velocity of the ocean currents without tidal effects u o and the residual velocity other than u o u t u u o eqs 1 and 2 are rewritten as 4 u o h u t h t u o u t u o h u t h f o f t 1 ρ 0 p o p t k u o h u t h ρ t o t t s o s t c o c t ρ 0 g 5 u o u t 0 where u o uo vo wo m s is the velocity of the ocean currents without tidal effects u o h uo vo 0 is its horizontal component po kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u o f o fvo fuo 0 m s2 is the coriolis force m s2 for the ocean currents without tidal effects to so and co are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u o u t u t v t w t m s is the residual velocity other than u o out of the total velocity u u o u t u t h u t v t 0 is its horizontal component p t kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u t fv t fu t 0 m s2 is the coriolis force for u t t t s t and c t are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u t if an ocean current model computes the ocean currents without tidal current effects the governing equation should be 6 u o t u o u o h f o 1 ρ 0 p o k u o h ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g 7 u o 0 subtracting eqs 6 and 7 from eqs 4 and 5 respectively results in a new set of governing equations for the residual u t 8 u t t u t u o h u o u t u t h f t 1 ρ 0 p t k u t h ρ t o t t s o s t c o c t ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g 9 u t 0 eqs 8 and 9 are the new governing equations to solve in this study here we find that the differences between the original governing equations 1 and 2 and the new governing equations 8 and 9 are the cross terms of the convection term and the buoyancy term this indicates that currents in the ocean are not a simple summation of tidal and ocean currents u u o u t u o u t where u t is the tidal current velocity without ocean current effects and that we should take into account the one way forcing of ocean currents via the convection term in this study eqs 6 and 7 are solved using the roms and eqs 8 and 9 are solved using the mec model because u o must not include tidal effects the roms simulation in this study does not include tidal effects intentionally note that to obtain eq 8 kh and kv should be the same in both eqs 4 and 6 in this study we used the richardson s 3 4 power law model for kh and the stratification model for kv for both the tidal mec and the ocean roms current models the boundary condition for u t is the zero gradient neumann condition with the tidal elevation u o in eq 8 may be replaced by the measured velocity as long as the data do not include tidal effects to exclude the tidal flow constituents averaging for the diurnal or semi diurnal period may be useful because grid systems of a large regional scale ocean current model are usually larger than those of a mesoscale tidal current model the convection velocity u excludes subgrid components which can be resolved by grids of a tidal current model but not by those of an ocean current model in addition the numerical errors originating from the discretization of the convection and diffusion terms are also different when the grid sizes of the ocean current and the tidal current models are different this may lead to a difference in kh because the richardson s 4 3 power law model uses the grid size therefore even though it is difficult to use the same grid systems it is better if the grids of the two models are as close as possible similarly it is possible to obtain the governing equations of ocean currents with forcing of tidal currents the governing equations of the residual velocity u o other than tidal current velocity without ocean current effects u t out of the total velocity u u o u t however it may not be very practical to analyze u o in regional scale domains because its computational cost may not be very different from analyzing ocean currents together with setting tidal elevations at the open boundaries of regional domains 2 1 3 tidal current model with two way ocean current forcing if the second term on the left hand side of eq 8 moves to the governing equation of the ocean current eq 6 then we can have two way forcing both for the tidal and ocean currents 10 u o t u t u o u o h f o 1 ρ 0 p o k u o h ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g 11 u t t u o u t u t h f t 1 ρ 0 p t k u t h ρ t o t t s o s t c o c t ρ t o s o c o ρ 0 g where u o u o v o w o m s is the velocity of the ocean currents without tidal effects u o h u o v o 0 is its horizontal component p o kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u o f o fv o fu o 0 m s2 is the coriolis force m s2 for the ocean currents without tidal effects t o s o and c o are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u o u t u t v t w t m s is the residual velocity other than u o out of the total velocity u u o u t u t h u t v t 0 is its horizontal component p t kg m s2 is the hydrostatic pressure relevant to u t f t fv t fu t 0 m s2 is the coriolis force for u t t t s t and c t are the temperature salinity and tco2 respectively relevant to u t the difference of this two way forcing from the one way using eq 8 is that in the case of the one way forcing ocean currents are analyzed in advance using eqs 6 and 7 and later the resultant velocities are stored and used as the forcing component in eq 8 and that in the case of this two way forcing both the ocean and tidal currents are analyzed simultaneously it is noted that in order to make this two way forcing effective both the ocean and tidal current models would better have the same resolutions in space and time to avoid interpolation of velocity at every time step 2 2 small scale non hydrostatic model we divided one of the computational cells of the mesoscale hydrostatic model domain with a horizontal size of kilometers to tens of kilometers into very fine cells for the small scale non hydrostatic model domain with a size of tens of meters to hundreds of meters where we consider the vertical flow to be significant the governing equations of this small scale model are the fully three dimensional 3d navier stokes equations and the continuum equation in addition for the two phase flow simulation considering the co2 bubble plume we adopted the following eulerian lagrangian method of kano et al

non hydrostatic model including the sub models of cd in eq 19 and k eq 20 are referred to in kano et al 2010 we did not use ocean current forcing in this small scale full 3d model and instead we interpolated u to the small scale boundary grids from the neighbouring mesoscale grids as the boundary condition 3 materials and methods 3 1 numerical scheme and computational conditions the mec model employs a finite difference method to solve the governing equations the small scale non hydrostatic model also adopts a finite difference method with the mac marker and cell algorithm see sato et al 2006 both models employ third order upwinding and second order central differencing schemes for the convection and the diffusion terms respectively the mec model needed 7 days for spin up to settle tidal elevations and currents and vertical stratification of temperature and salinity with atmospheric forcing and river effects the computational conditions for the physical parameters are listed in table 1 3 2 selection of sea site we employed a computational domain fig 1 for the sea site off tomakomai japan the domain size of the mesoscale hydrostatic model was 81 km 20 7 km 100 m with 90 23 32 grids in the x y and z directions respectively the size of each computational cell was 900 m 900 m in the x and y directions respectively and 2 m between the surface and a depth of 40 m and 5 m deeper than 40 m in the z direction the numbers in fig 1 indicate the ctd monitoring locations the numbers with a letter r indicate the locations of the mouths of large rivers and the drainages of large power plants the details of which are stated in table 2 the data from rivers 1 and 2 were obtained from the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism http www1 river go jp for the other rivers we calculated the flow rates assuming that their rates are proportional to their catchment areas we took into account the warm water discharge from the two power plants on this coast as rivers 7 and 8 the temperatures of these discharges were not available to this study therefore in this study we set them to be warmer than the surrounding seawater by 7 c we conducted numerical simulations for two seasons november 2011 and february 2012 3 3 ocean current for the large regional scale ocean currents we used the results of roms which was nudged in temperature and salinity towards the jcope2 data with 1 12 grid miyazawa et al 2009 to incorporate assimilated phenomena such as the tsugaru current these ocean currents are used as forcing components in the mesoscale tidal current model the grid system used in the roms simulations is given in table 3 fig 2 a and b show the velocity vectors calculated by the roms for november 2011 and february 2012 respectively the mesoscale model domain is illustrated by a rectangle at approximately 42 5 n these figures indicate that there is a strong eastbound current through the tsugaru strait it is known that the ocean currents in the mesoscale model domain off tomakomai can have unsteady complicated current systems induced by numerous eddies the ocean current depends on the location and direction of the vortices shed from the eastern exit of the tsugaru strait for co2 diffusion in the mesoscale domain the february case shown in fig 2 b is considered more conservative than that in november 2011 because the ocean current is weak in the area in february 2012 and consequently the co2 concentration may be larger then here the wording conservative means less diffusive and therefore more harmful to marine organisms the grid systems and the time increments for the presented roms and mec calculations are compared in table 3 because the horizontal grid sizes and the vertical coordinate systems are different for mec and roms we interpolated the roms results at the mec grid points trilinearly for the time scale interpolation we used linear interpolation even though both grid sizes should be the same for the accuracy of the mesoscale mec calculation they were slightly different 900 m 900 m for mec and 1 120 about 680 m 680 m for roms moreover the vertical coordinate systems were different mec used the z coordinate system and roms used the s coordinate system shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 therefore there are likely some numerical errors from the discretization in the mec calculation as mentioned in section 2 1 3 4 boundary conditions on the open boundary of the mesoscale domain tidal surface elevations are given as the driving force of the tidal currents we used nao99b matsumoto et al 2000 as a tidal wave model to obtain the amplitudes and phases of the significant tides at the positions of the open boundary we chose the five largest tidal constituents m2 k1 o1 s2 and p1 for which amplitudes are 0 31173 m 0 22896 m 0 18477 m 0 14429 m and 0 07392 m at a point x 40 5 km and y 0 km on the open boundary the boundary conditions of the temperature and salinity play an important role in evaluating the validity of the presented method because of the shape of the mesoscale domain in this study we used the roms results for the boundary and initial conditions of the mec calculation fig 3 a and b show the vertical profiles of t and s at 141 41 95 e 42 28 24 n measured in november 2011 and february 2012 respectively as shown later in figs 9 and 10 in the february case the measurements at points 4 7 and 8 indicate that a potentially unstable thermocline and stable halocline coexisted resulting in a stable stratification as also shown later in fig 6 d in this february there was strong inflow at the west side of the open boundary of the sea area off tomakomai while the current velocity is relatively small in the other area it is inferred from them that the warm tsugaru current coming into the sea area from the west intruded into the lower layer beneath the cold water influenced by inland freshwater however the original roms result profiles of temperature and salinity were uniform in the vertical direction partially because the present roms simulation did not include the effects of inland waters we therefore modified the profile to create a pycnocline at the open boundary in the february case referring to the data at point 7 the south west corner of the 3 3 grid shaped measurement points the climate conditions are listed in table 4 3 5 co2 seepage condition the co2 was set to seep out of the seafloor in the small scale non hydrostatic model domain at cell number i 35 j 10 i e point 7 shown in fig 1 in the mesoscale domain fig 4 a shows the mesoscale cell indicated by a black square into which the small scale domain fits tightly in the small scale domain we assumed that there is a fault which is shown in fig 4 b with a north south length of 510 m 34 cells and an east west width of 30 m 2 cells the seepage rate was set to a realistic value which was an estimated leakage rate of the co2 from an actual ccs eor enhanced oil recovery site klusman 2003 3800 ton co2 year in this study only co2 seeped in the form of bubbles is considered co2 in the dissolved aqueous phase is neglected the bubbles had a sphere equivalent diameter of 15 mm and a gaussian distribution with a deviation of 5 mm the seepage positions of single bubbles were determined randomly on the fault surface 4 results and discussion fig 5 shows a snapshot of the calculated velocity vectors indicated by arrows which are drawn at every 2 grids on the sea surface on day 20 in the november case fig 5 a shows only the tidal velocity without considering the ocean currents u t of eqs 10 and 11 fig 5 b shows the interpolated ocean current velocity u o of eqs 6 and 7 fig 5 c shows the tidal velocity with the ocean current effects u t of eqs 8 and 9 and fig 5 d shows the total velocity of the tidal and ocean currents u u o u t it is obvious that u o is dominant in this november fig 5 b and that u t u u o does not succeed the fast inflow and outflow of u t in the west half of the open boundary fig 5 a and c instead we can observe rather disarrayed velocity vectors at the west open boundary and a south ward flow almost along the edge of the shallow shelf at x 5400 m in fig 5 c slight signs of these flows remain in the total velocity field u fig 5 d fig 6 also shows the calculated velocity vectors in the february case in the same order as those shown in fig 5 because the ocean current is very small in february as seen in fig 6 b compared to fig 5 b the difference in the tidal currents between those shown in fig 6 a and c seems smaller than that between those shown in fig 5 a and c fig 6 a and d shows that u t and u have quite fast inflow and outflow at the west side of the open boundary this may have non trivial influences on the particular stratifications at points 4 7 and 8 shown later in figs 9 and 10 the velocity fields in fig 5 a and 5 d and 6 a and 6 d are used for the co2 fate simulations a without and d with ocean current effects in the november and february cases respectively fig 7 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated temperatures in c on day 25 in the november case at the monitoring points shown in fig 1 the solid line indicates the measured temperature and the closed and open dots indicate the calculated temperature with and without the ocean current effects respectively in general in nearly all the figures the calculated profiles with ocean current effects are closer to the measurements than those calculated without ocean currents the average errors between measured and calculated temperature values tmes tcal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 5 89 10 1 c and 9 49 10 1 c respectively the sea surface temperature in the case without ocean currents the open dots is peculiarly low at all the points this may be due to the low temperature river water and the unrealistically slow tidal currents along the coastline of tomakomai however the temperatures in the upper halves of the vertical profiles are slightly larger than those in the lower halves particularly at points 6 and 9 it is thought that this is due to the slightly higher temperature water coming from the shallow shelf in the bay that is entering the northeast area of this computational domain and these two points located at the edge of the shallow shelf as seen in fig 1 it can be seen that the case with ocean currents the closed dots simulates these measured stratified profiles better than the cases without ocean currents the open dots fig 8 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated salinities in psu on the same day and at the same monitoring points as those in fig 7 for the november case the measured salinity profiles do not indicate stratification and are nearly constant in the vertical direction the calculated salinity profiles both with and without ocean current effects also demonstrate similar tendencies even though the calculated profile without ocean current effects erroneously emphasizes the lower salinity near the coast at the sea surface likely due to freshwater from the land and the unrealistically slow tidal currents that result without the ocean current effects the average errors smes scal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 1 58 10 1 psu and 2 58 10 1 psu respectively fig 9 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated temperatures on day 22 in the february case at the points shown in fig 1 because u o is not very large and the difference between u and u t is small in the february case the difference in the calculated temperature profiles between those with and without ocean current effects is also not very large except in the upper layers of the profiles at points 1 2 and 3 near the coast the low temperature probably due to cold inland water in the upper layer near the coast in the case without ocean currents can be attributed to the u ts relatively slow current along the coast line on the other hand near the outer boundary particularly at points 4 7 and 8 the measured temperature profiles at the lower layer exhibit potentially unstable stratifications although the density itself does not cause instability due to the stable salinity stratification later shown in fig 10 the profiles calculated with ocean current effects at points 4 7 and 8 demonstrate stratifications better than those without ocean current effects although the both could not simulate the sharp thermoclines of the measurement probably because of the used unsophisticated vertical eddy viscosity model the average errors tmes tcal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 8 45 10 1 c and 9 43 10 1 c respectively fig 10 shows the vertical profiles of the measured and calculated salinities on the same day and at the same monitoring points as those in fig 9 for the february case the measured salinity profiles near the west side of the open boundary such as point 4 8 and 9 represent stable stratifications while those at the other points are nearly constant in the vertical direction the calculated profiles without ocean current effects indicate lower salinity near the coast at the sea surface caused by freshwater from the inland and slower currents near the coast line it seems that for these stratifications the calculated profiles with ocean current effects perform better than those without ocean current effects the average errors smes scal 2 n for with and without ocean current effects are 1 33 10 1 psu and 2 32 10 1 psu respectively these figures imply the validity of the presented tidal current simulations with ocean current effects compared to those without ocean current effects although the measurement was conducted on the same day it took several hours to collect data for the nine points to see the effect of the tidal timing the vertical profiles of calculated temperature at the timings of the high low and ebb tides at point 5 are illustrated in fig 11 a and b in the november and february cases respectively together with the measured data it is noticed that although there are slight differences in the profiles among the tidal timings these differences do not affect the comparisons conducted using figs 7 10 fig 12 and 13 show the contour maps of the calculated δtco2 a with and b without ocean current effects on day 26 in the november and february cases respectively here δ indicates the difference from the background value the horizontal planes on the left indicate the sea surface and the vertical sections on the right indicate the plains sectioning point 7 where the virtual co2 seepage takes place in both figures the cases with ocean current effects shown in a suggest a more diffused δtco2 distribution than those without ocean current effects this is due to the faster tidal currents that occur when including the ocean current effects it is interesting to see the vertical sections in fig 12 in which the intrusion depths of the density currents of high δtco2 water differ between the cases with and without ocean current effects it is seen that the plume of high δtco2 water intrudes horizontally close to the seepage depth in the case with ocean current effects fig 12 a conversely the plume rises toward the surface and spreads near the surface in the case without ocean current effects fig 12 b in fig 13 it is seen that the high δtco2 is diffused quickly in the case with ocean current effects fig 13 a while it stayed near the seepage point in the case without ocean current effects fig 13 b to consider the difference in the intrusion depth of the high co2 water we show the contour maps of the calculated δtco2 in the small scale domain with fig 14 a and without fig 14 b the ocean current effects in november and with fig 14 c and without fig 14 d the ocean current effects in february on day 26 similarly fig 15 shows the contour maps of the calculated volume fraction of co2 gas bubbles with fig 15 a and without fig 15 b the ocean current effects in november and with fig 15 c and without fig 15 d the ocean current effects in february on day 26 the co2 bubbles rise as a plume dissolve into the seawater during their ascent and disappear at the top of the upward plume figs 14 and 15 indicate that in both seasonal cases the bubble plume curtains around which δtco2 is high are clearly seen except for fig 14 a the low δtco2 in fig 14 a is probably caused by fast ocean current in the november case the co2 bubbles in november reach higher than those in february in other words the co2 bubbles dissolve into the seawater more in february than in november figs 7 and 9 indicate that the water temperatures near the sea floor at point 7 are 13 4 c and 3 0 c in november and february respectively this difference could cause the differences in the dissolution of co2 gas into the seawater the seawater becomes heavier with the dissolution of co2 and intrudes horizontally as a density current at the depth at which the density of the ambient seawater is the same as experimentally illustrated by sato and sato 2001 it should also be noted that at point 7 at which the virtual seepage takes place there is a stratification only in the february case the depth at which the gradual increase of calculated temperature starts in the downward direction is about 35 m this stratification may not affect the bubble rise but δtco2 distribution in fig 14 d and also fig 13 b it is seen that the high co2 concentration stays beneath that depth in the case without ocean current effects however in the case with ocean current effects high δtco2 is carried away or diffused out in the lower layer and some remain just above that depth fig 14 c this is probably because there are comparatively fast ocean current in the lower layer and calm water mainly originating from the inland in the upper layer 5 summary in this study we developed a mesoscale tidal current model for open bays or in sea sites near coastlines areas in which ocean currents cannot be ignored large regional scale simulations with a spatial scale of a couple thousand kilometers were conducted and the temporal changes of the ocean current velocity at each grid point were stored then we spatially and temporally interpolated the velocities and incorporated them into the convection term as forcing to analyze the tidal currents in the mesoscale domain with a spatial scale of a couple hundred kilometers finally we applied this method to the fate of dissolved co2 in a sea site off tomakomai and validated the method via a comparison with the measurements two phase flows with rising and dissolving co2 bubbles were analyzed in the small scale non hydrostatic model the computational domain of which had a spatial scale of a couple hundred meters and nested in the mesoscale tidal current model grids from the simulated distributions of the dissolved tco2 it is suggested that in this particular sea the tco2 concentration in the seawater is strongly affected by the ocean current in the case of a moderate seepage rate i e the seepage of several thousands of tons of co2 per year acknowledgment we thank mr shunsuke nishimura for his help in the calculation we are also grateful for the editors and reviewers for their instructive comments
