6465,glacier wide mass balances and runoffs are reconstructed over 1969 2016 for chhota shigri glacier catchment india applying a glacio hydrological model the model is forced using in situ daily air temperature and precipitation records from the meteorological stations at bhuntar observatory 1092 m a s l glacier base camp 3850 m a s l and glacier side moraine 4863 m a s l the modelled mean annual mass balance is 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 meter water equivalent per year while the mean catchment wide runoff is 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 over 1969 2016 three periods are distinguished in the reconstructed mass balance and runoff series periods i 1969 1985 and iii 2001 2016 show glacier mass wastage at rates of 0 36 and 0 50 m w e a 1 respectively corresponding to catchment wide runoffs of 1 51 and 1 65 m w e a 1 respectively conversely period ii 1986 2000 exhibits steady state conditions with average mass balances of 0 01 m w e a 1 and corresponding runoff of 1 52 m w e a 1 the reduced ice melt 0 20 m w e a 1 over period ii in agreement with steady state conditions is compensated by the increased snow melt 1 03 m w e a 1 providing almost similar catchment wide runoffs for period i and ii the increased runoff after 2000 is mainly governed by increased ice melt 0 32 m w e a 1 over period iii snow accumulation in winter and summer seasons together control the glacier wide mass balances as well as catchment wide runoffs snow melt contributes the maximum to the total mean annual runoff with 63 share while glacier melt and rain contribute 17 and 20 respectively over the whole period keywords himalayan glaciers mass balance hydrology ice melt runoff snow melt runoff 1 introduction the himalaya karakoram hk region hosts a large amount of snow and ice which provides continuous fresh water supply for over 800 million people of indus ganges and brahmaputra river basins for irrigation domestic consumption or hydro electric power immerzeel et al 2013 consequently there are increasing concerns about the effect of global warming on himalayan river hydrology immerzeel et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 and specifically on the different hydrologic components glacier melt runoff snowmelt runoff total streamflow further the heterogeneous mass wastage of hk glaciers brun et al 2017 azam et al 2018 suggests that the impact of changing climate on melt runoff generation depends on the regional climate of the glaciers as well as the contrasting glacier response to climate along the hk region sakai and fujita 2017 therefore a precise quantification of the snow and glacier melt contribution to river runoff in different parts of the hk is important for decision making in water sensitive sectors water resource management and flood risk reduction brown et al 2014 quantification of different hydrologic components in the hk rivers is done by applying several methods models the most common methods are empirical relationship between precipitation and runoff thayyen and gergan 2010 ice ablation models racoviteanu et al 2013 chemical tracer methods racoviteanu et al 2013 rai et al 2016 glaciological method kääb et al 2012 gardelle et al 2013 and semi distributed distributed glacio hydrological models jeelani et al 2012 immerzeel et al 2013 nepal et al 2014 lutz et al 2014 ragettli et al 2015 li et al 2015 chen et al 2017 among all glacio hydrological models are the best tools to understand the relative contribution of different hydrologic components to the total river runoff glacio hydro meteorological investigations in the hk region are sparse compared to other mountain regions on earth on account of intrinsic challenges in maintaining the monitoring networks due to harsh climatic conditions and difficult access to the glaciers meteorological stations are often installed at valley bottoms and the knowledge of long term precipitation at glacier elevations is mostly lacking in the hk region precipitation has extremely large spatial variability due to rough topography in the hk region that makes extrapolation speculative immerzeel et al 2015 underestimation overestimation of precipitation amounts may produce bias in the modelled hydrologic components for instance the observed water budget over 2001 2005 in the dudh koshi basin was significantly imbalanced and attributed to a large underestimation of high elevation precipitation while the modeled water budget was well balanced due to unrealistic overestimation of the glacier melt volume savéan et al 2015 this situation makes it difficult to develop glacio hydrological models for the hk region in the present study a concerted attempt has been made to develop a glacio hydrological model involving extensive field based data to quantify the hydrologic components of runoff in a highly glacierized catchment from western himalaya this model includes an accumulation module a temperature index module and a rain module and is used to reconstruct the mass balances as well as to investigate the relationship between glacier wide mass balances and catchment wide runoff of the small catchment of chhota shigri glacier 34 7 km2 lahaul valley western himalaya india using the long term meteorological data between 1969 and 2016 from nearby observatory at bhuntar city and in situ meteorological stations in addition we analysed the relative contributions of the different hydrologic components including snow melt ice melt and rainfall runoff our study is certainly important to improve process understanding in small study areas which can later be generalized over larger regions 2 study area and climate chhota shigri catchment 32 28 n 77 58 e 34 7 km2 outlet at 3840 m a s l 47 glacierized is located in the lahaul valley of himachal pradesh in the western himalaya india chhota shigri glacier has been studied for various aspects such as mass balances energy balance dynamics ice thickness hydrology etc wagnon et al 2007 azam et al 2012 vincent et al 2013 engelhardt et al 2017 ramsankaran et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 runoff from the catchment makes up a single proglacial stream and contributes to the chandra river one of the tributaries of the indus river basin fig 1 the lower ablation area of chhota shigri glacier 4500 m a s l is covered by debris representing 3 4 of the total surface area in 2005 vincent et al 2013 table 1 gives a list of geographical and topographical characteristics of catchment as well as some basic information of chhota shigri glacier fig 2 shows the area elevation distribution of chhota shigri glacier catchment chhota shigri catchment is located in the monsoon arid transition zone and is influenced by the indian summer monsoon during summer and the mid latitude disturbances during winter azam et al 2014b mean annual precipitation sum at base camp was 917 mm w e water equivalent between october 2012 and september 2017 out of which 71 was during the winter season november april and 29 during the summer monsoon may october confirming that chhota shigri glacier is a winter accumulation type glacier as suggested earlier by ageta and higuchi 1984 the mean annual temperature at the off glacier automatic weather station aws at 4863 m a s l was 5 4 c while the summer and winter mean temperatures were 0 5 c and 11 3 c respectively between 2009 and 2016 table 1 3 data 3 1 meteorological data to run the model we used daily mean temperatures and daily precipitation sums recorded at bhuntar observatory kullu airport 31 58 n 77 98 e 1092 m a s l for the period 1969 2013 this observatory is located 50 km southwest of chhota shigri glacier on the windward side of the mountain and belongs to the indian meteorological department fig 1 the details about data gaps and the necessary treatments carried out are given in azam et al 2014a we also used short term in situ meteorological data series from an aws located on a lateral moraine of chhota shigri glacier at 4863 m a s l azam et al 2014b and from an automatic all weather precipitation gauge geonor 200 tb at the base camp 3850 m a s l fig 1 besides mean monthly precipitation data from kaza 1984 2012 and tandi 1975 2015 stations obtained from tawde et al 2017 and chand et al 2017 respectively are also discussed in this paper section 6 4 the details of the stations are given in table 2 3 2 mass balance and runoff data a variety of data is available from previous studies on chhota shigri glacier including the geodetic mass balances covering different time periods berthier et al 2007 brun et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 annual glacier wide mass balances over 2012 2014 azam et al 2016 and seasonal runoff data over 2010 2013 engelhardt et al 2017 the available mass balances with their uncertainty ranges and corresponding methods are given in table 4 runoff measurements were performed during the summer months may to september over 2010 2015 at a gauging site about 2 km downstream of the chhota shigri glacier terminus fig 1 observation length of field observed runoffs was subjected to access to the catchment roads remained closed due to snow avalanches landslides and therefore not always available for the whole summer period since chhota shigri glacier stream floor is not paved at the gauging site and is difficult to keep free from the boulders transported through water particularly in the peak melt period july and august and due to other technical and instrumental limitations the possibility of error in runoff measurements is expected to be about 25 of the total runoff eeckman et al 2017 4 method 4 1 model description and parameters annual glacier wide mass balances and catchment wide runoffs are computed using a glacio hydrological model that includes an accumulation module and an ablation module as well as a rain module daily precipitation and temperature fields for each 50 m elevation range are generated from daily precipitation sums and daily mean temperatures from bhuntar observatory 1969 2013 aws and all weather precipitation gauge 2013 2016 applying the altitudinal precipitation gradient and temperature lapse rates for each day of year calculated in azam et al 2014a the model starts on 1st october of a year and calculates glacier mass balance and runoff for each elevation range of 50 m at daily time step fig 3 for a full hydrological year until 30th september of the following year taking into account the glacier surface state snow bare ice or debris and using the corresponding degree day factor ddf at a given elevation range glacierized and non glacierized the accumulation c mm w e d 1 is computed by 1 c p w h e n t t p 0 w h e n t t p where p and t are daily precipitation mm w e and temperature c respectively extrapolated at glacier elevations and tp is the threshold temperature c for snow rain conversely at a given elevation range glacierized and non glacierized the daily rainfall r is computed by 2 r 0 w h e n t t p p w h e n t t p the computed rainfall and more generally every computed discharge component mentioned hereafter are assumed to reach the discharge site within the same day temperature index module relates the amount of melt with positive air temperature sums positive degree days and a proportionality factor called ddf at each elevation range the ablation a mm w e d 1 is computed by 3 a dd f s i d t t m w h e n t t m 0 w h e n t t m where ddf denotes the degree day factor mm d 1 c 1 different for snow s ice i and debris covered ice d surfaces t is extrapolated daily mean air temperature c at given elevations and tm is the threshold temperature c for melt a dynamic storage of snow is maintained over the whole catchment the snow is added to glacierized and non glacierized areas following the equation 1 if t tm then snow is melted as a function of ddfs when snow is melted out at any given elevation range and t tm then over glacierized areas ice is melted as a function of ddfi or ddfd depending on whether the surface is clean ice and debris covered ice in this study ablation is restricted to melt total snow melt runoff qsnow over the whole catchment is computed as 4 q snow a sg a sng where asg and asng are snow melt over glacierized area and non glacierized area respectively total rainfall runoff qrain over the whole catchment is computed as 5 q rain r g r ng where rg and rng are rainfall runoff from glacierized area and non glacierized area respectively the daily runoff q at the catchment outlet is finally computed using the following equation 6 q q snow q ice q rain where q qsnow qice and qrain are total runoff snow melt runoff over whole catchment ice melt runoff clean ice as well as debris covered ice and rainfall runoff over whole catchment respectively with qice being equal to ice ablation for clean or debris covered ice surfaces eq 3 in order to keep the number of parameters minimum this model includes neither a radiation component nor a grid based approach which are useful to assess the spatial variability of the mass balance and thus runoff but less relevant in assessing their temporal variability the purpose of this work most of the model parameters are constrained using in situ measurements azam et al 2014a the temperature lapse rates for each day of the year are estimated using the daily mean temperatures from bhuntar observatory 1092 m a s l and glacier side aws 4863 m a s l for the period 18 august 2009 to 31 october 2012 computations of the ddf for different surfaces snow ice and debris covered ice were performed at various elevations between 4300 and 4900 m a s l using ablation stakes distributed on chhota shigri glacier during the summers 2009 2011 and 2012 june to october around 500 measurements have been performed at the ablation stakes ddf for each surface was obtained by linear regression between point ablation measurements performed and the corresponding cumulative positive degree days cpdd computed from the calculated daily lapse rates lrs estimated ddf for each surface snow ice and debris covered ice represents the average conditions of the corresponding surface because the measurements have been performed over the whole summer june to october and for different topographic conditions encountered at the glacier surface such as slope aspect etc see azam et al 2014a for more details literature about threshold temperatures for melt generation and snow rain delimitation is extremely limited in the himalayan region therefore in present study we adopted the most commonly used values i e 0 c and 1 c respectively hock 2003 lutz et al 2014 azam et al 2014a shea et al 2015 the altitudinal precipitation gradient was first constrained using the annual precipitation sums at bhuntar observatory and annual point mass balance at 5550 m a s l on chhota shigri glacier and then adjusted during model calibration the model structure is shown in fig 3 the parameter values are given in table 3 refreezing of melt water or rainfall has been rarely observed during field expeditions thus not taken into account in the model point scale surface energy balance study on chhota shigri glacier suggested that the net mass loss as a result of sublimation evaporation and resublimation condensation process is 2 of the total melting on the glacier azam et al 2014b and therefore ignored in the present study though some studies covering elevation range 500 8800 m a s l suggested evapotranspiration up to 14 to 20 of annual precipitation in the himalayan region andermann et al 2012 nepal et al 2014 we ignored the losses through evapotranspiration mainly because of two reasons 1 our catchment covering 3840 6263 m a s l elevation range has few days with positive temperatures and 2 the study area is almost vegetation free further limiting the losses through evapotranspiration the catchment outlet is only 2 km away from the glacier snout limiting the subsurface fluxes and therefore we also ignored the subsurface fluxes dye tracer experiments during 2010 2012 pottakkal et al unpublished data suggested that the surface melt water from ablation area reaches the catchment outlet through moulins and englacial conduits within a few hours supporting our same day runoff assumption for the computation of the mass balances and runoffs we used a fixed glacier surface over the whole modelling period see section 4 4 the non glacierized catchment area above 5200 m a s l is mostly very steep fig 1 and thus the accumulated snow occasionally tends to fall on the glacier as avalanches these snow avalanches are ignored in the model calculations it is noteworthy that the results are likely to be sensitive to the choice of this parameter set table 3 or to the assumptions described above therefore we discussed below these choices and conducted model sensitivity tests see section 4 6 to quantify the effects of each main parameter or assumption on the model results 4 2 model calibration altitudinal precipitation gradient was the only parameter that was poorly constrained due to its large spatial variability and limited in situ precipitation data two different data sets of annual mean altitudinal mass balance measurements between 2002 and 2012 and decadal geodetic mass balance observations over 1988 2010 period had been used simultaneously to calibrate the altitudinal precipitation gradient azam et al 2014a the model was tuned to minimize at the same time i the resulting root mean square errors rmse between modelled and measured annual point mass balances averaged every 50 meter elevation range from 2002 to 2012 and ii the difference between modelled mass balances and geodetic mass balances at decadal scale i e 1988 1999 and 1999 2010 the modelled annual glacier wide annual mbs were cumulated over the periods when decadal geodetic mass balances vincent et al 2013 were available in order to make a comparison in order to avoid overtuning the model is not calibrated with field runoff data rather it is used for model validation section 4 5 4 3 model efficiency we also performed nash and sutcliffe efficiency test nash and sutcliffe 1970 to check the performance of our model this test is defined as follows 7 e 1 i 1 n q i m i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 where e is the efficiency of the model qi mi and q are the observed runoff modelled runoff and mean observed runoff over the period of investigation the efficiency range lies between 1 corresponds to a perfect match and infinite the calculated efficiency for different years between 2010 and 2015 varies from 1 05 to 0 60 demonstrating the good performance of the model fig 4 4 4 error estimation the uncertainty in annual mass balances was assessed by changing step by step one parameter at a time the other parameters remaining unchanged and the resulting cumulative modelled mass balances were compared to the observed geodetic mass balances at decadal scale 1988 1999 and 1999 2010 given the very small debris cover area 3 4 the model is not sensitive to ddfd and thus it was not used in this exercise daily temperature lapse rates are related to ddf extrapolated temperature and precipitation fields eqs 1 2 so selecting different values for temperature lapse rates would have resulted in different values of ddf extrapolated temperature and precipitation fields without significantly changing the model results therefore these were also not used for model tuning further to keep them realistic the threshold temperatures tm and tp were allowed to change between 1 0 and 1 0 c only each model parameter tm tp p g ddf s and ddfi was changed to allow maximal variations of the resulting modelled cumulative mass balances within the limits prescribed by the uncertainty bounds of the observed geodetic mass balances 2 7 and 1 8 m w e for 1988 1999 and 1999 2010 respectively table 4 the maximum ranges of model parameters used are given in table 3 as a result of this exercise each parameter provides two new 47 year series of annual mass balances one toward negative values and the other toward positive values the resulting uncertainty in annual mass balances is taken as the highest standard deviation calculated between these new series and the initial mass balance series the model showed maximum standard deviation for ddfs followed by altitudinal precipitation gradient and ddfi the estimated uncertainty bounds in annual mass balances is as high as 0 36 m w e a 1 and the corresponding error in the annual runoff is estimated as 0 23 m w e a 1 4 5 model validation the model is validated against a variety of available data sets on chhota shigri glacier from different studies 1 the geodetic mass balances over 1971 1999 1999 2011 mukherjee et al 2018 1999 2004 berthier et al 2007 and 2005 2014 brun et al 2017 2 the in situ annual mass balances between 2012 and 2014 azam et al 2016 and 3 the observed runoff between 2010 and 2015 engelhardt et al 2017 table 4 provides a study to study comparison of the modelled mass balances with the observed mass balances for the respective periods the agreement is most of the time promising or even good while considering the respective uncertainty bars even though the model gives more negative mass balances than the observed mass balances of mukherjee et al 2018 and brun et al 2017 or twice less negative than the field measurements over the period 2012 2014 performed by azam et al 2014a table 4 as a second validation the modelled daily runoffs between 2010 and 2015 have been compared to observed runoffs at chhota shigri discharge site in summer the agreement is fair with correlation coefficients r2 ranging from 0 56 in summer 2014 to 0 70 in summer 2012 or the efficiency e ranging from 1 05 in 2012 to 0 60 in 2010 fig 4 the model slightly overestimated the daily runoffs for 2012 5 and 2015 5 while underestimating them for 2010 6 2011 5 2013 15 and 2014 42 the model is calibrated using only point mass balances and independently validated with two different data sets viz mass balances and runoffs however simulations of a variety of different systems have demonstrated the ubiquitous nature of equifinality issue even with moderate levels of hydrological models beven and freer 2001 overall in our study after this double validation and looking at the model efficiency we believe that the model is robust enough to fairly reconstruct both the glacier wide mass balances and the catchment wide runoffs with limited equifinality issue 4 6 model sensitivity the sensitivity of the model to each parameter µ was assessed by re running the model changing each parameter using corresponding plausible range highest parameter value µh and lowest parameter value µl while keeping the other variables and model parameters unchanged table 3 these sensitivity tests for chhota shigri glacier catchment were performed calculating the annual glacier wide mass balance and catchment wide runoff averaged over the period 1969 2016 following oerlemans et al 1998 as 8 db a d μ b a μ h b a μ l 2 9 dq d μ q μ h q μ l 2 where ba and q being the glacier wide mass balance and catchment wide runoff averaged over the period 1969 2016 using the highest lowest value of the parameter µ the estimated model sensitivities for parameters are given in table 3 model is the most sensitive mass balance sensitivity 0 44 m w e a 1 and runoff sensitivity 0 29 m w e a 1 to threshold temperature for melt followed by precipitation gradient mass balance sensitivity 0 35 m w e a 1 and runoff sensitivity 0 03 m w e a 1 though we have used a single threshold temperature for snow and ice melt we also checked the model sensitivity to different threshold temperatures for snow and ice melt these model sensitivities were estimated using 1 c change in threshold temperature independently for snow and ice threshold temperatures the sensitivity of modelled glacier wide mass balance to threshold temperature for snow melt is around four times higher than ice while the sensitivity of modelled runoff to threshold temperature for snow melt is six fold that of ice besides the given input parameters we also developed sensitivity test for evapotranspiration by changing input precipitation 0 to 20 as evapotranspiration losses could be up to 20 of precipitation amounts in the himalayan region andermann et al 2012 the model sensitivity of mass balance and runoff for 20 reduction in evapotranspiration are estimated to be 0 17 m w e a 1 and 0 05 m w e a 1 respectively for modelling the mass balances and runoffs in the present study we used an unchanged glacier area and hypsometry of the year 2004 2005 wagnon et al 2007 however this assumption induces mass balance errors due to temperature changes resulting from surface elevation changes not taken into account the mass balance errors arising from temperature changes associated with surface elevation changes resulting from unequal mass wastage were estimated and found to be very small 0 03 m w e a 1 compared to the total estimated uncertainty in mass balances 0 36 m w e a 1 mukherjee et al 2018 assessed an area reduction from 15 7 0 20 to 15 5 0 40 m2 over 1971 1999 corresponding to an area reduction of 0 05 per year hence to test the effect of an unchanged area assumption we assumed this area change restricted to only ablation area below 5050 m a s l 52 of total area that resulted in an area reduction of 0 10 per year over ablation area relative to the area in 2004 2005 used in our study two new hypsographies are tested one for 1969 1970 corresponding to the 2004 2005 ablation area increased by 3 35 0 10 35 years and the other for 2015 2016 corresponding to the 2004 2005 ablation area decreased by 1 05 0 10 11 years hydrological years we ran the model using these two new hypsographies 1969 1970 and 2015 2016 and obtained two new mass balance and runoff series for 1969 1970 and 2015 2016 hydrological years the errors due to hypsography assumption in our model are estimated as the rmse between initial model results with 1960 1970 and 2015 2016 mass balance and runoff series respectively the rmse between 2004 and 2005 and 1969 1970 hypsographies are 0 16 and 0 07 m w e a 1 for mass balances and runoffs respectively whereas the rmse between 2004 and 2005 and 2015 2016 hypsographies are 0 05 and 0 02 m w e for mass balances and runoffs respectively combining these rmse for both periods the rmse between 1969 and 2016 are 0 21 and 0 09 m w e a 1 for mass balances and runoffs respectively these differences are lower than the already estimated errors of 0 36 and 0 23 m w e in mass balances and runoffs respectively supporting our temporally unchanged hypsography assumption 5 results 5 1 modelled seasonal runoffs the modelled runoffs from the catchment are negligible during winter season november to april with a mean value of 0 01 m w e a 1 and the summer may to october runoffs are responsible for the quasi total annual runoffs fig 5 a represents the seasonal hydrographs of snow melt runoff ice melt runoff rainfall runoff and total runoff at chhota shigri catchment outlet fig 1 the early summer runoff is mainly generated by snow melt which starts in april and peaks in july and august with maximum monthly values of 4 37 and 4 28 m w e a 1 respectively in august there is a sharp decrease in snow melt because most of the snow has already melted out while the snow line progressively migrates to higher elevations during the course of the summer ice melt progressively increases and reaches its maximum in august with a monthly value of 1 85 m w e a 1 around 56 of total ice melt the major rainfall contribution comes between june and september peaking in august with a monthly value of 1 65 m w e a 1 the total monthly runoff peaks in august with a value of 7 78 m w e a 1 from a combination of high snow melt maximum ice melt and maximum rainfall runoff fig 5a the maximum runoff in july august in chhota shigri catchment is in good agreement with other studies in hma including himalayan region wang et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 nepal et al 2014 tahir et al 2016 han et al 2019 5 2 modelled and observed annual glacier wide mass balances fig 6 shows year to year comparison between field observed and modelled annual mass balances between 2002 and 2014 on chhota shigri glacier the differences between both mass balances are within the uncertainties except for 2009 in 2009 the modelled mass balance is estimated as 1 20 0 36 m w e a 1 while the field observed mass balance was 0 12 0 40 m w e a 1 we could not find any reason for this large difference in modelled and observed mass balances for 2009 inset in fig 6 shows the correlations r2 0 30 between modelled and observed annual mass balances with a calculated rmse of 0 55 m w e a 1 for all 12 years 2002 2014 the correlation is quite good if the 2009 data is excluded r2 0 82 and rmse 0 39 m w e a 1 inset in fig 6 the modelled cumulative mass wastage 5 69 m w e corresponding to 0 47 0 36 m w e a 1 is in close agreement with the observed cumulative loss 6 72 m w e corresponding to 0 56 0 40 m w e a 1 between 2002 and 2014 5 3 annual glacier wide mass balances and annual runoffs mass balances hydrologic components as well as total runoffs for chhota shigri glacier catchment over 1969 2016 are shown in fig 7 and table 5 the mean glacier wide mass balance is 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 with a cumulative mass wastage of 14 10 m w e showing the moderate mass wastage on chhota shigri glacier over the last five decades over the whole modelling period the mean runoff is 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 the annual mean runoffs show a large inter annual variability with the minimum runoff of 1 00 0 23 m w e a 1 for the hydrological year 1975 1976 and the maximum runoff of 1 86 0 23 m w e a 1 for the hydrological year 1998 1999 the maximum share of 63 to total catchment runoff comes from snow melt with almost equal contribution from glacierized and non glacierized areas followed by similar contributions of 17 and 20 from ice melt and rain respectively during the study period the relationship between annual mass balances and annual mean runoffs for chhota shigri catchment is shown in the inset of fig 7 though the relationship r2 0 31 n 47 years is weak the more negative mass balances are often associated with increased runoff at catchment outlet or vice versa chhota shigri glacier receives a large part of annual precipitation in winter in solid form table 1 that is released in summer due to high temperatures and intense solar radiation azam et al 2014b during negative mass balance years additional runoff from wastage of perennial glacier storage is released in addition to the hydrological cycle thereby increasing catchment runoff conversely during positive mass balance years catchment runoff decreases as some water is stored in the glacier in the form of ice hock et al 2005 however few positive mass balance years are found to be associated with more runoff such years 1998 2005 2010 and 2015 shown in red color in inset of fig 7 are characterized by very high precipitation that delivers a direct contribution of rain or summer snowfalls that melt quickly due to high summer temperatures fig 6 this is reminiscent of monsoon dominated glaciers of central and eastern himalaya where maximum precipitation coincides with the maximum discharge in summer and therefore a large runoff contribution comes directly from rainfall or monsoonal snowfalls in the catchment that often melts quickly due to high summer temperature and high radiation long and short wave thayyen and gergan 2010 ragettli et al 2015 5 4 decadal mass balances vs decadal runoffs here we build upon the work of azam et al 2014a who analysed three different periods period ii 1986 2000 characterized by almost balanced conditions sandwiched between two mass wastage periods of i 1969 1985 and iii 2001 2012 the latter being extended to 2001 2016 in this present study table 5 shows the snow melt runoff ice melt runoff rainfall runoff for periods i ii and iii respectively along with their corresponding annual and seasonal glacier wide mass balances the mean catchment wide runoff for period i and ii are almost equal with 1 51 and 1 52 m w e a 1 respectively but the mean glacier wide mass balances are quite different with values of 0 36 and 0 01 m w e a 1 respectively the similar runoff under different mass balance conditions can be explained with the relative contributions of different hydrologic components to the total runoff whereas the rainfall runoff is almost similar for all three periods the snow and ice melt runoffs are quite different fig 7 table 5 for period ii the mean winter mass balance 1 25 m w e a 1 is higher than that of period i 1 02 m w e a 1 indicating more snow accumulation on the glacier as well as non glacierized parts of the catchment during period ii higher annual precipitation values over period ii fig 6 also support higher accumulation this excess snow results in more snow melt generation during period ii 1 03 m w e a 1 compared to 0 90 m w e a 1 during period i fig 7 table 5 further the mean summer mass balance and resulting mean annual mass balances are more negative for period i 1 38 and 0 36 m w e a 1 respectively compared to period ii 1 27 and 0 01 m w e a 1 respectively that provides more ice melt runoff for period i 0 30 m w e a 1 than period ii 0 20 m w e a 1 fig 7 table 5 the reduced ice melt runoff over period ii in agreement with steady state conditions is compensated by the increased snow melt runoff that provides almost similar total runoffs for period i and ii table 6 over period iii the increased mean runoff of 1 65 m w e a 1 is mainly governed by the increased ice melt 0 32 m w e a 1 due to the most negative annual mass balances of the entire study period amounting to 0 50 m w e a 1 corresponding to the lowest winter mean mass balances of 1 05 m w e a 1 and the most negative summer mass balances of 1 54 m w e a 1 fig 7 table 5 6 discussion 6 1 snow accumulation as a major driver for catchment wide runoff in order to give insights into the functioning of chhota shigri catchment we sorted all the years in three categories positive mass balance years glacier wide mass balance 0 10 m w e a 1 16 years negative mass balance years glacier wide mass balance 0 10 m w e a 1 24 years and close to balanced years 0 10 m w e a 1 glacier wide mass balance 0 10 m w e a 1 7 years table 6 shows mean annual and seasonal mass balances and mean hydrologic components as well as the catchment wide mean precipitation snow and rain and air temperature while table 7 shows mean monthly hydrological components during summer months may to october fig 8 displays the mean monthly evolution of the different hydrologic components mean catchment wide precipitation snow and rain and mean catchment wide air temperatures for these three categories mean monthly catchment wide temperatures are the highest during july august in agreement with the highest catchment runoffs for all three categories fig 8 table 7 balanced and positive mass balance years are rather similar with a slight increase of ice melt during balanced years fig 8 table 7 and a maximum winter accumulation during positive years table 6 negative mass balance years are drastically different especially during the second half of the summer after mid july or beginning of august when ice melt strongly increases in detriment of snowmelt fig 8 table 7 in such years a rapid decay of the snow cover likely associated with a vertical migration of the snow line leaves a large part of the glacier exposed with bare ice enhancing the absorption of solar radiation and fostering ice melt this rapid decay of the snow cover is due either to a below average winter accumulation mölg et al 2014 as revealed by the lowest value of winter mass balance or reduced snowfalls azam et al 2014b also associated with the highest summer temperatures as revealed by very negative summer mass balance for the negative mass balance category fig 8 and table 6 or a combination of both the importance of annual and seasonal snowfalls controlling the glacier wide mass balance of the glacier and in turn its catchment wide runoff has already been partly highlighted by azam et al 2014b using an energy balance approach 6 2 comparison with other studies engelhardt et al 2017 hereafter engelhardt recently modelled the runoffs and mass balances of chhota shigri glacier catchment over 1951 2014 they used the daily temperature and precipitation from three regional climate models rcms rca4 remo and wrf v3 7 1 with resolution ranging from 5 to 50 km the mass balances in m w e a 1 and runoffs in m3 s 1 from engelhardt are compared with those of the present study in table 8 respectively over three common periods 1970 1984 1985 1999 and 2000 2014 as demarcated by engelhardt the mean annual mass balances from engelhardt are very similar with our study except over 1985 1999 with a significant ice wastage of 0 24 0 33 m w e a 1 whereas our study shows a nearly steady state preceding to 21st century already known from previous studies based on ice dynamics analysis field based geodetic as well as remotely sensed mass estimates azam et al 2012 vincent et al 2013 another recent study using satellite data estimated the mean annual mass balance of 0 03 0 10 m w e a 1 over 1971 1999 period mukherjee et al 2018 in line with close to steady state conditions during period ii table 5 even though the glacier wide mass balances for 1970 1984 and 2000 2014 are almost similar all the hydrologic components as well as total runoffs are systematically higher from engelhard for all three periods compared to the present study table 8 corresponding to a higher mass turn over their modelled summer mass balances were more negative than those of this present study for all three periods however the winter mass balances were almost the same for period 1970 1984 and higher for periods 1985 1999 and 2000 2014 table 8 to investigate the reasons responsible for the differences between engelhardt and our study we focus on precipitation inputs of both models since solid precipitation is one of the main drivers for mass balance or river runoff of chhota shigri catchment section 6 1 and since the magnitude and distribution of high elevation precipitation is one of the largest unknowns in mountain hydrology immerzeel et al 2015 fig 9 shows the mean monthly precipitation for mid catchment elevation 5065 m a s l used in engelhardt from rcms and in this study extrapolated from bhuntar observatory to 5065 m a sl as well as the records of all meteorological stations in the vicinity table 2 and fig 1 table 9 provides the annual and seasonal precipitation amounts for all sites we observe that the difference between engelhardt and our study is less related to the total annual precipitation only slightly higher in engelhard in line with their higher turnover than to the seasonal distribution of precipitation which is quite different with a winter summer partitioning of 63 37 and 49 51 in engelhardt and our study respectively table 9 actually the spatial variability of precipitation is extremely high fig 9 and table 9 over this region due to i elevation differences table 2 and ii the location of the orographic barrier fig 1 separating bhuntar observatory in windward side from all other stations in the leeward side this orographic barrier generates foehn effect during the monsoon when the air masses come from the south and is responsible for a strong south to north gradient of precipitation when humid winds collide with a mountain range they drain most of their moisture through precipitation over windward side up to the top of orographic barrier and then quickly descend over the leeward side with very less moisture content and thus precipitation barry 2008 chhota shigri glacier is located at the top of this orographic barrier fig 1 and flows south to north over the leeward slope of the mountain in such geographical setting upper reaches of chhota shigri glacier tend to receive precipitation during summer months when the stations down in the valley receive very limited precipitation this has often been observed in the field when clouds come from the south and provide snow falls on the glacier while the base camp stays dry in such a complex situation where monsoon is affected by a steep topography neither bhuntar station nor rcms whose resolution is not fine enough 5 to 50 km are able to capture the spatial variability of precipitation over chhota shigri catchment our study does not provide any evidence that one precipitation dataset is better than the other but it is clear that using different precipitation records as model input has large impacts on the results 7 conclusions the annual mass wastage on chhota shigri glacier is moderate with a mean value of 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 corresponding to cumulative mass loss of 14 10 m w e over 1969 2016 over the same modelling period the mean annual runoff is 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 snow melt contributes 63 to total mean annual runoff followed by almost equal share of 17 and 20 from ice melt and rain respectively monthly runoff is the maximum in august with a value of 7 78 m w e a 1 because of high snow melt maximum ice melt and maximum rainfall runoff except for a few close to balance years characterized by high runoffs the more negative mass balance years are associated with increased runoff at catchment outlet or vice versa summer temperatures as well as snow accumulation in both winter and summer seasons together control the glacier wide mass balances as well as catchment wide runoff annual glacier wide mass balance series suggested three periods period i 1969 1985 with moderate mass loss period ii 1986 2000 with near balanced conditions and period iii 2001 2016 with an accelerated mass wastage though the mean mass balances are quite different over period i and period ii the mean catchment wide runoff for both the periods are similar which is mainly due to the higher snow melt over period ii the maximum mass wastage during period iii indicates that the maximum runoff is mainly governed by accelerated ice wastage the model simulations are not devoid of equifinality issue however several independent validation datasets might limit this issue in the present study the glacio hydrological model has been developed exploiting a large number of field observed data and was independently validated with glacier mass balances and catchment runoffs therefore we believe that the equifinality issue is reduced however we stress that an independent validation allowing to quantify the ice and snow melt separately such as an isotopic or chemical mixing approach i e racoviteanu et al 2013 is further required to check the validity of snow and ice melt contributions chhota shigri glacier though one of the best studied glaciers in the whole himalayan range yet begs a better understanding of the spatial distribution of precipitation over this area to understand the dynamics of western disturbances and indian summer monsoon on both sides of the orographic barrier therefore we recommend developing a strong network of automatic precipitation and temperature sensors in this region the resulting

6465,glacier wide mass balances and runoffs are reconstructed over 1969 2016 for chhota shigri glacier catchment india applying a glacio hydrological model the model is forced using in situ daily air temperature and precipitation records from the meteorological stations at bhuntar observatory 1092 m a s l glacier base camp 3850 m a s l and glacier side moraine 4863 m a s l the modelled mean annual mass balance is 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 meter water equivalent per year while the mean catchment wide runoff is 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 over 1969 2016 three periods are distinguished in the reconstructed mass balance and runoff series periods i 1969 1985 and iii 2001 2016 show glacier mass wastage at rates of 0 36 and 0 50 m w e a 1 respectively corresponding to catchment wide runoffs of 1 51 and 1 65 m w e a 1 respectively conversely period ii 1986 2000 exhibits steady state conditions with average mass balances of 0 01 m w e a 1 and corresponding runoff of 1 52 m w e a 1 the reduced ice melt 0 20 m w e a 1 over period ii in agreement with steady state conditions is compensated by the increased snow melt 1 03 m w e a 1 providing almost similar catchment wide runoffs for period i and ii the increased runoff after 2000 is mainly governed by increased ice melt 0 32 m w e a 1 over period iii snow accumulation in winter and summer seasons together control the glacier wide mass balances as well as catchment wide runoffs snow melt contributes the maximum to the total mean annual runoff with 63 share while glacier melt and rain contribute 17 and 20 respectively over the whole period keywords himalayan glaciers mass balance hydrology ice melt runoff snow melt runoff 1 introduction the himalaya karakoram hk region hosts a large amount of snow and ice which provides continuous fresh water supply for over 800 million people of indus ganges and brahmaputra river basins for irrigation domestic consumption or hydro electric power immerzeel et al 2013 consequently there are increasing concerns about the effect of global warming on himalayan river hydrology immerzeel et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 and specifically on the different hydrologic components glacier melt runoff snowmelt runoff total streamflow further the heterogeneous mass wastage of hk glaciers brun et al 2017 azam et al 2018 suggests that the impact of changing climate on melt runoff generation depends on the regional climate of the glaciers as well as the contrasting glacier response to climate along the hk region sakai and fujita 2017 therefore a precise quantification of the snow and glacier melt contribution to river runoff in different parts of the hk is important for decision making in water sensitive sectors water resource management and flood risk reduction brown et al 2014 quantification of different hydrologic components in the hk rivers is done by applying several methods models the most common methods are empirical relationship between precipitation and runoff thayyen and gergan

tools to understand the relative contribution of different hydrologic components to the total river runoff glacio hydro meteorological investigations in the hk region are sparse compared to other mountain regions on earth on account of intrinsic challenges in maintaining the monitoring networks due to harsh climatic conditions and difficult access to the glaciers meteorological stations are often installed at valley bottoms and the knowledge of long term precipitation at glacier elevations is mostly lacking in the hk region precipitation has extremely large spatial variability due to rough topography in the hk region that makes extrapolation speculative immerzeel et al 2015 underestimation overestimation of precipitation amounts may produce bias in the modelled hydrologic components for instance the observed water budget over 2001 2005 in the dudh koshi basin was significantly imbalanced and attributed to a large underestimation of high elevation precipitation while the modeled water budget was well balanced due to unrealistic overestimation of the glacier melt volume savéan et al 2015 this situation makes it difficult to develop glacio hydrological models for the hk region in the present study a concerted attempt has been made to develop a glacio hydrological model involving extensive field based data to quantify the hydrologic components of runoff in a highly glacierized catchment from western himalaya this model includes an accumulation module a temperature index module and a rain module and is used to reconstruct the mass balances as well as to investigate the relationship between glacier wide mass balances and catchment wide runoff of the small catchment of chhota shigri glacier 34 7 km2 lahaul valley western himalaya india using the long term meteorological data between 1969 and 2016 from nearby observatory at bhuntar city and in situ meteorological stations in addition we analysed the relative contributions of the different hydrologic components including snow melt ice melt and rainfall runoff our study is certainly important to improve process understanding in small study areas which can later be generalized over larger regions 2 study area and climate chhota shigri catchment 32 28 n 77 58 e 34 7 km2 outlet at 3840 m a s l 47 glacierized is located in the lahaul valley of himachal pradesh in the western himalaya

chhota shigri catchment is located in the monsoon arid transition zone and is influenced by the indian summer monsoon during summer and the mid latitude disturbances during winter azam et al 2014b mean annual precipitation sum at base camp was 917 mm w e water equivalent between october 2012 and september 2017 out of which 71 was during the winter season november april and 29 during the summer monsoon may october confirming that chhota shigri glacier is a winter accumulation type glacier as suggested earlier by ageta and higuchi 1984 the mean annual temperature at the off glacier automatic weather station aws at 4863 m a s l was 5 4 c while the summer and winter mean temperatures were 0 5 c and 11 3 c respectively between 2009 and 2016 table 1 3 data 3 1 meteorological data to run the

southwest of chhota shigri glacier on the windward side of the mountain and belongs to the indian meteorological department fig 1 the details about data gaps and the necessary treatments carried out are given in azam et al 2014a we also used short term in situ meteorological data series from an aws located on a lateral moraine of chhota shigri glacier at 4863 m a s l azam et al 2014b and from an automatic all weather precipitation gauge geonor 200 tb at the base camp 3850 m a s l fig 1 besides mean monthly precipitation data from kaza 1984 2012 and tandi 1975 2015 stations obtained from tawde et al 2017 and chand et al 2017 respectively are also discussed in this paper section 6 4 the details of the stations are given in table 2 3 2 mass balance and runoff data a variety of data is available from previous studies on chhota shigri glacier including the geodetic mass balances covering different time periods berthier et al 2007 brun et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 annual glacier wide mass balances over 2012 2014 azam et al 2016 and seasonal runoff data over 2010 2013 engelhardt et al 2017 the available mass balances with their uncertainty ranges and corresponding methods are given in table 4 runoff measurements were performed during the summer months may to september over 2010 2015 at a gauging site about 2 km downstream of the chhota shigri glacier terminus fig 1 observation length of field observed runoffs was subjected to access to the catchment roads remained closed due to snow avalanches landslides and therefore not always available for the whole summer period since chhota shigri glacier stream floor is not paved at the gauging site and is difficult to keep free from the boulders transported through water particularly in the peak melt period july and august and due to other technical and instrumental limitations the possibility of error in runoff measurements is expected to be about 25 of the total runoff eeckman et al 2017 4 method 4 1 model description and parameters annual glacier wide mass balances and catchment wide runoffs are computed using a glacio hydrological model that includes an accumulation module and an ablation module as well as a rain module daily precipitation and temperature fields for each 50 m elevation range are generated from daily precipitation sums and daily mean temperatures from bhuntar observatory 1969 2013 aws and all weather precipitation gauge 2013 2016 applying the altitudinal precipitation gradient and temperature lapse rates for each day of year calculated in azam et al 2014a the model starts on 1st october of a year and calculates glacier mass balance and runoff for each elevation range of 50 m at daily time step fig 3 for a full hydrological year until 30th september of the following year taking into account the glacier surface state snow bare ice or debris and using the corresponding degree day factor ddf at a given elevation range glacierized and non glacierized the accumulation c mm w e d 1 is computed by 1 c p w h e n t t p 0 w h e n t t p where p and t are daily precipitation mm w e and temperature c respectively extrapolated at glacier elevations and tp is the threshold temperature c for snow rain conversely at a given elevation range glacierized and non glacierized the daily rainfall r is computed by 2 r 0 w h e n t t p p w h e n t t p the computed rainfall and more generally every computed discharge component mentioned hereafter are assumed to reach the discharge site within the same day temperature index module relates the amount of melt with positive air temperature sums positive degree days and a proportionality factor called ddf at each elevation range the ablation a mm w e d 1 is computed by 3 a dd f s i d t t m w h e n t t m 0 w h e n t t m where ddf denotes the degree day factor mm d 1 c 1 different for snow s ice i and debris covered ice d surfaces t is extrapolated daily mean air temperature c at given elevations and tm is the threshold temperature c for melt a dynamic storage of snow is maintained over the whole catchment the snow is added to glacierized and non glacierized areas following the equation 1 if t tm then snow is melted as a function of ddfs when snow is melted out at any given elevation range and t tm then over glacierized areas ice is melted as a function of ddfi or ddfd depending on whether the surface is clean ice and debris covered ice in this study ablation is restricted to melt total snow melt runoff qsnow over the whole catchment is computed as 4 q snow a sg a sng where asg and asng are snow melt over glacierized area and non glacierized area respectively total rainfall runoff qrain over the whole catchment is computed as 5 q rain r g r ng where rg and rng are rainfall runoff from glacierized area and non glacierized area respectively the daily runoff q at the catchment outlet is finally computed using the following equation 6 q q snow q ice q rain where q qsnow qice and qrain are total runoff snow melt runoff over whole catchment ice melt runoff clean ice as well as debris covered ice and rainfall runoff over whole catchment respectively with qice being equal to ice ablation for clean or debris covered ice surfaces eq 3 in order to keep the number of parameters minimum this model includes neither a radiation component nor a grid based approach which are useful to assess the spatial variability of the mass balance and thus runoff but less relevant in assessing their temporal variability the purpose of this work most of the model parameters are constrained using in situ measurements azam et al 2014a the temperature lapse rates for each day of the year are estimated using the daily mean temperatures from bhuntar observatory 1092 m a s l and glacier side aws 4863 m a s l for the period 18 august 2009 to 31 october 2012 computations of the ddf for different surfaces snow ice and debris covered ice were performed at various elevations between 4300 and 4900 m a s l using ablation stakes distributed on chhota shigri glacier during the summers 2009 2011 and 2012 june to october around 500 measurements have been performed at the ablation stakes ddf for each surface was obtained by linear regression between point ablation measurements performed and the corresponding cumulative positive degree days cpdd computed from the calculated daily lapse rates lrs estimated ddf for each surface snow ice and debris covered ice represents the average conditions of the corresponding surface because the measurements have been performed over the whole summer june to october and for different topographic conditions encountered at the glacier surface such as slope aspect etc see azam et al 2014a for more details literature about threshold temperatures for melt generation and snow rain delimitation is extremely limited in the himalayan region therefore in present study we adopted the most commonly used values i e 0 c and 1 c respectively hock 2003 lutz et al 2014 azam et al 2014a shea et al 2015 the altitudinal precipitation gradient was first constrained using the annual precipitation sums at bhuntar observatory and annual point mass balance at 5550 m a s l on chhota shigri glacier and then adjusted during model calibration the model structure is shown in fig 3 the parameter values are given in table 3 refreezing of melt water or rainfall has been rarely observed during field expeditions thus not taken into account in the model point scale surface energy balance study on chhota shigri glacier suggested that the net mass loss as a result of sublimation evaporation and resublimation condensation process is 2 of the total melting on the glacier azam et al 2014b and therefore ignored in the present study though some studies covering elevation range 500 8800 m a s l suggested evapotranspiration up to 14 to 20 of annual precipitation in the himalayan region andermann et al 2012 nepal et al 2014 we ignored the losses through evapotranspiration mainly because of two reasons 1 our catchment covering 3840 6263 m a s l elevation range has few days with positive temperatures and 2 the study area is almost vegetation free further limiting the losses through evapotranspiration the catchment outlet is only 2 km away from the glacier snout limiting the subsurface fluxes and therefore we also ignored the subsurface fluxes dye tracer experiments during 2010 2012 pottakkal et al unpublished data suggested that the surface melt water from ablation area reaches the catchment outlet through moulins and englacial conduits within a few hours supporting our same day runoff assumption for the computation of the mass balances and runoffs we used a fixed glacier surface over the whole modelling period see section 4 4 the non glacierized catchment area above 5200 m a s l is mostly very steep fig 1 and thus the accumulated snow occasionally tends to fall on the glacier as avalanches these snow avalanches are ignored in the model calculations it is noteworthy that the results are likely to be sensitive to the choice of this parameter set table 3 or to the assumptions described above therefore we discussed below these choices and conducted model sensitivity tests see section 4 6 to quantify the effects of each main parameter or assumption on the model results 4 2 model calibration altitudinal precipitation gradient was the only parameter that was poorly constrained due to its large spatial variability and limited in situ precipitation data two different data sets of annual mean altitudinal mass balance measurements between 2002 and 2012 and decadal geodetic mass balance observations over 1988 2010 period had been used simultaneously to calibrate the altitudinal precipitation gradient azam et al 2014a the model was tuned to minimize at the same time i the resulting root mean square errors rmse between modelled and measured annual point mass balances averaged every 50 meter elevation range from 2002 to 2012 and ii the difference between modelled mass balances and geodetic mass balances at decadal scale i e 1988 1999 and 1999 2010 the modelled annual glacier wide annual mbs were cumulated over the periods when decadal geodetic mass balances vincent et al 2013 were available in order to make a comparison in order to avoid overtuning the model is not calibrated with field runoff data rather it is used for model validation section 4 5 4 3 model efficiency we also performed nash and sutcliffe efficiency test nash and sutcliffe 1970 to check the performance of our model this test is defined as follows 7 e 1 i 1 n q i m i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 where e is the efficiency of the model qi mi and q are the observed runoff modelled runoff and mean observed runoff over the period of investigation the efficiency range lies between 1 corresponds to a perfect match and infinite the calculated efficiency for different years between 2010 and 2015 varies from 1 05 to 0 60 demonstrating the good performance of the model fig 4 4 4 error estimation the uncertainty in annual mass balances was assessed by changing step by step one parameter at a time the other parameters remaining unchanged and the resulting cumulative modelled mass balances were compared to the observed geodetic mass balances at decadal scale 1988 1999 and 1999 2010 given the very small debris cover area 3 4 the model is not sensitive to ddfd and thus it was not used in this exercise daily temperature lapse rates are related to ddf extrapolated temperature and precipitation fields eqs 1 2 so selecting different values for temperature lapse rates would have resulted in different values of ddf extrapolated temperature and precipitation fields without significantly changing the model results therefore these were also not used for model tuning further to keep them realistic the threshold temperatures tm and tp were allowed to change between 1 0 and 1 0 c only each model parameter tm tp p g ddf s and ddfi was changed to allow maximal variations of the resulting modelled cumulative mass balances within the limits prescribed by the uncertainty bounds of the observed geodetic mass balances 2 7 and 1 8 m w e for 1988 1999 and 1999 2010 respectively table 4 the maximum ranges of model parameters used are given in table 3 as a result of this exercise each parameter provides two new 47 year series of annual mass balances one toward negative values and the other toward positive values the resulting uncertainty in annual mass balances is taken as the highest standard deviation calculated between these new series and the initial mass balance series the model showed maximum standard deviation for ddfs followed by altitudinal precipitation gradient and ddfi the estimated uncertainty bounds in annual mass balances is as high as 0 36 m w e a 1 and the corresponding error in the annual runoff is estimated as 0 23 m w e a 1 4 5 model validation the model is validated against a variety of available data sets on chhota shigri glacier from different studies 1 the geodetic mass balances over 1971 1999 1999 2011 mukherjee et al 2018 1999 2004 berthier et al 2007 and 2005 2014 brun et al 2017 2 the in situ annual mass balances between 2012 and 2014 azam et al 2016 and 3 the observed runoff between 2010 and 2015 engelhardt et al 2017 table 4 provides a study to study comparison of the modelled mass balances with the observed mass balances for the respective periods the agreement is most of the time promising or even good while considering the respective uncertainty bars even though the model gives more negative mass balances than the observed mass balances of mukherjee et al 2018 and brun et al 2017 or twice less negative than the field measurements over the period 2012 2014 performed by azam et al 2014a table 4 as a second validation the modelled daily runoffs between 2010 and 2015 have been compared to observed runoffs at chhota shigri discharge site in summer the agreement is fair with correlation coefficients r2 ranging from 0 56 in summer 2014 to 0 70 in summer 2012 or the efficiency e ranging from 1 05 in 2012 to 0 60 in 2010 fig 4 the model slightly overestimated the daily runoffs for 2012 5 and 2015 5 while underestimating them for 2010 6 2011 5 2013 15 and 2014 42 the model is calibrated using only point mass balances and independently validated with two different data sets viz mass balances and runoffs however simulations of a variety of different systems have demonstrated the ubiquitous nature of equifinality issue even with moderate levels of hydrological models beven and freer 2001 overall in our study after this double validation and looking at the model efficiency we believe that the model is robust enough to fairly reconstruct both the glacier wide mass balances and the catchment wide runoffs with limited equifinality issue 4 6 model sensitivity the sensitivity of the model to each parameter µ was assessed by re running the model changing each parameter using corresponding plausible range highest parameter value µh and lowest parameter value µl while keeping the other variables and model parameters unchanged table 3 these sensitivity tests for chhota shigri glacier catchment were performed calculating the annual glacier wide mass balance and catchment wide runoff averaged over the period 1969 2016 following oerlemans et al 1998 as 8 db a d μ b a μ h b a μ l 2 9 dq d μ q μ h q μ l 2 where ba and q being the glacier wide mass balance and catchment wide runoff averaged over the period 1969 2016 using the highest lowest value of the parameter µ the estimated model sensitivities for parameters are given in table 3 model is the most sensitive mass balance sensitivity 0 44 m w e a 1 and runoff sensitivity 0 29 m w e a 1 to threshold temperature for melt followed by precipitation gradient mass balance sensitivity 0 35 m w e a 1 and runoff sensitivity 0 03 m w e a 1 though we have used a single threshold temperature for snow and ice melt we also checked the model sensitivity to different threshold temperatures for snow and ice melt these model sensitivities were estimated using 1 c change in threshold temperature independently for snow and ice threshold temperatures the sensitivity of modelled glacier wide mass balance to threshold temperature for snow melt is around four times higher than ice while the sensitivity of modelled runoff to threshold temperature for snow melt is six fold that of ice besides the given input parameters we also developed sensitivity test for evapotranspiration by changing input precipitation 0 to 20 as evapotranspiration losses could be up to 20 of precipitation amounts in the himalayan region andermann et al 2012 the model sensitivity of mass balance and runoff for 20 reduction in evapotranspiration are estimated to be 0 17 m w e a 1 and 0 05 m w e a 1 respectively for modelling the mass balances and runoffs in the present study we used an unchanged glacier area and hypsometry of the year 2004 2005 wagnon et al 2007 however this assumption induces mass balance errors due to temperature changes resulting from surface elevation changes not taken into account the mass balance errors arising from temperature changes associated with surface elevation changes resulting from unequal mass wastage were estimated and found to be very small 0 03 m w e a 1 compared to the total estimated uncertainty in mass balances 0 36 m w e a 1 mukherjee et al 2018 assessed an area reduction from 15 7 0 20 to 15 5 0 40 m2 over 1971 1999 corresponding to an area reduction of 0 05 per year hence to test the effect of an unchanged area assumption we assumed this area change restricted to only ablation area below 5050 m a s l 52 of total area that resulted in an area reduction of 0 10 per year over ablation area relative to the area in 2004 2005 used in our study two new hypsographies are tested one for 1969 1970 corresponding to the 2004 2005 ablation area increased by 3 35 0 10 35 years and the other for 2015 2016 corresponding to the 2004 2005 ablation area decreased by 1 05 0 10 11 years hydrological years we ran the model using these two new hypsographies 1969 1970 and 2015 2016 and obtained two new mass balance and runoff series for 1969 1970 and 2015 2016 hydrological years the errors due to hypsography assumption in our model are estimated as the rmse between initial model results with 1960 1970 and 2015 2016 mass balance and runoff series respectively the rmse between 2004 and 2005 and 1969 1970 hypsographies are 0 16 and 0 07 m w e a 1 for mass balances and runoffs respectively whereas the rmse between 2004 and 2005 and 2015 2016 hypsographies are 0 05 and 0 02 m w e for mass balances and runoffs respectively combining these rmse for both periods the rmse between 1969 and 2016 are 0 21 and 0 09 m w e a 1 for mass balances and runoffs respectively these differences are lower than the already estimated errors of 0 36 and 0 23 m w e in mass balances and runoffs respectively supporting our temporally unchanged hypsography assumption 5 results 5 1 modelled seasonal runoffs the modelled runoffs from the catchment are negligible during winter season november to april with a mean value of 0 01 m w e a 1 and the summer may to october runoffs are responsible for the quasi total annual runoffs fig 5 a represents the seasonal hydrographs of snow melt runoff ice melt runoff rainfall runoff and total runoff at chhota shigri catchment outlet fig 1 the early summer runoff is mainly generated by snow melt which starts in april and peaks in july and august with maximum monthly values of 4 37 and 4 28 m w e a 1 respectively in august there is a sharp decrease in snow melt because most of the snow has already melted out while the snow line progressively migrates to higher elevations during the course of the summer ice melt progressively increases and reaches its maximum in august with a monthly value of 1 85 m w e a 1 around 56 of total ice melt the major rainfall contribution comes between june and september peaking in august with a monthly value of 1 65 m w e a 1 the total monthly runoff peaks in august with a value of 7 78 m w e a 1 from a combination of high snow melt maximum ice melt and maximum rainfall runoff fig 5a the maximum runoff in july august in chhota shigri catchment is in good agreement with other studies in hma including himalayan region wang et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 nepal et al 2014 tahir et al 2016 han et al 2019 5 2 modelled and observed annual glacier wide mass balances fig 6 shows year to year comparison between field observed and modelled annual mass balances between 2002 and 2014 on chhota shigri glacier the differences between both mass balances are within the uncertainties except for 2009 in 2009 the modelled mass balance is estimated as 1 20 0 36 m w e a 1 while the field observed mass balance was 0 12 0 40 m w e a 1 we could not find any reason for this large difference in modelled and observed mass balances for 2009 inset in fig 6 shows the correlations r2 0 30 between modelled and observed annual mass balances with a calculated rmse of 0 55 m w e a 1 for all 12 years 2002 2014 the correlation is quite good if the 2009 data is excluded r2 0 82 and rmse 0 39 m w e a 1 inset in fig 6 the modelled cumulative mass wastage 5 69 m w e corresponding to 0 47 0 36 m w e a 1 is in close agreement with the observed cumulative loss 6 72 m w e corresponding to 0 56 0 40 m w e a 1 between 2002 and 2014 5 3 annual glacier wide mass balances and annual runoffs mass balances hydrologic components as well as total runoffs for chhota shigri glacier catchment over 1969 2016 are shown in fig 7 and table 5 the mean glacier wide mass balance is 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 with a cumulative mass wastage of 14 10 m w e showing the moderate mass wastage on chhota shigri glacier over the last five decades over the whole modelling period the mean runoff is 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 the annual mean runoffs show a large inter annual variability with the minimum runoff of 1 00 0 23 m w e a 1 for the hydrological year 1975 1976 and the maximum runoff of 1 86 0 23 m w e a 1 for the hydrological year 1998 1999 the maximum share of 63 to total catchment runoff comes from snow melt with almost equal contribution from glacierized and non glacierized areas followed by similar contributions of 17 and 20 from ice melt and rain respectively during the study period the relationship between annual mass balances and annual mean runoffs for chhota shigri catchment is shown in the inset of fig 7 though the relationship r2 0 31 n 47 years is weak the more negative mass balances are often associated with increased runoff at catchment outlet or vice versa chhota shigri glacier receives a large part of annual precipitation in winter in solid form table 1 that is released in summer due to high temperatures and intense solar radiation azam et al 2014b during negative mass balance years additional runoff from wastage of perennial glacier storage is released in addition to the hydrological cycle thereby increasing catchment runoff conversely during positive mass balance years catchment runoff decreases as some water is stored in the glacier in the form of ice hock et al 2005 however few positive mass balance years are found to be associated with more runoff such years 1998 2005 2010 and 2015 shown in red color in inset of fig 7 are characterized by very high precipitation that delivers a direct contribution of rain or summer snowfalls that melt quickly due to high summer temperatures fig 6 this is reminiscent of monsoon dominated glaciers of central and eastern himalaya where maximum precipitation coincides with the maximum discharge in summer and therefore a large runoff contribution comes directly from rainfall or monsoonal snowfalls in the catchment that often melts quickly due to high summer temperature and high radiation long and short wave thayyen and gergan 2010 ragettli et al 2015 5 4 decadal mass balances vs decadal runoffs here we build upon the work of azam et al 2014a who analysed three different periods period ii 1986 2000 characterized by almost balanced conditions sandwiched between two mass wastage periods of i 1969 1985 and iii 2001 2012 the latter being extended to 2001 2016 in this present study table 5 shows the snow melt runoff ice melt runoff rainfall runoff for periods i ii and iii respectively along with their corresponding annual and seasonal glacier wide mass balances the mean catchment wide runoff for period i and ii are almost equal with 1 51 and 1 52 m w e a 1 respectively but the mean glacier wide mass balances are quite different with values of 0 36 and 0 01 m w e a 1 respectively the similar runoff under different mass balance conditions can be explained with the relative contributions of different hydrologic components to the total runoff whereas the rainfall runoff is almost similar for all three periods the snow and ice melt runoffs are quite different fig 7 table 5 for period ii the mean winter mass balance 1 25 m w e a 1 is higher than that of period i 1 02 m w e a 1 indicating more snow accumulation on the glacier as well as non glacierized parts of the catchment during period ii higher annual precipitation values over period ii fig 6 also support higher accumulation this excess snow results in more snow melt generation during period ii 1 03 m w e a 1 compared to 0 90 m w e a 1 during period i fig 7 table 5 further the mean summer mass balance and resulting mean annual mass balances are more negative for period i 1 38 and 0 36 m w e a 1 respectively compared to period ii 1 27 and 0 01 m w e a 1 respectively that provides more ice melt runoff for period i 0 30 m w e a 1 than period ii 0 20 m w e a 1 fig 7 table 5 the reduced ice melt runoff over period ii in agreement with steady state conditions is compensated by the increased snow melt runoff that provides almost similar total runoffs for period i and ii table 6 over period iii the increased mean runoff of 1 65 m w e a 1 is mainly governed by the increased ice melt 0 32 m w e a 1 due to the most negative annual mass balances of the entire study period amounting to 0 50 m w e a 1 corresponding to the lowest winter mean mass balances of 1 05 m w e a 1 and the most negative summer mass balances of 1 54 m w e a 1 fig 7 table 5 6 discussion 6 1 snow accumulation as a major driver for catchment wide runoff in order to give insights into the functioning of chhota shigri catchment we sorted all the years in three categories positive mass balance years glacier wide mass balance 0 10 m w e a 1 16 years negative mass balance years glacier wide mass balance 0 10 m w e a 1 24 years and close to balanced years 0 10 m w e a 1 glacier wide mass balance 0 10 m w e a 1 7 years table 6 shows mean annual and seasonal mass balances and mean hydrologic components as well as the catchment wide mean precipitation snow and rain and air temperature while table 7 shows mean monthly hydrological components during summer months may to october fig 8 displays the mean monthly evolution of the different hydrologic components mean catchment wide precipitation snow and rain and mean catchment wide air temperatures for these three categories mean monthly catchment wide temperatures are the highest during july august in agreement with the highest catchment runoffs for all three categories fig 8 table 7 balanced and positive mass balance years are rather similar with a slight increase of ice melt during balanced years fig 8 table 7 and a maximum winter accumulation during positive years table 6 negative mass balance years are drastically different especially during the second half of the summer after mid july or beginning of august when ice melt strongly increases in detriment of snowmelt fig 8 table 7 in such years a rapid decay of the snow cover likely associated with a vertical migration of the snow line leaves a large part of the glacier exposed with bare ice enhancing the absorption of solar radiation and fostering ice melt this rapid decay of the snow cover is due either to a below average winter accumulation mölg et al 2014 as revealed by the lowest value of winter mass balance or reduced snowfalls azam et al 2014b also associated with the highest summer temperatures as revealed by very negative summer mass balance for the negative mass balance category fig 8 and table 6 or a combination of both the importance of annual and seasonal snowfalls controlling the glacier wide mass balance of the glacier and in turn its catchment wide runoff has already been partly highlighted by azam et al 2014b using an energy balance approach 6 2 comparison with other studies engelhardt et al 2017 hereafter engelhardt recently modelled the runoffs and mass balances of chhota shigri glacier catchment over 1951 2014 they used the daily temperature and precipitation from three regional climate models rcms rca4 remo and wrf v3 7 1 with resolution ranging from 5 to 50 km the mass balances in m w e a 1 and runoffs in m3 s 1 from engelhardt are compared with those of the present study in table 8 respectively over three common periods 1970 1984 1985 1999 and 2000 2014 as demarcated by engelhardt the mean annual mass balances from engelhardt are very similar with our study except over 1985 1999 with a significant ice wastage of 0 24 0 33 m w e a 1 whereas our study shows a nearly steady state preceding to 21st century already known from previous studies based on ice dynamics analysis field based geodetic as well as remotely sensed mass estimates azam et al 2012 vincent et al 2013 another recent study using satellite data estimated the mean annual mass balance of 0 03 0 10 m w e a 1 over 1971 1999 period mukherjee et al 2018 in line with close to steady state conditions during period ii table 5 even though the glacier wide mass balances for 1970 1984 and 2000 2014 are almost similar all the hydrologic components as well as total runoffs are systematically higher from engelhard for all three periods compared to the present study table 8 corresponding to a higher mass turn over their modelled summer mass balances were more negative than those of this present study for all three periods however the winter mass balances were almost the same for period 1970 1984 and higher for periods 1985 1999 and 2000 2014 table 8 to investigate the reasons responsible for the differences between engelhardt and our study we focus on precipitation inputs of both models since solid precipitation is one of the main drivers for mass balance or river runoff of chhota shigri catchment section 6 1 and since the magnitude and distribution of high elevation precipitation is one of the largest unknowns in mountain hydrology immerzeel et al 2015 fig 9 shows the mean monthly precipitation for mid catchment elevation 5065 m a s l used in engelhardt from rcms and in this study extrapolated from bhuntar observatory to 5065 m a sl as well as the records of all meteorological stations in the vicinity table 2 and fig 1 table 9 provides the annual and seasonal precipitation amounts for all sites we observe that the difference between engelhardt and our study is less related to the total annual precipitation only slightly higher in engelhard in line with their higher turnover than to the seasonal distribution of precipitation which is quite different with a winter summer partitioning of 63 37 and 49 51 in engelhardt and our study respectively table 9 actually the spatial variability of precipitation is extremely high fig 9 and table 9 over this region due to i elevation differences table 2 and ii the location of the orographic barrier fig 1 separating bhuntar observatory in windward side from all other stations in the leeward side this orographic barrier generates foehn effect during the monsoon when the air masses come from the south and is responsible for a strong south to north gradient of precipitation when humid winds collide with a mountain range they drain most of their moisture through precipitation over windward side up to the top of orographic barrier and then quickly descend over the leeward side with very less moisture content and thus precipitation barry 2008 chhota shigri glacier is located at the top of this orographic barrier fig 1 and flows south to north over the leeward slope of the mountain in such geographical setting upper reaches of chhota shigri glacier tend to receive precipitation during summer months when the stations down in the valley receive very limited precipitation this has often been observed in the field when clouds come from the south and provide snow falls on the glacier while the base camp stays dry in such a complex situation where monsoon is affected by a steep topography neither bhuntar station nor rcms whose resolution is not fine enough 5 to 50 km are able to capture the spatial variability of precipitation over chhota shigri catchment our study does not provide any evidence that one precipitation dataset is better than the other but it is clear that using different precipitation records as model input has large impacts on the results 7 conclusions the annual mass wastage on chhota shigri glacier is moderate with a mean value of 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 corresponding to cumulative mass loss of 14 10 m w e over 1969 2016 over the same modelling period the mean annual runoff is 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 snow melt contributes 63 to total mean annual runoff followed by almost equal share of 17 and 20 from ice melt and rain respectively monthly runoff is the maximum in august with a value of 7 78 m w e a 1 because of high snow melt maximum ice melt and maximum rainfall runoff except for a few close to balance years characterized by high runoffs the more negative mass balance years are associated with increased runoff at catchment outlet or vice versa summer temperatures as well as snow accumulation in both winter and summer seasons together control the glacier wide mass balances as well as catchment wide runoff annual glacier wide mass balance series suggested three periods period i 1969 1985 with moderate mass loss period ii 1986 2000 with near balanced conditions and period iii 2001 2016 with an accelerated mass wastage though the mean mass balances are quite different over period i and period ii the mean catchment wide runoff for both the periods are similar which is mainly due to the higher snow melt over period ii the maximum mass wastage during period iii indicates that the maximum runoff is mainly governed by accelerated ice wastage the model simulations are not devoid of equifinality issue however several independent validation datasets might limit this issue in the present study the glacio hydrological model has been developed exploiting a large number of field observed data and was independently validated with glacier mass balances and catchment runoffs therefore we believe that the equifinality issue is reduced however we stress that an independent validation allowing to quantify the ice and snow melt separately such as an isotopic or chemical mixing approach i e racoviteanu et al 2013 is further required to check the validity of snow and ice melt contributions chhota shigri glacier though one of the best studied glaciers in the whole himalayan range yet begs a better understanding of the spatial distribution of precipitation over this area to understand the dynamics of western disturbances and indian summer monsoon on both sides of the orographic barrier therefore we recommend developing a strong network of automatic precipitation and temperature sensors in this region the resulting

6466,the significance of unconventional low permeability reservoir development has been well recognized in recent years pressure and rate transient behavior analyses are crucial methods of finding key factors that affect well production in these formations however previous analytically or semi analytically based gridless models of pressure and rate transient response analyses for multi stage fractured horizontal wells mfhws mainly deal with homogeneous reservoirs and merely use skin factors to describe the fracture damage fracture damage normally refers to the conductivity reduction within hydraulic fractures and the matrix permeability or porosity impairment near the fracture face the widely applied skin factors are derived under steady state conditions and are accurate only when the damage length is small they also show inability to simulate partially propped fractures and multiple fracture damage scenarios in this article a general linear flow model is established to simulate heterogeneous box shaped unconventional low permeability reservoirs with closed outer boundaries and various hydraulic fracture damage including 1 fracture near wellbore damage caused by proppant flow back over displacement embedment crush or ineffective placement 2 partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions 3 fracturing fluid leak off damage in the adjacent matrix 4 dual or multiple damage effects under unsteady flow conditions the fracture interference in heterogeneous reservoirs is modeled by our previous method zeng et al 2018 the basic model has been verified against well testing software kappa and satisfactory agreements are obtained new type curves have been generated with distinct flow regimes for specific fracture damage mechanisms sensitivity analyses have been conducted to find out how the damage properties affect the shape and duration of these distinct regimes reservoir heterogeneity combined with fracture damage makes the pressure and rate behavior deviate significantly from the undamaged homogeneous one and controls the fracture flux distribution in certain regimes during production for both constant rate and constant pressure production cases in addition field data from the cardium unconventional light oil formation in western canada are analyzed through type curve matching which demonstrates the benefits of our model the

fracturing is currently the most effective technique to enhance the productivity of unconventional low permeability reservoirs that have become hotspots in the oil and gas industry however there are many potential damage mechanisms that contribute to the well productivity reduction after hydraulic fracturing two major damage scenarios are the conductivity reduction of hydraulic fractures and matrix impairment the internal filter cake in the vicinity of the fracture face gdanski et al 2009 the two scenarios are major damage mechanisms because if we neglect the direct fluid flow from the reservoir to the horizontal well cased hole completions the performance of a fractured well is controlled by the two processes 1 the fluid inflow from the matrix at the fracture face and 2 the fluid flow from fractures to the wellbore li et al 2012 as this newly developed model is for cased hole mfhws the possible near wellbore damaged reservoir zone for open hole wells is not considered besides with the continuous development of unconventional low permeability reservoirs the exploitation targets have become more complex reservoir heterogeneity is an essential factor that provides difficulty and uncertainty in evaluating both the initial and long term pressure and rate transient behavior in this section the fracture damage mechanisms and the current methods of simulating fracture damage are first introduced then the limitation of existing models and the advantage of this work will be summarized 1 1 fracture conductivity reduction fracture conductivity is defined as the product of fracture permeability and fracture width and can fundamentally determine post stimulation well production zhang et al 2015 fracture conductivity damage in this study refers to choked fractures and partially propped or unpropped sections in the fracture tips as shown in figs 1 and 2 1 1 1 proppant over displacement and flow back in practice at the end of a stimulation treatment proppant over displacement occurs while clearing casing of sand then pumping perforation guns and bridge plugs would generate additional over displacement themig 2010 snyder and seale 2011 pitts et al 2013 dusterhoft et al 2014 gutierrez et al 2014 al tailji et al 2014 in proppant over displacement cases a larger portion of proppants can be pumped deep within the fracture with few proppants left in the near wellbore region leading to incomplete fracture conductivity or a complete loss of conductivity towards the wellbore zander et al 2010 rylance and martin 2014 proppant over displacement may be concerned in transverse fractures which are very common for mfhws although it would not pose noticeable effects on the productivity of longitudinal fractures due to the extensive connection between longitudinal fractures and the wellbore vincent 2011 besler et al 2007 van gijtenbeek et al 2012 found that over displacement may not be detrimental to shale formations where the proppant transport is poor there would not be proppants left in the near wellbore area even without over displacement but in most other types of fractured formations over displacement should be considered el rabaa and siddiqui 2015 examined the effects of proppant over displacement and found that the over displacement case can have as low as 30 productivity of the undamaged case apart from proppant over displacement another near wellbore fracture damage mechanism that a number of groups have studied is proppant flow back to the industry proppant flow back from hydraulic fractures is of significant concerns especially for offshore environments milton tayler et al 1992 howard et al 1995 daneshy 2005 as many as 20 of the proppants in the fracture can be produced to the surface martins et al 1992 card et al 1995 although there are methods that can control proppant over displacement and back production these strategies all have their limitations and may only be applicable in certain environments for existing analytical models the choked fracture effect is simulated by the choked skin factor cinco ley and smaniego 1981 and its modified expressions 1 1 2 chemical impairment water soluble polymers are normally added to fracturing fluids to increase their viscosity the viscosity of fracturing fluids is designed to decrease due to polymer degradation after stimulation treatments to minimize the potential fracture conductivity damage however degraded polymers for example the degraded guar gum may not be completely water soluble cook 1975 this residual impedes the oil and gas flow even after the fracture cleanup process both laboratory tests and field production results have indicated this fracture conductivity damage elbel et al 1991 the insufficient broken fracturing fluids exist in 25 of the cases where crosslinked gels are used for fracturing treatments unbroken polymers can reduce gas recovery by 30 and decrease the initial gas rate as high as 80 voneiff et al 1996 the degree of fracture conductivity impairment increases with the increase of the gel concentration even at a low concentration level hawkins 1988 sanaei et al 2016 pointed out that even clay swelling can induce conductivity damage although some fracturing fluid additives such as polyacrylamides leave no residue after degradation they usually cost more money cook 1975 using low viscosity fracturing fluids shows an advantage in relieving residual damage and carrying low density proppants to control proppant settling parker et al 2005 2012 nguyen et al 2013 but the cost and effectiveness of low density proppants may provide some limitations modeling this fracture conductivity damage on production can be realized by changing the whole fracture conductivity which has been done in our previous work zeng et al 2017 2018 1 1 3 partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions many hydraulically induced fractures do not form as expected resulting in minimally propped areas namely partially propped or unpropped sections glover et al 2015 apart from choked fractures proppants may not be placed deep into the fracture these unpropped fracture sections caused by insufficient proppant injecting proppant flow back and settling can still have some conductivity because the fracture surfaces are irregular and do not completely match after closure as shown in fig 2 however the conductivity can be at least two orders of magnitude lower without proppants fredd et al 2001 another situation is that monolayer proppants with a low proppant concentration may be placed in the fracture front and provide conductivity for this area even the aligned unpropped hydraulic fractures have relatively high permeability compared with reservoir rocks zhang et al 2015 heterogeneity and stress shadow effects can affect fracture propagation which creates the width for the proppant flow zhong et al 2014 liu et al 2016a lu et al 2016 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and hence influence proppant placement previously no skin factor can address partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions and few models have considered this effect 1 2 matrix impairment around fractures in this case the hydraulic fracture is surrounded by a damaged zone which creates an additional pressure drop due to excessive fracturing fluid invading as shown in fig 3 fracturing fluid leak off widely exists in unconventional low permeability formations liu et al 2016b liu et al 2017 bellarby 2009 pointed out that the suspended particles with diameters between 1 7 and 1 3 of the pore throat size are likely to plug the formation and form an internal filter cake that is difficult to remove clay swelling in the invaded zone may also reduce the formation permeability holdich 1979 here the effects of the stubborn matrix impairment near the fracture face are thoroughly investigated in van poollen 1957 found that the depth of the permeability damage can be 1 in with a permeability loss ranging from 0 to 95 then an electrical model steady state was used to simulate the influence on production under various damage levels results reveal that the overall effects of damage are not significant compared with the fracture flow capacity damage and the damaged region tends to penetrate 1 in to 2 in later cinco ley and samaniego 1977 investigated the effects of the fracture damage caused by an infinitesimal skin around the fracture they used a dimensionless skin factor to describe this damage and found that a damaged fracture shows a relatively flat line in the log log dimensionless pressure curve the more serious the damage is the longer this fracture face skin controlled period in the early stage will be cinco ley and smaniego 1981 holdich 1979 numerically analyzed how fluid leak off damages the invaded zone the two phase two dimensional simulation results show that the damaged zone could extend to a depth of 6 in and the lower the reservoir permeability is the heavier the impairment effects will be in some cases the gas flow in the damaged zone can even be completely blocked the study conducted by aggour and economides 1999 indicates that for fractured high permeability reservoirs when the fluid leak off penetration is small skin effects may not become noticeable even the permeability impairment is severe gdanski et al 2009 modified the cinco ley and samaniego 1977 fracture face skin as a function of time to calculate the two phase flow they provided skin evolution data during cleanup and production processes and gave practical suggestions to minimize the fracture face damage romero et al 2002 applied a nonuniform fracture face skin factor and found that it has a significant impact on productivity and changes the optimal dimensionless fracture conductivity li et al 2012 proposed a model considering the reservoir fracture crossflow in the finite conductivity fracture for shale reservoirs their study reveals that the fluid leak off damage is not a strong factor for the well productivity reduction the significance of the fluid leak off damage on production depends on the invasion depth and damaged permeability odumabo et al 2014 experimentally studied the impact of fracturing fluid leak off on tight gas formations and took the leak off volume and shut in time as two key variables of their research results demonstrate that a larger leak off volume reduces effective permeability while an increase in shut in time increases effective permeability although the two variables affect the effective permeability in opposing ways the leak off process is the dominant one bostrom et al 2014 performed similar experiments and obtained optimized shut in time for analytical models the fracture face skin factor cinco ley and samaniego 1977 and the modified ones are used to describe this damage some of the above mentioned studies conclusions are conflicting regarding the significance of this damage in post fracturing performance 1 3 combined damage effects the above damage mechanisms may occur simultaneously for a fractured well combined damage effects here refer to fractures with fracture face matrix impairment and choked near wellbore regions partially propped fractures with near wellbore damage partially propped fractures with impaired fracture faces and the combination of choked damage fracture face damage and partially propped fractures few people have studied the multiple damage effects in the literature as presented above the concept of skin factors and the modified expressions have been applied extensively to represent fracture damage however the skin factor concept is based on the steady state flow assumption skin factors are only applicable when the damaged zone width is small cinco ley and smaniego 1977 the unsteady flow fracture damage condition is realized by numerical simulation narasimhan and palen 1979 bennett et al 1983 in reality the damaged area can actually be larger than we normally expect take the fracture choke damage as an example approximately 20 of placed proppants can be produced back martins et al 1992 indicating that the damage length can be longer than 20 of the total fracture length besides the skin factor idealization can only address the fracture face and choked fracture damage it shows an obvious inability in dealing with partially propped and multiple fracture damage cases in addition the performance of mfhws in heterogeneous reservoirs deviates substantially from that in homogeneous reservoirs normally numerical models or semi analytical models with infinite series are frequently used to deal with heterogeneous reservoirs requiring extensive input parameters which may not be available at the early stage of exploitation and considerable computing time besides most of the time saving analytical models for mfhws are derived for homogeneous reservoirs or those with stimulated reservoir volumes recently zeng et al 2017 and 2018 established composite linear flow models to address reservoir heterogeneity in artificially fractured reservoirs however the two models are specifically derived to simulate shale gas reservoirs and tight reservoirs with a threshold pressure gradient respectively and cannot include any complex fracture damage the purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive linear flow model to address the following issues 1 modeling the above possible single mechanism fracture damage cases under unsteady state conditions and analyzing how the key damage properties affect the transient pressure and rate behavior 2 simulating multiple fracture damage and generating new type curves with distinct flow regimes 3 combing fracture damage and reservoir heterogeneity and analyzing the typical transient behavior for fracture damage diagnostic and the flux distribution of individual fractures 4 conducting a field application and interpreting the field data that cannot be effectively handled by conventional models 2 methodologies the model presented here is extended from the seven region linear flow models zeng et al 2017 2018 as shown in fig 4 the linear flow assumption is made because the linear flow regime has been widely observed in reservoirs with mfhws and can last for years wattenbarger et al 1998 nobakht and clarkson 2012a b the linear flow model is applicable for unconventional low permeability reservoirs with mfhws unless the beyond well tip regions control well performance the beyond well tip region control only occurs when the reservoir permeability is well above the tight reservoir permeability range or the rate or the bottom hole pressure is at an unrealistically low level the linear flow model is valid for common low permeability formations brown et al 2011 besides the geometry of mfhw systems indicates that it is not likely to form radial flow regimes between two adjacent fractures stalgorova and mattar 2013 due to the symmetry an eighth of a hydraulic fracture drainage volume is appropriate to describe our model the hydraulic fracture region is further divided into three parts damaged zones 1 and 2 and the propped zone to simulate fracture conductivity damage while a matrix impairment zone damaged zone 3 is added to depict the fluid leak off damage fig 5 to address reservoir heterogeneity this model assigns distinct properties to each reservoir block as each flow region fig 4 can have its own reservoir properties other assumptions of the physical model are listed below the mfhw is drilled at the center of a box shaped low permeability reservoir with closed outer boundaries a uniform pressure value at the initial time and constant temperature to obtain both the transient pressure and rate behavior the mfhw can produce either under a constant rate condition or under a constant pressure condition with a single phase flow other properties of both the reservoir and fluids are constant the gravity effects for the gas flow can be ignored due to its low density for low permeability oil reservoirs with extremely high percolation resistance the impact of gravity for liquid phase transport is also negligible chen et al 2016 an eighth of a fracture drainage volume is divided into ten linear flow regions as shown in figs 4 and 5 including three hydraulic fracture sub regions one matrix impairment region near the fracture face two inner flow regions two outer flow regions and two upper flow regions when the fracture partially penetrates the formation in the horizontal direction two outer regions regions 3 and 4 are used to represent the reservoir beyond fracture tips if the fracture partially penetrates the formation in the vertical direction two upper flow regions regions 5 and 6 are applied to depict the reservoir beyond the fracture top or bottom the fluid flow within each flow region is assumed to be a 1 d flow and the flow direction in each region is validated by comparing with commercial software s simulation results the fracture interference is simulated by using the virtual no flow boundary method proposed by zeng et al 2017 and 2018

flow regions and coupled based on the flux and pressure continuity conditions at the interfaces of adjacent flow regions the analytical derivation process as shown in the appendix has been conducted in the laplace domain the stehfest algorithm stehfest 1970 is applied for inverting the solutions from the laplace domain to the real time domain the solution for the constant production rate

between the constant rate condition and the constant bottom hole pressure condition the dimensionless pressure in eq 13 is the pressure obtained from the constant rate condition as shown in eq 10 the total dimensionless rate is the sum of all fractures rates 14 q d i 1 n q fdi and the cumulative production in the laplace domain is expressed as 15 q d q d s for a gas well the pressure drop within the horizontal wellbore can be ignored and for oil reservoirs to rigorously model the fluid flow in the horizontal wellbore two types of additional pressure drops are considered the detailed description of fracture and wellbore coupling has been given in our previous work zeng et al 2018 3 model validation to validate our model the simulation results for both fully penetrating vertical fractures and partially penetrating vertical fractures are compared against the outcome of commercial well testing software kappa ecrin this software contains various modules for analyses of dynamic well responses it is capable of conducting pressure transient analyses production analyses field history matching and analyzing the well performance for a fair comparison the analytical test design model in kappa is selected without adding the rate dependent skin this is because in kappa s analytical model the rate dependent skin is for the well and is not for fractures the reference parameters that are used to calculate dimensionless parameters are listed in table 1 the reference viscosity clarkson and pederson 2011 permeability clarkson and pederson 2011 porosity clarkson and pederson 2011 length brown et al 2011 compressibility clarkson and pederson 2011 ross et al 2018 height and diffusivity are selected or calculated based on common reservoir and fluid properties of unconventional light oil reservoirs given by the literature for the two compared cases the reservoir and fracture dimensions are in accordance with our previous linear flow model zeng et al 2018 the reservoir porosity and compressibility are in the common range of unconventional low permeability reservoirs as explained before the reservoir permeability is a typical value of tight reservoirs according to their definition zhang et al 2016 other input parameters including hydraulic fracture width brown et al 2011 apaydin et al 2012 ozkan et al 2010 hydraulic fracture permeability davies and kuiper 1988 apaydin et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 hydraulic fracture porosity brown et al 2011 ozkan et al 2010 apaydin et al 2012 fan et al 2017 and the oil formation volume factor zeng et al 2018 are all determined according to the literature the comparison results indicate that in both cases reasonable agreements are obtained as can be seen from fig 6 a and b this proves the reliability of our model and the directions of the fluid flow assumed in different linear flow regions the reliability of modeling reservoir heterogeneity is given in our previous paper zeng et al 2018 it is worth noting that using the virtual no flow boundary method is an approximation mismatches between our calculation and kappa s numerical simulation results may occur at the very late time when the dimensionless rate is too low to consider note xfi and kfi in these figures represent the fracture sub region size and permeability and the unit dimensionless time is equal to 8 12 years 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of the near wellbore fracture conductivity damage the reduction of near wellbore fracture conductivity could be the result of proppant over displacement back production or embedment both the damaged zone length and residual fracture conductivity are selected as major variables to comprehensively study how the near wellbore damage affects the pressure and rate behavior the ranges of variables are determined based on martins et al 1992 card et al 1995 soliman et al 2008 and fredd et al 2001 for the near wellbore effective fracture width reduction case the fracture is pseudo ized rubin 2010 because the fracture width is assumed to be constant along the fracture therefore there is no need to care about the actual reduced fracture width in damaged zone 1 fig 5 effective conductivity is used to describe the fracture conductivity in this region 16 f ce k fe w f f cd k f w fd where f ce f cd k fe and w fd are the effective fracture conductivity fracture conductivity of damaged zone 1 effective fracture permeability and reduced fracture width respectively figs 7 and 8 show how the degree of near wellbore conductivity damage with 10 ft damage length 2 5 of the fracture total length affects well performance it is clear that even the conductivity reduces to 10 of the original one 80 md ft only a marginal difference can be seen at the early dimensionless time however with further increases in conductivity damage more noticeable differences in pressure and derivative responses can be found compared with the undamaged case especially for those with over 99 conductivity reductions less than 8 md ft due to the existence of near wellbore damage the pressure and its derivative become higher at the very beginning the heavier the damage is the higher the pressure and derivative become this is followed by a transient period and then the curves shift towards the formation linear flow regime as evidenced by the 1 2 slope in the pressure derivative curves more severe damage results in a later start of the transient regime and a longer transient time similar results can be found in the dimensionless rate type curves in figs 9 and 10 different damage length cases are analyzed under the constant conductivity damage 99 6 reduction condition when the damage length becomes larger the occurrence of the transient regime is delayed and the duration of the transient flow turns to be longer however regardless of the magnitude of the damage zone length the early time curves tend to overlap each other until the transient period occurs it can be concluded that the damage length only impacts on the occurrence and duration of the transient period while the degree of conductivity damage determines the initial pressure and rate values 4 2 effects of partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions experimental studies have revealed the significant fracture conductivity difference between propped and unpropped hydraulic fractures zhang et al 2015 for a partially propped fracture with an undamaged near wellbore region there is a certain unpropped or low proppant concentration segment in the hydraulic fracture tip therefore the properties of partially propped or unpropped fractures are employed to simulate these areas in this section the conductivity and length of insufficiently propped segments are selected as major variables the range of conductivity used here is in accordance with the experimental data from fredd et al 2001 and zhang et al 2015 it is shown in figs 11 14 that both the conductivity and length of the partially propped or unpropped zone dominate the formation linear flow regime higher conductivity contributes to lower dimensionless pressure and derivative values and higher dimensionless rates during the formation linear flow regime especially in the early to mid time formation linear flow regime however when the conductivity reduces to 0 1 md ft it affects the entire formation linear flow period for unpropped or partially propped length as expected a longer damaged zone results in higher dimensionless pressure derivative values and lower rates as well as an earlier arrival of the formation linear flow regime this trend gradually accelerates with the increase of damage length when the damage length is less than 12 5 of the total fracture length the variation of damage length has a very slight influence on pressure and rate responses in addition the late time formation linear flow regime is not sensitive to the damage length change and the effects of the overall fracture conductivity variation have been documented in our previous work zeng et al 2017 2018 4 3 effects of matrix impairment near fracture faces this section focuses on the issues of matrix damage in the fracturing fluid invaded zone the effects of both the permeability loss and invaded length are discussed as shown in figs 15 18 compared with fracture near wellbore damage effects of fracture face matrix damage appear later because at very small dimensionless times most fluids entering the horizontal wellbore come from fluid expansion in the fracture therefore during that period most of the fluids within the impaired zone do not contribute to production the dimensionless pressure and its derivative curves first rise to a peak value at an accelerating pace before transient regime s decline and finally join the undamaged curve as for transient rate responses the dimensionless rate drops smoothly at initial times and then decreases faster until the transient regime where the rate reduction slows down finally dimensionless rate curves with matrix damage join the undamaged one moreover only severe permeability impairment less than 30 permeability remained for this case can cause obvious influences on the transient rate behavior similar to the effects of near wellbore damage one can conclude that the permeability reduction determines the degree of deviation from the undamaged curve but has a slight influence on the start time and duration of the transient regime and longer damage length causes a later start of the transient flow 4 4 effects of multiple fracture damage mechanisms as mentioned before the fracture choke skin and face skin factors are derived under the steady state condition and have been widely used in the literature to simulate near wellbore damage and matrix impairment near the fracture face in this section appropriate damaged zone properties are selected to represent the equivalent effects of skin factors to reveal how multiple fracture damage mechanisms affect well performance under the more realistic unsteady state condition besides the partially propped fracture case with undamaged near wellbore regions which cannot be described by skin factors is included in one of the cases according to cinco ley and smaniego 1981 the fracture choke damage and fracture face damage can be adjusted as follows for our mfhw model 17 s ck q fi q ft π k ref h ref μ x 1 μ ref w f h f k f 2 k f 2 k f 1 1 18 s ff q fi q ft π k ref h ref μ y s 2 μ ref x 3 h f k 1 k 1 k s 1 where s ck and s ff are the choked fracture skin and fracture face skin factors respectively eq 17 is different from the original form because the undamaged fracture section of cinco ley and smaniego 1981 has an infinite conductivity value the skin factor ratios for the choked fracture skin and fracture face skin are newly defined as follows to show the relative importance of different damage mechanisms while keeping the sum of the two skin factors as a constant 19 r ck s ck s ck s ff 20 r ff s ff s ck s ff by changing the damaged zone properties different skin factor ratios are obtained with the same total skin factor stotal therefore the equivalent effects of multiple fracture damage can be realized through our model the analysis of multiple damage effects is conducted under various skin factor ratios as shown in table 2 cases 1 to 4 have both near wellbore damage and fracture face damage while case 5 is modified from case 3 by adding partially propped sections in the fracture tips in well testing the actual total skin factor may not be the simple algebraic sum of the two skin factors because different skin effects may control specific flow regimes the total skin factor defined here is only applied to show the relative magnitude of individual skin factors figs 19 and 20 present that even the total skin factors are the same the pressure and rate responses can have significant differences at early times under different skin factor ratios the two concave transient regimes in pressure derivative curves are caused by the choked fracture damage and fracture face damage respectively by comparing cases 1 and 4 or cases 2 and 3 one can find that with the same skin factor ratios the overall responses of the two cases are similar except the initial performance this is because the damaged zone parameters are different between the two cases with identical skin factor ratios case 4 has larger residual conductivity near the wellbore and obtains lower dimensionless pressure and higher dimensionless rates at early times compared with case 1 the occurrence of the first transient regime is also influenced by near wellbore conductivity the partially propped section once again only influences the late transient regime and the early mid time formation linear flow regime in the multiple damage case in well testing interpretation this small early time difference with identical skin factor ratios can be ignored therefore once the field data type curve is fixed the corresponding skin factor ratio can be evaluated though type curve matching and the major damage mechanisms can also be diagnosed although the damaged zone parameters such as residual conductivity and damaged length may not be the actual values because different damaged zone parameters can result in the same skin factor ratio 4 5 well performance in a heterogeneous reservoir with damaged fractures the application examples presented in this section demonstrate the capability and physical consistency of this method to model reservoir heterogeneity and reveal how heterogeneous reservoir blocks affect well performance under various damage mechanisms as mentioned before no flow boundaries are applied to simulate the fracture interference these are artificially defined interference boundaries rather than the real physical boundaries because no flow boundary s location depends on the pressure of its two sides the following equations are used to calculate region 2 s pressure at yd y2d namely the pressure of the no flow boundary 21 p 2 d y 2 d 2 p 1 d y 1 d exp α 2 y 2 d y 1 d exp α 2 y 2 d y 1 d 22 p 1 d y 1 d p sd y s d exp α 1 y 1 d exp 2 α 1 y 1 d exp α 1 y 1 d α 1 k 1 k 2 α 2 tan h α 2 y 2 d y 1 d α 1 k 1 k 2 α 2 tan h α 2 y 2 d y 1 d exp α 1 y s d exp 2 α 1 y 1 d exp α 1 y s d α 1 k 1 k 2 α 2 tan h α 2 y 2 d y 1 d α 1 k 1 k 2 α 2 tan h α 2 y 2 d y 1 d 23 p sd y s d p fd w d 2 exp α s y s d exp 2 α s y s d exp α s y s d α s k s k 1 β 1 α s k s k 1 β 1 exp α s w d 2 exp 2 α s y s d exp α s w d 2 α s k s k 1 β 1 α s k s k 1 β 1 the hydraulic fracture pressure at yd wd 2 in eq 23 cannot be directly calculated because in the fracture linear flow region the pressure is only a function of xd integrating the pressure along the hydraulic fracture direction and using the length averaged integral value to represent the whole fracture pressure yd wd 2 can be a rational choice just similar to the classical area averaged pressure dietz 1965 for the whole reservoir one can use the following average pressure to represent the fracture pressure at yd wd 2 24 p fd ave 0 x f d 1 p f d 1 d x d x f d 1 x f d 2 p f d 2 d x d x f d 2 x f d 3 p f d 3 d x d x f d 3 since eq 24 involves extensive integration processes which are time consuming an alternative way could be using the fracture pressure at xd 0 this is because the pressure wave will first propagate from the fracture face at xd 0 to the formation and the pressure waves generated from two adjacent fractures will first interact with each other at xd 0 as well the differences of pressure values at yd wd 2 obtained from the two pressure calculation methods mainly occur in the early time which we have discussed in our previous research zeng et al 2017 the pressure waves from two adjacent fractures do not interact with each other at early times therefore using the two methods has few influences on the accuracy of determining the location of the no flow boundary in the examples a fractured horizontal well extends through a compartmentalized reservoir as shown in fig 21 it is a three block reservoir along the horizontal wellbore direction with a relatively high permeability bock in the center which is sandwiched by two low permeability blocks all the fractures have the same damage mechanisms including partially propped sections in the fracture tips choked fracture damage and fracture face matrix damage although the reservoir model is relatively simple it is versatile enough to reveal the post fracturing behavior in a heterogeneous reservoir with damaged fractures in fact more complex cases with more heterogeneous reservoir blocks and hydraulic fractures have been analyzed in our previous research zeng et al 2017 2018 it is found that adding more reservoir blocks shows almost no influence on the interactions between two adjacent fractures in linear flow models with a specific drainage volume for each fracture and only influences the overall performance of an mfhw the reservoir model presented here can demonstrate the typical behavior induced by adjacent heterogeneous blocks combined with complex fracture damage based on the knowledge obtained from these examples one can explain the well performance of other complex cases 4 5 1 transient pressure behavior under constant total rate conditions the basic reservoir model of case 6 is first applied to compare the pressure behavior under different damage mechanisms considering reservoir heterogeneity as shown in fig 22 the parameters listed in fig 22 are for the multiple damage situation for undamaged cases the fracture permeability is equal to the propped zone permeability and the permeability of damaged zone 3 equals matrix reservoir permeability the no flow boundaries calculated with fracture damage are located 339 ft away from fracture 2 in its two sides due to the symmetry the existence of fracture damage has a slight influence on the location of the no flow boundary and causes only a 1 ft difference in our cases this can be explained by the fact that near wellbore damage and fracture face damage dominate early time responses where the fracture interaction has not begun and although the partially propped section has longer time effects the damaged parameters are identical for all fractures therefore the location of the no flow boundary is mainly determined by the reservoir properties here fig 22 demonstrates that the pressure and its derivative are dramatically increased by the near wellbore conductivity reduction until the boundary dominant flow occurs the partially propped section in the fracture tip constrains the shape of intermediate time curves the effects of fracture face matrix impairment however are inconspicuous here to analyze how the degree of heterogeneity affects the pressure behavior three cases with the same properties in the second compartment are considered while the permeability values of blocks in the two sides are 10 4 md 10 3 md and 10 2 md respectively other reservoir fracture and fluid properties for each block in the three cases are listed in fig 23 the no flow boundaries of cases 7 and 8 are 329 ft and 301 ft away from the second fracture respectively the order of pressure and derivative values shown in fig 23 is qualitatively in good agreement with our expectation based on the permeability distribution cases with higher overall permeability have lower dimensionless pressure and derivative except the boundary dominated flow different from the pressure behavior in fig 19 only one early time transient section can be seen in the pressure derivation curves as the effects of fracture face damage are too small the lower the overall permeability is the earlier this transient regime will occur and the shorter its duration will be due to the reservoir heterogeneity there is also a transient regime before the unit slope boundary flow the higher degree of reservoir heterogeneity is the later the unit slope section will be achieved 4 5 2 flux distribution of each fracture under constant total rate conditions fig 24 a and b present the fracture flux distribution variations as a function of time under the constant rate condition the flux difference between fracture 2 and fracture 1 fracture 3 increases first because of the difference between reservoir block permeability values of fracture 2 and fracture 1 fracture 3 for the cases with choked near wellbore damage after the short time increase in the beginning the flux disparity of the three fractures decreases because this regime is controlled by identical damaged properties within the fracture then the flux difference continuously rises as the dominant parameter once again is the block permeability after a peak value the flux difference reduces until the fluxes finally become stable and distribute according to the fracture controlled drainage area which is determined by the no flow boundary locations for example the second fracture has a larger drainage area and hence obtains a larger flux in the stable period the reason why the curves of partially propped fracture cases deviate from those of fully propped fractures in fig 24 a and b at early mid times is that the formation flow influence comes earlier in partially propped cases see figs 13 and 14 making the effects of reservoir permeability heavier and accelerating the flux difference increase the partially propped part in the fracture tip later weakens the effects of block permeability resulting in a smaller flux difference compared with the undamaged one results from fig 25 a and b indicate that the greater the permeability difference is the more different the fluxes of fracture 2 and fracture 1 fracture 3 would be at early mid times and because the no flow boundaries locations of cases 6 and 7 have a marginal difference 10 ft the stable fracture fluxes in the two cases are very close moreover the lower the overall permeability is the later the stable flux period will occur the above factors emphasize the significance of the high permeability reservoir compartment in the analysis of the mfhw responses under the constant rate condition because it contributes a large portion of total rates in a relatively long time and is a crucial factor in determining no flow boundary s location 4 5 3 transient rate behavior under constant pressure conditions fig 26 a c show the rate behavior of individual fractures and the mfhw with different fracture damage mechanisms the basic reservoir model of case 6 is applied here for fractures 1 and 3 their drainage area properties are homogeneous as the no flow boundaries are located within blocks 1 and 3 respectively and the drainage area of fracture 2 contains a high permeability inner section in block 2 and two low permeability outer sections in blocks 1 and 3 as shown in fig 21 the choked near wellbore damage significantly reduces the early time production while the partially propped section in the fracture tip decreases the intermediate time rates different from fractures 1 and 3 the rate decline trend of the second fracture slows down at late times see the distinct flat period due to the contribution of the two low permeability outer drainage areas during early mid times when the flow rates are relatively high the contribution of the outer sections cannot be distinguished from the curves however at late times when the inner high permeability region is almost depleted the outer low permeability sections with higher flow resistance can still produce though the rate might be extremely low because partially propped cases rates reduce slower late time outer sections contribution becomes noticeable later the total rate behavior of the mfhw is similar to the rate behavior of fracture 2 except that the rates of the flat regime at late times are larger due to the contribution of fractures 1 and 3 fig 27 a c show how the degree of reservoir heterogeneity affects the transient rate responses with fracture damage the basic parameters for cases 6 7 and 8 are listed in the three figures the lower the permeability values of blocks 1 and 3 are the lower the fluxes of fractures 1 and 3 will be and the later the boundary flow regime will occur however for fracture 2 the early mid time rates of different cases are almost the same because the properties of block 2 are identical in all cases and at late times fracture 2 with higher outer drainage section permeability has a faster decline rate the late time contribution of outer drainage sections of fracture 2 is particularly noticeable for case 6 with lowest permeability outer sections this is because a higher permeability outer section has lower flow resistance resulting in more uniform depletion and the rate curves decline smoothly without a step shaped period 5 field data analyses in this section the production data of an mfhw with 12 hydraulic fractures drilled in the western canada cardium unconventional light oil formation are analyzed the well is located at the western sedimentary basin clarkson and pederson 2011 initially this region had been mainly developed through vertical wells recently many horizontal wells have been completed and fractured to exploit relatively low permeability areas along the edges of previously well developed oil pools typical permeability values in the targeted reservoirs range from 0 1 md to 10 md while the porosity ranges from 0 05 to 0 12 the well is a cased hole mfhw which can be nicely simulated by our model fig 28 gives the flowing pressure data and production rates the case detail is given in fig 29 the hydraulic fracture porosity and width are assumed properties from brown et al 2011 and the rationality of using them is explained in the model validation part the fracture number well length rock compressibility fracture height formation thickness formation porosity and permeability light oil viscosity initial reservoir pressure flowing wellbore pressure and the oil formation volume factor are all from the original paper of clarkson and pederson 2011 by assuming that the fractures are evenly distributed along the horizontal wellbore with the first fracture at the heel and the last fracture at the toe the fracture spacing is obtained previously similar analyses of the same well the card 3 well in that work have been done by clarkson and pederson 2011 they stated that the calculated length of that well from their method is 64 of the actual length and pointed out the possible reasons as follows 1 several fractures may not be effective in that well 2 using single phase flow methods has some limitations they also used a multi phase numerical method to match production data with full wellbore length 5105 ft in using the multi phase model a horizontal permeability value of 0 35 md is needed while the actual absolute reservoir permeability is 0 28 md besides although that model s oil rates match well with actual oil rates by increasing the reservoir permeability to 0 35 md its gas rates deviate from the field data in fact ignoring the fracture damage can also be a factor that causes errors in matching with the field data the non effectively created fractures mentioned by clarkson and pederson 2011 can be treated as a limiting case of damaged fractures it can be seen from fig 28 that the pressure is stable during production except at early times the clean up period therefore the constant pressure model of this work is selected to conduct the matching process considering fracture damage case 9 contains both fracture face damage and near wellbore damage while case 10 only has the fracture conductivity reduction near the wellbore with longer damage length the 12 fractures for each case are assumed to be identical and the input parameters are all listed in fig 29 the hydraulic fracture length permeability and fracture damage properties are obtained through matching the field data results suggest that if the fracture damage is considered the outcome obtained from our model shows reasonable agreements in oil rate matching with actual reservoir permeability 0 28 md as shown in fig 29 and clarkson and pederson 2011 did not consider fracture damage so they have to adjust the wellbore length to match field data case 11 represents the case without fracture damage under the 0 28 md reservoir permeability condition it is shown that the initial rates are dramatically higher than the actual field case even the undamaged hydraulic fracture permeability is already relatively low 5000 md compared with the undamaged fracture permeability in cases 9 and 10 and if smaller permeability values for the undamaged fracture are used a heavier discrepancy will occur at late times and if higher undamaged fracture permeability is applied the early time mismatch will be more significant as no reservoir width data are available the fractures are assumed to fully penetrate the formation vertically and horizontally the estimated half fracture length is 450 ft 6 conclusions a comprehensive linear flow model is written to explore the effects of fracture damage and heterogeneity on mfhw s performance in unconventional low permeability reservoirs the method is derived from a composite linear flow model model validation sensitivity analyses and a field case study are conducted the following key conclusions can be drawn 1 the model is capable to analyze transient pressure and rate responses in heterogeneous unconventional low permeability reservoirs with various fracture damage it can also be used to diagnose fracture damage predict well performance and help optimize the fracturing treatment design under constant rate or constant pressure conditions 2 fracture near wellbore damage influences the initial fracture contribution regime and the early mid formation linear flow regime by inducing a transient regime there the initial pressure and rate are affected by the fracture conductivity reduction while the transient regime start time and duration are controlled by the damage length 3 partially propped sections in fracture tips increase formation linear flow regime s dimensionless pressure and decrease its production rates longer damage length and lower residual conductivity of this section after fracture closure result in a longer duration and a heavier influence of this effect 4 only severe matrix impairment more than 70 reduction in permeability near the fracture face can have noticeable effects on pressure and rate responses permeability impairment determines the degree of deviation from the undamaged curves in the mid late fracture contribution regime and the early mid formation linear flow regime the longer the damage depth is the later the transient flow regime will occur 5 a new parameter the skin factor ratio is proposed to describe the relative magnitude of individual damage in multiple damage cases different damage length depth and conductivity permeability reductions can represent the same skin factor ratio when the skin factor ratios of fracture face and choked fracture damage are fixed the generally accurate type curves can be created although different length depth and conductivity permeability reductions with the same skin factor ratio may cause slight differences in individual cases therefore through type curve matching the skin factor ratios can be interpreted and the major damage mechanisms can be diagnosed 6 reservoir heterogeneity combined with fracture damage determines the shapes of certain flow regimes in pressure and rate curves except for the boundary dominant regime and controls the fracture flux distribution during production typical flow regimes with standard slopes may disappear under these complex reservoir conditions 7 ignoring fracture damage can be one potential factor that causes the mismatch between field data and results from

6466,the significance of unconventional low permeability reservoir development has been well recognized in recent years pressure and rate transient behavior analyses are crucial methods of finding key factors that affect well production in these formations however previous analytically or semi analytically based gridless models of pressure and rate transient response analyses for multi stage fractured horizontal wells mfhws mainly deal with homogeneous reservoirs and merely use skin factors to describe the fracture damage fracture damage normally refers to the conductivity reduction within hydraulic fractures and the matrix permeability or porosity impairment near the fracture face the widely applied skin factors are derived under steady state conditions and are accurate only when the damage length is small they also show inability to simulate partially propped fractures and multiple fracture damage scenarios in this article a general linear flow model is established to simulate heterogeneous box shaped unconventional low permeability reservoirs with closed outer boundaries and various hydraulic fracture damage including 1 fracture near wellbore damage caused by proppant flow back over displacement embedment crush or ineffective placement 2 partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions 3 fracturing fluid leak off damage in the adjacent matrix 4 dual or multiple damage effects under unsteady flow conditions the fracture interference in heterogeneous reservoirs is modeled by our previous method zeng et al 2018 the basic model has been verified against well testing software kappa and satisfactory agreements are obtained new type curves have been generated with distinct flow regimes for specific fracture damage mechanisms sensitivity analyses have been conducted to find out how the damage properties affect the shape and duration of these distinct regimes reservoir heterogeneity combined with fracture damage makes the pressure and rate behavior deviate significantly from the undamaged homogeneous one and controls the fracture flux distribution in certain regimes during production for both constant rate and constant pressure production cases in addition field data from the cardium unconventional light oil formation in western canada are analyzed through type curve matching which demonstrates the benefits of our model the

fracturing is currently the most effective technique to enhance the productivity of unconventional low permeability reservoirs that have become hotspots in the oil and gas industry however there are many potential damage mechanisms that contribute to the well productivity reduction after hydraulic fracturing two major damage scenarios are the conductivity reduction of hydraulic fractures and matrix impairment the internal filter cake in the vicinity of the fracture face gdanski et al 2009 the two scenarios are major damage mechanisms because if we neglect the direct fluid flow from the reservoir to the horizontal well cased hole completions the performance of a fractured well is controlled by the two processes 1 the fluid inflow from the matrix at the fracture face and 2 the fluid flow from fractures to the wellbore li et al 2012 as this newly developed model is for cased hole mfhws the possible near wellbore damaged reservoir zone for open hole wells is not considered besides with the continuous development of unconventional low permeability reservoirs the exploitation targets have become more complex reservoir heterogeneity is an essential factor that provides difficulty and uncertainty in evaluating both the initial and long term pressure and rate transient behavior in this section the fracture damage mechanisms and the current methods of simulating fracture damage are first introduced then the limitation of existing models and the advantage of this work will be summarized 1 1 fracture conductivity reduction fracture conductivity is defined as the product of fracture permeability and fracture width and can fundamentally determine post stimulation well production zhang et al 2015 fracture conductivity damage in this study refers to choked fractures and partially propped or unpropped sections in the fracture tips as shown in figs 1 and 2 1 1 1 proppant over displacement and flow back in practice at the end of a stimulation treatment proppant over displacement occurs while clearing casing of sand then pumping perforation guns and bridge plugs would generate additional over displacement themig 2010 snyder and seale 2011 pitts et al 2013 dusterhoft et al 2014 gutierrez et al 2014 al tailji et al 2014 in proppant over displacement cases a larger portion of proppants can be pumped deep within the fracture with few proppants left in the near wellbore region leading to incomplete fracture conductivity or a complete loss of conductivity towards the wellbore zander et al 2010 rylance and martin 2014 proppant over displacement may be concerned in transverse fractures which are very common for mfhws although it would not pose noticeable effects on the productivity of longitudinal fractures due to the extensive connection between longitudinal fractures and the wellbore vincent 2011 besler et al 2007 van gijtenbeek et al 2012 found that over displacement may not be detrimental to shale formations where the proppant transport is poor there would not be proppants left in the near wellbore area even without over displacement but in most other types of fractured formations over displacement should be considered el rabaa and siddiqui 2015 examined the effects of proppant over displacement and found that the over displacement case can have as low as 30 productivity of the undamaged case apart from proppant over displacement another near wellbore fracture damage mechanism that a number of groups have studied is proppant flow back to the industry proppant flow back from hydraulic fractures is of significant concerns especially for offshore environments milton tayler et al 1992 howard et al 1995 daneshy 2005 as many as 20 of the proppants in the fracture can be produced to the surface martins et al 1992 card et al 1995 although there are methods that can control proppant over displacement and back production these strategies all have their limitations and may only be applicable in certain environments for existing analytical models the choked fracture effect is simulated by the choked skin factor cinco ley and smaniego 1981 and its modified expressions 1 1 2 chemical impairment water soluble polymers are normally added to fracturing fluids to increase their viscosity the viscosity of fracturing fluids is designed to decrease due to polymer degradation after stimulation treatments to minimize the potential fracture conductivity damage however degraded polymers for example the degraded guar gum may not be completely water soluble cook 1975 this residual impedes the oil and gas flow even after the fracture cleanup process both laboratory tests and field production results have indicated this fracture conductivity damage elbel et al 1991 the insufficient broken fracturing fluids exist in 25 of the cases where crosslinked gels are used for fracturing treatments unbroken polymers can reduce gas recovery by 30 and decrease the initial gas rate as high as 80 voneiff et al 1996 the degree of fracture conductivity impairment increases with the increase of the gel concentration even at a low concentration level hawkins 1988 sanaei et al 2016 pointed out that even clay swelling can induce conductivity damage although some fracturing fluid additives such as polyacrylamides leave no residue after degradation they usually cost more money cook 1975 using low viscosity fracturing fluids shows an advantage in relieving residual damage and carrying low density proppants to control proppant settling parker et al 2005 2012 nguyen et al 2013 but the cost and effectiveness of low density proppants may provide some limitations modeling this fracture conductivity damage on production can be realized by changing the whole fracture conductivity which has been done in our previous work zeng et al 2017 2018 1 1 3 partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions many hydraulically induced fractures do not form as expected resulting in minimally propped areas namely partially propped or unpropped sections glover et al 2015 apart from choked fractures proppants may not be placed deep into the fracture these unpropped fracture sections caused by insufficient proppant injecting proppant flow back and settling can still have some conductivity because the fracture surfaces are irregular and do not completely match after closure as shown in fig 2 however the conductivity can be at least two orders of magnitude lower without proppants fredd et al 2001 another situation is that monolayer proppants with a low proppant concentration may be placed in the fracture front and provide conductivity for this area even the aligned unpropped hydraulic fractures have relatively high permeability compared with reservoir rocks zhang et al 2015 heterogeneity and stress shadow effects can affect fracture propagation which creates the width for the proppant flow zhong et al 2014 liu et al 2016a lu et al 2016 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and hence influence proppant placement previously no skin factor can address partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions and few models have considered this effect 1 2 matrix impairment around fractures in this case the hydraulic fracture is surrounded by a damaged zone which creates an additional pressure drop due to excessive fracturing fluid invading as shown in fig 3 fracturing fluid leak off widely exists in unconventional low permeability formations liu et al 2016b liu et al 2017 bellarby 2009 pointed out that the suspended particles with diameters between 1 7 and 1 3 of the pore throat size are likely to plug the formation and form an internal filter cake that is difficult to remove clay swelling in the invaded zone may also reduce the formation permeability holdich 1979 here the effects of the stubborn matrix impairment near the fracture face are thoroughly investigated in van poollen 1957 found that the depth of the permeability damage can be 1 in with a permeability loss ranging from 0 to 95 then an electrical model steady state was used to simulate the influence on production under various damage levels results reveal that the overall effects of damage are not significant compared with the fracture flow capacity damage and the damaged region tends to penetrate 1 in to 2 in later cinco ley and samaniego 1977 investigated the effects of the fracture damage caused by an infinitesimal skin around the fracture they used a dimensionless skin factor to describe this damage and found that a damaged fracture shows a relatively flat line in the log log dimensionless pressure curve the more serious the damage is the longer this fracture face skin controlled period in the early stage will be cinco ley and smaniego 1981 holdich 1979 numerically analyzed how fluid leak off damages the invaded zone the two phase two dimensional simulation results show that the damaged zone could extend to a depth of 6 in and the lower the reservoir permeability is the heavier the impairment effects will be in some cases the gas flow in the damaged zone can even be completely blocked the study conducted by aggour and economides 1999 indicates that for fractured high permeability reservoirs when the fluid leak off penetration is small skin effects may not become noticeable even the permeability impairment is severe gdanski et al 2009 modified the cinco ley and samaniego 1977 fracture face skin as a function of time to calculate the two phase flow they provided skin evolution data during cleanup and production processes and gave practical suggestions to minimize the fracture face damage romero et al 2002 applied a nonuniform fracture face skin factor and found that it has a significant impact on productivity and changes the optimal dimensionless fracture conductivity li et al 2012 proposed a model considering the reservoir fracture crossflow in the finite conductivity fracture for shale reservoirs their study reveals that the fluid leak off damage is not a strong factor for the well productivity reduction the significance of the fluid leak off damage on production depends on the invasion depth and damaged permeability odumabo et al 2014 experimentally studied the impact of fracturing fluid leak off on tight gas formations and took the leak off volume and shut in time as two key variables of their research results demonstrate that a larger leak off volume reduces effective permeability while an increase in shut in time increases effective permeability although the two variables affect the effective permeability in opposing ways the leak off process is the dominant one bostrom et al 2014 performed similar experiments and obtained optimized shut in time for analytical models the fracture face skin factor cinco ley and samaniego 1977 and the modified ones are used to describe this damage some of the above mentioned studies conclusions are conflicting regarding the significance of this damage in post fracturing performance 1 3 combined damage effects the above damage mechanisms may occur simultaneously for a fractured well combined damage effects here refer to fractures with fracture face matrix impairment and choked near wellbore regions partially propped fractures with near wellbore damage partially propped fractures with impaired fracture faces and the combination of choked damage fracture face damage and partially propped fractures few people have studied the multiple damage effects in the literature as presented above the concept of skin factors and the modified expressions have been applied extensively to represent fracture damage however the skin factor concept is based on the steady state flow assumption skin factors are only applicable when the damaged zone width is small cinco ley and smaniego 1977 the unsteady flow fracture damage condition is realized by numerical simulation narasimhan and palen 1979 bennett et al 1983 in reality the damaged area can actually be larger than we normally expect take the fracture choke damage as an example approximately 20 of placed proppants can be produced back martins et al 1992 indicating that the damage length can be longer than 20 of the total fracture length besides the skin factor idealization can only address the fracture face and choked fracture damage it shows an obvious inability in dealing with partially propped and multiple fracture damage cases in addition the performance of mfhws in heterogeneous reservoirs deviates substantially from that in homogeneous reservoirs normally numerical models or semi analytical models with infinite series are frequently used to deal with heterogeneous reservoirs requiring extensive input parameters which may not be available at the early stage of exploitation and considerable computing time besides most of the time saving analytical models for mfhws are derived for homogeneous reservoirs or those with stimulated reservoir volumes recently zeng et al 2017 and 2018 established composite linear flow models to address reservoir heterogeneity in artificially fractured reservoirs however the two models are specifically derived to simulate shale gas reservoirs and tight reservoirs with a threshold pressure gradient respectively and cannot include any complex fracture damage the purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive linear flow model to address the following issues 1 modeling the above possible single mechanism fracture damage cases under unsteady state conditions and analyzing how the key damage properties affect the transient pressure and rate behavior 2 simulating multiple fracture damage and generating new type curves with distinct flow regimes 3 combing fracture damage and reservoir heterogeneity and analyzing the typical transient behavior for fracture damage diagnostic and the flux distribution of individual fractures 4 conducting a field application and interpreting the field data that cannot be effectively handled by conventional models 2 methodologies the model presented here is extended from the seven region linear flow models zeng et al 2017 2018 as shown in fig 4 the linear flow assumption is made because the linear flow regime has been widely observed in reservoirs with mfhws and can last for years wattenbarger et al 1998 nobakht and clarkson 2012a b the linear flow model is applicable for unconventional low permeability reservoirs with mfhws unless the beyond well tip regions control well performance the beyond well tip region control only occurs when the reservoir permeability is well above the tight reservoir permeability range or the rate or the bottom hole pressure is at an unrealistically low level the linear flow model is valid for common low permeability formations brown et al 2011 besides the geometry of mfhw systems indicates that it is not likely to form radial flow regimes between two adjacent fractures stalgorova and mattar 2013 due to the symmetry an eighth of a hydraulic fracture drainage volume is appropriate to describe our model the hydraulic fracture region is further divided into three parts damaged zones 1 and 2 and the propped zone to simulate fracture conductivity damage while a matrix impairment zone damaged zone 3 is added to depict the fluid leak off damage fig 5 to address reservoir heterogeneity this model assigns distinct properties to each reservoir block as each flow region fig 4 can have its own reservoir properties other assumptions of the physical model are listed below the mfhw is drilled at the center of a box shaped low permeability reservoir with closed outer boundaries a uniform pressure value at the initial time and constant temperature to obtain both the transient pressure and rate behavior the mfhw can produce either under a constant rate condition or under a constant pressure condition with a single phase flow other properties of both the reservoir and fluids are constant the gravity effects for the gas flow can be ignored due to its low density for low permeability oil reservoirs with extremely high percolation resistance the impact of gravity for liquid phase transport is also negligible chen et al 2016 an eighth of a fracture drainage volume is divided into ten linear flow regions as shown in figs 4 and 5 including three hydraulic fracture sub regions one matrix impairment region near the fracture face two inner flow regions two outer flow regions and two upper flow regions when the fracture partially penetrates the formation in the horizontal direction two outer regions regions 3 and 4 are used to represent the reservoir beyond fracture tips if the fracture partially penetrates the formation in the vertical direction two upper flow regions regions 5 and 6 are applied to depict the reservoir beyond the fracture top or bottom the fluid flow within each flow region is assumed to be a 1 d flow and the flow direction in each region is validated by comparing with commercial software s simulation results the fracture interference is simulated by using the virtual no flow boundary method proposed by zeng et al 2017 and 2018 dimensionless variable groups are employed to develop the mathematical model for convenience the dimensionless pressure and pseudo pressure for oil and gas reservoirs are given by 1 p d k ref h ref

description of fracture and wellbore coupling has been given in our previous work zeng et al 2018 3 model validation to validate our model the simulation results for both fully penetrating vertical fractures and partially penetrating vertical fractures are compared against the outcome of commercial well testing software kappa ecrin this software contains various modules for analyses of dynamic well responses it is capable of conducting pressure transient analyses production analyses field history matching and analyzing the well performance for a fair comparison the analytical test design model in kappa is selected without adding the rate dependent skin this is because in kappa s analytical model the rate dependent skin is for the well and is not for fractures the reference parameters

light oil reservoirs given by the literature for the two compared cases the reservoir and fracture dimensions are in accordance with our previous linear flow model zeng et al 2018 the reservoir porosity and compressibility are in the common range of unconventional low permeability reservoirs as explained before the reservoir permeability is a typical value of tight reservoirs according to their definition zhang et al 2016 other input parameters including hydraulic fracture width brown et al 2011 apaydin et al 2012 ozkan et al 2010 hydraulic fracture permeability davies and kuiper 1988 apaydin et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 hydraulic fracture porosity brown et al 2011 ozkan et al 2010 apaydin et al 2012 fan et al 2017 and the oil formation volume factor zeng et al 2018 are all determined according to the literature the comparison results indicate that in both cases reasonable agreements are obtained as can be seen from fig 6 a and b this proves the reliability of our model and the directions of the fluid flow assumed in different linear flow regions the reliability of modeling reservoir heterogeneity is given in our previous paper zeng et al 2018 it is worth noting that using the virtual no flow boundary method is an approximation mismatches between our calculation and kappa s numerical simulation results may occur at the very late time when the dimensionless rate is too low to consider note xfi and kfi in these figures represent the fracture sub region size and permeability and the unit dimensionless time is equal to 8 12 years 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of the near wellbore fracture conductivity damage the reduction of near wellbore fracture conductivity could be the result of proppant over displacement back production or embedment both the damaged zone length and residual fracture conductivity are selected as major variables to comprehensively study how the near wellbore damage affects the pressure and rate behavior the ranges of variables are determined based on martins et al 1992 card et al 1995 soliman et al 2008 and fredd et al 2001 for the near wellbore effective fracture width reduction case the fracture is pseudo ized rubin 2010 because the fracture width is assumed to be constant along the fracture therefore there is no need to care about the actual reduced fracture width in damaged zone 1 fig 5 effective conductivity is used to describe the fracture conductivity in this region 16 f ce k fe w f f cd k f w fd where f ce f cd k fe and w fd are the effective fracture conductivity fracture conductivity of damaged zone 1 effective fracture permeability and reduced fracture width respectively figs 7 and 8 show how the degree of near wellbore conductivity damage with 10 ft damage length 2 5 of the fracture total length affects well performance it is clear that even the conductivity reduces to 10 of the original one 80 md ft only a marginal difference can be seen at the early dimensionless time however with further increases in conductivity damage more noticeable differences in pressure and derivative responses can be found compared with the undamaged case especially for those with over 99 conductivity reductions less than 8 md ft due to the existence of near wellbore damage the pressure and its derivative become higher at the very beginning the heavier the damage is the higher the pressure and derivative become this is followed by a transient period and then the curves shift towards the formation linear flow regime as evidenced by the 1 2 slope in the pressure derivative curves more severe damage results in a later start of the transient regime and a longer transient time similar results can be found in the dimensionless rate type curves in figs 9 and 10 different damage length cases are analyzed under the constant conductivity damage 99 6 reduction condition when the damage length becomes larger the occurrence of the transient regime is delayed and the duration of the transient flow turns to be longer however regardless of the magnitude of the damage zone length the early time curves tend to overlap each other until the transient period occurs it can be concluded that the damage length only impacts on the occurrence and duration of the transient period while the degree of conductivity damage determines the initial pressure and rate values 4 2 effects of partially propped fractures with undamaged near wellbore regions experimental studies have revealed the significant fracture conductivity difference between propped and unpropped hydraulic fractures zhang et al 2015 for a partially propped fracture with an undamaged near wellbore region there is a certain unpropped or low proppant concentration segment in the hydraulic fracture tip therefore the properties of partially propped or unpropped fractures are employed to simulate these areas in this section the conductivity and length of insufficiently propped segments are selected as major variables the range of conductivity used here is in accordance with the experimental data from fredd et al 2001 and zhang et al 2015 it is shown in figs 11 14 that both the conductivity and length of the partially propped or unpropped zone dominate the formation linear flow regime higher conductivity contributes to lower dimensionless pressure and derivative values and higher dimensionless rates during the formation linear flow regime especially in the early to mid time formation linear flow regime however when the conductivity reduces to 0 1 md ft it affects the entire formation linear flow period for unpropped or partially propped length as expected a longer damaged zone results in higher dimensionless pressure derivative values and lower rates as well as an earlier arrival of the formation linear flow regime this trend gradually accelerates with the increase of damage length when the damage length is less than 12 5 of the total fracture length the variation of damage length has a very slight influence on pressure and rate responses in addition the late time formation linear flow regime is not sensitive to the damage length change and the effects of the overall fracture conductivity variation have been documented in our previous work zeng et al 2017 2018 4 3 effects of matrix impairment near fracture faces this section focuses on the issues of matrix damage in the fracturing fluid invaded zone the effects of both the permeability loss and invaded length are discussed as shown in figs 15 18 compared with fracture near wellbore damage effects of fracture face matrix damage appear later because at very small dimensionless times most fluids entering the horizontal wellbore come from fluid expansion in the fracture therefore during that period most of the fluids within the impaired zone do not contribute to production the dimensionless pressure and its derivative curves first rise to a peak value at an accelerating pace before transient regime s decline and finally join the undamaged curve as for transient rate responses the dimensionless rate drops smoothly at initial times and then decreases faster until the transient regime where the rate reduction slows down finally dimensionless rate curves with matrix damage join the undamaged one moreover only severe permeability impairment less than 30 permeability remained for this case can cause obvious influences on the transient rate behavior similar to the effects of near wellbore damage one can conclude that the permeability reduction determines the degree of deviation from the undamaged curve but has a slight influence on the start time and duration of the transient regime and longer damage length causes a later start of the transient flow 4 4 effects of multiple fracture damage mechanisms as mentioned before the fracture choke skin and face skin factors are derived under the steady state condition and have been widely used in the literature to simulate near wellbore damage and matrix impairment near the fracture face in this section appropriate damaged zone properties are selected to represent the equivalent effects of skin factors to reveal how multiple fracture damage mechanisms affect well performance under the more realistic unsteady state condition besides the partially propped fracture case with undamaged near wellbore regions which cannot be described by skin factors is included in one of the cases according to cinco ley and smaniego 1981 the fracture choke damage and fracture face damage can be adjusted as follows for our mfhw model 17 s ck q fi q ft π k ref h ref μ x 1 μ ref w f h f k f 2 k f 2 k f 1 1 18 s ff q fi q ft π k ref h ref μ y s 2 μ ref x 3 h f k 1 k 1 k s 1 where s ck and s ff are the choked fracture skin and fracture face skin factors respectively eq 17 is different from the original form because the undamaged fracture section of cinco ley and smaniego 1981 has an infinite conductivity value the skin factor ratios for the choked fracture skin and fracture face skin are newly defined as follows to show the relative importance of different damage mechanisms while keeping the sum of the two skin factors as a constant 19 r ck s ck s ck s ff 20 r ff s ff s ck s ff by changing the damaged zone properties different skin factor ratios are obtained with the same total skin factor stotal therefore the equivalent effects of multiple fracture damage can be realized through our model the analysis of multiple damage effects is conducted under various skin factor ratios as shown in table 2 cases 1 to 4 have both near wellbore damage and fracture face damage while case 5 is modified from case 3 by adding partially propped sections in the fracture tips in well testing the actual total skin factor may not be the simple algebraic sum of the two skin factors because different skin effects may control specific flow regimes the total skin factor defined here is only applied to show the relative magnitude of individual skin factors figs 19 and 20 present that even the total skin factors are the same the pressure and rate responses can have significant differences at early times under different skin factor ratios the two concave transient regimes in pressure derivative curves are caused by the choked fracture damage and fracture face damage respectively by comparing cases 1 and 4 or cases 2 and 3 one can find that with the same skin factor ratios the overall responses of the two cases are similar except the initial performance this is because the damaged zone parameters are different between the two cases with identical skin factor ratios case 4 has larger residual conductivity near the wellbore and obtains lower dimensionless pressure and higher dimensionless rates at early times compared with case 1 the occurrence of the first transient regime is also influenced by near wellbore conductivity the partially propped section once again only influences the late transient regime and the early mid time formation linear flow regime in the multiple damage case in well testing interpretation this small early time difference with identical skin factor ratios can be ignored therefore once the field data type curve is fixed the corresponding skin factor ratio can be evaluated though type curve matching and the major damage mechanisms can also be diagnosed although the damaged zone parameters such as residual conductivity and damaged length may not be the actual values because different damaged zone parameters can result in the same skin factor ratio 4 5 well performance in a heterogeneous reservoir with damaged fractures the application examples presented in this section demonstrate the capability and physical consistency of this method to model reservoir heterogeneity and reveal how heterogeneous reservoir blocks affect well performance under various damage mechanisms as mentioned before no flow boundaries are applied to simulate the fracture interference these are artificially defined interference boundaries rather than the real physical boundaries because no flow boundary s location depends on the pressure of its two sides the following equations are used to calculate region 2 s pressure at yd y2d namely the pressure of the no flow boundary 21 p 2 d y 2 d 2 p 1 d y 1 d exp α 2 y 2 d y 1 d exp α 2 y 2 d y 1 d 22 p 1 d y 1 d p sd y s d exp α 1 y 1 d exp 2 α 1 y 1 d exp α 1 y 1 d α 1 k 1 k 2 α 2 tan h α 2 y 2 d y 1 d α 1 k 1 k 2 α 2 tan h α 2 y 2 d y 1 d exp α 1 y s d exp 2 α 1 y 1 d exp α 1 y s d α 1 k 1 k

α s w d 2 α s k s k 1 β 1 α s k s k 1 β 1 the hydraulic fracture pressure at yd wd 2 in eq 23 cannot be directly calculated because in the fracture linear flow region the pressure is only a function of xd integrating the pressure along the hydraulic fracture direction and using the length averaged integral value to represent the whole fracture pressure yd wd 2 can be a rational choice just similar to the classical area averaged pressure dietz 1965 for the whole reservoir one can use the following average pressure to represent the fracture pressure at yd wd 2 24 p fd ave 0 x f d 1 p f d 1 d x d x f d 1 x f d 2 p f d 2 d x d x f d 2 x f d 3 p f d 3 d x d x f d 3 since eq 24 involves extensive integration processes which are time consuming an alternative way could be using the fracture pressure at xd 0 this is because the pressure wave will first propagate from the fracture face at xd 0 to the formation and the pressure waves generated from two adjacent fractures will first interact with each other at xd 0 as well the differences of pressure values at yd wd 2 obtained from the two pressure calculation methods mainly occur in the early time which we have discussed in our previous research zeng et al 2017 the pressure waves from two adjacent fractures do not interact with each other at early times therefore using the two methods has few influences on the accuracy of determining the location of the no flow boundary in the examples a fractured horizontal well extends through a compartmentalized reservoir as shown in fig 21 it is a three block reservoir along the horizontal wellbore direction with a relatively high permeability bock in the center which is sandwiched by two low permeability blocks all the fractures have the same damage mechanisms including partially propped sections in the fracture tips choked fracture damage and fracture face matrix damage although the reservoir model is relatively simple it is versatile enough to reveal the post fracturing behavior in a heterogeneous reservoir with damaged fractures in fact more complex cases with more heterogeneous reservoir blocks and hydraulic fractures have been analyzed in our previous research zeng et al 2017 2018 it is found that adding more reservoir blocks shows almost no influence on the interactions between two adjacent fractures in linear flow models with a specific drainage volume for each fracture and only influences the overall performance of an mfhw the reservoir model presented here can demonstrate the typical behavior induced by adjacent heterogeneous blocks combined with complex fracture damage based on the knowledge obtained from these examples one can explain the well performance of other complex cases 4 5 1 transient pressure behavior under constant total rate conditions the basic reservoir model of case 6 is first applied to compare the pressure behavior under different damage mechanisms considering reservoir heterogeneity as shown in fig 22 the parameters listed in fig 22 are for the multiple damage situation for undamaged cases the fracture permeability is equal to the propped zone permeability and the permeability of damaged zone 3 equals matrix reservoir permeability the no flow boundaries calculated with fracture damage are located 339 ft away from fracture 2 in its two sides due to the symmetry the existence of fracture damage has a slight influence on the location of the no flow boundary and causes only a 1 ft difference in our cases this can be explained by the fact that near wellbore damage and fracture face damage dominate early time responses where the fracture interaction has not begun and although the partially propped section has longer time effects the damaged parameters are identical for all fractures therefore the location of the no flow boundary is mainly determined by the reservoir properties here fig 22 demonstrates that the pressure and its derivative are dramatically increased by the near wellbore conductivity reduction until the boundary dominant flow occurs the partially propped section in the fracture tip constrains the shape of intermediate time curves the effects of fracture face matrix impairment however are inconspicuous here to analyze how the degree of heterogeneity affects the pressure behavior three cases with the same properties in the second compartment are considered while the permeability values of blocks in the two sides are 10 4 md 10 3 md and 10 2 md respectively other reservoir fracture and fluid properties for each block in the three cases are listed in fig 23 the no flow boundaries of cases 7 and 8 are 329 ft and 301 ft away from the second fracture respectively the order of pressure and derivative values shown in fig 23 is qualitatively in good agreement with our expectation based on the permeability distribution cases with higher overall permeability have lower dimensionless pressure and derivative except the boundary dominated flow different from the pressure behavior in fig 19 only one early time transient section can be seen in the pressure derivation curves as the effects of fracture face damage are too small the lower the overall permeability is the earlier this transient regime will occur and the shorter its duration will be due to the reservoir heterogeneity there is also a transient regime before the unit slope boundary flow the higher degree of reservoir heterogeneity is the later the unit slope section will be achieved 4 5 2 flux distribution of each fracture under constant total rate conditions fig 24 a and b present the fracture flux distribution variations as a function of time under the constant rate condition the flux difference between fracture 2 and fracture 1 fracture 3 increases first because of the difference between reservoir block permeability values of fracture 2 and fracture 1 fracture 3 for the cases with choked near wellbore damage after the short time increase in the beginning the flux disparity of the three fractures decreases because this regime is controlled by identical damaged properties within the fracture then the flux difference continuously rises as the dominant parameter once again is the block permeability after a peak value the flux difference reduces until the fluxes finally become stable and distribute according to the fracture controlled drainage area which is determined by the no flow boundary locations for example the second fracture has a larger drainage area and hence obtains a larger flux in the stable period the reason why the curves of partially propped fracture cases deviate from those of fully propped fractures in fig 24 a and b at early mid times is that the formation flow influence comes earlier in partially propped cases see figs 13 and 14 making the effects of reservoir permeability heavier and accelerating the flux difference increase the partially propped part in the fracture tip later weakens the effects of block permeability resulting in a smaller flux difference compared with the undamaged one results from fig 25 a and b indicate that the greater the permeability difference is the more different the fluxes of fracture 2 and fracture 1 fracture 3 would be at early mid times and because the no flow boundaries locations of cases 6 and 7 have a marginal difference 10 ft the stable fracture fluxes in the two cases are very close moreover the lower the overall permeability is the later the stable flux period will occur the above factors emphasize the significance of the high permeability reservoir compartment in the analysis of the mfhw responses under the constant rate condition because it contributes a large portion of total rates in a relatively long time and is a crucial factor in determining no flow boundary s location 4 5 3 transient rate behavior under constant pressure conditions fig 26 a c show the rate behavior of individual fractures and the mfhw with different fracture damage mechanisms the basic reservoir model of case 6 is applied here for fractures 1 and 3 their drainage area properties are homogeneous as the no flow boundaries are located within blocks 1 and 3 respectively and the drainage area of fracture 2 contains a high permeability inner section in block 2 and two low permeability outer sections in blocks 1 and 3 as shown in fig 21 the choked near wellbore damage significantly reduces the early time production while the partially propped section in the fracture tip decreases the intermediate time rates different from fractures 1 and 3 the rate decline trend of the second fracture slows down at late times see the distinct flat period due to the contribution of the two low permeability outer drainage areas during early mid times when the flow rates are relatively high the contribution of the outer sections cannot be distinguished from the curves however at late times when the inner high permeability region is almost depleted the outer low permeability sections with higher flow resistance can still produce though the rate might be extremely low because partially propped cases rates reduce slower late time outer sections contribution becomes noticeable later the total rate behavior of the mfhw is similar to the rate behavior of fracture 2 except that the rates of the flat regime at late times are larger due to the contribution of fractures 1 and 3 fig 27 a c show how the degree of reservoir heterogeneity affects the transient rate responses with fracture damage the basic parameters for cases 6 7 and 8 are listed in the three figures the lower the permeability values of blocks 1 and 3 are the lower the fluxes of fractures 1 and 3 will be and the later the boundary flow regime will occur however for fracture 2 the early mid time rates of different cases are almost the same because the properties of block 2 are identical in all cases and at late times fracture 2 with higher outer drainage section permeability has a faster decline rate the late time contribution of outer drainage sections of fracture 2 is particularly noticeable for case 6 with lowest permeability outer sections this is because a higher permeability outer section has lower flow resistance resulting in more uniform depletion and the rate curves decline smoothly without a step shaped period 5 field data analyses in this section the production data of an mfhw with 12 hydraulic fractures drilled in the western canada cardium unconventional light oil formation are analyzed the well is located at the western sedimentary basin clarkson and pederson 2011 initially this region had been mainly developed through vertical wells recently many horizontal wells have been completed and fractured to exploit relatively low permeability areas along the edges of previously well developed oil pools typical permeability values in the targeted reservoirs range from 0 1 md to 10 md while the porosity ranges from 0 05 to 0 12 the well is a cased hole mfhw which can be nicely simulated by our model fig 28 gives the flowing pressure data and production rates the case detail is given in fig 29 the hydraulic fracture porosity and width are assumed properties from brown et al 2011 and the rationality of using them is explained in the model validation part the fracture number well length rock compressibility fracture height formation thickness formation porosity and permeability light oil viscosity initial reservoir pressure flowing wellbore pressure and the oil formation volume factor are all from the original paper of clarkson and pederson 2011 by assuming that the fractures are evenly distributed along the horizontal wellbore with the first fracture at the heel and the last fracture at the toe the fracture spacing is obtained previously similar analyses of the same well the card 3 well in that work have been done by clarkson and pederson 2011 they stated that the calculated length of that well from their method is 64 of the actual length and pointed out the possible reasons as follows 1 several fractures may not be effective in that well 2 using single phase flow methods has some limitations they also used a multi phase numerical method to match production data with full wellbore length 5105 ft in using the multi phase model a horizontal permeability value of 0 35 md is needed while the actual absolute reservoir permeability is 0 28 md besides although that model s oil rates match well with actual oil rates by increasing the reservoir permeability to 0 35 md its gas rates deviate from the field data in fact ignoring the fracture damage can also be a factor that causes errors in matching with the field data the non effectively created fractures mentioned by clarkson and pederson 2011 can be treated as a limiting case of damaged fractures it can be seen from fig 28 that the pressure is stable during production except at early times the clean up period therefore the constant pressure model of this work is selected to conduct the matching process considering fracture damage case 9 contains both fracture face damage and near wellbore damage while case 10 only has the fracture conductivity reduction near the wellbore with longer damage length the 12 fractures for each case are assumed to be identical and the input parameters are all listed in fig 29 the hydraulic fracture length permeability and fracture damage properties are obtained through matching the field data results suggest that if the fracture damage is considered the outcome obtained from our model shows reasonable agreements in oil rate matching with actual reservoir permeability 0 28 md as shown in fig 29 and clarkson and pederson 2011 did not consider fracture damage so they have to adjust the wellbore length to match field data case 11 represents the case without fracture damage under the 0 28 md reservoir permeability condition it is shown that the initial rates are dramatically higher than the actual field case even the undamaged hydraulic fracture permeability is already relatively low 5000 md compared with the undamaged fracture permeability in cases 9 and 10 and if smaller permeability values for the undamaged fracture are used a heavier discrepancy will occur at late times and if higher undamaged fracture permeability is applied the early time mismatch will be more significant as no reservoir width data are available the fractures are assumed to fully penetrate the formation vertically and horizontally the estimated half fracture length is 450 ft 6 conclusions a comprehensive linear flow model is written to explore the effects of fracture damage and heterogeneity on mfhw s performance in unconventional low permeability reservoirs the method is derived from a composite linear flow model model validation sensitivity analyses and a field case study are conducted the following key conclusions can be drawn 1 the model is capable to analyze transient pressure and rate responses in heterogeneous unconventional low permeability reservoirs with various fracture damage it can also be used to diagnose fracture damage predict well performance and help optimize the fracturing treatment design under constant rate or constant pressure conditions 2 fracture near wellbore damage influences the initial fracture contribution regime and the early mid formation linear flow regime by inducing a transient regime there the initial pressure and rate are affected by the fracture conductivity reduction while the transient regime start time and duration are controlled by the damage length 3 partially propped sections in fracture tips increase formation linear flow regime s dimensionless pressure and decrease its production rates longer damage length and lower residual conductivity of this section after fracture closure result in a longer duration and a heavier influence of this effect 4 only severe matrix impairment more than 70 reduction in permeability near the fracture face can have noticeable effects on pressure and rate responses permeability impairment determines the degree of deviation from the undamaged curves in the mid late fracture contribution regime and the early mid formation linear flow regime the longer the damage depth is the later the transient flow regime will occur 5 a new parameter the skin factor ratio is proposed to describe the relative magnitude of individual damage in multiple damage cases different damage length depth and conductivity permeability reductions can represent the same skin factor ratio when the skin factor ratios of fracture face and choked fracture damage are fixed the generally accurate type curves can be created although different length depth and conductivity permeability reductions with the same skin factor ratio may cause slight differences in individual cases therefore through type curve matching the skin factor ratios can be interpreted and the major damage mechanisms can be diagnosed 6 reservoir heterogeneity combined with fracture damage determines the shapes of certain flow regimes in pressure and rate curves except for the boundary dominant regime and controls the fracture flux distribution during production typical flow regimes with standard slopes may disappear under these complex reservoir conditions 7 ignoring fracture damage can be one potential factor that causes the mismatch between field data and results from

6467,several studies have documented the characteristics of seasonal decadal and spatial variations of tritium in different regions including north america australia and europe however long term data such as these studies were not yet reported for northeast asia in this study we document the extensive spatial temporal monitoring data of tritium levels in precipitation measured at 16 stations in korea over the last 20 years including the long term trend since 1961 by using measured and estimated data the long term variation of tritium concentrations in the korean precipitation follows the global trend reaching the maximum in 1963 owing to nuclear bomb testing followed by a consistent level since the late 1990s tritium concentrations in precipitation from 1998 to 2017 were maximum in spring april due to tropopause folding and minimum in summer july due to the dominant inflows of marine air the tritium concentrations in precipitation were lower toward the coastal stations due to the influence of marine moisture for all seasons our results characterize the differences in tritium levels in groundwater recharging areas for different periods in this region these results will serve as important tritium reference data for hydrology studies in northeast asia which is an important region for understanding global hydrological cycles keywords tritium precipitation groundwater nuclear testing korea 1 introduction tritium is the only radioisotope of hydrogen with the half life of 12 32 years lucas and unterweger 2000 it is naturally produced by cosmic ray spallation of nitrogen in the upper atmosphere craig and lal 1961 two thirds of this naturally occurring tritium is produced in the stratosphere and one third in the troposphere the natural production rate was estimated to be about 70 pbq y for the whole atmosphere araguas et al 1996 tritium is supplied from the stratosphere to the troposphere mainly due to the elevation of tropopause height called spring leak of the tropopause clark and fritz 1997 gat et al 2001 yasunari and yamazaki 2009 tritium can also be produced artificially by a variety of nuclear activities the amount of tritium released into the atmosphere by the nuclear weapons testing from 1945 to 1980 was estimated to be around 200 ebq which resulted in a factor of nearly 1000 higher level in 1963 in the northern hemisphere begemann and libby 1957 iaea wmo 2018 martell 1963 michel 1976 miskel 1971 unscear 2016 nowadays the tritium concentration in precipitation reached the natural tritium level guetat et al 2011 however there are

and smethie 1996 sarmiento 1983 for dating tritium ages of modern groundwater it is very important to know the initial tritium concentrations in precipitation extensive data reports have been made in different regions of the world tritium in precipitation samples have been investigated by the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip which was created by the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo in 1958 the gnip includes more than 1000 sampling stations over 125 countries iaea 2018 the tritium data reports are available some major

1987 1991 matsuoka et al 1994 however the long term data before 1963 to present have not yet reported in the northeast asia in spite of this region being important for global hydrological cycles in terms of human perturbations thus in this study we present the long term data of tritium in precipitation collected from nationwide monitoring stations from 1998 to 2017 throughout south korea the objective of this study is to characterize the variations of tritium concentrations in precipitation which can be used as tritium reference data of tritium age dating in groundwater and to determine the factors controlling temporal and spatial variations of tritium in this region in this study we also provide conversion factors of tritium concentration the tritium values relative to the korean stations for different regions in east asia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area south korea is located in the northeast asia the korean peninsula is mountainous and surrounded by marginal seas fig 1 this region is characterized by a humid continental and humid subtropical climate the annual average precipitation ranges from 826 mm to 2007 mm and has regional differences kma 2012 since this peninsula is affected by the east asian monsoon most of the annual precipitation occurs in summer korea has four distinct seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february precipitation samples were collected at 16 sampling stations nationwide nine stations are located inland four stations are located on the coastal areas and three stations are located on the islands the detailed information on the locations of sampling stations and sampling periods are shown in table 1 2 2 data acquisition and analyses the tritium concentrations in precipitation samples from 16 nationwide monitoring stations throughout south korea are available in the annual reports published by the korea institute of nuclear safety kins kins 1998 2017 the data of precipitation amounts were obtained from kma database kma 2018 the tritium data in precipitation measured in the world used in this study including pohang station in korea were obtained from the gnip database iaea wmo 2018 at pohang station of gnip the oldest monitoring station in korea tritium in precipitation was measured from 1961 to 1976 n 139 from 1998 to 2017 tritium concentrations in precipitation samples n 2386 were measured at 16 monitoring stations fig 1 since the monitoring data between 1977 and 1997 are not available tritium concentrations in precipitation during this period were interpolated using the correlation between monitoring data from the southern part of the korean peninsula monitoring data from pohang station 1961 1976 average values of monitoring data from stations of c1 c2 and c3 1998 2011 and those at ottawa station in canada 1953 2016 ottawa station is one of the long running gnip monitoring stations where up to the latest 2016 measurement data are available the correlation equation can be presented as ln c k 1 0484 ln c o 1 3032 r 2 0 98 n 30 where ck is the estimated tritium value in the study region and co is the monitoring result at ottawa station the data presented for the annual mean tritium concentration in precipitation was weight normalized by the amount of precipitation using the method described in technical report published by iaea iaea 1992 tritium concentrations in precipitation are presented as a tritium unit where 1 tu corresponds to 0 11919 0 00021 bq kg 1 of water gröning and rozanski 2003 the analytical methods used for monitoring are briefly described precipitation samples were collected monthly for 20 years table 1 these precipitation samples were then distilled and electrolytic enrichment was performed after pretreatment 10 ml of the water sample was added to a 20 ml perfluoroalkoxy pfa vial together with 10 ml of ultima gold llt cocktail packard usa and then sufficiently mixed the prepared sample was measured using a liquid scintillation counter 1220 quantulus perkinelmer the minimum detectable activity and analytical uncertainty were estimated to be about 0 1 bq l and 5 0 4 tu respectively since 1998 almost consistent methods for tritium analysis have been used without critical modifications 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal and spatial variations of tritium in precipitation the monthly average tritium concentrations showed seasonal variations with the maximum values obtained in early spring march april and minimum values obtained in late summer july august at most of the sampling stations fig 2 the monthly tritium concentrations from 2003 to 2011 showed the standard deviation sd from 1 2 tu st s1 to 6 2 tu st n8 fig 2 in general in spring the height of the tropopause increases caused by the heating of the continental surface and this process can lead to the transport of tritium enriched air to the troposphere as mentioned earlier gat et al 2001 rozanski et al 1991 in contrast the decreased tritium concentrations in summer are attributed to the inflows of marine air since the southeast monsoon also affects large parts of korea during summer in general the tritium level of water vapor over the sea is depleted in tritium due to the dilution effect with oceanic water vapor bolin 1958 seasonal variations of tritium in precipitation have been reported in other areas of the world but with the different trends for example in australian precipitation the maximum tritium values were observed in early spring august and september and the minimum values were observed in march and april tadros et al 2014 in ramnicu valcea romania a significant maximum level was noted during the late spring summer months duliu et al 2018 in hanoi vietnam decreased levels were observed from june to september anh et al 2018 in fukuoka japan increased values were recorded during winter and spring whereas decreased values were obtained during summer and fall hayashi et al 1999 therefore the seasonal variations of tritium in precipitation seem to be affected by various geographical and meteorological factors these factors are discussed further in the next section the magnitude of seasonal variations was smaller at stations located in the island st s1 s3 and coastal regions st c1 c3 c4 than those located inland stations n1 n9 owing to more frequent incursions of marine airs the difference between the maximum and minimum values at st s3 2 9 6 2 tu which is located on jeju island displays the lowest value amongst the entire sampling stations as such the average concentrations of tritium in precipitation from 2003 to 2011 increased with increasing distance of the sampling station from the coastline except for station c4 fig 3 the values were less than 7 tu at the sampling stations in most of the islands and coastal areas this geographical trend is consistent with the previously reported results in california usa and australia harms et al 2016 tadros et al 2014 amongst the stations station c4 showed unusually high peak in january the peak seems to be affected by the dominant northerly wind during winter as this station is situated in proximity to wolsong nuclear power plants npps 3 2 meteorological factors controlling tritium levels in air in order to evaluate the effect of precipitation amounts on tritium values the correlations between tritium concentrations and precipitation amounts were examined for different regions the monthly tritium concentration was normalized to the 12 month average the normalized tritium values monthly 3h concentration 12 month 3h concentration were negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation fig 4 such a precipitation amount effect was observed in the monthly tritium data for certain inland sites in australia tadros et al 2014 however no correlation was reported for hanoi vietnam since the rainfall during the dry season is monsoonal and is small or even rainless anh et al 2018 the negative correlations between tritium concentrations and precipitation amounts could be observed due to fractionation of hydrogen isotopes and the timing of the stratosphere troposphere exchange during the low precipitation period korea is characterized by four distinct seasons and the period of monsoon in order to eliminate this seasonal effect the monthly tritium concentrations in precipitation during summer june july and august were used separately fig 4 we still observe weak negative correlations between tritium concentrations in precipitation and the amount of precipitation for all three different group regions inland coast and island during the summer these negative correlations could be explained by this fractionation effect the fractionation of hydrogen deuterium isotopes by evaporation and condensation processes has been previously reported craig and gordon 1965 in the case of tritium it is known to be more strongly fractionated due to its larger mass difference herczeg and imboden 1988 in general hto is preferentially condensed due to its lower saturation vapor pressure than h2o craig and lal 1961 and can be concentrated in early rainout and diluted in more complete rainout thus we suggest that the precipitation amount effect could be associated with various factors including isotopic fractionation precipitation frequency and seasonal variation 3 3 tritium levels in precipitation for different regions in east asia the precipitation weighted annual mean values of tritium in korea peaked 1385 tu in 1963 due to the effects of global atmospheric nuclear weapons testing prior to the 1963 partial test ban treaty ptbt fig 5 the levels of tritium decreased rapidly from 1963 to 1968 and then gradually decreased thereafter although tritium concentrations decrease gradually after 1968 there were small transient increases in 1971 and 1974 due to the effects of the french and chinese nuclear tests as mentioned earlier the trend between 1977 and 1997 in this region is interpolated from the regression line between in korea and ottawa canada since the late 1990s the level has maintained a constant value of less than 10 tu fig 5 the tritium level in korea was relatively lower than that of ottawa and vienna since korea is located at a lower latitude than ottawa and vienna but higher than that of addis ababa located in low latitude area and melbourne in the south hemisphere compared with other regions in asia the tritium level in korea was approximately twice as high as that of hong kong in southeast asia however its value was half of the value observed in shijiazhuang china between 1980 and 2000 this is because in spite of being located at a similar latitude to korea shijiazhuang is comparatively less affected by the oceanic water vapor the tritium level in japan was slightly lower than that in korea thus dominant marine air effects can be one of the causes for the difference considering both countries are located at a similar latitude the average value of precipitation weighted annual mean tritium concentrations excluding the data for station c4 in korea was 5 9 tu from 1998 to 2011 the tritium values were high in the order of inland 6 3 tu coastal areas 5 5 tu and islands 5 1 tu in order to establish the relative concentration factors of tritium for different regions in asia we calculated f value which is the ratio of tritium concentration at each station to the mean tritium concentration in the korean coastal area f 1 for 5 5 tu we used the korean coastal value since the seasonal variations of tritium is small the f values ranged from 0 33 to 4 4 in east asia fig 6 indeed the values are high at wulumuqi china f 4 4 and shijiazhuang china f 3 6 which are higher than the f value f 2 9 at ottawa station compared with these chinese stations south asian stations including hong kong china bangkok thailand and diliman quezon city philippines showed lower values f 0 33 0 47 our long termdata in this region can be used to interpolate tritium data in precipitation formissing periods in other areasof asia in addition the mapping of f values based on our reference value will be useful in applying more accurate initial tritium values in hydrology studies or modeling modern tritium levels over global and regional scales 4 conclusions the temporal and spatial variations of tritium in precipitation were investigated at 16 stations in korea the seasonal variations of tritium concentration in precipitation showed the maximum value in spring due to the stratosphere troposphere air exchange and minimum values in summer due to dominant oceanic air inflows related to the monsoon the magnitude of seasonal variation in tritium concentrations varied depending on the contribution of marine air which has low tritium concentrations thus the seasonal variations were smaller for coastal and island stations as such the tritium concentrations in precipitation increased with the distance from the coastline to the land due to influence of marine air the tritium concentrations in precipitation decreased as the amount of precipitation increased perhaps due to the fractionation of tritium relative to hydrogen in the course of rainout as well as difference in the origin of rain clouds the concentrations of tritium in precipitation in asia showed an order of magnitude differences depending on geographical and meteorological characteristics of the region thus our results on tritium in precipitation in korea will serve as important tritium reference data for modeling modern tritium levels over global and regional scales which areimportant for understanding air mass mixingbetween the stratosphere and troposphere as well as global and regional water cycles conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements we thank all members in the korea institute of nuclear safety kins who produced the original

precipitation have been reported in other areas of the world but with the different trends for example in australian precipitation the maximum tritium values were observed in early spring august and september and the minimum values were observed in march and april tadros et al 2014 in ramnicu valcea romania a significant maximum level was noted during the late spring summer months duliu et al 2018 in hanoi vietnam decreased levels were observed from june to september anh et al 2018 in fukuoka japan increased values were recorded during winter and spring whereas decreased values were obtained during summer and fall hayashi et al 1999 therefore the seasonal variations of tritium in precipitation seem to be affected by various geographical and meteorological factors these factors are discussed further in the next section the magnitude of seasonal variations was smaller at stations located in the island st s1 s3 and coastal regions st c1 c3 c4 than those located inland stations n1 n9 owing to more frequent incursions of marine airs the difference between the maximum and minimum values at st s3 2 9 6 2 tu which is located on jeju island displays the lowest value amongst the entire sampling stations as such the average concentrations of tritium in precipitation from 2003 to 2011 increased with increasing distance of the sampling station from the coastline except for station c4 fig 3 the values were less than 7 tu at the sampling stations in most of the islands and coastal areas this geographical trend is consistent with the previously reported results in california usa and australia harms et al 2016 tadros et al 2014 amongst the stations station c4 showed unusually high peak in january the peak seems to be affected by the dominant northerly wind during winter as this station is situated in proximity to wolsong nuclear power plants npps 3 2 meteorological factors controlling tritium levels in air in order to evaluate the effect of precipitation amounts on tritium values the correlations between tritium concentrations and precipitation amounts were examined for different regions the monthly tritium concentration was normalized to the 12 month average the normalized tritium values monthly 3h concentration 12 month 3h concentration were negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation fig 4 such a precipitation amount effect was observed in the monthly tritium data for certain inland sites in australia tadros et al 2014 however no correlation was reported for hanoi vietnam since the rainfall during the dry season is monsoonal and is small or even rainless anh et al 2018 the negative correlations between tritium concentrations and precipitation amounts could be observed due to fractionation of hydrogen isotopes and the timing of the stratosphere troposphere exchange during the low precipitation period korea is characterized by four distinct seasons and the period of monsoon in order to eliminate this seasonal effect the monthly tritium concentrations in precipitation during summer june july and august were used separately fig 4 we still observe weak negative correlations between tritium concentrations in precipitation and the amount of precipitation for all three different group regions inland coast and island during the summer these negative correlations could be explained by this fractionation effect the fractionation of hydrogen deuterium isotopes by evaporation and condensation processes has been previously reported craig and gordon 1965 in the case of tritium it is known to be more strongly fractionated due to its larger mass difference herczeg and imboden 1988 in general hto is preferentially condensed due to its lower saturation vapor pressure than h2o craig and lal 1961 and can be concentrated in early rainout and diluted in more complete rainout thus we suggest that the precipitation amount effect could be associated with various factors including isotopic fractionation precipitation frequency and seasonal variation 3 3 tritium levels in precipitation for different regions in east asia the precipitation weighted annual mean values of tritium in korea peaked 1385 tu in 1963 due to the effects of global atmospheric nuclear weapons testing prior to the 1963 partial test ban treaty ptbt fig 5 the levels of tritium decreased rapidly from 1963 to 1968 and then gradually decreased thereafter although tritium concentrations decrease gradually after 1968 there were small transient increases in 1971 and 1974 due to the effects of the french and chinese nuclear tests as mentioned earlier the trend between 1977 and 1997 in this region is interpolated from the regression line between in korea and ottawa canada since the late 1990s the level has maintained a constant value of less than 10 tu fig 5 the tritium level in korea was relatively lower than that of ottawa and vienna since korea is located at a lower latitude than ottawa and vienna but higher than that of addis ababa located in low latitude area and melbourne in the south hemisphere compared with other regions in asia the tritium level in korea was approximately twice as high as that of hong kong in southeast asia however its value was half of the value observed in shijiazhuang china between 1980 and 2000 this is because in spite of being located at a similar latitude to korea shijiazhuang is comparatively less affected by the oceanic water vapor the tritium level in japan was slightly lower than that in korea thus dominant marine air effects can be one of the causes for the difference considering both countries are located at a similar latitude the average value of precipitation weighted annual mean tritium concentrations excluding the data for station c4 in korea was 5 9 tu from 1998 to 2011 the tritium values were high in the order of inland 6 3 tu coastal areas 5 5 tu and islands 5 1 tu in order to establish the relative concentration factors of tritium for different regions in asia we calculated f value which is the ratio of tritium concentration at each station to the mean tritium concentration in the korean coastal area f 1 for 5 5 tu we used the korean coastal value since the seasonal variations of tritium is small the f values ranged from 0 33 to 4 4 in east asia fig 6 indeed the values are high at wulumuqi china f 4 4 and shijiazhuang china f 3 6 which are higher than the f value f 2 9 at ottawa station compared with these chinese stations south asian stations including hong kong china bangkok thailand and diliman quezon city philippines showed lower values f 0 33 0 47 our long termdata in this region can be used to interpolate tritium data in precipitation formissing periods in other areasof asia in addition the mapping of f values based on our reference value will be useful in applying more accurate initial tritium values in hydrology studies or modeling modern tritium levels over global and regional scales 4 conclusions the temporal and spatial variations of tritium in precipitation were investigated at 16 stations in korea the seasonal variations of tritium concentration in precipitation showed the maximum value in spring due to the stratosphere troposphere air exchange and minimum values in summer due to dominant oceanic air inflows related to the monsoon the magnitude of seasonal variation in tritium concentrations varied depending on the contribution of marine air which has low tritium concentrations thus the seasonal variations were smaller for coastal and island stations as such the tritium concentrations in precipitation increased with the distance from the coastline to the land due to influence of marine air the tritium concentrations in precipitation decreased as the amount of precipitation increased perhaps due to the fractionation of tritium relative to hydrogen in the course of rainout as well as difference in the origin of rain clouds the concentrations of tritium in precipitation in asia showed an order of magnitude differences depending on geographical and meteorological characteristics of the region thus our results on tritium in precipitation in korea will serve as important tritium reference data for modeling modern tritium levels over global and regional scales which areimportant for understanding air mass mixingbetween the stratosphere and troposphere as well as global and regional water cycles conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements we thank all members in the korea institute of nuclear safety kins who produced the original

6468,statistical post processing methods have been applied in hydrometeorological forecasting to correct the bias and spread error in raw forecasts among various post processing methods the meta gaussian distribution model mgd is one of the early successful methods for post processing of precipitation forecasts and has been applied in the national weather service s hydrologic ensemble forecast system hefs together with the mix type meta gaussian distribution model mmgd however recent studies have shown that the original mgd cannot yield reliable forecasts especially for sub daily precipitation forecasts e g 6 hourly in this paper we improved the mgd model by applying the censored maximum likelihood estimation cmle method we conducted experiments using gefs reforecasts in huai river basin in china to evaluate its performance the results show that the proposed method performs better than the original mgd for sub daily precipitation forecasts the proposed method also achieves similar forecast skill with the state of the art censored shifted gamma distribution based ensemble mos csgd emos if both use ensemble mean as the only predictor the results indicate that the proposed cmle mgd can be useful for further applications such as flood forecasting that needs forecasts of high temporal resolution keywords ensemble forecasts precipitation statistical post processing meta gaussian distribution 1 introduction hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts are vitally important for applications such as flood forecasting and water resource management however due to different uncertainty sources including model inputs initial conditions model structures and parameters raw forecasts from meteorological or hydrological models suffer from systematic bias and dispersion errors and need to be corrected demargne et al 2014 schaake et al 2010 schaake et al 2007b various statistical post processing methods have been developed to correct these errors and achieve sharp forecasts subject to calibration gneiting et al 2007 gneiting and katzfuss 2014 gneiting and raftery 2007 these methods mainly follow the model output statistics mos scheme namely to fit the statistical models using historical forecasts and corresponding observations then apply the fitted model to calibrate future forecasts wilks 2011 the post processing of precipitation forecasts is challenging one difficulty is the intermittent nature of precipitation namely a positive probability for zero precipitation and a skewed distribution for nonzero precipitation scheuerer and hamill 2015 shrestha et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 during the past decade several post processing methods have been developed to deal with this problem some methods apply data transformations and then develop statistical models for the transformed variables this type of methods includes logistic regression lr models messner et al 2014a messner et al 2014b wilks 2009 meta gaussian distribution mgd models kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 krzysztofowicz and evans 2008 schaake et al 2007a wu et al 2011 and bayesian joint probability bjp robertson et al 2013 shrestha et al 2015 wang et al 2009 wang et al 2012 there are also other models that do not need transformations such as the censored shifted gamma distribution ensemble mos csgd emos scheuerer and hamill 2015 multi model averaging methods have also been developed particularly for precipitation forecasts such as the gamma distribution based bayesian model averaging raftery et al 2005 sloughter et al 2007 moreover the heteroscedasticity problem also exists for post processing of precipitation forecasts which means the forecast uncertainty increases with the magnitude of forecast variables scheuerer and hamill 2015 to deal with the heteroscedastic problem the non homogenous regression scheme can be applied namely to adjust the variance of the predictive distribution by predictors such as raw forecast mean or spread gneiting et al 2005 messner et al 2014b scheuerer and hamill 2015 besides the modeling of the spatio temporal correlation of precipitation forecasts is important for applications such as hydrological forecasting to solve this problem non parametric reordering methods have been widely used notable ensemble reordering methods including schaake shuffle clark et al 2004 ensemble copula coupling ecc schefzik et al 2013 and other variants of the two schemes joseph et al 2017 schefzik 2015 scheuerer et al 2017 wu et al 2018 parametric methods based on copula or the geostatistical output perturbation model gop have also been developed in recent years berrocal et al 2008 gel et al 2004 möller et al 2013 pinson and girard 2011 a recent paper did a more detailed review of those post processing methods li et al 2017 among existing post processing methods the meta gaussian distribution mgd model schaake et al 2007a is one of the early successful methods and it has been applied in the meteorological ensemble forecast processor mefp for national weather service s hydrologic ensemble forecast service hefs demargne et al 2014 together with the mixed type meta gaussian distribution based model mmgd wu et al 2011 however wu et al 2011 found that the original mgd by schaake et al fails to obtain reliable forecasts for 6 hourly precipitation because the estimation of the correlation coefficients of transformed forecasts and observations in the original mgd cannot yield satisfying results wu et al 2011 this disadvantage restricts the original mgd for applications such as flood forecasting that needs precipitation forecasts at high temporal resolution in this paper we proposed a new version of mgd model by applying maximum likelihood estimation for censored data cmle for short to improve its performance with the proposed cmle mgd model we treated the zero precipitation values as left censored data here the term left censored means it is only known that the precipitation amount is less than the threshold of zero precipitation e g 0 1 mm day but the exact precipitation amount is unknown in this way we made it feasible to estimate the correlation coefficients between the observations and forecasts including zero precipitation values this censoring technique has been successfully applied in other post processing models such as hclr messner et al 2014a and bjp robertson et al 2013 we compared the proposed cmle mgd with the original mgd and the state of the art csgd emos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and methods used in this paper section 3 describes the validation of the assumptions for the post processing model section 4 provides the comparison results of the three post processing methods section 5 discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed method finally section 6 summarizes the main conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 study region and data as shown in fig 1 the huai river basin 30 55 36 36 n 111 55 121 25 e is situated between the yangtze and yellow rivers in eastern china with an approximate drainage area of 270 000 km2 the mean annual precipitation is approximately 700 1600 mm decreasing from the south to the north huai river basin is under the influence of the asian monsoon system so most of the precipitation occurs during the june august flooding season the characteristics of the 15 subbasins used in this study are shown in table 1 liu et al 2013 the 15 subbasins were divided by the china meteorological administration for hydrometeorological forecasting purpose the precipitation forecasts used here is the global ensemble forecast system gefs reforecasts provided by noaa s national centers for environmental prediction ncep hamill et al 2013 the raw reforecasts are downloaded at a spatial resolution of 1 1 grid observations are the 0 1 0 1 gridded hourly china hourly merged precipitation analysis cmpa hourly obtained from the china meteorological administration shen et al 2014 the precipitation analysis is merged from gauge based analysis and satellite based cmorph precipitation from noaa climate prediction center cpc as the cmpa hourly dataset is only available from 2008 here we used ten years of observations and corresponding gefs reforecasts in rain season june august during 2008 2017 the mean areal precipitation map forecasts and observations were calculated from gridded gefs forecasts and observations by inverse distance interpolation method 2 2 the original mgd and cmle mgd the original mgd and cmle mgd both follow four steps as shown in fig 2 namely 1 the normal quantile transformation nqt for both the forecasts and the observations 2 the estimation of the joint distribution between the transformed observations and forecasts in normal space 3 the computation of the conditional distribution of observations given the new forecasts and the inverse nqt 4 the schaake shuffle procedure to maintain the spatio temporal correlation the difference between the original mgd and cmle mgd only exists in the second step 2 2 1 the normal quantile transformation procedure the normal quantile transformation nqt is designed to transform the non gaussian precipitation forecasts and observations into standard normal variables as follows 1 u φ n 1 f x x 2 v φ n 1 f y y where φ n 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution f x and f y are the cdfs of the marginal distribution of raw forecasts and observations respectively in this study we used mixed type distributions for the marginal distribution of forecasts and observations for example the marginal distribution of forecasts is as follows 3 f x x p 0 1 p 0 f x x 0 x where p 0 is the probability of the occurrence of precipitation and f x x 0 is the cdf of the precipitation amount given the occurrence of precipitation the distribution for the non zero precipitation is selected based on the p value of the anderson darling goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 for several parametric distributions including pearson type iii weibull and the generalized gamma distribution these three distributions were chosen because they were found to perform well in fitting the distribution for daily or sub daily precipitation amounts e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 papalexiou et al 2018 ye et al 2018 these parametric distributions also perform well for the study region according to the results of the anderson darling test in previous experiments 2 2 2 the estimation of the joint distribution of transformed forecasts and observations in normal space in the meta gaussian model the transformed forecasts u and observations v are assumed to follow the bivariate standard normal distribution as follows schaake et al 2007a 4 f u v n μ σ where μ 0 0 and σ 1 ρ ρ 1 the only parameter to be estimated for the joint distribution is the correlation coefficient ρ in normal space the difference between the original mgd and the proposed cmle mgd is how ρ is estimated in original mgd several options are provided for the estimation of ρ the default option is to substitute ρ in normal space by that in the untransformed space there are also other options in the original mgd but the default option leads to acceptable results in general liu et al 2013 tao et al 2014 ye et al 2017 however this substitution is not correct and may lead to an underestimation in the post processed results wu et al 2011 in this paper we tried to estimate the actual ρ in normal space directly by applying the maximum likelihood estimation for censored data cmle we treated the zero precipitation values as left censored at the threshold of zero precipitation e g 0 1 mm day used in this study here the term left censored means the data is known to be less than or equal to the threshold but unknown precisely the mle method for censored data was first developed in statistics and has been successfully used in the post processing of precipitation forecasts e g messner et al 2014a robertson et al 2013 the details of the likelihood functions are described as follows the cdf value at the censoring threshold instead of the density should be used in the likelihood function for censored data specifically depending on whether the forecasts and observations are censored or not the likelihood function in normal space can be divided into four cases as follows schepen et al 2016 5 l u v ρ i 1 t l t where 6 l t ϕ bn u t v t ρ if u t u 0 v t v 0 φ n v 0 μ v u σ v u ϕ n u t if u t u 0 v t v 0 φ n u 0 μ u v σ u v ϕ n v t if u t u 0 v t v 0 φ bn u 0 v 0 ρ if u t u 0 v t v 0 u 0 and v 0 are the transformed values for the thresholds of zero precipitation for forecasts and observations respectively for the first and last cases ϕ b n and φ b n are the density and the cdf for the standard bivariate normal distribution respectively for the second case ϕ n is the density for a standard univariate normal distribution φ n μ v u σ v u is the cdf of the conditional distribution of observations given forecasts with parameters as follows 7 μ v u ρ u t 8 σ v u 1 ρ 2 similarly for the third case ϕ n is the density for a standard univariate normal distribution φ n μ u v σ u v is the cdf of the conditional distribution of forecasts given observations with parameters as follows 9 μ u v ρ v t 10 σ u v 1 ρ 2 2 2 3 the computation of the conditional distribution and inverse nqt after the estimation of the joint distribution the conditional distribution of observation given a new forecast can be obtained exactly in the same way in the original mgd scheme schaake et al 2007a specifically if the new forecast is larger than zero the conditional distribution of the observation is a normal distribution with parameters defined in eqs 7 and 8 if the new forecast is less than the threshold of zero precipitation the cdf of the observation in normal space can be written as follows schaake et al 2007a 11 f v u v u u u 0 v u 0 f u v d u d v u 0 f u v d u d v v φ n u 0 μ u v σ u v ϕ n v d v φ n u 0 μ u v σ u v ϕ n v d v where φ n μ u v σ u v is the cdf of the conditional distribution of forecasts given observations with parameters defined as eqs 9 and 10 ϕ n is the density for a standard univariate normal distribution then the observation given a new forecast in original space can be obtained by the inverse nqt as follows schaake et al 2007a 12 y f y 1 φ n f v u 1 v u where φ n is the cdf of the standard univariate normal distribution f y 1 is the inverse of the cdf of the observations 2 2 4 the ensemble generation using the schaake shuffle procedure after obtaining the calibrated predictive distribution ensemble members can be generated from the predictive distribution by the sampling method used in the original mgd schaake et al 2007a firstly a larger number e g 1000 in this research of equally spaced samples are drawn from the predictive distribution obtained in eq 12 then the predictive distribution is partitioned into n equal intervals with probability equal to 1 n where n is the ensemble size an ensemble size of 100 was used in this research according to previous experiments finally the ensemble members are obtained by computing the sample mean within each interval of the predictive distribution then schaake shuffle is applied to generate ensemble series with appropriate spatio temporal correlation clark et al 2004 firstly the current ensemble members and the historical observations on similar dates are both ranked then the ensemble members are reordered to match the rank of the historical observations in this way the shuffled ensemble members represent the spatio temporal correlation of historical observations for more details on schaake shuffle please refer to clark et al 2004 2 3 forecast experiments and verification strategies to verify the performance of the proposed method we conducted a 10 fold leave one year out cross validation using the 10 year gefs reforecasts and corresponding observations in other words we chose nine years of data for training and used the other one year of data for verification and repeated this process for ten times post processing models were fitted for each month using a training dataset composed from a 91 day window centered on the 15th of each month during the training years for example the training dataset for the post processing model in june is the 9 year data within the time window of 1st may 30th july thus a training dataset of 91 9 days can be obtained in this study we focused on 6 hourly accumulated precipitation amounts within the lead time of five days because the forecast skill for 6 hourly precipitation is limited beyond five days three post processing methods including the original mgd cmle mgd and csgd emos were applied to the map of each subbasin the csgd emos is briefly described in the appendix the post processed forecasts were verified both for all the 15 subbasins together and for each subbasin individually the verification for all 15 subbasins was implemented after pooling the samples from the 15 subbasins and 10 fold cross validations together the verification for each subbasin was implemented after pooling the samples of 10 fold cross validations together several commonly used verification metrics were applied including the relative mean error rme the mean continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 and the brier skill score bss brier 1950 reliability is the statistical consistency of forecasts and observations and here we used the stratified probability integral transform pit histogram dawid 1984 gneiting et al 2007 bellier et al 2017 to assess the reliability as for discrimination we used roc score computed from the relative operating characteristic roc curve wilks 2011 the sampling uncertainty of metrics including rme crps bss and roc score was estimated by the stationary block bootstrap technique politis and romano 1994 for 1000 times by the software of ensemble verification system evs brown et al 2010 details of the verification metrics can be found in the appendix and related references e g wilks 2011 the stratified pit histogram is able to show the reliability for precipitation forecasts of different strata in this work three strata are divided by the 85 and 95 quantiles of raw forecast mean in other words the three strata are corresponding to the samples with raw forecast mean within the range of 0 85 quantiles light rain 85 95 quantiles moderate rain and 95 100 quantiles heavy rain then the pit histograms for each stratum are plotted and stacked together as will be shown in fig 5 it should be noted that the stratification should be based on forecasts e g raw forecast mean as we used here instead of observations to ensure calibration for each stratum lerch et al 2017 bellier et al 2017 3 validation of the model assumption in this section we applied the proposed cmle mgd and the original mgd method to the full dataset described in section 2 to validate the bivariate normal distribution assumption for the joint distribution of transformed forecasts and observations due to the existence of zero precipitation it is not easy to directly check the bivariate normal distribution assumption so we compared the estimated correlation coefficients of transformed variants with the optimal correlation coefficients the optimal correlation coefficients are defined as the correlation coefficients that minimize the crps of the post processed ensemble forecasts as we haven t got the closed form of the crps for mgd model we simply searched the optimal correlation coefficients by traversing a series of correlation coefficients within the 0 1 interval we computed the crps of the ensemble forecasts from the mgd model with each correlation coefficient value then the correlation coefficients with the lowest crps were selected as the optimal correlation coefficients the other parameters in mgd were kept the same during the searching for the optimal correlation coefficients in fig 3 we plotted the optimal correlation coefficients in transformed space horizontal axis versus the estimated correlation coefficients vertical axis by cmle mgd red dots and original mgd blue circles for the results of all the subbasins as shown in fig 3 the correlation coefficients estimated by the original mgd blue circles are obviously lower than the optimal correlation coefficients the results show that the original mgd underestimates the correlation coefficients of the transformed variants on the contrary the correlation coefficients estimated by cmle mgd red dots are much closer to the 1 1 line than those by the original mgd which indicates better correlation coefficients can be obtained by the proposed cmle mgd the superior results of cmle mgd also indirectly suggest that the assumption of bivariate normal distribution for transformed forecasts and observations is generally appropriate 4 verification results in this section we evaluated the predictive performance of the gefs forecasts and the results of the post processing methods using the 10 fold cross validation method described in subsection 2 3 the verification results for all the 15 subbasins together are shown in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 the verification results for individual subbasins are presented in the supplementary materials 4 1 the overall forecast performance in fig 4 the relative mean error and the mean crps hereafter referred to as crps for brevity of all 15 subbasins for raw gefs forecasts and the post processed forecasts are plotted versus lead times the 90 confidence intervals are obtained through bootstrapping for each metric by evs as shown in fig 4a raw gefs forecasts black lines suffer from an obvious positive bias of 20 60 after post processed by three methods the relative mean error is much lower which means that the post processing methods are able to correct the systematic bias in raw gefs forecasts the relative mean error of cmle mgd red lines is 10 20 higher than that of the original mgd blue lines which is 0 10 the reason for the overestimation problem of cmle mgd will be further analyzed in section 5 in fig 4b the crps results show that all three post processing methods obtained much lower crps values than those of the raw gefs forecasts among the three post processing methods emos performs the best followed by cmle mgd and the original mgd but the differences between the crps of the three post processing methods are not obvious in general in fig 5 the stratified pit histograms show the reliability of the post processed forecasts from the original mgd and cmle mgd for three strata light moderate and heavy rain based on raw forecasts at the four lead times within the first day as shown in fig 5a d the histograms of the original mgd exhibit obvious underestimation upslope shape especially for moderate and heavy rain the histograms in moderate blue and dark blue color on the contrary the histograms of all the samples for cmle mgd fig 5e h are generally flat which indicates cmle mgd can achieve generally reliable forecasts fig 5 shows that the proposed cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd in term of overall reliability it should also be noted that the pit histograms of cmle mgd for heavy rain in dark blue color are still not perfect and indicate a bit overestimation downslope shape especially for lead time of 12 18 h fig 5g and 18 24 h fig 5h the corresponding reason will be further analyzed in section 5 the pit histograms for other lead times are generally similar to the results in fig 5 and are only shown in the supplemental material 4 2 the forecast performance for dichotomous events the forecast performance of the original mgd and cmle mgd for dichotomous events at different precipitation thresholds are assessed through the brier skill score and the roc score in this subsection three thresholds namely the 85 quantile 0 6 mm 6h 95 quantile 6 5 mm 6h and 97 5 quantile 13 3 mm 6h of observed 6 hourly precipitation amounts during summers of 2008 2017 are used as shown in fig 6 a c the bss results of cmle mgd red lines are better than those of original mgd blue lines at the threshold of 85 and 95 quantiles for the threshold of 97 5 quantile the bss results of cmle mgd are slightly better than those of the original mgd for events within the first 72 h lead times the bss results show that cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd mainly for light and moderate rain fig 6d f show the roc scores of the post processed methods the roc scores for the two methods are generally similar for the first 72 h lead times for several longer lead times the cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd such as for lead times beyond 96 h in fig 6e and for lead times beyond 60 h in fig 6f the results show that cmle mgd also performs better than the original mgd in terms of discrimination for longer lead times in summary the results from all the 15 subbasins demonstrate that the proposed cmle mgd performs better than the original mgd in terms of brier skill score especially for light and moderate rain there are also improvements in discrimination in terms of roc score for several lead times the detailed results for each of the 15 subbasins are shown in the supplementary materials which also indicate improvements in terms of bss for most of the subbasins 5 discussion as illustrated in section 4 the proposed cmle mgd is generally superior to the original mgd in terms of forecast skill and overall reliability the original mgd cannot achieve reliable forecasts for 6 hourly precipitation which confirms the results in wu et al 2011 the reason of the improvements of cmle mgd can be attributed to the improved estimation of correlation coefficients between the transformed forecasts and observations by the cmle method fig 3 as it is the only difference between the two methods in fact the estimation of correlation coefficients for the transformed variates with censored data needs special treatments if the default option in the original mgd is used the correlation coefficient of the transformed variates is substituted by the correlation coefficient in the untransformed space however this substitution method in the original mgd will lead to underestimation of the correlation coefficients which can be proved theoretically by investigating the relationship between the correlation of untransformed variants and the correlation of transformed variants papalexiou 2018 another estimation option of the correlation coefficients in the original mgd is a weighted sum of the correlation coefficients for untransformed variants and those for transformed variants but the results are still not satisfying wu et al 2011 on the contrary the correlation coefficients can be well estimated by the cmle method because zero precipitation values are modeled as left censored data at the threshold of zero precipitation in cmle mgd the cmle method has been successfully applied in other studies for post processing of precipitation forecasts such as in hclr messner et al 2014a and bjp robertson et al 2013 the cmle mgd s improvement over the original mgd for sub daily precipitation events is meaningful in hydrological applications because accurate and reliable precipitation forecasts of high temporal resolution are very important in applications such as flood forecasting there are still limitations in the proposed cmle mgd model which may lead to the overestimation of cmle mgd in terms of bias fig 4a and reliability for heavy rain fig 5 as fig 3 shows the estimated correlation coefficients by cmle mgd are slightly higher than the optimal correlation coefficients that minimize crps which may result in the overestimation of cmle mgd a possible reason for the imperfect estimation of the correlation coefficients is the joint distribution of transformed forecasts and observations may not be bivariate normal distribution wu et al 2011 in the future more flexible tools such as copulas can be applied to model the joint distribution of forecasts and observations khajehei and moradkhani 2017 moreover the current version of cmle mgd is based on the parametric nqt in this study however the performance of the parametric nqt is influenced by the goodness of fit of the marginal distribution if the fitting of the marginal distribution is not satisfying the transformed variables may not follow standard normal distribution which will further deteriorate the modeling of the joint distribution in transformed space in the future we will test other transformations or non parametric nqt to achieve better performance besides wu et al 2011 demonstrated that the mixed type mgd performed better than the original mgd developed by schaake et al 2007a the comparison of the mixed type mgd and the proposed cmle mgd is also needed in the future in addition we only used ensemble mean as predictor in this work there are several methods that utilize all the ensemble members or the ensemble spread as predictors such as the member by member mbm van schaeybroeck and vannitsem 2015 and emos gneiting et al 2005 scheuerer and hamill 2015 we will improve the mgd models to make better use of the information from the ensemble forecasts to address the heteroscedasticity problem in the future 6 summary and conclusions raw forecasts from numerical weather models nwp can be improved significantly through post processing to remove the systematic bias and obtain better forecast skill the meta gaussian distribution mgd model is one of the early successful methods however recent studies have shown that the original mgd may suffer from reliability problems for 6 hourly precipitation forecasts in this paper we proposed an improved version of mgd model namely the censored maximum likelihood estimation based mgd cmle mgd we evaluated the proposed method using the gefs reforecasts of 6 hourly precipitation the results show that the proposed cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd in terms of brier skill score and overall reliability the proposed method can achieve similar performance with the state of the art csgd emos if both use ensemble mean as the only predictor the proposed cmle mgd can achieve reliable sub daily precipitation forecasts and it can be used in applications such as flood forecasting that needs precipitations forecasts of high temporal resolution more studies are

6468,statistical post processing methods have been applied in hydrometeorological forecasting to correct the bias and spread error in raw forecasts among various post processing methods the meta gaussian distribution model mgd is one of the early successful methods for post processing of precipitation forecasts and has been applied in the national weather service s hydrologic ensemble forecast system hefs together with the mix type meta gaussian distribution model mmgd however recent studies have shown that the original mgd cannot yield reliable forecasts especially for sub daily precipitation forecasts e g 6 hourly in this paper we improved the mgd model by applying the censored maximum likelihood estimation cmle method we conducted experiments using gefs reforecasts in huai river basin in china to evaluate its performance the results show that the proposed method performs better than the original mgd for sub daily precipitation forecasts the proposed method also achieves similar forecast skill with the state of the art censored shifted gamma distribution based ensemble mos csgd emos if both use ensemble mean as the only predictor the results indicate that the proposed cmle mgd can be useful for further applications such as flood forecasting that needs forecasts of high temporal resolution keywords ensemble forecasts precipitation statistical post processing meta gaussian distribution 1 introduction hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts are vitally important for applications such as flood forecasting and water resource management however due to different uncertainty sources including model inputs initial conditions model structures and parameters raw forecasts from meteorological or hydrological models suffer from systematic bias and dispersion errors and need to be corrected demargne et al 2014 schaake et al 2010 schaake et al 2007b various statistical post processing methods have been developed to correct these errors and achieve sharp forecasts subject to calibration gneiting et al 2007 gneiting and katzfuss 2014 gneiting and raftery 2007 these methods mainly follow the model output statistics mos scheme namely to fit the statistical models using historical forecasts and corresponding observations then apply the fitted model to calibrate future forecasts wilks 2011 the post processing of precipitation forecasts is challenging one difficulty is the intermittent nature of precipitation namely a positive probability for zero precipitation and a skewed distribution for nonzero precipitation scheuerer and hamill 2015 shrestha et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 during the past decade several post processing methods have been developed to deal with this problem some methods apply data transformations and then develop statistical models for the transformed variables this type of methods includes logistic regression lr models messner et al 2014a messner et al 2014b wilks 2009 meta gaussian distribution mgd models kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 krzysztofowicz and evans 2008 schaake et al 2007a wu et al 2011 and bayesian joint probability bjp robertson et al 2013 shrestha et al 2015 wang et al 2009 wang et al 2012 there are also other models that do not need transformations such as the censored shifted gamma distribution ensemble mos csgd emos scheuerer and hamill 2015 multi model averaging methods have also been developed particularly for precipitation forecasts such as the gamma distribution based bayesian model averaging raftery et al 2005 sloughter et al 2007 moreover the heteroscedasticity problem also exists for post processing of precipitation forecasts which means the forecast uncertainty increases with the magnitude of forecast variables scheuerer and hamill 2015 to deal with the heteroscedastic problem the non homogenous regression scheme can be applied namely to adjust the variance of the predictive distribution by predictors such as raw forecast mean or spread gneiting et al 2005 messner et al 2014b scheuerer and hamill 2015 besides the modeling of the spatio temporal correlation of precipitation forecasts is important for applications such as hydrological forecasting to solve this problem non parametric reordering methods have been widely used notable ensemble reordering methods including schaake shuffle clark et al 2004 ensemble copula coupling ecc schefzik et al 2013 and other variants of the two schemes joseph et al 2017 schefzik 2015 scheuerer et al 2017 wu et al 2018 parametric methods based on copula or the geostatistical output perturbation model gop have also been developed in recent years berrocal et al 2008 gel et al 2004 möller et al 2013 pinson and girard 2011 a recent paper did a more detailed review of those post processing methods li et al 2017 among existing post processing methods the meta gaussian distribution mgd model schaake et al 2007a is one of the early successful methods and it has been applied in the meteorological ensemble forecast processor mefp for national weather service s hydrologic ensemble forecast service hefs demargne et al 2014 together with the mixed type meta gaussian distribution based model mmgd wu et al 2011 however wu et al 2011 found that the original mgd by schaake et al fails to obtain reliable forecasts for 6 hourly precipitation because the estimation of the correlation coefficients of transformed forecasts and observations in the original mgd cannot yield satisfying results wu et al 2011 this disadvantage restricts the original mgd for applications such as flood forecasting that needs precipitation forecasts at high temporal resolution in this paper we proposed a new version of mgd model by applying maximum likelihood estimation for censored data cmle for short to improve its performance with the proposed cmle mgd model we treated the zero precipitation values as left censored data here the term left censored means it is only known that the precipitation amount is less than the threshold of zero precipitation e g 0 1 mm day but the exact precipitation amount is unknown in this way we made it feasible to estimate the correlation coefficients between the observations and forecasts including zero precipitation values this censoring technique has been successfully applied in other post processing models such as hclr messner et al 2014a and bjp robertson et al 2013 we compared the proposed cmle mgd with the original mgd and the state of the art csgd emos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and methods used in this paper section 3 describes the validation of the assumptions for the post processing model section 4 provides the comparison results of the three post processing methods section 5 discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed method finally section 6 summarizes the main conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 study region and data as shown in fig 1 the huai river basin 30 55 36 36 n 111 55 121 25 e is situated between the yangtze and yellow rivers in eastern china with an approximate drainage area of 270 000 km2 the mean annual precipitation is approximately 700 1600 mm decreasing from the south to the north huai river basin is under the influence of the asian monsoon system so most of the precipitation occurs during the june august flooding season the characteristics of the 15 subbasins used in this study are shown in table 1 liu et al 2013 the 15 subbasins were divided by the china meteorological administration for hydrometeorological forecasting purpose the precipitation forecasts used here is the global ensemble forecast system gefs reforecasts provided by noaa s national centers for environmental prediction ncep hamill et al 2013 the raw reforecasts are downloaded at a spatial resolution of 1 1 grid observations are the 0 1 0 1 gridded hourly china hourly merged precipitation analysis cmpa hourly obtained from the china meteorological administration shen et al 2014 the precipitation analysis is merged from gauge based analysis and satellite based cmorph precipitation from noaa climate prediction center cpc as the cmpa hourly dataset is only available from 2008 here we used ten years of observations and corresponding gefs reforecasts in rain season june august during 2008 2017 the mean areal precipitation map forecasts and observations were calculated from gridded gefs forecasts and observations by inverse distance interpolation method 2 2 the original mgd and cmle mgd the original mgd and cmle mgd both follow four steps as shown in fig 2 namely 1 the normal quantile transformation nqt for both the forecasts and the observations 2 the estimation of the joint distribution between the transformed observations and forecasts in normal space 3 the computation of the conditional distribution of observations given the new forecasts and the inverse nqt 4 the schaake shuffle procedure to maintain the spatio temporal correlation the difference between the original mgd and cmle mgd only exists in the second step 2 2 1 the normal quantile transformation procedure the normal quantile transformation nqt is designed to transform the non gaussian precipitation forecasts and observations into standard normal variables as follows 1 u φ n 1 f x x 2 v φ n 1 f y y where φ n 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution f x and f y are the cdfs of the marginal distribution of raw forecasts and observations respectively in this study we used mixed type distributions for the marginal distribution of forecasts and observations for example the marginal distribution of forecasts is as follows 3 f x x p 0 1 p 0 f x x 0 x where p 0 is the probability of the occurrence of precipitation and f x x 0 is the cdf of the precipitation amount given the occurrence of precipitation the distribution for the non zero precipitation is selected based on the p value of the anderson darling goodness of fit test anderson and darling 1954 for several parametric distributions including pearson type iii weibull and the generalized gamma distribution these three distributions were chosen because they were found to perform well in fitting the distribution for daily or sub daily precipitation amounts e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 papalexiou et al 2018 ye et al 2018 these parametric distributions also perform well for the study region according to the results of the anderson darling test in previous experiments 2 2 2 the estimation of the joint distribution of transformed forecasts and observations in normal space in the meta gaussian model the transformed forecasts u and observations v are assumed to follow the bivariate standard normal distribution as follows schaake et al 2007a 4 f u v n μ σ where μ 0 0 and σ 1 ρ ρ 1 the only parameter to be estimated for the joint distribution is the correlation coefficient ρ in normal space the difference between the original mgd and the proposed cmle mgd is how ρ is estimated in original mgd several options are provided for the estimation of ρ the default option is to substitute ρ in normal space by that in the untransformed space there are also other options in the original mgd but the default option leads to acceptable results in general liu et al 2013 tao et al 2014 ye et al 2017 however this substitution is not correct and may lead to an underestimation in the post processed results wu et al 2011 in this paper we tried to estimate the actual ρ in normal space directly by applying the maximum likelihood estimation for censored data cmle we treated the zero precipitation values as left censored at the threshold of zero precipitation e g 0 1 mm day used in this study here the term left censored means the data is known to be less than or equal to the threshold but unknown precisely the mle method for censored data was first developed in statistics and has been successfully used in the post processing of precipitation forecasts e g messner et al 2014a robertson et al 2013 the details of the likelihood functions are described as follows the cdf value at the censoring threshold instead of the density should be used in the likelihood function for censored data specifically depending on whether the forecasts and observations are censored or not the likelihood function in normal space can be divided into four cases as follows schepen et al 2016 5 l u v ρ i 1 t l t where 6 l t ϕ bn u t v t ρ if u t u 0 v t v 0 φ n v 0 μ v u σ v u ϕ n u t if u t u 0 v t v 0 φ n u 0 μ u v σ u v ϕ n v t if u t u 0 v t v 0 φ bn u 0 v 0 ρ if u t u 0 v t v 0 u 0 and v 0 are the transformed values for the thresholds of zero precipitation for forecasts and observations respectively for the first and last cases ϕ b n and φ b n are the density and the cdf for the standard bivariate normal distribution respectively for the second case ϕ n is the density for a standard univariate normal distribution φ n μ v u σ v u is the cdf of the conditional distribution of observations given forecasts with parameters as follows 7 μ v u ρ u t 8 σ v u 1 ρ 2 similarly for the third case ϕ n is the density for a standard univariate normal distribution φ n μ u v σ u v is the cdf of the conditional distribution of forecasts given observations with parameters as follows 9 μ u v ρ v t 10 σ u v 1 ρ 2 2 2 3 the computation of the conditional distribution and inverse nqt after the estimation of the joint distribution the conditional distribution of observation given a new forecast can be obtained exactly in the same way in the original mgd scheme schaake et al 2007a specifically if the new forecast is larger than zero the conditional distribution of the observation is a normal distribution with parameters defined in eqs 7 and 8 if the new forecast is less than the threshold of zero precipitation the cdf of the observation in normal space can be written as follows schaake et al 2007a 11 f v u v u u u 0 v u 0 f u v d u d v u 0 f u v d u d v v φ n u 0 μ u v σ u v ϕ n v d v φ n u 0 μ u v σ u v ϕ n v d v where φ n μ u v σ u v is the cdf of the conditional distribution of forecasts given observations with parameters defined as eqs 9 and 10 ϕ n is the density for a standard univariate normal distribution then the observation given a new forecast in original space can be obtained by the inverse nqt as follows schaake et al 2007a 12 y f y 1 φ n f v u 1 v u where φ n is the cdf of the standard univariate normal distribution f y 1 is the inverse of the cdf of the observations 2 2 4 the ensemble generation using the schaake shuffle procedure after obtaining the calibrated predictive distribution ensemble members can be generated from the predictive distribution by the sampling method used in the original mgd schaake et al 2007a firstly a larger number e g 1000 in this research of equally spaced samples are drawn from the predictive distribution obtained in eq 12 then the predictive distribution is partitioned into n equal intervals with probability equal to 1 n where n is the ensemble size an ensemble size of 100 was used in this research according to previous experiments finally the ensemble members are obtained by computing the sample mean within each interval of the predictive distribution then schaake shuffle is applied to generate ensemble series with appropriate spatio temporal correlation clark et al 2004 firstly the current ensemble members and the historical observations on similar dates are both ranked then the ensemble members are reordered to match the rank of the historical observations in this way the shuffled ensemble members represent the spatio temporal correlation of historical observations for more details on schaake shuffle please refer to clark et al 2004 2 3 forecast experiments and verification strategies to verify the performance of the proposed method we conducted a 10 fold leave one year out cross validation using the 10 year gefs reforecasts and corresponding observations in other words we chose nine years of data for training and used the other one year of data for verification and repeated this process for ten times post processing models were fitted for each month using a training dataset composed from a 91 day window centered on the 15th of each month during the training years for example the training dataset for the post processing model in june is the 9 year data within the time window of 1st may 30th july thus a training dataset of 91 9 days can be obtained in this study we focused on 6 hourly accumulated precipitation amounts within the lead time of five days because the forecast skill for 6 hourly precipitation is limited beyond five days three post processing methods including the original mgd cmle mgd and csgd emos were applied to the map of each subbasin the csgd emos is briefly described in the appendix the post processed forecasts were verified both for all the 15 subbasins together and for each subbasin individually the verification for all 15 subbasins was implemented after pooling the samples from the 15 subbasins and 10 fold cross validations together the verification for each subbasin was implemented after pooling the samples of 10 fold cross validations together several commonly used verification metrics were applied including the relative mean error rme the mean continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 and the brier skill score bss brier 1950 reliability is the statistical consistency of forecasts and observations and here we used the stratified probability integral transform pit histogram dawid 1984 gneiting et al 2007 bellier et al 2017 to assess the reliability as for discrimination we used roc score computed from the relative operating characteristic roc curve wilks 2011 the sampling uncertainty of metrics including rme crps bss and roc score was estimated by the stationary block bootstrap technique politis and romano 1994 for 1000 times by the software of ensemble verification system evs brown et al 2010 details of the verification metrics can be found in the appendix and related references e g wilks 2011 the stratified pit histogram is able to show the reliability for precipitation forecasts of different strata in this work three strata are divided by the 85 and 95 quantiles of raw forecast mean in other words the three strata are corresponding to the samples with raw forecast mean within the range of 0 85 quantiles light rain 85 95 quantiles moderate rain and 95 100 quantiles heavy rain then the pit histograms for each stratum are plotted and stacked together as will be shown in fig 5 it should be noted that the stratification should be based on forecasts e g raw forecast mean as we used here instead of observations to ensure calibration for each stratum lerch et al 2017 bellier et al 2017 3 validation of the model assumption in this section we applied the proposed cmle mgd and the original mgd method to the full dataset described in section 2 to validate the bivariate normal distribution assumption for the joint distribution of transformed forecasts and observations due to the existence of zero precipitation it is not easy to directly check the bivariate normal distribution assumption so we compared the estimated correlation coefficients of transformed variants with the optimal correlation coefficients the optimal correlation coefficients are defined as the correlation coefficients that minimize the crps of the post processed ensemble forecasts as we haven t got the closed form of the crps for mgd model we simply searched the optimal correlation coefficients by traversing a series of correlation coefficients within the 0 1 interval we computed the crps of the ensemble forecasts from the mgd model with each correlation coefficient value then the correlation coefficients with the lowest crps were selected as the optimal correlation coefficients the other parameters in mgd were kept the same during the searching for the optimal correlation coefficients in fig 3 we plotted the optimal correlation coefficients in transformed space horizontal axis versus the estimated correlation coefficients vertical axis by cmle mgd red dots and original mgd blue circles for the results of all the subbasins as shown in fig 3 the correlation coefficients estimated by the original mgd blue circles are obviously lower than the optimal correlation coefficients the results show that the original mgd underestimates the correlation coefficients of the transformed variants on the contrary the correlation coefficients estimated by cmle mgd red dots are much closer to the 1 1 line than those by the original mgd which indicates better correlation coefficients can be obtained by the proposed cmle mgd the superior results of cmle mgd also indirectly suggest that the assumption of bivariate normal distribution for transformed forecasts and observations is generally appropriate 4 verification results in this section we evaluated the predictive performance of the gefs forecasts and the results of the post processing methods using the 10 fold cross validation method described in subsection 2 3 the verification results for all the 15 subbasins together are shown in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 the verification results for individual subbasins are presented in the supplementary materials 4 1 the overall forecast performance in fig 4 the relative mean error and the mean crps hereafter referred to as crps for brevity of all 15 subbasins for raw gefs forecasts and the post processed forecasts are plotted versus lead times the 90 confidence intervals are obtained through bootstrapping for each metric by evs as shown in fig 4a raw gefs forecasts black lines suffer from an obvious positive bias of 20 60 after post processed by three methods the relative mean error is much lower which means that the post processing methods are able to correct the systematic bias in raw gefs forecasts the relative mean error of cmle mgd red lines is 10 20 higher than that of the original mgd blue lines which is 0 10 the reason for the overestimation problem of cmle mgd will be further analyzed in section 5 in fig 4b the crps results show that all three post processing methods obtained much lower crps values than those of the raw gefs forecasts among the three post processing methods emos performs the best followed by cmle mgd and the original mgd but the differences between the crps of the three post processing methods are not obvious in general in fig 5 the stratified pit histograms show the reliability of the post processed forecasts from the original mgd and cmle mgd for three strata light moderate and heavy rain based on raw forecasts at the four lead times within the first day as shown in fig 5a d the histograms of the original mgd exhibit obvious underestimation upslope shape especially for moderate and heavy rain the histograms in moderate blue and dark blue color on the contrary the histograms of all the samples for cmle mgd fig 5e h are generally flat which indicates cmle mgd can achieve generally reliable forecasts fig 5 shows that the proposed cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd in term of overall reliability it should also be noted that the pit histograms of cmle mgd for heavy rain in dark blue color are still not perfect and indicate a bit overestimation downslope shape especially for lead time of 12 18 h fig 5g and 18 24 h fig 5h the corresponding reason will be further analyzed in section 5 the pit histograms for other lead times are generally similar to the results in fig 5 and are only shown in the supplemental material 4 2 the forecast performance for dichotomous events the forecast performance of the original mgd and cmle mgd for dichotomous events at different precipitation thresholds are assessed through the brier skill score and the roc score in this subsection three thresholds namely the 85 quantile 0 6 mm 6h 95 quantile 6 5 mm 6h and 97 5 quantile 13 3 mm 6h of observed 6 hourly precipitation amounts during summers of 2008 2017 are used as shown in fig 6 a c the bss results of cmle mgd red lines are better than those of original mgd blue lines at the threshold of 85 and 95 quantiles for the threshold of 97 5 quantile the bss results of cmle mgd are slightly better than those of the original mgd for events within the first 72 h lead times the bss results show that cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd mainly for light and moderate rain fig 6d f show the roc scores of the post processed methods the roc scores for the two methods are generally similar for the first 72 h lead times for several longer lead times the cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd such as for lead times beyond 96 h in fig 6e and for lead times beyond 60 h in fig 6f the results show that cmle mgd also performs better than the original mgd in terms of discrimination for longer lead times in summary the results from all the 15 subbasins demonstrate that the proposed cmle mgd performs better than the original mgd in terms of brier skill score especially for light and moderate rain there are also improvements in discrimination in terms of roc score for several lead times the detailed results for each of the 15 subbasins are shown in the supplementary materials which also indicate improvements in terms of bss for most of the subbasins 5 discussion as illustrated in section 4 the proposed cmle mgd is generally superior to the original mgd in terms of forecast skill and overall reliability the original mgd cannot achieve reliable forecasts for 6 hourly precipitation which confirms the results in wu et al 2011 the reason of the improvements of cmle mgd can be attributed to the improved estimation of correlation coefficients between the transformed forecasts and observations by the cmle method fig 3 as it is the only difference between the two methods in fact the estimation of correlation coefficients for the transformed variates with censored data needs special treatments if the default option in the original mgd is used the correlation coefficient of the transformed variates is substituted by the correlation coefficient in the untransformed space however this substitution method in the original mgd will lead to underestimation of the correlation coefficients which can be proved theoretically by investigating the relationship between the correlation of untransformed variants and the correlation of transformed variants papalexiou 2018 another estimation option of the correlation coefficients in the original mgd is a weighted sum of the correlation coefficients for untransformed variants and those for transformed variants but the results are still not satisfying wu et al 2011 on the contrary the correlation coefficients can be well estimated by the cmle method because zero precipitation values are modeled as left censored data at the threshold of zero precipitation in cmle mgd the cmle method has been successfully applied in other studies for post processing of precipitation forecasts such as in hclr messner et al 2014a and bjp robertson et al 2013 the cmle mgd s improvement over the original mgd for sub daily precipitation events is meaningful in hydrological applications because accurate and reliable precipitation forecasts of high temporal resolution are very important in applications such as flood forecasting there are still limitations in the proposed cmle mgd model which may lead to the overestimation of cmle mgd in terms of bias fig 4a and reliability for heavy rain fig 5 as fig 3 shows the estimated correlation coefficients by cmle mgd are slightly higher than the optimal correlation coefficients that minimize crps which may result in the overestimation of cmle mgd a possible reason for the imperfect estimation of the correlation coefficients is the joint distribution of transformed forecasts and observations may not be bivariate normal distribution wu et al 2011 in the future more flexible tools such as copulas can be applied to model the joint distribution of forecasts and observations khajehei and moradkhani 2017 moreover the current version of cmle mgd is based on the parametric nqt in this study however the performance of the parametric nqt is influenced by the goodness of fit of the marginal distribution if the fitting of the marginal distribution is not satisfying the transformed variables may not follow standard normal distribution which will further deteriorate the modeling of the joint distribution in transformed space in the future we will test other transformations or non parametric nqt to achieve better performance besides wu et al 2011 demonstrated that the mixed type mgd performed better than the original mgd developed by schaake et al 2007a the comparison of the mixed type mgd and the proposed cmle mgd is also needed in the future in addition we only used ensemble mean as predictor in this work there are several methods that utilize all the ensemble members or the ensemble spread as predictors such as the member by member mbm van schaeybroeck and vannitsem 2015 and emos gneiting et al 2005 scheuerer and hamill 2015 we will improve the mgd models to make better use of the information from the ensemble forecasts to address the heteroscedasticity problem in the future 6 summary and conclusions raw forecasts from numerical weather models nwp can be improved significantly through post processing to remove the systematic bias and obtain better forecast skill the meta gaussian distribution mgd model is one of the early successful methods however recent studies have shown that the original mgd may suffer from reliability problems for 6 hourly precipitation forecasts in this paper we proposed an improved version of mgd model namely the censored maximum likelihood estimation based mgd cmle mgd we evaluated the proposed method using the gefs reforecasts of 6 hourly precipitation the results show that the proposed cmle mgd outperforms the original mgd in terms of brier skill score and overall reliability the proposed method can achieve similar performance with the state of the art csgd emos if both use ensemble mean as the only predictor the proposed cmle mgd can achieve reliable sub daily precipitation forecasts and it can be used in applications such as flood forecasting that needs precipitations forecasts of high temporal resolution more studies are

6469,human activities have altered terrestrial carbon c and nitrogen n dynamics via changes to land cover and use such as deforestation agriculture application of fertilizers etc and have influenced the patterns of organic c input and eutrophication in downstream freshwater ecosystems biogeochemical cycling of c and n and the related organic carbon oc production may display correlated diurnal and seasonal variations due to photosynthesis and respiration in these ecosystems whose underlying mechanisms still need to be resolved in this study we document the diurnal and seasonal variations measured in dic dissolved inorganic carbon no3 toc total organic carbon and other related hydrochemical parameters ph and do dissolved oxygen in five artificial spring pond ecosystems with differing land uses in tanks draining into springs and corresponding ponds constructed at the shawan karst test site sw china it was found that diurnal changes in dic no3 and toc in all ponds were dominated by aquatic ecosystem metabolism i e photosynthesis and respiration as evidenced by the pertinent variations in do and ph daily dic and no3 uptake and oc production were higher in october growing period and lower in january dormant period indicating seasonal differences in assimilation that were determined by both changes in weather temperature and light and nutrient inputs under conditions of bare rock or bare soil there was very low dic and no3 additions to the spring pond ecosystems resulting in lower oc productivity in the ponds cropped land yielded higher dic and no3 to the pond due to growth of corn and use of fertilizers that enhanced oc production highest productivity and densest vegetation cover on tanks with grassland or shrubs with higher n retention in soils resulted in higher dic but limited no3 addition to the ecosystems downstream the highest dic concentration in the grassland resulted in maximum oc production in the pond these results indicate that oc production in the ponds with elevated ph was limited by dic fertilization in general the supply of dic is not considered to limit aquatic primary productivity because its concentration exceeds that of other plant macronutrients such as no3 and po4 3 by two or three orders of magnitude therefore the carbon limitation detected here may indicate that photoautotrophs in karst dominated aquatic terrains dominated by charophyta and spirogyra cannot use the total dic for photosynthesis but only the dissolved co2 which comprises 1 of total dic at ph 8 2 that is characteristic in these environments this may have implications for control of eutrophication in such alkaline aquatic ecosystems i e rates of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems may be regulated not only by n and or p but also by c it is also projected that there will be an increase in oc sequestration with the current land use and global climate change driven increases in dic due to carbon limitation of aquatic primary production

al 2015 liu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 the higher dissolved organic carbon dic half of which from soil atmosphere from carbonate weathering can fuel the growth of aquatic plants and thus enhance the uptake of atmospheric carbon liu et al 2018 contemporary human activities such as agricultural land use and land cover changes lucc have resulted in increased carbon and nitrogen discharge from soils into aquatic ecosystems and thus significantly increased the dic and nitrate concentrations in surface and groundwater systems mulholland 2008 raymond et al 2008 taylor and townsend 2010 zeng et al 2017 for a long period co2 increase has been thought to have only minor influence on primary productivity in freshwater ecosystems because of the common assumption that co2 concentrations in freshwater are high enough for phytoplankton growth visser et al 2016 however the actual concentration of dissolved co2 is quite low and co2 uptake by flourishing submerged aquatic plants can turn the water from supersaturated to highly undersaturated to atmospheric co2 balmer et al 2011 phytoplankton photosynthesis draws down the concentration of dissolved co2 leading to the water becoming co2 undersaturated increasing the ph and changing principal molecular hosts of dissolved inorganic carbon dic talling 1976 verschoor et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 a high ph environment helps shift the inorganic carbon dominated by co2 aq towards a bicarbonate and or carbonate ion dominated system schulte et al 2011 this severely reduces the concentration of dissolved co2 aq in water which is only 1 of dic at ph 8 2 riebesell et al 1993 co2 aq is the favored substrate for aquatic plant photosynthesis therefore elevated ph may be associated with accessible carbon limitation for phytoplankton production van dam et al 2018 verspagen et al 2014 to relieve this limitation some phytoplankton have developed an ability to use bicarbonate and carbonate by co2 concentrating mechanisms ccms allowing them to access additional inorganic carbon pools when co2 aq becomes depleted from increase in ph mangan et al 2016 morales williams et al 2017 price et al 2008 price 2011 van dam et al 2018 on the other hand as a fundamental nutrient n availability may also constrain the algal growth carbon uptake and primary production of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 n alteration caused by different land use activities can impact the nutrient uptake rate and n dynamics hall et al 2009 causing eutrophication problems in aquatic ecosystems abell et al 2010 conley et al 2009 howarth and marino 2006 jarvie et al 2018 the cycling of c and n in freshwater has been shown to be closely related with coupled control of organic carbon oc concentrations through aquatic biological processes of assimilation or denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 gruber and galloway 2008 taylor and townsend 2010 trimmer et al 2012 further a growing body of evidence has shown that c n and oc production in freshwater ecosystems display similar patterns of change that are most likely due to aquatic ecosystem metabolism clarke et al 2002 harrison et al 2005 heffernan and cohen 2010 jiang et al 2013 parker et al 2007 parker et al 2010 poulson and sullivan 2010 spencer et al 2007 nutrient load such as n input has long been thought to be the most significant limiting factor for organic matter production in aquatic ecosystems compared to the effect of c which seems to have less influence hecky and kilham 1988 visser et al 2016 however laboratory experiments and models have demonstrated that rising co2 concentrations may result in phytoplankton blooms in both marine chen and durbin 1994 riebesell et al 1993 and freshwater ecosystems hein and sand jensen 1997 verschoor et al 2013 verspagen et al 2014 young and gobler 2017 by reducing the c limitations on primary production moreover in freshwater ecosystems elevated co2 uptake can increase the carbon nutrient stoichiometry in aquatic biomass verspagen et al 2014 in addition primary producers still have the ability to photosynthesize when sufficient light and dic are available even under severe nutrient limited conditions verschoor et al 2013 it is generally difficult to distinguish and estimate the impacts of specific land use activities on c and n inputs and their subsequent effects on aquatic c and n cycles in natural conditions where different land uses persist within a given catchment studies in single use catchments can clearly help us to determine the c and n dynamics and their relationships with aquatic primary production this is best accomplished under experimental control of land use types therefore we have investigated the spring fed pond ecosystems derived from five different experimental land uses at the shawan karst test site sw china measuring the range of dic and no3 concentrations by each individual spring to its hydrologically connected artificial pond chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 the different types of land use in the experiment bare rock bare soil cropland grassland and shrubland displayed large dic and no3 gradients and the different nutrient input scenarios helped us to determine the role of c vs n limitation in aquatic ecosystem photosynthesis and its potential influence on eutrophication control and carbon cycling in karst surface waters with high ph and dic though the biological carbon pump effect has been found to be related to the dic fertilization by previous authors chen et al 2017 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the underlying mechanisms still need to be resolved especially the roles of principal molecular hosts of dic which may have implications in controlling eutrophication and the carbon cycle in such aquatic ecosystems 2 site description our test site is located in the puding comprehensive karst research and experimental station puding county guizhou province southwest china fig 2 a the site has a humid sub tropical monsoon climate with annual mean air temperature of 15 1 c mean annual precipitation is 1315 mm 80 of which falls in the wet season from may to october in january 2014 five concrete tanks lu1 lu5 were built at the experimental station each of them simulating a single land use catchment as shown in fig 2 b d each tank is 20 m long 5 m wide and 3 m deep coated with epoxy resin to avoid the influence of possible concrete erosion on the tank hydrochemistry filled with 2 m dolomitic limestone rubble in the lower part and topped with 0 5 m soil tank lu1 was left with rubble only intended to simulate the scenario with no soil and plants on the land but only bare carbonate rocks rocky desertification tank lu2 simulates land with only bare soil and the carbonate rubble beneath it tank lu3 was planted with corn to simulate intensive cultivation with application of nitrogen fertilizers alfalfa and roxburgh rose were sown in the soils of tanks lu4 and lu5 to simulate grass and shrub land uses respectively a lateral drainage hole in each tank simulated a natural karst spring s1 s5 which fed an artificial pond p1 p5 that was 3 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep fig 2 d to simulate a lake or a reservoir equal amounts of locally dominant submerged plants including spirogyra hornwort and charophyta were transplanted into each spring fed pond in january 2014 each tank and its connected pond system fig 2 c d thus simulate a single land use catchment table 1 with precisely known identical dimensions and all share the same climatic and geological conditions chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 field monitoring of seasonal and diurnal hydrochemistry four sampling surveys 19 21 july and 24 26 october 2015 23 25 january and 26 28 april 2016 were conducted to examine seasonal and diurnal biological controls on each spring pond chemistry at the same times the hydrochemistry was monitored automatically during sunny weather with steady water flow conditions for 48 h to evaluate the diurnal variation of spring waters s1 s5 and pond waters p1 p5 the monitoring period in each season thus was two full diurnal cycles five manta multi parameter data logger 2 0 and five wtw technology multiline 350i were programmed to record at 15 min intervals for each spring vent and pond outlet respectively the measured parameters were water temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do the instruments were calibrated prior to deployment using ph 4 7 and 10 ec 1412 μs cm 1 and do 0 and 100 standards resolution of ph t do and ec were 0 01 0 01 c 0 01 mg l 1 and 0 01 μs cm 1 respectively 3 2 sampling and analysis of the hydrochemistry water samples from the springs and ponds were collected once every four hours during autumn and winter and every six hours during summer and spring major cation and anion samples were collected in 20 ml acid washed high density polyethylene bottles using 0 45 μm millipore filters the cation samples were acidified to ph 2 0 with concentrated nitric acid to prevent complexation and precipitation concentrations of k na ca2 and mg2 were determined with an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp oes and cl no3 and so4 2 with an ics 90 ion chromatograph resolving to 0 01 mg l 1 because of their instability hco3 concentrations were determined in situ by titration with an aquamerck alkalinity test kit with resolution of 0 05 mmol l 1 dissolved organic carbon doc samples were first filtered through 2 mm mesh sieves to remove large particles and aquatic plants debris and then through 0 2 μm whatman gf f filters into brown glass bottles the bottles were combusted at 450 c for three hours in a muffle furnace to eliminate any biological processes in the bottles we added 2 ml saturated hgcl2 solution after sampling then stored the same at 4 c and analyzed with an analytik jena n c multi3100 particulate organic carbon poc was captured on whatman filters dried at 65 c for 48 h and then fumed with concentrated hydrochloric acid in a sealed desiccator for 24 h to remove inorganic carbon after drying the samples were analyzed by vario max cn elementar with an analytical error 2 3 3 calculation of continuous diurnal hco3 concentration co2 partial pressure and dissolved co2 concentration ca2 and mg2 are the major cations while hco3 is the dominant anion in these waters and they dominate the electric conductivity ec in these aquatic systems consequently continuous concentrations of ca2 mg2 or hco3 can be estimated from the automatically recorded ec data liu et al 2007 chen et al 2017 based on the titrated hco3 and the ca2 and mg2 lab analyses the linear relationships between these ions and ec in the experiments were published by chen et al 2017 based on the automatic monitoring of diurnal physicochemical parameters by technology multiline 350i and major ion determinations by icp oes we employed the geochemical modelling program phreeqc3 parkhurst and appelo 1999 to calculate the diurnal pco2 in each spring pond system this revealed the diurnal pco2 changes caused by the c uptake by aquatic ecosystems and the co2 exchanges between air and pond water dissolved co2 aq values were calculated based on the dominant dic speciation shift in the inorganic carbon chemistry as a function of ph zeebe and wolf gladrow 2001 4 results 4 1 seasonal and diurnal variability in t ph and do of the springs and ponds all seasonal diurnal changes of t ph and do in the spring pond systems s ps 1 to s ps 5 are summarized in figs 3a e and tables 1 5 as supplementary data these trends show that all parameters in the ponds displayed remarkable but similar seasonal diurnal patterns in variation with t do and ph increasing during daytime and decreasing over the night p4 had lowest mean ph 7 90 9 60 and diurnal ph range among all ponds diurnal changes in do were more remarkable in october in p3 3 00 to 20 00 mg l and p4 2 30 to 14 00 mg l but less in january 9 10 to 15 30 mg l and 8 00 to 12 90 mg l for p3 and p4 respectively diurnal changes in the springs however were very small or even remained unchanged fig 3 daily variation 1 in most seasons 4 2 seasonal diurnal variabilities of hco3 co2 aq and no3 in the spring pond systems the hco3 and co2 aq concentrations of springs were relatively stable at the diurnal scale in all seasons fig 3 generally spring s4 had the highest hco3 and co2 aq concentrations 227 256 mg l and 5 5 12 4 mg l respectively followed by s5 164 241 mg l and 3 5 7 9 mg l respectively s3 140 240 mg l and 2 8 5 8 mg l respectively and s2 121 171 mg l and 1 1 2 7 mg l respectively the lowest values occurred in s1 116 159 mg l and 1 0 2 1 mg l respectively in contrast concentrations of hco3 and co2 aq in the ponds decreased during the daytime with lowest values occurring at 16 00 18 00 hrs and increased during the night with peaks occurring early in the morning 6 00 8 00 hrs they showed remarkable diurnal changes in all seasons except during the winter fig 3 diurnal changes in concentration of nitrate are also shown in fig 3 generally they are similar to the hco3 and co2 aq findings with nitrate in the ponds decreasing during the day and increasing over the night the largest amplitude in diurnal changes of no3 in all ponds occurred in the summer and october samplings and the lowest diurnal changes were in january higher no3 concentrations occurred in springs s3 1 74 35 86 mg l and s2 9 10 20 25 mg l and lower in s4 0 00 0 90 mg l and s5 0 00 0 56 mg l spring s1 showed irregular diurnal no3 changes and fluctuated over the seasons while s2 and s3 displayed descending no3 concentration with summer july autumn october winter january spring april demonstrating a marked annual trend there was a decline in no3 concentration from spring to the pond outlet in all cases 4 3 seasonal diurnal variabilities of toc in the spring pond systems as shown in figs 3 a e the diurnal variabilities of toc in each pond were similar increasing during daytime but decreasing during night time while there was little diurnal change for the springs in addition the toc concentrations in each pond were higher than their source spring and showed seasonal differences i e higher during spring and autumn but lower in winter s ps 4 had the highest toc concentration in both spring and pond 2 70 3 10 mg l and 5 60 8 30 mg l respectively fig 3 while the values in s ps 1 were the lowest 1 10 1 60 mg l and 1 90 2 90 mg l respectively the difference in toc between each spring and its pond was calculated to estimate the net total organic carbon production toc attributed to aquatic photosynthesis in each pond the net dic loss dic and no3 loss no3 in each spring pond were calculated to investigate their diurnal variations and relationship with toc as shown in fig 4 there were prominent diurnal changes of toc in autumn when there was greater biological activity in all pond systems than in winter generally toc reached peak values in late afternoon and decreased dramatically during the night time with lowest values occurring in the early morning fig 4 comparing the different land uses the highest toc occurred in s ps 4 simulated grassland in october and april with a mean value of 5 20 mg l and the lowest occurred in s ps 1 simulated bare rock in winter with a mean value of 0 89 mg l dic also exhibited strong diurnal cyclicity in october with the maximum values occurring around 18 00 hrs and minimum values in the early morning this cyclicity was present but much weaker in winter similarly no3 showed substantial diurnal changes like those of toc in the spring and autumn samplings but weaker patterns in winter especially in s ps 2 simulated bare soil fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal variations of dic pco2 and no3 concentrations in the springs seasonal root respiration and organic matter decomposition forced soil co2 variation thus controlling the carbonate weathering rate liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 the differences in dic as expressed by co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 from the springs can be attributed to the different land uses differing soil type and extent of vegetal cover in the tanks strong respiration and abundant organic matter decomposition in tank lu4 generated the greatest soil co2 leading to the highest dic concentrations in spring s4 fig 3 in contrast and as expected the bare rock rubble conditions in tank lu1 yielded the lowest dic concentrations because pco2 values were lowest there zeng et al 2017 the seasonal variations of dic and pco2 in s2 s5 were large due to the large differences in temperature soil moisture and solar irradiance levels between the growing and dormant periods like dic the no3 in s1 s3 also displayed seasonal variations during the study period higher in summer autumn and lower in winter spring fig 3 the seasonal difference in nitrate concentration between s1 and s2 was attributed chiefly to the atmospheric nitrogen deposition and biological n fixation in the soils respectively dinnes et al 2002 the latter controlled by temperature and macrobiotic activity the highest nitrate concentration 35 40 mg l in s3 in summer was due to the use of fertilizer added for corn production 5 2 metabolism controls on the diurnal variations of dic no3 do and net oc production in the pond ecosystems diurnal variations of dic no3 in aquatic ecosystems can be attributed chiefly to aquatic plant metabolism chen et al 2017 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 intense photosynthesis during the day was accompanied by increased do production in all ponds conversely respiration of the aquatic plants consumes the do with respiration dominating do variations at night chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 all of the ponds showed cyclic patterns of increase decrease in dic e g hco3 and co2 aq and do over the diurnal cycles except during winter when biotic activities were presumed at their lowest levels the pco2 variation tracked the dic variation also indicating the influence of metabolism the extremely low pco2 measured in late afternoon was consistent with the finding that assimilation of dic by phytoplankton can draw down pco2 to a very low level 0 1 μatm and the waters become highly undersaturated with respect to atmospheric co2 balmer et al 2011 at the night pco2 in the ponds increased and surpassed even the co2 levels in spring waters reinforcing the presumption of aquatic plant respiration dominating at night the no3 uptake rates in aquatic ecosystems have been demonstrated to show seasonal and diurnal variability globally simon et al 2005 mulholland et al 2006 as shown in figs 3a c diurnal cycles in nitrate concentration were found in each pond during the growing and dormant periods the lowest values of no3 occurred during the late afternoon and the highest during the early morning hours this trend is attributed chiefly to daily biological activities such as assimilation of no3 produced by autotrophic and heterotrophic processes mulholland et al 2006 heffernan and cohen 2010 rusjan and mikoš 2010 jiang et al 2013 which are highly dependent on water temperature or availability of light hessen et al 1997 a strong negative relationship between the concentrations of do and no3 were found in p1 p2 and p3 in all seasons except the winter fig 5 combining all of these results we conclude that no3 variations in the ponds were caused by uptake during plant photosynthesis which was followed by the dic changes shown above there were large differences in toc concentrations between the springs and their ponds fig 3 indicating substantial oc production by aquatic photosynthesis in the pond ecosystems the net oc production toc p s 0 between each spring and pond was matched by dic and no3 losses between them as shown in fig 3 as well as the negative relationship between no3 and do fig 5 both δno3 and δdic in s ps 1 to s ps 3 showed seasonal patterns and diurnal cycles that closely matched toc especially in the autumn growing season when aquatic photosynthesis was most active fig 4 fig 6 further shows the significant positive relationship between oc production and net no3 uptake in s ps 1 to s ps 3 5 3 carbon limitations on aquatic ecosystem primary production intense photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems can raise the ph by consuming dissolved co2 talling 1976 however ecosystem respiration will increase co2 concentrations at night as well decreasing the ph and potentially driving calcite dissolution which will increase dic concentration cicerone et al 1999 liu et al 2008 the dic in our ponds was actively assimilated by submerged plants during the day when temperature and solar irradiance levels increased the ph in the ponds showed substantial diurnal change with a range of 7 50 10 00 during the period of study as illustrated in fig 3 dic in this ph range was dominated by hco3 with extremely low amounts of co2 aq 10 fig 1 it is well known that co2 aq is the favored substrate for aquatic plant photosynthesis the elevated ph may reduce plant growth and photosynthesis by limiting co2 aq the effect known as carbon limitation chen et al 1994 riebesell et al 1993 van dam et al 2018 verspagen et al 2014 when co2 aq is low some algae can use hco3 as their carbon source for primary production price et al 2011 however other algae can use only dissolved co2 riebesell et al 1993 for photosynthesis because utilization of bicarbonate requires a specific bicarbonate uptake system tortell 2000 visser et al 2016 on the other hand as a fundamental nutrient for primary production nitrate is also related to the oc production in freshwater ecosystems the higher concentrations of no3 found in streams in agriculturally exploited catchments stimulates the no3 uptake by aquatic ecosystems mulholland et al 2006 and thus accumulation of oc in water heffernan and cohen 2010 and or sediments huang et al 2018 the production of organic matter is generally accompanied by prominent deviations of c n and p in the ratio 106 16 1 known as redfield ratio for the elemental stoichiometry of marine organic matter redfield et al 1963 compared to c n and p were for a long while regarded as the dominant limiting nutrients for aquatic ecosystems and eutrophication howarth and marino 2016 schindler et al 2016 however several studies have shown that elevated co2 uptake can increase the carbon nutrient stoichiometry of phytoplankton riebesell et al 2007 verschoor et al 2013 verspagen et al 2014 the rising co2 levels can increase phytoplankton c n stoichiometry the effect being more prominent at low than at high nutrient load furthermore even under severe nutrient limited conditions primary producers still have the capacity for photosynthesis when sufficient light and dic are available verschoor et al 2013 our results show that in s ps 1 to s ps 3 where dic concentrations are s3 s2 s1 the c n ratios i e the slopes in fig 6 increased with dic i e higher dic input resulted in higher values in c n stoichiometry the no3 and po4 3 in s ps 4 and s ps 5 were extremely low chen et al 2017 and the supply of dic in these waters exceeded no3 and po4 3 possibly by several orders of magnitude however the toc in s ps 4 and s ps 5 were even higher than those in the s ps 1 2 3 systems which had greater no3 supply therefore the carbon limitation may indicate that the photoautotrophs dominated by charophyta and spirogyra in karst surface aquatic ecosystems cannot use the total dic for photosynthesis but only the dissolved co2 which comprises 1 of total dic at ph 8 characteristic of karst surface aquatic ecosystems the dic input gradient caused by the different land uses in our experiments indicated that greater dic input alleviated the c limitation by supplying more co2 for aquatic plant photosynthesis in the waters in fig 7 we plot the relationship between toc and dic a s ps 1 to s ps 5 or no3 b s ps 1 to s ps 3 inputs in october january and april to detect different impacts of c and n input on net oc production dic inputs show a more significant positive relationship with the net oc production than do no3 inputs therefore it is suggested that in karst terrains surface waters with high ph values carbon or dic input may become the dominant factor that limits aquatic primary production 5 4 implication for eutrophication control and carbon sink projection experiencing land use and climate changes the above finding that carbon can limit aquatic primary production may have two implications one for control of eutrophication rates and the other for carbon sink rates where there is land use and or climate change 1 implications for eutrophication control whole lake experiments by schindler and others since 1971 have shown conclusively that phosphorus is the major cause of eutrophication in many freshwater lakes schindler et al 2008 2016 however contrary to this phosphorus p only paradigm control of nitrogen n input is widely adopted to alleviate eutrophication in new zealand abell et al 2010 and many other countries seitzinger et al 2006 jarvie et al 2018 a review of published results of nutrient enrichment experiments in lakes showed that n more frequently limited lake productivity than p abell et al 2010 indicating the complexity in eutrophication controls in fact about 20 years ago hein 1997 found that photosynthesis by phytoplankton in lakes with low to intermediate dic concentrations was seriously restricted when co2 concentrations declined in particular photosynthesis was limited by low co2 concentrations during phytoplankton blooms in hardwater alkaline lakes our results here further confirm this therefore eutrophication control in freshwater lakes may be limited not only by p and n but also by c 2 implication for carbon sink projection with land use and global climate change terrestrial and aquatic primary production are closely related to the local land use activity a growing number of studies have found that rising atmospheric co2 levels and increasing agricultural land use can enhance the carbonate weathering rates leading to increasing input of dic to surface water systems andrews and schlesinger 2001 macpherson et al 2008 raymond et al 2008 combined with our findings on carbon limitation it is projected that the elevation of dic concentrations will enhance primary production in surface water ecosystems and thus increase the oc production implying that there will be an increase in the net carbon sink under land use and global climate changes showing long term implications of this process biological carbon pumping in affecting the water chemistry eutrophication and other issues in karst terrains 6 conclusions in this study we documented seasonal and diurnal variations in dic no3 toc and related hydrochemical parameters ph and do in model spring pond ecosystems with different land use activities at the shawan karst test site sw china it was found that diurnal changes in dic no3 and toc concentrations in the ponds were determined by aquatic ecosystem metabolism the bare rock lu1 and bare soil lu2 experiments produced very low dic and no3 additions to their downstream spring pond ecosystems s ps 1 and s ps 2 resulting in lower oc production in the latter the cropland lu1 yielded higher dic and no3 to its pond p3 due to growth of the corn and use of fertilizer which enhanced the oc production in the pond ecosystem highest productivity and best vegetation cover in the grassland lu4 and

6469,human activities have altered terrestrial carbon c and nitrogen n dynamics via changes to land cover and use such as deforestation agriculture application of fertilizers etc and have influenced the patterns of organic c input and eutrophication in downstream freshwater ecosystems biogeochemical cycling of c and n and the related organic carbon oc production may display correlated diurnal and seasonal variations due to photosynthesis and respiration in these ecosystems whose underlying mechanisms still need to be resolved in this study we document the diurnal and seasonal variations measured in dic dissolved inorganic carbon no3 toc total organic carbon and other related hydrochemical parameters ph and do dissolved oxygen in five artificial spring pond ecosystems with differing land uses in tanks draining into springs and corresponding ponds constructed at the shawan karst test site sw china it was found that diurnal changes in dic no3 and toc in all ponds were dominated by aquatic ecosystem metabolism i e photosynthesis and respiration as evidenced by the pertinent variations in do and ph daily dic and no3 uptake and oc production were higher in october growing period and lower in january dormant period indicating seasonal differences in assimilation that were determined by both changes in weather temperature and light and nutrient inputs under conditions of bare rock or bare soil there was very low dic and no3 additions to the spring pond ecosystems resulting in lower oc productivity in the ponds cropped land yielded higher dic and no3 to the pond due to growth of corn and use of fertilizers that enhanced oc production highest productivity and densest vegetation cover on tanks with grassland or shrubs with higher n retention in soils resulted in higher dic but limited no3 addition to the ecosystems downstream the highest dic concentration in the grassland resulted in maximum oc production in the pond these results indicate that oc production in the ponds with elevated ph was limited by dic fertilization in general the supply of dic is not considered to limit aquatic primary productivity because its concentration exceeds that of other plant macronutrients such as no3 and po4 3 by two or three orders of magnitude therefore the carbon limitation detected here may indicate that photoautotrophs in karst dominated aquatic terrains dominated by charophyta and spirogyra cannot use the total dic for photosynthesis but only the dissolved co2 which comprises 1 of total dic at ph 8 2 that is characteristic in these environments this may have implications for control of eutrophication in such alkaline aquatic ecosystems i e rates of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems may be regulated not only by n and or p but also by c it is also projected that there will be an increase in oc sequestration with the current land use and global climate change driven increases in dic due to carbon limitation of aquatic primary production

al 2015 liu et al 2018 yang et al 2015 the higher dissolved organic carbon dic half of which from soil atmosphere from carbonate weathering can fuel the growth of aquatic plants and thus enhance the uptake of atmospheric carbon liu et al 2018 contemporary human activities such as agricultural land use and land cover changes lucc have resulted in increased carbon and nitrogen discharge from soils into aquatic ecosystems and thus significantly increased the dic and nitrate concentrations in surface and groundwater systems mulholland 2008 raymond et al 2008 taylor and townsend 2010 zeng et al 2017 for a long period co2 increase has been thought to have only minor influence on primary productivity in freshwater ecosystems because of the common assumption that co2 concentrations in freshwater are high enough for phytoplankton growth visser et al 2016 however the actual concentration of dissolved co2 is quite low and co2 uptake by flourishing submerged aquatic plants can turn the water from supersaturated to highly undersaturated to atmospheric co2 balmer et al 2011 phytoplankton photosynthesis draws down the concentration of dissolved co2 leading to the water becoming co2 undersaturated increasing the ph and changing principal molecular hosts of dissolved inorganic carbon dic talling 1976 verschoor et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 a high ph environment helps shift the inorganic carbon dominated by co2 aq towards a bicarbonate and or carbonate ion dominated system schulte et al 2011 this severely reduces the concentration of dissolved co2 aq in water which is only 1 of dic at ph 8 2 riebesell et al 1993 co2 aq is the favored substrate for aquatic plant photosynthesis therefore elevated ph may be associated with accessible carbon limitation for phytoplankton production van dam et al 2018 verspagen et al 2014 to relieve this limitation some phytoplankton have developed an ability to use bicarbonate and carbonate by co2 concentrating mechanisms ccms allowing them to access additional inorganic carbon pools when co2 aq becomes depleted from increase in ph mangan et al 2016 morales williams et al 2017 price et al 2008 price 2011 van dam et al 2018 on the other hand as a fundamental nutrient n availability may also constrain the algal growth carbon uptake and primary production of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 n alteration caused by different land use activities can impact the nutrient uptake rate and n dynamics hall et al 2009 causing eutrophication problems in aquatic ecosystems abell et al 2010 conley et al 2009 howarth and marino 2006 jarvie et al 2018 the cycling of c and n in freshwater has been shown to be closely related with coupled control of organic carbon oc concentrations through aquatic biological processes of assimilation or denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 gruber and galloway 2008 taylor and townsend 2010 trimmer et al 2012 further a growing body of evidence has shown that c n and oc production in freshwater ecosystems display similar patterns of change that are most likely due to aquatic ecosystem metabolism clarke et al 2002 harrison et al 2005 heffernan and cohen 2010 jiang et al 2013 parker et al 2007 parker et al 2010 poulson and sullivan 2010 spencer et al 2007 nutrient load such as n input has long been thought to be the most significant limiting factor for organic matter production in aquatic ecosystems compared to the effect of c which seems to have less influence hecky and kilham 1988 visser et al 2016 however laboratory experiments and models have demonstrated that rising co2 concentrations may result in phytoplankton blooms in both marine chen and durbin 1994 riebesell et al 1993 and freshwater ecosystems hein and sand jensen 1997 verschoor et al 2013 verspagen et al 2014 young and gobler 2017 by reducing the c limitations on primary production moreover in freshwater ecosystems elevated co2 uptake can increase the carbon nutrient stoichiometry in aquatic biomass verspagen et al 2014 in addition primary producers still have the ability to photosynthesize when sufficient light and dic are available even under severe nutrient limited conditions verschoor et al 2013 it is generally difficult to distinguish and estimate the impacts of specific land use activities on c and n inputs and their subsequent effects on aquatic c and n cycles in natural conditions where different land uses persist within a given catchment studies in single use catchments can clearly help us to determine the c and n dynamics and their relationships with aquatic primary production this is best accomplished under experimental control of land use types therefore we have investigated the spring fed pond ecosystems derived from five different experimental land uses at the shawan karst test site sw china measuring the range of dic and no3 concentrations by each individual spring to its hydrologically connected artificial pond chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 the different types of land use in the experiment bare rock bare soil cropland grassland and shrubland displayed large dic and no3 gradients and the different nutrient input scenarios helped us to determine the role of c vs n limitation in aquatic ecosystem photosynthesis and its potential influence on eutrophication control and carbon cycling in karst surface waters with high ph and dic though the biological carbon pump effect has been found to be related to the dic fertilization by previous authors chen et al 2017 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the underlying mechanisms still need to be resolved especially the roles of principal molecular hosts of dic which may have implications in controlling eutrophication and the carbon cycle in such aquatic ecosystems 2 site description our test site is located in the puding comprehensive karst research and experimental station puding county guizhou province southwest china fig 2 a the site has a humid sub tropical monsoon climate with annual mean air temperature of 15 1 c mean annual precipitation is 1315 mm 80 of which falls in the wet season from may to october in january 2014 five concrete tanks lu1 lu5 were built at the experimental station each of them simulating a single land use catchment as shown in fig 2 b d each tank is 20 m long 5 m wide and 3 m deep coated with epoxy resin to avoid the influence of possible concrete erosion on the tank hydrochemistry filled with 2 m dolomitic limestone rubble in the lower part and topped with 0 5 m soil tank lu1 was left with rubble only intended to simulate the scenario with no soil and plants on the land but only bare carbonate rocks rocky desertification tank lu2 simulates land with only bare soil and the carbonate rubble beneath it tank lu3 was planted with corn to simulate intensive cultivation with application of nitrogen fertilizers alfalfa and roxburgh rose were sown in the soils of tanks lu4 and lu5 to simulate grass and shrub land uses respectively a lateral drainage hole in each tank simulated a natural karst spring s1 s5 which fed an artificial pond p1 p5 that was 3 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 5 m deep fig 2 d to simulate a lake or a reservoir equal amounts of locally dominant submerged plants including spirogyra hornwort and charophyta were transplanted into each spring fed pond in january 2014 each tank and its connected pond system fig 2 c d thus simulate a single land use catchment table 1 with precisely known identical dimensions and all share the same climatic and geological conditions chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 field monitoring of seasonal and diurnal hydrochemistry four sampling surveys 19 21 july and 24 26 october 2015 23 25 january and 26 28 april 2016 were conducted to examine seasonal and diurnal biological controls on each spring pond chemistry at the same times the hydrochemistry was monitored automatically during sunny weather with steady water flow conditions for 48 h to evaluate the diurnal variation of spring waters s1 s5 and pond waters p1 p5 the monitoring period in each season thus was two full diurnal cycles five manta multi parameter data logger 2 0 and five wtw technology multiline 350i were programmed to record at 15 min intervals for each spring vent and pond outlet respectively the measured parameters were water temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec 25 c and dissolved oxygen do the instruments were calibrated prior to deployment using ph 4 7 and 10 ec 1412 μs cm 1 and do 0 and 100 standards resolution of ph t do and ec were 0 01 0 01 c 0 01 mg l 1 and 0 01 μs cm 1 respectively 3 2 sampling and analysis of the hydrochemistry water samples from the springs and ponds were collected once every four hours during autumn and winter and every six hours during summer and spring major cation and anion samples were collected in 20 ml acid washed high density polyethylene bottles using 0 45 μm millipore filters the cation samples were acidified to ph 2 0 with concentrated nitric acid to prevent complexation and precipitation concentrations of k na ca2 and mg2 were determined with an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp oes and cl no3 and so4 2 with an ics 90 ion chromatograph resolving to 0 01 mg l 1 because of their instability hco3 concentrations were determined in situ by titration with an aquamerck alkalinity test kit with resolution of 0 05 mmol l 1 dissolved organic carbon doc samples were first filtered through 2 mm mesh sieves to remove large particles and aquatic plants debris and then through 0 2 μm whatman gf f filters into brown glass bottles the bottles were combusted at 450 c for three hours in a muffle furnace to eliminate any biological processes in the bottles we added 2 ml saturated hgcl2 solution after sampling then stored the same at 4 c and analyzed with an analytik jena n c multi3100 particulate organic carbon poc was captured on whatman filters dried at 65 c for 48 h and then fumed with concentrated hydrochloric acid in a sealed desiccator for 24 h to remove inorganic carbon after drying the samples were analyzed by vario max cn elementar with an analytical error 2 3 3 calculation of continuous diurnal hco3 concentration co2 partial pressure and dissolved co2 concentration ca2 and mg2 are the major cations while hco3 is the dominant anion in these waters and they dominate the electric conductivity ec in these aquatic systems consequently continuous concentrations of ca2 mg2 or hco3 can be estimated from the automatically recorded ec data liu et al 2007 chen et al 2017 based on the titrated hco3 and the ca2 and mg2 lab analyses the linear relationships between these ions and ec in the experiments were published by chen et al 2017 based on the automatic monitoring of diurnal physicochemical parameters by technology multiline 350i and major ion determinations by icp oes we employed the geochemical modelling program phreeqc3 parkhurst and appelo 1999 to calculate the diurnal pco2 in each spring pond system this revealed the diurnal pco2 changes caused by the c uptake by aquatic ecosystems and the co2 exchanges between air and pond water dissolved co2 aq values were calculated based on the dominant dic speciation shift in the inorganic carbon chemistry as a function of ph zeebe and wolf gladrow 2001 4 results 4 1 seasonal and diurnal variability in t ph and do of the springs and ponds all seasonal diurnal changes of t ph and do in the spring pond systems s ps 1 to s ps 5 are summarized in figs 3a e and tables 1 5 as supplementary data these trends show that all parameters in the ponds displayed remarkable but similar seasonal diurnal patterns in variation with t do and ph increasing during daytime and decreasing over the night p4 had lowest mean ph 7 90 9 60 and diurnal ph range among all ponds diurnal changes in do were more remarkable in october in p3 3 00 to 20 00 mg l and p4 2 30 to 14 00 mg l but less in january 9 10 to 15 30 mg l and 8 00 to 12 90 mg l for p3 and p4 respectively diurnal changes in the springs however were very small or even remained unchanged fig 3 daily variation 1 in most seasons 4 2 seasonal diurnal variabilities of hco3 co2 aq and no3 in the spring pond systems the hco3 and co2 aq concentrations of springs were relatively stable at the diurnal scale in all seasons fig 3 generally spring s4 had the highest hco3 and co2 aq concentrations 227 256 mg l and 5 5 12 4 mg l respectively followed by s5 164 241 mg l and 3 5 7 9 mg l respectively s3 140 240 mg l and 2 8 5 8 mg l respectively and s2 121 171 mg l and 1 1 2 7 mg l respectively the lowest values occurred in s1 116 159 mg l and 1 0 2 1 mg l respectively in contrast concentrations of hco3 and co2 aq in the ponds decreased during the daytime with lowest values occurring at 16 00 18 00 hrs and increased during the night with peaks occurring early in the morning 6 00 8 00 hrs they showed remarkable diurnal changes in all seasons except during the winter fig 3 diurnal changes in concentration of nitrate are also shown in fig 3 generally they are similar to the hco3 and co2 aq findings with nitrate in the ponds decreasing during the day and increasing over the night the largest amplitude in diurnal changes of no3 in all ponds occurred in the summer and october samplings and the lowest diurnal changes were in january higher no3 concentrations occurred in springs s3 1 74 35 86 mg l and s2 9 10 20 25 mg l and lower in s4 0 00 0 90 mg l and s5 0 00 0 56 mg l spring s1 showed irregular diurnal no3 changes and fluctuated over the seasons while s2 and s3 displayed descending no3 concentration with summer july autumn october winter january spring april demonstrating a marked annual trend there was a decline in no3 concentration from spring to the pond outlet in all cases 4 3 seasonal diurnal variabilities of toc in the spring pond systems as shown in figs 3 a e the diurnal variabilities of toc in each pond were similar increasing during daytime but decreasing during night time while there was little diurnal change for the springs in addition the toc concentrations in each pond were higher than their source spring and showed seasonal differences i e higher during spring and autumn but lower in winter s ps 4 had the highest toc concentration in both spring and pond 2 70 3 10 mg l and 5 60 8 30 mg l respectively fig 3 while the values in s ps 1 were the lowest 1 10 1 60 mg l and 1 90 2 90 mg l respectively the difference in toc between each spring and its pond was calculated to estimate the net total organic carbon production toc attributed to aquatic photosynthesis in each pond the net dic loss dic and no3 loss no3 in each spring pond were calculated to investigate their diurnal variations and relationship with toc as shown in fig 4 there were prominent diurnal changes of toc in autumn when there was greater biological activity in all pond systems than in winter generally toc reached peak values in late afternoon and decreased dramatically during the night time with lowest values occurring in the early morning fig 4 comparing the different land uses the highest toc occurred in s ps 4 simulated grassland in october and april with a mean value of 5 20 mg l and the lowest occurred in s ps 1 simulated bare rock in winter with a mean value of 0 89 mg l dic also exhibited strong diurnal cyclicity in october with the maximum values occurring around 18 00 hrs and minimum values in the early morning this cyclicity was present but much weaker in winter similarly no3 showed substantial diurnal changes like those of toc in the spring and autumn samplings but weaker patterns in winter especially in s ps 2 simulated bare soil fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal variations of dic pco2 and no3 concentrations in the springs seasonal root respiration and organic matter decomposition forced soil co2 variation thus controlling the carbonate weathering rate liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 the differences in dic as expressed by co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 from the springs can be attributed to the different land uses differing soil type and extent of vegetal cover in the tanks strong respiration and abundant organic matter decomposition in tank lu4 generated the greatest soil co2 leading to the highest dic concentrations in spring s4 fig 3 in contrast and as expected the bare rock rubble conditions in tank lu1 yielded the lowest dic concentrations because pco2 values were lowest there zeng et al 2017 the seasonal variations of dic and pco2 in s2 s5 were large due to the large differences in temperature soil moisture and solar irradiance levels between the growing and dormant periods like dic the no3 in s1 s3 also displayed seasonal variations during the study period higher in summer autumn and lower in winter spring fig 3 the seasonal difference in nitrate concentration between s1 and s2 was attributed chiefly to the atmospheric nitrogen deposition and biological n fixation in the soils respectively dinnes et al 2002 the latter controlled by temperature and macrobiotic activity the highest nitrate concentration 35 40 mg l in s3 in summer was due to the use of fertilizer added for corn production 5 2 metabolism controls on the diurnal variations of dic no3 do and net oc production in the pond ecosystems diurnal variations of dic no3 in aquatic ecosystems can be attributed chiefly to aquatic plant metabolism chen et al 2017 liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 intense photosynthesis during the day was accompanied by increased do production in all ponds conversely respiration of the aquatic plants consumes the do with respiration dominating do variations at night chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 all of the ponds showed cyclic patterns of increase decrease in dic e g hco3 and co2 aq and do over the diurnal cycles except during winter when biotic activities were presumed at their lowest levels the pco2 variation tracked the dic variation also indicating the influence of metabolism the extremely low pco2 measured in late afternoon was consistent with the finding that assimilation of dic by phytoplankton can draw down pco2 to a very low level 0 1 μatm and the waters become highly undersaturated with respect to atmospheric co2 balmer et al 2011 at the night pco2 in the ponds increased and surpassed even the co2 levels in spring waters reinforcing the presumption of aquatic plant respiration dominating at night the no3 uptake rates in aquatic ecosystems have been demonstrated to show seasonal and diurnal variability globally simon et al 2005 mulholland et al 2006 as shown in figs 3a c diurnal cycles in nitrate concentration were found in each pond during the growing and dormant periods the lowest values of no3 occurred during the late afternoon and the highest during the early morning hours this trend is attributed chiefly to daily biological activities such as assimilation of no3 produced by autotrophic and heterotrophic processes mulholland et al 2006 heffernan and cohen 2010 rusjan and mikoš 2010 jiang et al 2013 which are highly dependent on water temperature or availability of light hessen et al 1997 a strong negative relationship between the concentrations of do and no3 were found in p1 p2 and p3 in all seasons except the winter fig 5 combining all of these results we conclude that no3 variations in the ponds were caused by uptake during plant photosynthesis which was followed by the dic changes shown above there were large differences in toc concentrations between the springs and their ponds fig 3 indicating substantial oc production by aquatic photosynthesis in the pond ecosystems the net oc production toc p s 0 between each spring and pond was matched by dic and no3 losses between them as shown in fig 3 as well as the negative relationship between no3 and do fig 5 both δno3 and δdic in s ps 1 to s ps 3 showed seasonal patterns and diurnal cycles that closely matched toc especially in the autumn growing season when aquatic photosynthesis was most active fig 4 fig 6 further shows the significant positive relationship between oc production and net no3 uptake in s ps 1 to s ps 3 5 3 carbon limitations on aquatic ecosystem primary production intense photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems can raise the ph by consuming dissolved co2 talling 1976 however ecosystem respiration will increase co2 concentrations at night as well decreasing the ph and potentially driving calcite dissolution which will increase dic concentration cicerone et al 1999 liu et al 2008 the dic in our ponds was actively assimilated by submerged plants during the day when temperature and solar irradiance levels increased the ph in the ponds showed substantial diurnal change with a range of 7 50 10 00 during the period of study as illustrated in fig 3 dic in this ph range was dominated by hco3 with extremely low amounts of co2 aq 10 fig 1 it is well known that co2 aq is the favored substrate for aquatic plant photosynthesis the elevated ph may reduce plant growth and photosynthesis by limiting co2 aq the effect known as carbon limitation chen et al 1994 riebesell et al 1993 van dam et al 2018 verspagen et al 2014 when co2 aq is low some algae can use hco3 as their carbon source for primary production price et al 2011 however other algae can use only dissolved co2 riebesell et al 1993 for photosynthesis because utilization of bicarbonate requires a specific bicarbonate uptake system tortell 2000 visser et al 2016 on the other hand as a fundamental nutrient for primary production nitrate is also related to the oc production in freshwater ecosystems the higher concentrations of no3 found in streams in agriculturally exploited catchments stimulates the no3 uptake by aquatic ecosystems mulholland et al 2006 and thus accumulation of oc in water heffernan and cohen 2010 and or sediments huang et al 2018 the production of organic matter is generally accompanied by prominent deviations of c n and p in the ratio 106 16 1 known as redfield ratio for the elemental stoichiometry of marine organic matter redfield et al 1963 compared to c n and p were for a long while regarded as the dominant limiting nutrients for aquatic ecosystems and eutrophication howarth and marino 2016 schindler et al 2016 however several studies have shown that elevated co2 uptake can increase the carbon nutrient stoichiometry of phytoplankton riebesell et al 2007 verschoor et al 2013 verspagen et al 2014 the rising co2 levels can increase phytoplankton c n stoichiometry the effect being more prominent at low than at high nutrient load furthermore even under severe nutrient limited conditions primary producers still have the capacity for photosynthesis when sufficient light and dic are available verschoor et al 2013 our results show that in s ps 1 to s ps 3 where dic concentrations are s3 s2 s1 the c n ratios i e the slopes in fig 6 increased with dic i e higher dic input resulted in higher values in c n stoichiometry the no3 and po4 3 in s ps 4 and s ps 5 were extremely low chen et al 2017 and the supply of dic in these waters exceeded no3 and po4 3 possibly by several orders of magnitude however the toc in s ps 4 and s ps 5 were even higher than those in the s ps 1 2 3 systems which had greater no3 supply therefore the carbon limitation may indicate that the photoautotrophs dominated by charophyta and spirogyra in karst surface aquatic ecosystems cannot use the total dic for photosynthesis but only the dissolved co2 which comprises 1 of total dic at ph 8 characteristic of karst surface aquatic ecosystems the dic input gradient caused by the different land uses in our experiments indicated that greater dic input alleviated the c limitation by supplying more co2 for aquatic plant photosynthesis in the waters in fig 7 we plot the relationship between toc and dic a s ps 1 to s ps 5 or no3 b s ps 1 to s ps 3 inputs in october january and april to detect different impacts of c and n input on net oc production dic inputs show a more significant positive relationship with the net oc production than do no3 inputs therefore it is suggested that in karst terrains surface waters with high ph values carbon or dic input may become the dominant factor that limits aquatic primary production 5 4 implication for eutrophication control and carbon sink projection experiencing land use and climate changes the above finding that carbon can limit aquatic primary production may have two implications one for control of eutrophication rates and the other for carbon sink rates where there is land use and or climate change 1 implications for eutrophication control whole lake experiments by schindler and others since 1971 have shown conclusively that phosphorus is the major cause of eutrophication in many freshwater lakes schindler et al 2008 2016 however contrary to this phosphorus p only paradigm control of nitrogen n input is widely adopted to alleviate eutrophication in new zealand abell et al 2010 and many other countries seitzinger et al 2006 jarvie et al 2018 a review of published results of nutrient enrichment experiments in lakes showed that n more frequently limited lake productivity than p abell et al 2010 indicating the complexity in eutrophication controls in fact about 20 years ago hein 1997 found that photosynthesis by phytoplankton in lakes with low to intermediate dic concentrations was seriously restricted when co2 concentrations declined in particular photosynthesis was limited by low co2 concentrations during phytoplankton blooms in hardwater alkaline lakes our results here further confirm this therefore eutrophication control in freshwater lakes may be limited not only by p and n but also by c 2 implication for carbon sink projection with land use and global climate change terrestrial and aquatic primary production are closely related to the local land use activity a growing number of studies have found that rising atmospheric co2 levels and increasing agricultural land use can enhance the carbonate weathering rates leading to increasing input of dic to surface water systems andrews and schlesinger 2001 macpherson et al 2008 raymond et al 2008 combined with our findings on carbon limitation it is projected that the elevation of dic concentrations will enhance primary production in surface water ecosystems and thus increase the oc production implying that there will be an increase in the net carbon sink under land use and global climate changes showing long term implications of this process biological carbon pumping in affecting the water chemistry eutrophication and other issues in karst terrains 6 conclusions in this study we documented seasonal and diurnal variations in dic no3 toc and related hydrochemical parameters ph and do in model spring pond ecosystems with different land use activities at the shawan karst test site sw china it was found that diurnal changes in dic no3 and toc concentrations in the ponds were determined by aquatic ecosystem metabolism the bare rock lu1 and bare soil lu2 experiments produced very low dic and no3 additions to their downstream spring pond ecosystems s ps 1 and s ps 2 resulting in lower oc production in the latter the cropland lu1 yielded higher dic and no3 to its pond p3 due to growth of the corn and use of fertilizer which enhanced the oc production in the pond ecosystem highest productivity and best vegetation cover in the grassland lu4 and shrubland lu5 experiments with higher n retention in soils resulted in highest dic but only limited no3 addition to the aquatic ecosystems p4 and p5 the highest dic concentration in the grassland resulted in the largest oc production among the ponds even though the no3 addition was smaller there these results indicate that oc production in the ponds with elevated ph was limited by dic fertilization i e rising dic supply counters the carbon limitation indicating that the photoautotrophs dominated by charophyta and spirogyra in karst ecosystems cannot use the total dic but only the dissolved co2 component 1 of total dic where ph 8 2 this may have implications for control of eutrophication in karst aquatic ecosystems i e rates of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems rivers lakes and reservoirs may be regulated not only by n and or p but also by c it is also projected that there will be an increase in oc sequestration with the current land use and global climate change
